            "article_content": "Art Pope said he'd been meeting with many Republican candidates and made up his mind this week He said Rubio's experience as speaker of the Florida House especially appealed to him Florida Sen. Marco Rubio picked up another big-name donor in the presidential race on Thursday, this time one from North Carolina. Art Pope, a philanthropist and CEO of Variety Wholesalers, said he would support Rubio\u2019s campaign in the GOP primary and in the general election. Pope said he\u2019d been meeting with many of the Republican candidates and made up his mind this week. \u201cI think Sen. Marco Rubio is both the most qualified, has the best all-around experience, and I agree with him more so on the issues than all the other candidates,\u201d Pope told CNN. RELATED: Rubio lands Ken Griffin The businessman and former politician has invested millions in North Carolina politics and is an ally of the Koch Brothers\u2019 network of advocacy groups and foundations. He wouldn\u2019t discuss any dollar amounts behind his planned support of Rubio, but pledged to \u201cdo whatever I can\u201d to get Rubio elected, including through his contributions, advocacy for Rubio and frequent role as a national Republican Party convention delegate. Pope said Rubio\u2019s experience as speaker of the Florida House especially appealed to him. \u201cTo be elected by your peers, your colleagues, is a good indication of your leadership,\u201d Pope said, adding state speakers have a heavy set of policy responsibilities. \u201cThat is more experience than President (Barack) Obama had when he was a member of the Legislature in Illinois.\u201d He also cited the senator\u2019s positions on national security, taxes, immigration and spending as being appealing. North Carolina\u2019s primary is in mid-March, making it a more important prize this election cycle than previous ones, where it voted later in the year. That was part of Pope\u2019s reasoning for getting behind Rubio in the primary, which he sat out last election cycle. It\u2019s the latest victory for Rubio in the GOP donor race, where he\u2019s competing against other big fundraisers, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has been sinking in the polls. Rubio has been endorsed by other mega-donors including Ken Griffin, Paul Singer and Frank VanderSloot.",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush spoke Monday from the Forum Club at an event held in West Palm Beach, Florida The former Florida governor said of selfies, \"It is a requirement that you take one, and I do it with great joy in my heart\" Jeb Bush, one of many presidential candidates who embraces the selfie (and the free social media advertising that comes with it), described the trend as a new fact of life, saying it\u2019s now \u201cthe 11th amendment of the Bill of Rights.\u201d Asked about the effect of selfies on the campaign trail, Bush said Monday it\u2019s become a regular part of retail politicking and offered up some tips in a freewheeling answer about the photo-taking custom. \u201cIt is a requirement that you take one, and I do it with great joy in my heart,\u201d he said to applause at the Forum Club, an event held in West Palm Beach, Florida. Feeling comfortable in his home state, Bush grew a little more candid. \u201cI don\u2019t know, look, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that people wanted signatures on things, and now, forget that. \u2018I want my damn Selfie. I\u2019m not leaving until I get it.\u2019 So we spend a lot of quality time doing that,\u201d he quipped with his signature sarcasm. RELATED: Jeb Bush: Donald Trump gets foreign policy advice \u2018in his pajamas\u2019 The former Florida governor said a long arm is helpful, but if not, \u201cI will take over.\u201d To the amusement of his audience, a largely older crowd, he added some other observations about the selfie culture. \u201cJust for the record, young people do it better than older people. It\u2019s cooler to do it diagonally rather than straight up, remember that. And it\u2019s better to do it higher than lower, because you look skinnier. Am I right?\u201d he said, as the audience cheered in agreement. Bush was also asked to name his funniest fellow candidate. \u201cLike funny in a good way?\u201d he said to laughs. \u201cI\u2019d say the guy with the quickest wit is, uh, (former Arkansas Gov. Mike) Huckabee. He\u2019s actually hilarious. Chris Christie is pretty funny as well \u2013 in a different kind of style. You can imagine a governor from Arkansas is slightly different than the current governor of New Jersey, but they\u2019re both\u2026pretty funny,\u201d he told the host, who was asking the questions. \u201cYou thought I was going to say somebody else.\u201d The answer came at the light-hearted end of an event where Bush made his presidential pitch before taking questions from the audience. Bush spoke on array of topics including the South China Sea, Cuba, immigration and gun violence. Asked whether he felt the GOP was making progress in appealing to women and minorities as it sought to do after the 2012 election loss, Bush made a not-so-veiled swipe at Donald Trump. \u201cSome of us are,\u201d he said, before attacking rivals who are \u201cdisparaging people\u201d and \u201cinsulting (their) way to the presidency.\u201d \u201cOne particular candidate comes to mind,\u201d he said, drawing some laughs from the crowd. For the last question, the host brought the Bush-Trump rivalry to the surface and asked Bush what he would say to the real estate titan \u2013 who stayed not far from West Palm Beach at his Mar-a-Lago club during Christmas and whose \u201cTrump Plaza\u201d is within eyesight of the convention center where Bush was speaking \u2014 if he were to walk in. \u201cDonald, I\u2019ll take you on one-on-one in the debate,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAny time, any place. You name it, I\u2019ll do it. With that, Bush stepped off the stage to greet members of the crowd \u2013 as well as take some selfies. RELATED: Meet the \u2018presidential selfie\u2019 girls",

            "article_content": "'Twas the week before Christmas, and all on the trail, presidential candidates were fighting one another tooth and nail Jeb Bush to Trump: \"For crying out loud, we're two days before Christmas. Lighten up man\" As Donald Trump stepped off a stage in Michigan Monday night, the speakers blared the holiday season classic song: \u201cIt\u2019s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year.\u201d Moments earlier, he said Hillary Clinton \u201cgot schlonged\u201d by Barack Obama in the 2008 election. Christmastime on the campaign trail is anything but merry and bright. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are brawling with each other over immigration. Clinton and Bernie Sanders are pointing fingers over voter data thefts. And Jeb Bush is going after Trump with a vengeance. \u201cI gotta get this off my chest \u2013 Donald Trump is a jerk,\u201d Bush said during a Saturday morning town hall in New Hampshire. He added: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much intellectual curiosity.\u201d Read: Christie explains \u2018shady\u2019 query, but won\u2019t discuss \u2018schlonged\u2019 Trump\u2019s retort Monday invoked Bush\u2019s family when mocking Jeb\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad. His family\u2019s so ashamed,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s insults have been a constant in the 2016 campaign. But the rest of the field seems to be joining as the season of peace on earth and goodwill towards men rolls around. Many candidates have started throwing their nastiest stuff yet in ways that would make Ebenezer Scrooge blush. Timing plays a big role. The campaign is set to enter a lull between Christmas and New Year\u2019s when voters have visions of sugarplums, not bitter politics, in their heads. The candidates are running out of time to change their momentum before the first votes are cast at Iowa\u2019s caucuses on February 1 From there, it\u2019s on to the New Hampshire primary on February 9, where many Republicans are expecting a wide set of establishment-type figures \u2013 Bush, Rubio, Chris Christie, John Kasich and others \u2013 to be trimmed down. So you see quotes like Christie calling President Barack Obama a \u201cfeckless weakling\u201d while Hillary Clinton is \u201cMrs. Happy Talk.\u201d Or Carly Fiorina attacking both Hillary and Bill Clinton, bashing \u201cthe Clinton way to get elected: lie as long as you can get away with it.\u201d On the Democratic side, the race exploded on Friday when it was revealed that Sanders\u2019 campaign gained unauthorized access to Clinton\u2019s proprietary voter files through a glitch in a Democratic National Committee system. When the DNC retaliated by temporarily locking Sanders out of his own voter files, the long-simmering fight between the liberal insurgent candidate and the party\u2019s establishment spilled into the open. \u201cThey are attempting to cripple our campaign and we\u2019re not going to stand for it,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told Wolf Blitzer on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz hit back, saying that \u201cthe Sanders campaign doesn\u2019t have anything other than bluster at the moment that they can put out there.\u201d The Clinton campaign stoked the fires, with spokesman Brian Fallon saying that the Sanders camp \u201cwent hog wild\u201d downloading data, adding and calling the Sanders lawsuit against the DNC \u201can outright act of chutzpah.\u201d Clinton also took on Trump with a startling accusation \u2013 one that hasn\u2019t been proven \u2013 during Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate, saying of Trump\u2019s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States: \u201cHe is becoming ISIS\u2019s best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.\u201d Trump hit back with harsh criticism of his own on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show Monday, saying he wants an apology. \u201cShe lies about emails, she lies about Whitewater, she lies about everything. She will be a disaster about everything as president of the United States.\u201d Is that apology coming? Fallon\u2019s reply: \u201cHell no.\u201d Read: Clinton stands by claim that Trump helps ISIS recruitment Rubio and Cruz have decided that their paths to the GOP nomination run through each other \u2013 turning two ambitious men who rode tea party waves into their Senate seats bitterly against each other. They\u2019ve shed the usual coded Senate-style insults, such as describing one\u2019s opponent as \u201cmy very good friend,\u201d for more overt hits. Cruz swung at Rubio in a National Review interview last week, saying Rubio is \u201chiding from the grassroots\u201d and waging his campaign \u201cfrom a TV studio\u201d \u2013 a reference to a Rubio schedule that\u2019s less jam-packed with events than some of his opponents\u2019. Read: The top campaign whoppers from a lie-filled 2015 And Cruz\u2019s campaign spokesman Rick Tyler gleefully noted that Rubio skipped Friday\u2019s vote on the massive spending bill they both opposed. .@marcorubio FOUND! - Missed the spending bill vote today b/c he had 1 event in a row in Iowa - a record-setting breakneck pace for Marco, Tyler tweeted. Rubio, for his part, hit Cruz on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d over his votes against defense spending bills, saying that Cruz \u201ctalks tough on some of these issues\u201d but doesn\u2019t have the votes to back it up. And the two Cuban-American freshmen have spent much of the month in a war over immigration. At a campaign rally in Virginia, Cruz charged: \u201cSen. Rubio unfortunately made the decision not to honor the promises he made to the men and women who elected him. Instead he sided with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and big money interests in Washington to lead the fight for amnesty.\u201d Rubio returned the volley Sunday on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d He said Cruz\u2019s shtick is to \u201cspend your whole time telling people that you\u2019re a clear talker, and you say what you mean, and everyone else is a sellout, but you\u2019re the only purist.\u201d Bush got in on the Cruz-bashing Monday when he backed a path to legal status for undocumented workers. \u201cBy the way, that view, Ted Cruz had until he went into the witness protection program,\u201d Bush said. The former Florida governor, stuck in the low single-digits, on Tuesday repeated the \u201cchaos candidate\u201d criticism of Trump he used at the CNN Republican debate last week and said Trump isn\u2019t serious because of his insults and profanities. \u201cTrump is not going to be president because he says these things that turns people off,\u201d Bush said. \u201cFor crying out loud, we\u2019re two days before Christmas.

Related: Jeb Bush blasts Ted Cruz over immigration, Syria At issue is an amendment Cruz pushed to a Rubio-backed immigration reform bill in 2013 that would have stripped out a portion of the measure to give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship.

Cruz has defended that move, calling it a poison pill designed to sink the bill by forcing Democrats into an awkward position.

            "article_content": "The biggest dispute between Cruz and Rubio is over a two-year-old immigration bill that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to gaining U.S. citizenship Rubio helped author the reform measure, but Cruz joined with other conservatives to defeat it Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio brought their increasingly nasty immigration fight to the campaign trail Thursday, accusing each other of muddying their records for political expediency. It\u2019s an extension of their exchanges in Tuesday night\u2019s GOP presidential debate, where Cruz hit Rubio for supporting a 2013 immigration reform proposal that granted undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship and Rubio shot back that Cruz, too, had pushed an amendment that granted those immigrants legal status. Cruz has been on the defensive in the days after the debate on the issue, and on Thursday, the Texas senator looked to regain momentum after increased attention on his record. In a new television spot in Iowa, Cruz amplified his new line of attack, the first time Cruz has taken to the airwaves to outline contrasts between him and another candidate during his campaign. \u201cSecuring our borders and stopping illegal immigration is a matter of national security. That\u2019s why I fought so hard to defeat President Obama and the Republican establishment\u2019s Gang of 8 amnesty plan,\u201d Cruz said in the direct-to-camera spot. \u201cTheir misguided plan would have given Obama the authority to admit Syrian refugees, including ISIS terrorists. That\u2019s just wrong.\u201d Cruz, the senator from Texas, continued latching Rubio\u2019s support for the bill to President Barack Obama and influential Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer in events across the country Thursday. \u201cFor the first time in five debates, Senator Rubio publicly admitted not only did he support Obama and Schumer\u2019s amnesty but he still supports amnesty and citizenship today,\u201d Cruz said Thursday \u2013 highlighting a Rubio stance that is anathema to the GOP\u2019s conservative base. In Iowa, meanwhile, Rubio accused Cruz of trying to duck the issue \u2013 pointing to his amendment that would have replaced citizenship with legal status for undocumented immigrants. \u201cHe supports legalization, and I think his hope was once he got into the general election, to then start talking about legalization as a way to attract more voters,\u201d Rubio said. Ted Cruz\u2019s run to the right The two are jockeying to become the Republican alternative to front-runner Donald Trump, and as each have climbed in the polls, they\u2019ve ratcheted up attacks on each other over defense funding, U.S. government surveillance and other issues. GOP debates in Las Vegas But the biggest dispute between Cruz and Rubio is over the two-year-old immigration bill that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to gaining U.S. citizenship. Rubio, as part of a bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d in the Senate, helped author the reform measure. Cruz joined with other conservatives to defeat it. Later, in Minnesota on Thursday, Cruz said that Rubio had broken the vow he had made to the voters who elected him in 2010. \u201cWe made the identical promises to the men and women who elected us. But when 2013 came along, Senator Rubio and I made very different choices,\u201d he said, arguing that Rubio made that push primarily to court elite Republican donors. \u201cThose decisions have consequences.\u201d Cruz introduced a spate of amendments to that bill \u2013 including one to strip out the path to citizenship and replace it with a measure that would allow those immigrants to gain legal status but never earn certain rights, like voting. Cruz has called that a poison pill designed to highlight Democrats\u2019 hypocrisy by painting them as more interested in gaining votes than helping immigrants. But Rubio isn\u2019t letting up, saying Thursday that Cruz shouldn\u2019t get a free pass on the amendment to grant legal status because of his explanation of legislative maneuvering. \u201cI think Ted Cruz needs to be clear about what his stance is today on that, but I can tell you what it\u2019s been in the past,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cHe strongly supported legalizing people that were in this country illegally.\u201d What\u2019s behind the Cruz/Rubio immigration fight? If Cruz\u2019s position was unclear in 2013, he\u2019s clarified it since, saying during Tuesday night\u2019s debate that he hasn\u2019t and \u201cdoesn\u2019t intend\u201d to support a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Some conservatives, however, have wondered whether Cruz\u2019s choice of words was intended to leave himself room to maneuver on that position in a general election. But he repeated that pledge Thursday in Nevada. \u201cI oppose amnesty. I oppose citizenship. I oppose legalization for illegal aliens,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI always have, and I always will, and I challenge every other Republican candidate to say the same thing or, if not, then to stop making silly assertions that their records and my records on immigration are the same.\u201d Rubio has also hit Cruz over an amendment that would have massively increased the number of H-1B guest worker visas \u2013 a proposal that could have undercut the broader bill\u2019s political support by pitting business groups that support such an expansion against labor unions that oppose it. \u201cHe was a supporter of legal immigration, as he said at the time and repeated to multiple media outlets for months,\u201d Rubio said Thursday.

            "article_content": "The Texas Republican is looking to shore up his conservative bonafides On trade and immigration -- two of the most volatile issues in the Republican Party -- Cruz has abandoned previous positions that are politically dangerous in the race to the right Ted Cruz, eager to extinguish any lingering liabilities with the conservative base that largely adores him, is quietly inching rightward as he surges into the Republican top tier. Few in the conservative grass-roots question his standing as a true believer. But with one eye on a threatening ideological competitor, Donald Trump, and another on an useful foil, Marco Rubio, Cruz has over the past four months slowly looked to remove any outstanding impurities that could hinder his hopes to coalesce conservatives around his campaign. On trade and immigration \u2013 two of the most volatile issues in the Republican Party \u2013 Cruz has abandoned previous positions that are politically dangerous in the race to the right. The latest shift came Tuesday, when Cruz discarded with his past caution on what to do with those who came to the U.S. illegally, saying finally at CNN\u2019s debate in Las Vegas that he would not support a path to legal status. That move hasn\u2019t been without controversy, as seen in a contentious interview on Fox News Wednesday that put the Texan squarely on the defensive. Memorable quotes from the last GOP debate of 2015 A month prior, Cruz sharply distanced himself from his long-held plan to increase the number of visas for high-tech workers by 500%. Under fire from conservative talk radio hosts who said he was imperiling American workers, Cruz said he would suspend the program for 180 days until it could be reformed to his liking. Three months before that, under that same pressure from GOP talkers, Cruz backed out of supporting the White House\u2019s Trade Promotion Authority, which had become a lightning rod for conservatives anxious about appeasing the White House. Cruz maintains that he still supports free trade, but that the trade authority was \u201cenmeshed in corrupt Washington backroom dealmaking.\u201d And since the attacks in Paris, Cruz has been leaving the door more open to committing U.S boots on the ground in the Middle East, trading his against-the-grain unwillingness for more mainstream interventionism. Together, the shifts allow Cruz to simultaneously avoid ceding any ground to Trump while also more distinctly articulating the difference between the man Cruz supporters see as his eventual final rival, Rubio. Read: What\u2019s behind the Cruz/Rubio immigration fight? More immediately, though, some unaffiliated Republicans argue that Cruz is responding to political pressure that comes as Cruz nears front-runner status in Iowa, a state that tends to reward the furthest right candidates in the field. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly tacking right to try to secure the hard-right base that he thinks will propel him to victory in the Iowa caucuses,\u201d said Doug Gross, a longtime Iowa GOP hand who worries about Cruz in a general election. \u201cHe may be short-term in his thinking here.\u201d The shifts haven\u2019t gone unnoticed by competitors, especially Rubio, whose campaign is eager to remind voters of each inconsistency they see in Cruz\u2019s new rhetoric. \u201cAnother week of Senator Ted Cruz willing to say or do anything to win an election, leaving a trail of inconsistencies and conflicting statements,\u201d read one recent missive from the campaign to reporters wrapping up the week\u2019s news. Rick Tyler, a Cruz campaign spokesman, pushed back on the idea that the policy changes were part of any broader narrative about his ideology. \u201cHow does Ted Cruz shift right? There\u2019s no right left,\u201d said Tyler. \u201cEverybody can try to pick apart Ted Cruz\u2019s record, but they can\u2019t because his record is conservative and consistent.\u201d The base does not seem worried. Jenny Beth Martin, the head of Tea Party Patriots who has not endorsed a candidate, said Cruz is simply paying attention to his audience and reflecting the moment. \u201cHe listened to his base and reflected and represented them,\u201d said Martin. On trade, she said, \u201cgrassroots pressure came to bear on him about the agreement, and learning more about it, he shifted about his position.\u201d Read: Senate intel committee leaders say no probe into debate comments There are not many blemishes on Cruz\u2019s record or concerns about his conservative allegiances: He has a 100% rating on the scorecard from Heritage Action for America, considered by grassroots activists to be one of the best barometers of their commitment to the cause. And he has staged his political campaign as a revolution against the traditional powers in Republican politics, charging that the party\u2019s establishment donors \u201cactively despise\u201d the base that he represents and that its leaders compose a \u201csurrender caucus.\u201d But that might not be enough in a GOP field dominated by Trump, who has displayed a populist appeal spanning from the tea party to mainstream suburban women. Despite his grounding in the grass-roots, Cruz has had to quickly react at times to Trump\u2019s envelope-pushing brand of conservatism, such as when Cruz quickly agreed this summer with Trump\u2019s new position to end birthright citizenship, despite previous questions the Texan posed about its constitutionality. And so some Cruz critics lay the blame for Cruz\u2019s moves at the New Yorker\u2019s feet. \u201cHe is trying to get to the right of Trump,\u201d said Massey Villarreal, who convened a group of like-minded Hispanic conservatives to meet with the Cruz campaign the day before the debate in Las Vegas. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be the darling of the people who have fear in their hearts.\u201d Cruz\u2019s most high-profile switch came Tuesday night, when he definitively ruled out a path to legal status for those currently in the United States. For months, Cruz has gone to extreme lengths to avoid answering what he would do with the estimated 12 million in the U.S. Illegally, derailing interviews and flustering questioners by repeatedly refusing to engage in the discussion. But under siege from a Rubio determined to close the distance between Cruz\u2019s position and his own, Cruz aimed to forge a new black-and-white contrast: Rubio would supports a path to citizenship for the undocumented, and Cruz would deport them. \u201cMy stance on immigration has been consistent,\u201d Cruz told reporters in California when asked about his hardened stance. Then he was able to parlayed it into a differentiation with his rival: \u201cLast night was the first time he admitted it,\u201d Cruz said of Rubio\u2019s position. \u201cThat\u2019s an important moment of candor.\u201d Cruz nevertheless has spent much of the post-debate news cycle on the defensive. In a contentious interview with Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier on Wednesday, an occasionally stammering Cruz was forced to recount every nook and turn of his positions during the 2013 immigration wars in the Capitol \u2013 and not Rubio\u2019s. For voters just paying attention to Cruz after his rapid rise, his past positions may remain merely fodder for rival campaigns. But given Cruz\u2019s self-stylization as an unabashed truth-teller, Gross said, his political profile could be at risk if one of those rivals tells voters about them. \u201cIf people realize he\u2019s being duplicitous about those positions, he\u2019ll kill himself,\u201d Gross said. \u201cIf it gets publicized, it\u2019s high, high risk.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Roger Stone announced his new effort in an email asking for donations from \"average Americans\" The letter says Rubio has been anointed by a Republican establishment, dubbed \"losers\" Former Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone has a new target: billionaire \u201cshill\u201d Marco Rubio. The former Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan aide on Thursday launched a new super PAC aimed at taking down the Florida senator in the GOP presidential primary and boosting the billionaire mogul. Stone announced his new effort in an email asking for donations from \u201caverage Americans\u201d on Thursday that was sent to conservative Newsmax readers and shared with CNN. The letter signed by Stone was a point-by-point indictment of Rubio and argument in favor of Trump. \u201cIt is vital that voters know about the real Marco Rubio, his liberal voting record and limited experience,\u201d Stone wrote. \u201cMarco Rubio intends to present himself to the voters of New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, as another Ronald Reagan. In fact, he is a wheeler-dealer who has played ball with the Obama administration on numerous issues such as immigration and trade. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve formed the Committee to Restore America\u2019s Greatness.\u201d RELATED: Putin praises Trump The letter says Rubio has been anointed by a Republican establishment, dubbed \u201closers,\u201d that produced the failed campaigns of Mitt Romney and John McCain. Stone also writes that candidate was originally supposed to be former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and that Bush has fallen to fifth place in the face of Trump\u2019s \u201clow energy\u201d attacks. It also accuses Rubio of entering a \u201csecret alliance\u201d with Ohio Gov. John Kasich to attack Trump. A Kasich-supporting super PAC has released some of the most aggressive attack ads going after the front-runner. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also gets a brief mention in a postscript at the end of the letter, including a mention of his office\u2019s \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal. The letter is a litany of Rubio\u2019s alleged anti-Republican indiscretions, including supporting the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d immigration bill and supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Stone also uses colorful language to portray Rubio being in billionaires\u2019 pockets. \u201cI must question whether Marco Rubio has the experience, intellectual heft, or principles to be president of the United States. Would Rubio simply be a shill for the billionaires?\u201d he wrote. \u201cMake no mistake, Rubio\u2019s New America is the wet dream of the crooked lobbyists, Wall Street billionaires and special interests.\u201d Trump, a billionaire in his own right, has pledged repeatedly throughout his campaign to self-fund and not accept super PACs\u2019 money. He decries politicians being owned by wealthy donors. Stone\u2019s PAC insists it will not accept money from corporations, asking \u201caverage Americans and everyday citizens to help us finance a hard-hitting television and radio campaign exposing the real Marco Rubio, and his secret deal with would-be vice president John Kasich.\u201d Stone declined to comment to CNN beyond the letter. Stone parted with Trump\u2019s campaign in August amid controversy over whether he quit or was fired. He insisted he left on his own terms. The committee filed for recognition with the Federal Election Commission in October. RELATED: Roger Stone talks to CNN",

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio came of age as rivals vying to take the conservative movement into a new generation Donald Trump said he has no plans to leave the GOP Jeb Bush attacked Trump and tried to re-ignite his struggling campaign Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio finally came of age as rivals vying to take the conservative movement into a new generation. Jeb Bush took a stand. And Donald Trump said he won\u2019t jump ship. Tuesday\u2019s CNN Republican debate was a last chance to shine for candidates in 2015. It was a crucial clash before the race goes into the deep freeze over the Christmas and New Year holidays, with just seven weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses. And as the first GOP showdown since the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, revealed the alarming, expanded reach of ISIS, the showdown in Las Vegas offered a preview of how a Republican president would reshape U.S. national security policy. Here are five takeaways from a fiery night in Sin City. It was the showdown everyone wanted to see: Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, the two young princes of right-of-center politics, feuding over the conservative crown. Cruz has positioned himself as the tea party outsider and evangelical favorite, while Rubio is now tops in the polls among more establishment favorites. The confrontation could not be put off any longer. The two clashed on immigration, data sweeps by intelligence agencies and regime change in the Middle East, and both drew enough blood to allow their camps to claim victory \u2013 and to set up tantalizing future duels. Cruz, basking in his ride to the top of the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa poll over the weekend, came prepared to deflect Rubio\u2019s attacks. \u201cMarco knows what he is saying is not true,\u201d Cruz said, shrugging off an assault by his rival from Florida over HIS congressional vote to limit mass data surveillance programs used by U.S. intelligence agencies to track terror suspects. In an intervention aimed at the party\u2019s grass-roots, Cruz cited an article by radio talk show host Mark Levin in his defense \u2013 implicitly making the point that he, and not Rubio, is the most authentic conservative. And for good measure, when Cruz accused Rubio of backing an amnesty bill, he again reached for a conservative icon, quoting President Ronald Reagan saying, \u201cthere was a time for choosing.\u201d Read: Republican debate: CNN\u2019s Reality Check team inspects the claims But Rubio stood his ground, and appeared to score points when he skewered Cruz on his exact position on offering a path to legal status for illegal immigrants during a congressional battle on the issue in 2013. Rubio has consistently argued that Cruz did support such a move \u2013 a charge that could weaken the Texas senator among core conservatives who see such support as amnesty. \u201cI have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization,\u201d Cruz replied, taking a more concrete position on the issue than ever before. Six months into his campaign, Donald Trump broke some news: he\u2019s definitely running to be the Republican candidate for President. The GOP front-runner has frequently teased the GOP\u2019s top brass with the possibility that he could mount an independent presidential run if he is not treated fairly. Such a maneuver would likely ensure Democrats keep the White House, which Salem Radio\u2019s Hugh Hewitt noted when he asked if Trump would stay in the party. Trump said he\u2019s happy in the GOP. \u201cI really am, I\u2019ll be honest. I really am,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI am totally committed to the Republican Party. I feel very honored to be the front-runner.\u201d That should at least reassure GOP leaders who fear that Trump could walk with his fired up constituency of angry blue-collar voters and fatally harm the party\u2019s chance of capturing the White House. But it won\u2019t ease the fears of some party members who worry that Trump, with his explosive rhetoric and calls for foreign Muslims to be banned from U.S. soil, is causing serious damage to the party\u2019s image. GOP debates in Las Vegas As far as the debate, Trump probably didn\u2019t win \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have to. The reality show star has based his campaign on his mastery of the airwaves and social media, so is in less need than other candidates of splashy highlight reel moments in a debate. He can simply call up a television anchor and hijack the news agenda. Read: Donald Trump: We must \u2018penetrate the Internet\u2019 He did appear to come off second best, for once, in a clash with Bush \u2013 though nothing so far in the campaign has loosened Trump\u2019s bond with his faithful coalition. \u201cI\u2019m at 42, and you\u2019re at 3,\u201d Trump snapped at the former Florida governor, comparing poll numbers as Bush started to annoy him. CNN political commentator S.E. Cupp said that Trump had turned in a \u201cpoor performance\u201d but with the caveat that his supporters probably would not care. But Trump\u2019s struggle with details was on show as he tried to explain his comments that America should \u201cshut down the Internet\u201d to fight terrorists and came under fire from his rivals for his call to target the families of terrorists in the Middle East, in apparent contravention of the laws of war. \u201cI had fun,\u201d Bush, the one-time establishment favorite and long-ago GOP front-runner, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper after the debate \u2013 and it actually seemed like he was telling the truth. After a series of tepid debate performances, which coincided with his campaign\u2019s tumble from the top tier and saw him bullied by Trump and mercilessly pummeled by his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Rubio, the former Florida governor finally put up a fight. Bush even managed to get under Trump\u2019s skin for the first time and has a case that he emerged from a bout with the bombastic billionaire with a win \u2013 or at least a draw \u2013 on points. Memorable quotes from the last GOP debate of 2015 \u201cDonald, you are not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency,\u201d Bush warned in a testy exchange, which prompted Trump to mock his rival\u2019s single-digit poll numbers and efforts to raise the energy levels that Trump has blasted as lacking throughout the race. \u201cA little of your own medicine there, Donald,\u201d said Bush clearly enjoying the chance to rattle his tormentor as he got on Trump\u2019s nerves by trying to interrupt him. If Bush has any chance of a getting back in the mix, he needs to prove not just that he is the most qualified potential commander-in-chief, but also that he is tough enough to take down Trump \u2014 a feat no other Republican has yet achieved. Despite coming away from the exchanges with Trump on top, and putting in the strongest debate of his campaign, the question remains: Is anyone still listening? Despite a massive war chest, Bush is languishing at 3% in national polls. His attacks on Trump seemed to encapsulate the frustration he has endured in the campaign. \u201cThis is not a serious kind of candidate,\u201d Bush said after lambasting Trump\u2019s call for foreign Muslims to be temporarily banned from entering the United State. As he spoke, the bafflement that Republican voters aren\u2019t getting his argument was clearly written on the face of the son and brother of presidents. \u201cDonald, you know, is great at the one-liners, but he\u2019s a chaos candidate. And he\u2019d be a chaos president. He would not be the commander in chief we need to keep our country safe,\u201d Bush said, trying again. If viewers buy into the apocalyptic Republican worldview on display in the pair of GOP debates, they might be frightened to venture out of their front doors. \u201cWe have people across the country who are scared to death,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie warned, habitually staring straight into the camera directly into America\u2019s spooked living rooms. Tuesday\u2019s clash was the first Republican debate since terrorist attacks orchestrated or inspired by ISIS in Paris and California shocked the world and transformed the tone of the 2016 campaign, so it was not surprising the showdown bristled with hawkish rhetoric. But even so, it was a dark, frightening world that the candidates portrayed. \u201cAmerica has been betrayed,\u201d Christie warned, blaming President Barack Obama and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, as he seized on a bomb threat to Los Angeles schools earlier Tuesday that appeared to be a hoax. \u201cThink about the mothers who will take those children tomorrow morning to the bus stop wondering whether their children will arrive back on that bus safe and sound.\u201d Christie clearly sees the ominous resurgence of jihadist terrorism represented by ISIS as a political opening for him to highlight his credentials as a terrorist-hunting former prosecutor  \u2014 a possible lifeline as he grasps for a lifeline for a campaign stuck in single digits in the polls. All of the candidates were under pressure to prove to conservatives that they were tough enough to be commander in chief. The spine-chilling rhetoric was not just for effect \u2013 it offered a preview of what is certain to be an important theme in November\u2019s general election. \u201cThis President hasn\u2019t kept us safe,\u201d said Rubio, encapsulating that theme, in a debate constantly punctuated by candidates vowing to keep Americans and their children safe. Bush warned that America must \u201cdestroy ISIS before it destroys us,\u201d as he joined the chorus that ISIS represents an existential threat to America\u2019s very survival. \u201cThe war that we are fighting now against radical Islamist jihadists is one that we must win. Our very existence is dependent upon that,\u201d said retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. If anything the picture was even darker in the undercard debate as former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum warned: \u201cWe have entered World War III. World War III has begun.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham didn\u2019t mince words either. \u201cWe\u2019re at war, folks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not trying to steal your car. They\u2019re trying to kill us all.\u201d Referring to ISIS martyrs, Graham said: \u201cThey\u2019re ready to die. Bring on the virgins.\u201d Read: Lindsey Graham\u2019s best lines from CNN\u2019s undercard debate Each candidate made a case that they were uniquely qualified to lead the nation in a perilous era of foreign wars, resurgent terror threats and rising powers like China that are determined to challenge U.S. primacy. Rubio, who bills himself as a foreign policy expert, delivered a comprehensive tutorial on nuclear policy. Cruz vowed to \u201cutterly destroy ISIS\u201d and stop lone wolf, home-grown terror attacks before they happen. Ohio Gov. John Kasich complained that world leaders just wrapped up a summit on climate change in Paris and not one on terrorism. Christie blasted Obama as a \u201cfeckless weakling\u201d and said the last thing America needed was to pick a president from the squabbling senators on stage. But he may have undermined his case with a slip of the tongue, saying he was ready to stand with \u201cKing Hussein of Jordan.\u201d The current monarch is the deceased Hussein\u2019s son, Abdullah II. While candidates strove to outdo one another in hawkish rhetoric, a serious, substantial discussion did break out over foreign policy. As candidates like Trump and Cruz weighed in against regime change in places like Libya and Syria, others like Rubio and Kasich took a more interventionist approach, laying bare an ideological fault line dividing the Republican Party on national security. The clashing viewpoints did not just shape the last GOP presidential debate of 2015. Which side wins the argument could dictate whether the party rallies around a nominee  in the style of George W. Bush or nestles closer to the more limited view of America\u2019s footprint abroad preferred by Obama.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidates sought to cement \u2013 or improve \u2013 their standings in a debate Tuesday night that comes less than two months before the first votes of the election season are cast. The CNN debate in Las Vegas marked the first time the White House hopefuls shared a stage since terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. They flashed their foreign policy credentials and targeted each others\u2019 weaknesses in the debate that lasted more than two hours and focused exclusively on foreign policy and national security. The result of the showdown: Some winners, and some losers. Jeb Bush The former Florida governor walked onto the CNN debate stage on Tuesday facing a make-or-break moment for his struggling campaign. Polling at about 3% nationally, pundits had low expectations for Bush. But he was able to make the most of the moment and his performance will likely reassure skittish donors and supporters who have doubted him. Appearing confident, Bush repeatedly engaged front-runner Donald Trump and at times flustered the real estate mogul. Unlike previous debates where he has backed off, Bush didn\u2019t relent in the face of Trump\u2019s return fire. Gov. Jeb Bush: Trump's rhetoric is 'dog whistle talk' \u201cIf you think this is tough and you\u2019re not being treated fairly, imagine what it\u2019s going to be like dealing with Putin or dealing with President Xi or dealing with the Islamic terrorism that exists,\u201d Bush said over Trump\u2019s persistent interruptions. CNN political commentator Michael Smerconish said after the debate that Bush \u201cturned in a strong performance\u201d with his ability to repeatedly needle Trump. \u201cJeb had a good night,\u201d he said. Ted Cruz The tea party favorite avoided a cage match with front-runner Donald Trump in favor of a sparring match with Rubio. Cruz and Trump have largely avoided skirmishes on the campaign trail but that ended in recent days as the Texas senator\u2019s standing improves in Iowa. Former Mitt Romney aide and current CNN political commentator Kevin Madden said Cruz\u2019s strategy of avoiding confrontation on the debate stage was effective. \u201cI think the strategy Cruz has is working, bear hugging Donald Trump. I think Donald Trump does not feel antagonized,\u201d he said. While Cruz didn\u2019t give viewers anything like the fiery and memorable soundbites his supporters savored in the last debate, the Texas senator gave a strong performance sure to please his base. And by taking aim at \u2013 and holding his ground against \u2013 Rubio, Cruz did nothing to stall his burgeoning momentum. Marco Rubio Sen. Marco Rubio delivered a front-runner\u2019s performance, as he parried blows from all sides in the crowded field. Rubio worked to stay above the fray of candidates, focusing on showing off his in-depth understanding of foreign policy and deflecting the attacks his competitors hurled his way. The Florida senator, though engaged in heated exchanges with Cruz and Rand Paul at times, mostly sought to flex his hawkish national security positions rather than attack his competitors. Marco Rubio attacks Ted Cruz's voting record When prompted to address Trump\u2019s proposal to bar foreign Muslims from entering the U.S. \u2013 which Rubio opposes \u2013 or to address his recent criticism of Cruz, Rubio didn\u2019t bite. Instead, the Florida senator used the opportunity to speak at length about foreign policy concerns and his own proposals \u2013 or to attacking President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. Donald Trump As the real estate mogul has done in recent debates, Donald Trump offered a measured performance stylistically different from the fiery stump speeches he delivers at rallies to supporters. And the typically confrontational businessman largely avoided tangling with his fellow contenders. It was a safe performance for Trump, but it\u2019s one that certainly won\u2019t deter his supporters and won\u2019t do anything to hurt his front-runner status. Donald Trump commits to the Republican Party CNN political commentator David Axelrod, a former top Obama adviser, said that while Trump didn\u2019t meet the bar on facts and \u201clinear thinking,\u201d he was \u201cin character.\u201d \u201cI think he probably did what he needed to do,\u201d Axelrod said, adding that it didn\u2019t hurt that few of the candidates to Trump\u2019s right and left were \u201ceager to tangle\u201d with the front-runner. Chris Christie New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s goal on Tuesday was to try and further his recent rise in stock in the early primary state of New Hampshire, where talk of national security has boosted the former federal prosecutor. Christie managed to poke at the three senators in the race by lamenting the tit-for-tat debates Cruz, Rubio and Paul engaged in. The governor continued to play to his executive experience and his prosecutions of terrorism cases as a U.S. attorney. In one of his strongest moments, Christie slammed the senators on stage as \u201cpeople who\u2019ve never had to make a consequential decision in an executive position\u201d and proclaimed that voters were looking for \u201ca president who actually knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d CNN political commentator Jeffrey Lord, a Trump supporter, noted that like Trump, Christie \u201cwas delivering a message\u201d on stage rather than getting too \u201cin the weeds\u201d on policy. Ben Carson Ben Carson said it himself on Tuesday heading into the last debate of the year: He needed to prove his national security credentials to reassure voters fleeing his campaign amid rising concerns over terrorism. But the retired neurosurgeon faltered on that front \u2013 offering little in the way of assuaging those concerns, which are believed to have contributed to Carson\u2019s fall from his position near the top of the polls in Iowa and nationally. Instead, Carson offered vague and meandering responses to specific foreign policy questions, complained about the time allotted to him and declined when asked whether he sided with Cruz or Rubio in the debate over National Security Agency data collection. Carly Fiorina Carly Fiorina still looked and sounded like a top debater on stage Tuesday night, but a closer look shows that the former Hewlett-Packard CEO is offering little to voters that they haven\u2019t already heard. In short, Fiorina\u2019s shtick is getting old. And several of Fiorina\u2019s attempts to elbow her way into the debate as other candidates were speaking \u2013 a tactic that has worked for her in the past \u2013 didn\u2019t help her during this performance. Her strongest moments, though, came when she touted her experience as a tech executive as a way to highlight the need for the private sector to boost the federal government\u2019s counter-terrorism efforts. John Kasich Kasich faced a similar problem as Fiorina \u2013 he didn\u2019t offer anything new that would jumpstart his candidacy. Kasich tried his best once again to play the role of the adult in the room, calling out Trump for unserious proposals and questioning other candidates\u2019 assessment of the situation in Syria, for example. But Kasich failed to snag himself a moment. Rand Paul The libertarian senator from Kentucky showed he was in a fighting mood from the outset: jabbing at Trump and Rubio in his opening statement Unfortunately for Paul, nobody wanted to tangle with him. Rand Paul questions Donald Trump's candidacy Even Trump \u2013 who rarely resists an opportunity to needle his competitors \u2013 didn\u2019t take the bait when Paul hit him at several points in the debate. \u201cMarco can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Paul said, attacking Rubio on immigration. \u201cHe wants to be this I\u2019m great and strong on national defense, but he\u2019s the weakest of all the candidates on immigration.\u201d But Rubio didn\u2019t hit back, simply thanking Paul for giving him another 30 seconds of talking time \u2013 afforded to any candidate called out by one of his opponents \u2013 and using it to lay out his position.

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz on Tuesday said he did not \"intend\" to support a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants That closed the door much more tightly on a proposal he has repeatedly declined to address Ted Cruz on Tuesday significantly toughened his position on how to deal with undocumented immigrants currently in the United States, closing the door on legalizing them and instead suggesting that he would deport them. Cruz has vocally opposed a path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States, but he has taken pains during his presidential campaign to not rule out a path to legal status, often telling reporters that he will not discuss what to do with them until the southern border is secured. But in Tuesday night\u2019s CNN debate, Cruz went further than he ever has before. \u201cI have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization,\u201d the Texas senator said on the debate stage after rival Florida Sen. Marco Rubio encouraged the moderators to pose that question again to Cruz. Rick Tyler, a campaign spokesman, confirmed that Cruz unequivocally now does not support a path to legalization. Although Cruz has pushed back on Rubio\u2019s claim that the Texas senator supported a path to legal status during the 2013 immigration fights in Congress, Cruz has never before stated that he did not plan to support a path to legal status moving forward. Some have raised the prospect of Cruz eventually coming out in support of legal status in a general election, during which that position would be more politically appealing. In his immigration plan rolled out last month that his campaign called comprehensive, Cruz did not address what he would do with the undocumented immigrants already here, declining to specify whether he would deport them or grant them legal status. And speaking to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper after the debate, Cruz even indicated he would back deporting those who came here illegally \u2013 another proposal he has usually rebuffed. \u201cI would enforce the law,\u201d Cruz said, explaining that he would first deport criminals without proper papers. \u201cFederal immigration law provides that if someone is here illegally and is apprehended, that they should be sent back to their home country.\u201d Cruz has recently begun stressing that he believes the number of undocumented immigrants would decrease with strict border enforcement. But asked last month in Iowa how he squared that \u201ccomprehensiveness\u201d with his lack of a comment about those already here, the Texan said no one was interested in that question beyond the media. \u201cThe only people I\u2019m under fire from are reporters who want to throw rocks,\u201d Cruz said in Harlan. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve demonstrated that we can solve the problem, then we can have a conversation about what to do about whatever people remain illegally.\u201d The Rubio campaign has argued that Cruz previously supported legalization during the debate over the Gang of Eight bill, which Rubio championed in the Senate. Cruz introduced an amendment that allowed for legal status that he said was meant to show that the comprehensive immigration bill was really about citizenship rather than a true representation of what he believes. The Rubio campaign disagrees, citing it as evidence that their positions aren\u2019t that different. \u201cHe has attempted to muddy the waters,\u201d Cruz said on the stage. \u201cWhere there was a battle over amnesty and some chose, like Sen. Rubio to stand with Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer and support a massive amnesty plan. Others chose to stand with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and secure the border.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Franklin Graham: I think we should put a halt on immigration Graham said the U.S. might have to shutdown mosques Evangelist Franklin Graham said Tuesday that all immigration to the U.S. should be halted until America\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d immigration system is fixed. \u201cI think we should put a halt on immigration, because our borders are broken, until we have a proper system to vet people. I think all immigration, but especially those coming from the Middle East right now,\u201d he said on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d with Carol Costello. Starting on January 5 in Des Moines, Graham \u2013 the son of evangelist Billy Graham \u2013 will hold prayer rallies at all 50 state capitals. \u201cI\u2019m asking for Christians to join me \u2013 or anybody \u2013 to join me at the capital and to pray for our nation,\u201d he told Costello, adding later, \u201cEverybody\u2019s welcome. Absolutely. Muslims will be welcomed.\u201d Graham, who is president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, has long been a vocal advocate for socially conservative issues, including moving his organization\u2019s accounts with Wells Fargo away from the bank after it showed an ad featuring a lesbian couple. Graham was also criticized in 2012 for refusing to say that President Barack Obama was Christian. Graham heads Samaritan\u2019s Purse, a humanitarian organization that provides aid to Middle Eastern refugees. Graham told Costello he \u201cloves Muslims\u201d and \u201cworks with Muslims,\u201d but after Donald Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants following the San Bernardino shooting, Graham agreed with the Republican front-runner. \u201cFor some time I have been saying that Muslim immigration into the United States should be stopped until we can properly vet them or until the war with Islam is over. Donald J. Trump has been criticized by some for saying something similar,\u201d Graham posted on Facebook. Graham also said Islam is not compatible with American values and therefore the U.S. might have to shut down mosques. \u201cWe might have to at some point. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a responsibility \u2013 our government, the President, our Congress \u2013 has a responsibility to protect all Americans.\u201d Graham said he will not endorse anyone this election but is encouraging Christians to vote for candidates that support \u201cbiblical principles, godly principles, because those principles work.\u201d \u201cWe need more Christians in politics. I want to encourage Christians to run for every political level,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about just at the presidential level, I\u2019m talking about all levels of government.\u201d \u201cOur nation is crumbling. We\u2019re in turmoil. Washington does not work. We need to get people in office who are willing to work with one another and who uphold Biblical principles,\u201d he added.

Sarah Palin isn\u2019t shy about her least-favorite candidates in the 2016 field. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio? \u201cRobotic.\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie? \u201cEmbraced Obama.\u201d Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush? \u201cGeorge.\u201d Hillary Clinton? \u201cNyquil.\u201d And President Barack Obama himself? \u201cWarned ya.\u201d Palin delivered the answers to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper as the two played a word-association game Monday night at a \u201cPolitics on Tap\u201d event at the Double Barrel Roadhouse in Las Vegas. It came the night before the fifth GOP presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. Palin\u2019s comments reflect what much of the GOP\u2019s conservative base think of Jeb Bush \u2013 that he\u2019s too much like his brother and father, both former presidents. And she showed conservatives still haven\u2019t forgiven Christie for hugging Obama in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, just before the 2012 election. She did have a compliment for former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, the low-polling Democratic candidate whose looks have drawn attention on social media. Her take on O\u2019Malley? \u201cBiceps.\u201d Here are a few more highlights from their 25-minute conversation: She doesn\u2019t plan to endorse any time soon. And, in a nod to her history of backing candidates who didn\u2019t win, she joked that the presidential hopefuls wouldn\u2019t want her backing, anyway. \u201cNot if they\u2019re smart!\u201d she said. But Palin wasn\u2019t shy about saying her two favorite candidates in the 2016 GOP race are Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. She offered some kudos for the \u201clibertarian leanings\u201d of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, and said she does \u201cso respect\u201d retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. But she offered the kindest praise to Cruz, the GOP front-runner in Iowa, and Trump, who leads in national polls. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pick one right now, but what a nice problem to have if it came down to Cruz and Trump,\u201d Palin said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good problem for voters to have, because we know that, as you say, they are both strong and very decisive and someone who would take the initiative. That is what we need today, and both of those candidates would fit that bill.\u201d Though the former Alaska governor wasn\u2019t endorsing anyone, her daughter Willow Palin \u2013 who attended Monday night\u2019s event \u2013 says she\u2019s backing Trump. Palin stuck with a tried-and-true tactic of saying the \u201cliberal media\u201d distorted Trump\u2019s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. She said Trump didn\u2019t get to \u201cfinish his thought\u201d \u2013 and that she believes a pause in a \u201cscrewed-up\u201d system more broadly is what the national Republican front-runner had in mind. \u201cI think that Trump was trying to finish the conversation that would lead to a pause on immigration in general, Jake. I think that\u2019s where he was going,\u201d Palin said. Palin said it\u2019d be the Republican Party\u2019s fault \u2013 not Trump\u2019s \u2013 if the real estate mogul decided he wasn\u2019t being treated fairly and launched an independent campaign. She said Republican voters are valuing candidates who split from the donor class, and the party overall \u201cbetter not blow it.\u201d \u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s got to do a better job of exerting independence,\u201d Palin said. Or at least, two specific drinking-related questions. Asked what beer she\u2019d pair with moose chili, Palin said: \u201cIt would be a good Coors Light. Yes, yes \u2013 pretty simple people.\u201d And as for which Republican presidential candidate she\u2019d most like to grab a beer with, she chose one who\u2019s said he\u2019s never consumed alcohol. \u201cThe one who seems most fun bellying up to a bar would be Trump,\u201d Palin said.",

            "article_content": "Watch the CNN Republican debate Tuesday, December 15 at 6:00 p.m. ET and 8:30 p.m. ET. The catalyst for the anti-establishment dominance in the party may have been another Republican who used bomb-throwing rhetoric Today, furious rank-and-file Republicans don't trust their leaders or government, splitting the party Donald Trump\u2019s political hurricane is no accident. It\u2019s been brewing in the Republican Party for decades. Yes, the wild force tearing through the Republican White House race is a reflection of the grass roots\u2019 current fury at government and a revolt against establishment party leaders that has already swept away the likes of former House Speaker John Boehner and his lieutenant, Eric Cantor. And it\u2019s at least partly an individual phenomenon based on the charismatic appeal of Trump himself. The billionaire\u2019s brash television virtuosity and mastery of social media has connected with an angry swath of Republican voters in a way no other candidate has managed and will be put to the test again in the final GOP debate of the year, on CNN from Las Vegas on Tuesday night. READ: Stage set for final GOP debate of 2015 GOP react to Trump's plan to bar Muslims from entering U.S. But the Trump tempest has long been building. GOP critics argue the party has brought his destabilizing intervention on itself by not squelching controversies like claims he helped fuel that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States or explosive rhetoric about illegal immigrants. This contentious atmosphere has detracted from the debate on the nature of authentic conservatism that many partisans had expected in the 2016 race. READ: Iowa poll: Ted Cruz leads Donald Trump Several conservative commentators have rejected the notion that the GOP is itself responsible for Trump\u2019s appeal. They reason, for instance, that the real estate mogul is not a true believer but has merely hijacked the party to reach a community of mainly white, blue-collar voters resistant to the tide of change in Obama\u2019s America. And they have a point: The anti-establishment heat that he is exacerbating does predate Trump\u2019s arrival on the political scene. The Republican Party\u2019s current trauma stretches back at least to the 1990s, if not earlier. It lies in a transformation that turned the GOP from a party of consensus government that produced presidents like Dwight Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush into a party of rebellion in which the rank and file are consumed with anger at party leaders who they believe habitually maneuver to block true conservatives from winning the nomination. The catalyst for the anti-establishment dominance in the party may have been another brash Republican with a flair for bomb-throwing rhetoric and a disdain of party elites. Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich led an insurgency against the GOP House leadership, determined to dispense with the coziness that encompassed both the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress for decades. Gingrich not only took over his party; in 1994, he led the GOP to take over the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years and became speaker in a backlash against struggling Democratic President Bill Clinton. His coup went down in history as the \u201cRepublican Revolution.\u201d The next tipping point came six years later, when many activists believed George W. Bush would install authentic conservative governance in the White House. But the 43rd president turned out to be a deep disappointment to many conservative voters around the country, fueling the fury at GOP elites that has crested in Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Bush backed an ultimately unsuccessful immigration compromise that opponents derided as amnesty for illegal immigrants, ballooned debt through unpaid-for wars that also prompted a massive expansion of the government and presided over a financial crisis that saw billions of dollars funneled to save banks while ordinary Americans lost their jobs and houses. READ: GOP primary voters split over Trump\u2019s Muslim ban, poll finds Add in two failed presidential campaigns by nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney \u2013 whom many conservatives saw as dinosaurs of the Republican establishment \u2013 an industry of political revolt fueled by social media and super PACS that enabled individuals to challenge party bosses, the echo chamber of right-wing talk radio and partisan television programing, and the stage was set for pent up grass-roots ire to erupt. Into that roiling cauldron stepped a black President, a culture that increasingly embraced liberal social values and a GOP-controlled Congress unable to stop massive legislation such as Obamacare and White House actions seen as dangerous executive overreach on crucial national issues. Today, furious rank-and-file Republicans don\u2019t trust their leaders or government, splitting the party between, on one side, activists who believe compromise on political principles leads only to Democratic victories and should be scorned even if it that threatens to drive the economy over a fiscal cliff and, on the other, conservatives in Washington who see compromise as a necessary evil to keep the country running. The latter group wants to implement at least the modest Republican goals that are possible in a divided government and worry that Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies will sink the GOP. In fact, the anti-establishment sentiment stoked by the upstart Gingrich and congressmen who embraced the tea party that surged during Obama\u2019s presidency rather than face defeat in primaries has resulted in a GOP constituency that doesn\u2019t particularly care about the party itself, certainly not when compared to its allegiance to Trump. READ: National poll: Trump leads; Cruz rises as Carson falls \u201cFor them to go out and backstab him like this, you know what? I\u2019m done with the Republican party,\u201d Paula Yoel Johnson from New Hampshire told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Thursday, demanding more respect for Trump from establishment leaders. Steve Stepanek, a local lawmaker who chairs Trump\u2019s campaign in the Granite State, said that people were fed up with those in the party establishment trying to dictate the terms of the presidential race. \u201cI think Donald Trump in his success and his popularity is an example that people are sick and tired of the political machines in both parties,\u201d Stepanek told CNN.\u201d Trump\u2019s advance rides on the fact that he is not offering these voters detailed plans or promises about what he will do. Instead, he has simply positioned himself as the most vocal, outspoken vehicle for the grievances of this voting bloc \u2013 who believe he dares to propose action, like imposing an entry ban on Muslims in the United States that they also support, but no conventional politician will risk uttering. READ: I am a Trump supporter: Voters speak out Indeed, the divide between the GOP\u2019s two factions is exacerbated by many establishment figures\u2019 feeling that Trump is not a true conservative at all but has simply hijacked the Republican primary to exploit a seam of angry, white, blue-collar, aging and less well-educated voters who have taken up residence in the party\u2019s base. While Trump may have once been seen as a joke inside the party, the humor has faded. With his call to ban Muslims from traveling to the U.S., among other controversies he has ignited, the front-runner threatens to inflict deep harm on the party\u2019s chance of winning its first presidential election in 12 years \u2013 perhaps why it triggered such unusually broad condemnation from across a Republican Party often wary of calling him out. Some candidates, however, have increasingly been willing to do so. One-time establishment favorite Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, has called Trump \u201cunhinged,\u201d while another candidate, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, branded him a \u201crace-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d who could \u201cgo to hell.\u201d Some Republican officials and right-leaning analysts have even suggested that the man leading the GOP polls displays fascist tendencies. Still, the constituency that Trump is making use of is one that the Republican Party itself created, according to Heather Cox Richardson, a Boston College professor who wrote a history of the GOP titled \u201cTo Make Men Free.\u201d The people Donald Trump offended Trump succeeded, she said, by discovering it. \u201cHe is above all a salesman and he sells to a constituency \u2013 a set of customers, if you will. He is simply able to read them incredibly well,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cHe has built this enormous following that adores him because he says what they have been thinking but what more mainstream Republican leaders have been dancing around.\u201d Trump\u2019s coalition rests on an angry 25% to 35% of the GOP electorate that has proven to be more resilient and faithful to him than many political pundits predicted. The fury is evident in polls that reflect the mood of voters who have turned to \u201coutsider\u201d candidates like Trump and neurosurgeon Ben Carson this election season. Only 11% of Republicans and voters who lean Republican said experience was the most important factor in choosing a presidential candidate, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll published last month. Some 52% said bringing change to Washington was more important. So faithful is Trump\u2019s army that 68% of his backers would vote for him if he mounted a third-party run, according to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll. GOP critics believe Trump\u2019s controversial tirades against Mexicans, Muslims and several prominent women is a case of the GOP reaping what it sowed after fomenting a rebellion that led to two consecutive midterm election triumphs in 2010 and 2014. Those wins helped the party clog up the Obama presidency but then stymied the Republican Party leadership itself, with the new members of Congress proving impossible to control once they reached Washington. Some liberals also argue that the GOP\u2019s tolerance of \u201cbirtherism\u201d \u2013 claims by Trump and others that Barack Obama was not born in America \u2013 and a \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d that uses race as a cudgel to preserve GOP dominance among white voters in conservative states fed Trump\u2019s explosive political momentum. Conservatives reject such a narrative, and see Obama\u2019s own governing style and agenda as largely driving the grass-roots\u2019 frustration \u2013 though many in the GOP base think it is the party\u2019s failure, despite controlling Congess, to thwart Obama that is as much the problem. Either way, there is certainly some evidence that Trump has latched onto the anti-Washington fervor of the tea party and the issues that animate members of a group at first assumed to be preoccupied with economic concerns but shown by political scientists to represent a wider set of beliefs. For instance, his decision to make opposition to illegal immigration a foundation of his campaign looks particularly shrewd and has helped him to connect with the visceral discontent electrifying the conservative movement. A study by three Harvard scholars in 2011 found that immigration \u2013 was almost as much of a motivating force for tea party voters as deficits and spending. Some 80% of tea party voters said illegal immigration was a \u201cvery serious problem.\u201d The study by Vanessa Williamson, Theda Skocpol and John Coggin also identified that the societal change in America epitomized by Obama \u2013 intoxicating to his supporters \u2013 is deeply troubling and almost frightening to tea party voters. Trump\u2019s stump speech, the soft rock 1980s soundtrack that pumps through his rallies and his vows to \u201cmake America great again\u201d seem to hark back to a simpler, less diverse, more traditional nation, before blue-collar jobs migrated to China and American power was feared in the world. \u201cI think the best explanation (for Trump\u2019s popularity) is this change and this disequilibrium that we are seeing in American society,\u201d said Dan Shea, a professor of political science at Maine\u2019s Colby College, who has studied the polarization of the electorate. Donald Trump: His own words Shea said Trump\u2019s rise was a natural extension of the upheaval of the tea party era, born in the dislocation of the Great Recession, the fallout of two wars and sweeping change on issues like gay rights. \u201cAt the same time that the tea party rises up, we have a woman speaker of the House (Nancy Pelosi), an openly gay chairman of a major congressional committee (Barney Frank) and an African-American in the White House with an odd-sounding name.\u201d He continued, \u201cThere is a last-ditch attempt to bring back something that they once had. Then this leads into Trump, who is a true outsider.\u201d Trump is not the only candidate to notice this group of voters is up for grabs. His GOP rival, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is aiming to build a more aspirational coalition bridging more establishment voters, social conservatives and the disaffected working class, made a pitch for the last group\u2019s support in a new campaign ad released on Monday. \u201cThis election is about the essence of America,\u201d he said, looking directly into the camera. \u201c(It\u2019s) about all of us who feel out of place in our own country, a government incredibly out of touch and millions with traditional values branded bigots and haters.\u201d In this reading of America\u2019s shifting culture, Trump\u2019s ascent is seen by some conservative commentators as outside the movement itself. As such, he begins to look more of an opportunist and a classic populist than a candidate motivated by a core ideology. \u201cTrumpism has nothing to do with conservatism. He is not a conservative. Most of the most prominent public positions he has advocated go against conservative orthodoxy,\u201d said Matt Lewis, a conservative commentator and author of the book \u201cToo Dumb to Fail: How the GOP Betrayed the Reagan Revolution to Win Elections (And How It Can Reclaim Its Conservative roots),\u201d due to be published next month. \u201cWhat we have right now is that the white working class is very scared and upset,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think that has to do with the bad economy and I think it has to do with technological change and globalization, the rise of ISIS and terrorism.\u201d He concluded, \u201cThere is a phenomenon that is taking place that has nothing to do with conservatism other than the fact that the Republican Party has essentially become the de facto home of working-class whites.\u201d Richardson, the Boston College professor, traces the roots of Trump\u2019s rise to well before the 1990s. She goes back to a breach in the Republican Party that first opened over New Deal social programs after World War II. Republicans like President Dwight Eisenhower and Nelson Rockefeller realized that such social legislation was popular and accepted it, while an opposite, more conservative wing of the GOP rejected the programs and also opposed the New Deal\u2019s regulation of businesses, establishing an anti-government creed that stretched from 1964 Republican nominee Barry Goldwater to Ronald Reagan to the George W. Bush of the 2000 campaign and into the modern conservative movement. She said that supporters of President Richard Nixon, meanwhile, opened the door to rhetoric critical of minorities, women and anyone perceived as getting a \u201chandout\u201d from the government \u2013 charges that are familiar in the 2016 race. \u201cTrump is the logical extension of that. We have been moving down that road,\u201d Richardson said. READ: Republicans discussed possibility of brokered convention Whatever role the party itself played in fostering Trumpism, its elites are now flummoxed at the prospect that the dynamic could doom them in 2016. Republican leaders fear that Trump\u2019s fiery stances could push independents and even moderate Republicans into the arms of probable Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At the same time, the billionaire businessman has threatened to mount an independent presidential bid if he is not treated with \u201crespect\u201d by the party. The GOP can ill afford to lose the Trump coalition, especially with the 2016 election likely to be close. But the presence of Trump inside the party also threatens to drive away voters turned off by his rhetoric and antics. \u201cWith Trump in the whole way, I cannot come up with a scenario where the Republicans can get through this,\u201d said Shea. \u201cEither he bails and he takes his supporters with him. Or he stays and ruins the brand.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump's debate Achilles heel -- his surveillance stance. How many opponents will take aim? Bush donors wondering about the possibility of an early exit strategy The impact of terrorism as a campaign issue, Donald Trump\u2019s beef with conservative Latino activists, GOP establishment hand-wringing over the rise of Ted Cruz, and the staying power of Trump \u2013 those stories filled our \u201cInside Politics\u201d forecast Sunday. It\u2019s no secret that Donald Trump\u2019s success can partly be attributed to a crowded GOP field with a handful or more of candidates you can fairly describe as mainstream establishment. GOP help wanted: Romney and Ryan to the rescue? Add up the poll numbers for Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich, for example, and you are at or above Trump levels. Carly Fiorina, among the outsiders, also largely fits the establishment mold when it comes to the issues. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina does too, though his numbers at the moment don\u2019t add much to the establishment math. So many party veterans say shrinking the field is the way to beat Trump. But who should go? Well, that is the issue, and Julie Pace of The Associated Press reports that among the many things being debated among party leaders is calling on the 2012 GOP ticket \u2013 Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan \u2013 to help with the nudging. \u201cThere are some preliminary discussions happening about what that wing of the party will do if all of those candidates want to come out of New Hampshire and continue on,\u201d said Pace. \u201cTwo of the names I heard a lot about were Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney, not to run, but to essentially to have a come-to-Jesus conversation with these candidates and come up with a process for winnowing down that part of the field.\u201d In June, Jeb Bush was atop the GOP field in national surveys. Now he tends to run fifth in single digits. 2016ers calling it quits? That makes the former Florida governor one of the names discussed when the establishment debates whether a smaller field would help it defeat Trump and Ted Cruz. Jeff Zeleny of CNN reports Team Bush brushes aside such talk and vows the governor is in for the long haul. But he also reports the private buzz among some Bush donors isn\u2019t so optimistic \u201cHis campaign will say, \u2018No, not at all, no chance \u2013 we will stay in through Iowa, New Hampshire, and beyond \u2013 we have a path,\u2019\u201d said Zeleny. \u201cIncreasingly, a lot of his donors do not believe that is true. This is the most critical week of this campaign, I believe, for Jeb Bush.\u201d As Cruz surges in Iowa, there is more and more talk that he has pretty decent odds of being the GOP nominee. And that prospect has the GOP establishment in as much of a tizzy as the chance that Trump might lead the ticket. The Cruz effect The big conversation among establishment strategists is that either Trump or Cruz would hurt Senate candidates in states that tend to go Democratic in presidential years, and even in some that are more purple \u2013 meaning competitive. New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio are the states most often mentioned when establishment types note their angst about the prospect of a ticket led by Trump or Cruz. There is internal party polling data to back up these anxieties, though Trump and Cruz loyalists dismiss them as establishment hand-wringing. For all the anxiety, though, there is also a sense of resignation that clearing a few of the more \u201ccenter-right\u201d candidates from the field might take a while. Perhaps, if someone bombs Tuesday night. More likely, though, is that the race stays crowded until the New Hampshire primary, and then quickly loses several candidates after that. We know terrorism will be a huge issue in the CNN Republican presidential debate Tuesday night, and there is good reason to believe Cruz will be under fire. The question is from how many of his rivals. Terrorism talking points Cruz at a recent fund-raiser questioned whether Donald Trump has the judgment to be commander in chief. So Trump firing back during the debate is a safe bet. Plus, Abby Phillip of The Washington Post says at least two other candidates see a chance to help themselves by attacking Cruz\u2019s support for curtailing the government\u2019s surveillance powers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Rubio that\u2019s going to be hammering him on that,\u201d said Phillip. \u201cWe\u2019ll see Chris Christie coming out of the woodwork. He\u2019s rising in New Hampshire, and this is, he thinks, his central issue. So we\u2019ll see who else can maneuver on that issue.\u201d Among the GOP groups holding strategy sessions around the big Vegas debate are conservative Latinos. GOP Hispanics say 'no thanks' to Trump Trump has had tense relations with Latinos because of his comments about illegal immigration, and Ed O\u2019Keefe of The Washington Post reports his campaign will not be among those getting a chance to make their case for an endorsement from this group of Hispanic conservatives. \u201cIt might not carry a lot of water (in the primary battle), but it would definitely allow the person that gets that endorsement to make a general election argument, you know, \u2018If I\u2019m able to draw Hispanic support, perhaps I\u2019m the one we should be nominating,\u2019\u201d said O\u2019Keefe.",

            "article_content": "McCaskill: Obama needs \"work on being empathetic\" Missouri senator says Clinton is scarred by political attacks and \"not comfortable opening up\" Calls Ted Cruz \"a jerk to everyone in Washington\" In a frank chat with former Obama political guru David Axelrod, Sen. Claire McCaskill offered a candid assessment of the President\u2019s ability to empathize with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. \u201cHe is my friend and I am loyal to him,\u201d the Missouri Democrat said of President Barack Obama, \u201cbut one of the President\u2019s shortcomings is that sometimes he sees the world through his eyes and doesn\u2019t do, I think, enough work on being empathetic about how other people view things.\u201d Axelrod, a journalist before entering politics and now host of \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast, told McCaskill the story of a contentious meeting between Obama and the Democratic caucus during the tense negotiations over passage of the Affordable Care Act. After the powwow, Axelrod recalled Obama asking him what everyone in the room had been \u201cso scared of.\u201d \u201c\u2018Well, I think they may be scared of losing their jobs,\u2019\u201d Axelrod told the President. \u201cI had the same conversation with him,\u201d McCaskill said on the podcast. \u201cI called him and I said, \u2018Listen, you know this could cost you re-elect.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s worth it to me on healthcare.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Okay, good for you, I\u2019m there.\u201d McCaskill also offered her take on Hillary Clinton. \u201cShe still is who she is,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cShe\u2019s not comfortable opening up. She still has some defensive crouches because she\u2019s gone through a life of being attacked and expects to be attacked. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to be on offense when you think you have to be on defense.\u201d As for the Republicans vying for a likely head-to-head fight with Clinton in the general election, McCaskill offered some mixed reviews. \u201cI hate to speak ill of my colleagues,\u201d McCaskill said, complimenting Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s smarts and work on a since-abandoned bipartisan immigration reform bill \u2014 one he would later renounce after it fell apart. \u201cI watched him find that sweet spot of compromise on the immigration reform,\u201d she recalled, \u201cbut then he broke down like a cheap shotgun the minute the right started chewing on his rear end. He [was] like, \u2018What? Me? Immigration reform? Wasn\u2019t me.\u2019\u201d As for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, described by Axelrod as \u201ca unifying figure\u201d in Washington because \u201ceverybody seems to dislike him,\u201d McCaskill suggested it was all part of the election-season game. \u201cI think he wants to be seen as \u2014 he needs to be an outsider this year,\u201d she said, \u201cso the way to be an outsider is to be a jerk to everybody in Washington.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump released Monday a statement calling for U.S. to refuse entry of foreign Muslims Trump's comments put U.S. national security at risk, Pentagon spokesman said without naming him Donald Trump\u2019s statement that Muslims should be banned from entering the United States \u201cdisqualifies\u201d him from being president, the White House spokesman said Tuesday. \u201cThe fact is what Donald Trump said yesterday disqualifies him from serving as president,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in Tuesday\u2019s press briefing. For a White House administration to so heavily weigh in on an opposing party\u2019s nominating contest is a highly unusual step. Earnest noted first that every president must take an oath to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d the U.S. Constitution, and thus, he said, Trump would not qualify. Mayors look to \u2018ban\u2019 Trump from their cities The GOP front-runner on Monday released a statement calling for the U.S. to refuse entry of foreign Muslims. His proposal was met with widespread criticism, including from several candidates in his own party. Trump supporters react to his plan to ban Muslims But Earnest had harsh words for the GOP as a whole, too, saying all GOP presidential candidates have signed a pledge to support whoever is the eventual nominee. \u201cFor Republican candidates for president to stand by their pledge to support Mr. Trump, that in and of itself is disqualifying,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThe question now is about the rest of the Republican Party and whether or not they\u2019re going to be dragged into the dustbin of history with him. And right now the current trajectory is not very good.\u201d Earnest cited the election of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who a reporter said once joked he was like white supremacist David Duke \u201cwithout the baggage,\u201d and a leaked Republican Senate campaign memo instructing candidates how to ride voters\u2019 support for Trump. He also noted that House Speaker Paul Ryan Tuesday said he would vote for Trump if he were the GOP nominee \u2013 though he omitted the fact that Ryan unequivocally rebuked Trump\u2019s comments and said they were \u201cnot who we are as a party\u201d and unconstitutional. The White House spokesman on Tuesday also called Trump a \u201ccarnival barker.\u201d \u201cThe Trump campaign for months now has had a dustbin of history-like quality to it,\u201d Earnest said. Trump on Muslims: The world reacts Secretary of State John Kerry also rebuked Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cI would simply say that nondiscrimination and equal treatment are a pillar of not just American values but of our immigration and  our  admission policies in this country and the State Department remains totally committed to treating all religions with respect and without discrimination,\u201d Kerry said during a press briefing in Paris. Donald Trump: Comments won't 'impact' Dubai golf course He added, \u201cAs I travel around the world, it is clear to me and how both our friends and our adversaries watch and listen to the discourse in the U.S., and I believe that comments such as those that we just heard are not constructive \u2013 and I would say that is putting it diplomatically.\u201d And Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook on Tuesday said \u2013 without hitting the Republican front-runner by name \u2013 that Trump\u2019s comments put U.S. national security at risk. \u201cAnything that bolsters ISIL\u2019s narrative and pits the United States against the Muslim faith is certainly not only contrary to our values but contrary to our national security,\u201d he said, using another name for ISIS. He also said that there are \u201cmany men and women in uniform today of Muslim faith who are serving this country patriotically.\u201d The U.S. is working with Muslim nations right now, Cook noted. \u201cWe want to, in essence, take the fight to ISIL with the help of Muslims around the world.\u201d ",

            "article_content": "Trump has forced candidates and other Republicans to respond to his quotes and actions, dominating the tenor of the campaign His proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States appears to have sparked a level of backlash that could be a tipping point for the willingness of fellow Republicans to criticize him directly Donald Trump has done it again. Less than 24 hours after President Barack Obama aimed to set the tone for the country on a response to the threat of terrorism with an Oval Office address, Trump only needed a press release to cause an uproar with his call for an outright ban on Muslims entering the United States. The billionaire businessman stood defiantly by his statement on Tuesday morning, when he warned that failing to follow his plans would lead to another September 11-style terror attack on U.S. soil. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have many more World Trade Centers if you don\u2019t solve it \u2013 many, many more and probably beyond the World Trade Center,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo in a contentious interview on \u201cNew Day.\u201d The episode is a microcosm of how the 2016 campaign has played out. Trump has consistently forced candidates, state party chairs, senators and conservative pundits to respond to his actions and quotes, however outlandish and improbable. And in turn, they have all struggled with the question of how to deal with the bombastic real estate tycoon who has dominated state and national polls since the summer. Trump\u2019s enduring ability to frame the terms of the debate for the GOP continues to have party leaders fretting he will drive voters to Hillary Clinton, help down-ballot Democrats and cause long-term damage to the Republican brand. Yet, unlike with past provocative statements, Trump appears to have sparked a level of backlash from GOP party leaders and his opponents that could be a tipping point for the willingness of fellow Republicans to criticize him directly and openly. Jeb Bush called Trump \u201cunhinged.\u201d Ted Cruz said it wasn\u2019t his policy. And Dick Cheney, who previously said he would back the Republican nominee even it was Trump, said that Monday\u2019s proposal \u201cgoes against everything we stand for and believe in.\u201d At a press conference on Tuesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan also slammed Trump. \u201cThis is not conservatism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for.\u201d But Trump has been here before \u2013 his blustery statements only seem to have deepened his appeal to a subset of Republican voters, leading to a frustrated party establishment. Predictions of his demise have all proved to be premature. Still, in an unprecedented move, the state party chairs of the three early presidential contests all waded into the fray, criticizing Trump\u2019s idea, suggesting at the very least that Trump has crossed a line they feel could damage the Republican brand. \u201cAfter Obama\u2019s terrible speech, GOP should be focused on Obama/Clinton foreign policy failures,\u201d Jeff Kaufmann, Iowa\u2019s GOP chairman, tweeted. \u201cInstead I\u2019m here to reiterate that our founding principles are stronger than political cynicism,\u201d he added. RELATED: Will any of Obama\u2019s ISIS proposals succeed? Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on Tuesday also criticized Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d Priebus told the Washington Examiner. \u201cWe need to aggressively take on radical Islamic terrorism but not at the expense of our American values.\u201d According to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday, Trump leads his GOP opponents by double digits in Iowa, garnering support from 33% of likely Republican caucus-goers, with Ted Cruz in second at 20%. \u201cAs a conservative who truly cares about religious liberty, Donald Trump\u2019s bad idea and rhetoric send a shiver down my spine,\u201d South Carolina GOP chairman Matt Moore tweeted. \u201cAmerican exceptionalism means always defending our inalienable rights, not attacking them when it\u2019s politically convenient.\u201d Moore did not answer a follow-up question about whether he thinks Trump\u2019s comments are disqualifying and whether he would back him if he wins the nomination. Trump\u2019s proposal, the latest in a string of provocative comments coming in the wake of the terrorist shooting that left 14 dead and 17 wounded in San Bernardino, California, drew cheers and applause from a crowd Monday in Charleston, South Carolina. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,\u201d said Trump reading from a statement his campaign sent out shortly before the rally. \u201cWe have no choice. We have no choice.\u201d RELATED: Trump supporters embrace Muslim travel ban plan Reggie Johnson, 38, who attended Trump\u2019s Charleston rally, agreed with the GOP frontrunner. \u201cI think it should be shut down for now until you find something, a better program in place,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean this is a free country for what\u2019s that\u2019s worth but I think it does need to be shut down until they get a cap on things.\u201d Republicans spent Sunday night condemning Obama\u2019s speech and his approach to combating terrorism. And they spent Monday night talking about Trump, who called for a religious test for who is admitted to the country right after Obama said it was \u201cour responsibility to reject\u201d such a test. Bush\u2019s super PAC, Right to Rise, will begin running an ad called \u201cDesk\u201d in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, that calls Trump \u201cimpulsive and reckless.\u201d While the ad doesn\u2019t specifically mention Trump\u2019s proposal, Bush supporters think he is best positioned to benefit from the shift to national security issues. \u201cTwenty-seven generals and admirals support Jeb Bush,\u201d the ad states. \u201cBecause Jeb has the experience and knowledge to protect your family.\u201d Doug Heye, a veteran GOP strategist and former adviser to the Iowa Republican Party, said Trump\u2019s latest proposal would do more damage than some of his previous controversial comments. \u201cThere are going to be newspapers throughout the world that are going to read \u2018Republican front-runner doesn\u2019t want Muslims to visit America,\u201d said Heye. \u201cIt will make it easier for Democrats to portray the GOP as hostile to any minority. Ultimately, I think Donald Trump is the best asset Hillary Clinton has.\u201d Clinton tweeted that Trump\u2019s proposal was \u201creprehensible, prejudiced and divisive.\u201d  Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s campaign vice-chairwoman, sent out an e-mail to Clinton supporters with the subject matter \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a proud Muslim.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, Trump is leaning into the kind of fear of progress that very well could help him win the nomination,\u201d Abedin wrote. \u201cWe have to be ready to stop him.\u201d RELATED: Clinton explains why she won\u2019t say \u2018radical Islam\u2019 Heye encouraged GOP contenders to condemn Trump\u2019s remarks, suggesting they take a dismissive tone like Bush did on Twitter. He warned that Trump\u2019s comments would be used to weaken the Republican nominee \u2014 even if it\u2019s not Trump \u2013 and will create challenges for Republicans in down-ballot races. \u201cEverything about Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has hurt the Party,\u201d Heye said. \u201cIt hurts the party on a presidential level. It certainly hurts the party on a Senate level as well.\u201d Heye\u2019s remarks run counter to a strategy revealed in a leaked National Republican Senatorial Committee that suggested one way to run with Trump at the top of the ticket is to adopt his issues, if not his tone and rhetoric. Senators were all over the map Monday as they were asked about Trump\u2019s proposal. Some were happy to blast the GOP front-runner, others, like Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst, wanted nothing to do with the question. Ernst, who occupies an influential spot among Iowa Republicans walked away from repeated questions about whether she supported Trump\u2019s call. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to comment on that,\u201d she said when asked by CNN about his comments. Asked again, she replied: \u201cI am not commenting on him.\u201d South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a first-term senator who has been hosting Republican candidates at forums and will be on the ballot in 2016, suggested that Trump\u2019s latest statements were simply par for the course. \u201cA lot of hyperbolic language is used during campaign season,\u201d Scott said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe need to focus on serious solutions to address the real dangers presented by ISIS.\u201d RELATED: San Bernardino shooters were radicalized \u2018for quite some time,\u2019 FBI says Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican who has advised Trump on immigration policy and appeared onstage with him at a rally in Alabama, didn\u2019t want to weigh in. \u201cI\u2019ve been pleased that he took a lot of my ideas in his immigration policy, but I have not endorsed Mr. Trump or anyone else,\u201d Sessions said when asked about Trump\u2019s comments. Pressed on whether he would support Trump\u2019s proposal, Session\u2019s became quiet and stopped talking as he rushed to a Senate elevator. Sen. Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, said that Trump was wrong to call for a ban on all Muslim travel to the U.S. \u201cIf he had changed instead of saying Muslim and said radical Islam, then I would agree with him. But I don\u2019t agree,\u201d Inhofe said, noting that there\u2019s a big difference between banning travel for anyone identified as a \u201cradical Islamic terrorist\u201d and all Muslims. Sen. John McCain, the party\u2019s 2008 nominee and a supporter of Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s long-shot bid was clear: \u201cIt\u2019s just foolishness. It\u2019s been a long series of statements like this that have been just foolish.\u201d McCain and Graham have been among the most critical of Trump, but all to no avail. Graham, for instance, trails Trump in his home state of South Carolina. And when Trump seemed to suggest that McCain, a Vietnam-era POW and the GOP\u2019s 2008 nominee, was not a war hero, it didn\u2019t hurt his standing in the polls. Opponents and party leaders seem to be in search of a referee who can credibly rebuke Trump and block his path to the nomination. \u201cIs the RNC still moving forward with a fundraiser featuring Trump? Asking for a nation\u2026.\u201d tweeted John Weaver, a John Kasich adviser. RELATED: American Muslims accuse Donald Trump of leading \u2018lynch mob\u2019 According to Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the RNC, Trump won\u2019t be at a Wednesday fundraiser in New York. But that decision was made well before Trump\u2019s latest comments, according to Spicer. Spicer didn\u2019t respond to e-mails about Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims. Nervous about what a third party Trump bid would do to the party\u2019s general election chances, the RNC moved to officially bring Trump into the GOP tent. He publicly signed a pledge saying that he would run as a Republican at the RNC\u2019s urging. Yet his entire campaign has been a rejection of the RNC\u2019s rebranding efforts. We need a leader that will unite us, not divide us @realDonaldTrump - Sign if you agree https://t.co/cdx5VrKtMt pic.twitter.com/G9F2XBMQDF In a 2013 autopsy, the RNC argued that to become a winning party at the presidential level, the party must be a more welcoming party and \u201cstop talking to itself.\u201d But like no other candidate, Trump knows his audience, repeatedly doubling down on statements that have brought criticism from party elders. His success highlights the competing factions of a leaderless party, searching for an identity. Republicans sought to strip the conservative label from Trump \u2014 New Hampshire GOP leader Jennifer Horn, called his ideas \u201cun-Republican.\u201d RELATED: Why some conservatives say Trump talk is facist Cheney weighed in as well. \u201cI think this whole notion that somehow we can just say no more Muslims, just ban a whole religion, goes against everything we stand for and believe in,\u201d he said on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show. \u201cI mean, religious freedom has been a very important part of our history and where we came from.\u201d Bill Kristol, who tweeted that he has come to loathe Trump for \u201csoiling the robe of conservatism and dragging it through the dust,\u201d said in an email to CNN that the RNC is \u201cpretty helpless in situations like this.\u201d But with Trump\u2019s latest comments, he said that the stakes are now higher on Trump\u2019s opponents, who by now have plenty of practice in criticizing him. \u201cOther GOP candidates will denounce this,\u201d Kristol tweeted. \u201cWill they also say they couldn\u2019t support him if somehow he becomes nominee?\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond, Tom LoBianco, Sara Murray, Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this story.",

Lindsey Graham said it\u2019s time for Republicans to rebuke presidential hopeful Donald Trump, urging his party to tell Trump to \u201cgo to hell.\u201d \u201cYou know how you make America great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell,\u201d Graham said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Tuesday, picking up on the GOP front-runner\u2019s famous slogan, \u201cmake America great again.\u201d The South Carolina Republican was responding to Trump\u2019s statement released Monday calling for the U.S. to ban all Muslims from entering the country. RELATED: Trump warns: \u2018Many more World Trade Centers\u2019 \u201cHe\u2019s a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot,\u201d Graham told Alisyn Camerota. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t represent my party. He doesn\u2019t represents the values that the men and women who wear the uniform are fighting for. \u2026 He\u2019s the ISIL man of the year.\u201d Graham said Trump\u2019s rhetoric benefits ISIS in helping them recruit people to their cause. He said having traveled to the Middle East 36 times as a lawmaker and in the Air Force reserve, he knows the troops and diplomats on the front lines are very concerned. \u201cWhat Mr. Trump is doing \u2013 and I don\u2019t think he has a clue about anything. He\u2019s just just trying to get his numbers up and get the biggest reaction he can,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe is helping the enemy of this nation. He is empowering radical Islam. And if he knew anything about the world at all, you would know that most Muslims reject this ideology.\u201d Graham said that what the U.S. needs to do is embrace the \u201c99%\u201d of Muslims who reject radical, violent extremism and have died \u201cby the thousands\u201d trying to fight it, and it needs to invest in the Middle East and giving people and women opportunity there. \u201cThat\u2019s how you win the war. A hopeful life versus a glorious death. And what Mr. Trump is doing is undercutting everything we stand for,\u201d Graham said. \u201cGoing to a military high school, Donald, is not military service. You\u2019ve never worn the uniform. \u2026 So knock it off. You\u2019re putting people at risk.\u201d Trump has been leading the Republican primary in nearly every poll, recently hitting 36% in a CNN survey. Graham has been languishing at the bottom of the race, failing to hit even 1% in some polling. The senator has become increasingly outspoken about the direction his party is headed, trying to position himself as the voice of reason even as his campaign struggles. Graham said it\u2019s a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d of American history that there has always been an appetite for bigotry and exclusion, but a presidential candidate should \u201cbring us together.\u201d Graham also called out other presidential candidates for not being stronger against Trump, saying the entire party needs to speak out against the mogul. He specifically spotlighted his fellow GOP presidential candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, for not condemning Trump strongly enough. \u201cThis is not a policy debate, Ted,\u201d Graham said. On Monday, Cruz said Trump\u2019s positions are not his own when asked about the call to ban Muslims and described his own proposals to place a moratorium on refugees entering the country from areas with strong footholds for terrorists. Graham said it was time for the party to reject Trump even if it hurts them in the long run. Trump has left the door open to mounting an independent bid for president if he doesn\u2019t win the Republican nomination, a possibility that spurred the Republican National Committee to have each candidate sign a pledge to support any eventual Republican nominee. \u201cI\u2019d rather lose without Donald Trump than try to win with with him,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI wish he would leave the party. I don\u2019t care if he runs as an independent. If we lose the 2016 election. So be it. \u2026 I want to be in a category of 1% who said \u2018B.S., this is not who we are at a party, this is not who we are as a nation.\u2019 And I\u2019m calling on Ted Cruz, you\u2019re trying to have it both ways here.\u201d It\u2019s the second time in less than a week that Graham has had harsh words for Cruz, who he also criticized along with Trump at the Republican Jewish Coalition presidential forum in Washington, last week for being too hardline on immigration. Graham said Cruz is trying to pick up Trump supporters for his own campaign and is ignoring a \u201cmoral imperative\u201d to speak out against the rhetoric. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to get all the Trump people when Trump falls. He\u2019s trying to get all the Carson people when they fall,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is be a president worthy of a great nation and a great party. So this doesn\u2019t cut it for me. This is not a policy debate, Ted. This is about you and us and our character as a party. Up your game. Condemn it, because it needs to be condemned.\u201d RELATED: After call to ban Muslims, is the GOP ready to unite against Trump?",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has 33% support is Iowa, followed by Ted Cruz at 20% with Ben Carson at 16%, poll says Hillary Clinton leads Democrats, with 54% compared to 36% for Bernie Sanders Donald Trump\u2019s support continues to grow among those who say they are likely to participate in February\u2019s Iowa presidential caucuses and Ted Cruz is on the rise while Ben Carson loses ground in the state, a new CNN/ORC Poll finds. Overall, Trump has 33% support among likely GOP caucusgoers, followed by Cruz at 20% with Carson at 16%, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 11% and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 4%. The new poll shows Trump up 8 points, Cruz up 9, while Carson has faded by 7 points, compared with the last CNN/ORC poll, conducted in late October and early November. The poll finds a markedly different landscape among potential GOP caucusgoers than another Iowa poll released Monday by Monmouth University. The difference between the two seems to stem primarily from sampling. READ: The complete CNN/ORC poll results The Monmouth poll interviewed a sample drawn from registered voter lists that primarily comprised those who had voted in state-level Republican primary elections in previous election years. Among those voters, Monmouth found Cruz and Rubio ahead of Trump and Carson. Among voters who were not regular GOP primary voters, however, the poll found Trump ahead, similar to the CNN/ORC poll\u2019s finding. The CNN/ORC Poll drew its sample from Iowa adults, asking those reached about their intention to participate in their caucus, interest in news about the caucuses, and past participation patterns to determine who would be a likely voter. But still, Trump\u2019s lead holds even among only those voters who express the most interest in attending the caucus or the most regular past participation in presidential caucuses. Among those in the CNN/ORC poll who say they definitely plan to attend the caucuses and are more interested in news about them than any other news story \u2013 a group which represents approximately 8% of Iowa adults \u2013 Trump\u2019s lead grows to a 42% to 23% advantage over Cruz, with Rubio at 11% and Carson at 9%. And among those who say they have participated in almost all of the caucuses for which they have been eligible \u2013 about 10% of Iowa adults \u2013 Trump leads 38% to 21% for Cruz, with Carson at 12% and Rubio at 11%. One group that remains a challenge for Trump and which makes up a large share of Iowa\u2019s usual set of Republican caucusgoers is white evangelicals. Among that group, 26% back Cruz, 24% Trump, 20% Carson and 12% Rubio. In last month\u2019s poll, Trump trailed Carson 31% to 20% among white evangelicals, with Cruz at 15% and Rubio at 11%. Trump is increasingly seen by likely GOP caucusgoers as the Republican with the best chance to win the 2016 general election: 42% say Trump has the best shot, followed by 17% for Cruz and 11% each for Carson and Rubio. Last month, 33% thought Trump had the best chance to win followed by Carson at 25% and Rubio at 17%. Cruz is up 9 points on this question. As is the case nationally, Trump holds big advantages as the candidate more trusted to handle the economy and illegal immigration, with smaller though still substantial leads on handling ISIS and foreign policy (30% Trump to 21% Cruz, 13% Rubio and 9% Bush). On foreign policy, Trump has increased his advantage on that issue since the early-November poll, when 18% said they thought Trump would do the best job and 14% each Cruz, Rubio and Bush, with Carson at 11%. But Trump\u2019s advantage on foreign policy and handling ISIS is larger than his edge on handling the responsibilities of being commander-in-chief. There, Trump comes in at 28% with Cruz a close second with 22%, Carson follows at 13% with Bush at 10% and Rubio at 9%. Trump remains somewhat vulnerable on social issues, where Carson (21%) is most trusted, but here, too, Trump has increased his support. In November\u2019s poll, 13% said Trump would do the best job on social issues, that\u2019s risen to 19%. Cruz follows Carson and Trump on this question with 17%. Trump and Cruz are also nearly even when caucusgoers are asked who best represents the values of Republicans like yourself (25% Trump to 22% Cruz, Carson fades 7 points to 18%). On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton maintains an 18-point lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 54% to 36%. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley has 4%. The gender gap between Clinton and Sanders has narrowed in the last month, with both men and women breaking significantly in the former secretary of state\u2019s favor (51% Clinton to 40% Sanders among men, 57% Clinton to 34% Sanders among women; last month it was 48% Clinton to 44% Sanders among men and 62% Clinton to 31% Sanders among women). Clinton\u2019s edge on handling economic issues is smaller in Iowa than it is nationally, 47% in Iowa say they think Clinton would do the best job handling the economy while 42% say they trust Sanders most, while our recent national poll found Clinton holding a 58% to 31% advantage on the same issue. Likewise, Iowa\u2019s likely caucusgoers are more likely to think that Sanders would do the most to help the middle class (50%) than to say Clinton would (43%), a question that split national Democrats almost evenly (47% Clinton to 44% Sanders). Likely Democratic caucus-goers remain more focused on the economy than on terrorism or foreign policy. The poll finds 38% say the economy will be most important when deciding their vote for president, compared with 13% who cite terrorism and 10% who name foreign policy their top issue. Among Republican caucus-goers, about as many say terrorism is their top issue (27%) as cite the economy (29%). The Iowa poll finds Clinton remains dominant on health care, race relations, foreign policy issues and as having the best chance to win. She also holds a better than 3-to-1 lead as the candidate who would best handle ISIS. But the two are about evenly matched on which better represents the values of \u201cDemocrats like yourself,\u201d with 46% naming Clinton, 44% Sanders. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone November 28-December 6 among 2,003 adult residents of Iowa, including interviews with 552 likely Republican presidential caucusgoers and 442 likely Democratic presidential caucusgoers. Results for likely Democratic caucusgoers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 points, it is 4 points for likely Republican caucusgoers.",

            "article_content": "A new CNN/ORC national poll finds 36% of Republican pick Donald Trump as their 2016 presidential candidate Ted Cruz is in second place, followed by Ben Carson and Marco Rubio Donald Trump is once again alone at the top of the Republican field, according to the latest CNN/ORC Poll, with 36% of registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independents behind him, while his nearest competitor trails by 20 points. Three candidates cluster behind Trump in the mid-teens, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 16%, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 14% and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 12%. All other candidates have the support of less than 5% of GOP voters in the race for the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for president. Carson (down 8 points since October), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (down 5 points to 3%) and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (down 4 points to 1%) have lost the most ground since the last CNN/ORC poll, conducted in mid-October. Cruz (up 12 points) and Trump (up 9 points) are the greatest beneficiaries of those declines. Rubio is also up slightly, gaining 4 points \u2013 an increase within the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error \u2013 since the last CNN/ORC poll. Republicans brace for a long battle against Trump Republican voters are most sharply divided by education. Among those GOP voters who hold college degrees, the race is a close contest between the top four contenders, with Cruz slightly in front at 22%, Carson and Rubio tied at 19% and Trump at 18%. Among those without college degrees, Trump holds a runaway lead: 46% support the businessman, compared with 12% for Cruz, 11% for Carson and just 8% for Rubio. Several other recent polls have shown Trump reclaiming a solid lead atop the GOP field after several weeks of near parity with Carson. But the new poll finds the businessman with both his broadest support and his widest lead in any national live-interviewer telephone poll since he announced his candidacy in June. The poll reflects Trump\u2019s dominance over the rest of the field on the issues voters deem most important to them. He holds massive margins over other Republicans as the candidate most trusted to handle the economy (at 55%, Trump stands 46 percentage points over his nearest competitor), the federal budget (51%, up 41 points), illegal immigration (48%, up 34 points), ISIS (46%, up 31 points) and foreign policy (30%, up 13 points). Looking at those Republicans who consider each issue to be \u201cextremely important\u201d to their vote, Trump\u2019s standing on each issue is even stronger. Among those Republican voters who call the economy extremely important, for example, 60% say they trust Trump to handle that issue. Among immigration voters, 55% trust Trump on the issue. On foreign policy, Trump inches up to 32%, and among those who call terrorism an extremely important issue, 49% say they trust Trump most on ISIS. At 3% in the polls, Jeb Bush in free-fall The poll was conducted before the shootings in San Bernardino, California, on Wednesday, carried out by a man reported to have been radicalized and his wife. More generally, about 4 in 10 Republicans say Trump is the candidate who would be most effective at solving the country\u2019s problems (42% name Trump, 14% Carson, 12% Cruz, 10% Rubio) and could best handle the responsibilities of being commander-in-chief (37% Trump, 16% Cruz, 11% Carson and 10% Rubio). And a majority of Republican voters say they see Trump as the candidate with the best chances to win the general election next November (52% say Trump has the best chances there, compared with 15% for Rubio, 11% for Cruz and 10% for Carson). On immigration, an issue that has been a focal point of Trump\u2019s campaign, most Americans say the government should not attempt to deport all people living in the country illegally (63%), and even more say such a mass deportation wouldn\u2019t be possible (81%). About half say such an effort would be harmful to the economy (47%), while about 3 in 10 say it would help (29%). Among Republicans, a narrow majority (53%) think the government should try to deport all of the estimated 11 million immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally, but most think it wouldn\u2019t ultimately be possible to achieve (73%). Republicans are more likely than others to see a deportation effort as helpful to the economy (44% think it would help, 30% that it would hurt). There\u2019s a sharp divide among Republican voters on these questions about deportation between those who back Trump and those who do not. Among Trump supporters, 67% say the government should attempt to deport all people living in the country illegally, while just 39% of Republican voters backing other candidates agree. Still, even among Trump\u2019s supporters, most say it wouldn\u2019t be possible to deport all those living in the  U.S. illegally (55%). Jeb Bush: I will \u2018whup\u2019 Hillary Clinton Republican voters remain more enthusiastic about voting than their Democratic counterparts, but the gains in enthusiasm that had emerged through October appear to have stalled. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone November 27 through December 1 among a random national sample of 1,020 adults. Interviews were conducted with 930 registered voters, including 445 who are Republicans or independents who lean toward the Republican Party. For results among Republican and Republican-leaning voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "GOP presidential candidates addressed the Republican Jewish Coalition in Washington on Thursday Candidates took questions from attendees Billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson is expected to spend millions of dollars backing a GOP candidate Republican presidential contenders descended on Washington on Thursday for a conference that was slated to focus on foreign policy but took place in the shadow of another mass shooting in the United States. The candidates planned to use their appearances before the Republican Jewish Coalition to boost their pro-Israel bona fides. But the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California \u2013 the deadliest since the 2012 massacre in Newtown, Connecticut \u2013 once again inserts the issues of violence, security and gun control into the 2016 race. The day opened with a moment of silence for the victims, and the first speaker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, held another one at the opening of his speech. He also said the murders show the nation is \u201cat war\u201d with terrorism. \u201cAt this point the details of what happened in San Bernardino is still unclear,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAll of us are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism here at home.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio was slightly more measured in his remarks, and only briefly touched on the shooting. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all the facts yet, but we certainly have learned some facts that are concerning,\u201d Rubio said, saying his \u201cprayers\u201d were with the victims. RELATED: Trump praises police response to shooting that Carson calls \u2018hate crime\u2019 In contrast, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is languishing at the bottom of the polls, devoted most of the beginning of his speech to attacking Cruz for his hard-line positions, telling the audience he guarantees Republicans will lose the election with hard right immigration policies and opposing exceptions to abortion restrictions for cases of rape. \u201cNot the speech you thought you were going to hear, right?\u201d Graham said. \u201cNot the speech I thought I was going to give.\u201d Still, the vast majority of the conference will serve as a forum for the candidates to make their foreign policy pitches before the RJC, a group of influential conservative Jews looking for a candidate strong on Israel and for an active U.S. role in the Middle East. With the Paris terrorist attacks and crisis in Syria putting national security in sharp focus in the race, candidates\u2019 performances may speak volumes about their viability with the Republican electorate. Cruz and Graham both still dedicated a significant portion of their speeches to supporting Israel, opposing Iran and fighting terrorism. Special attention Thursday was on GOP front-runner Trump and two senators rising in the polls: Rubio and Cruz. Trump led the new Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning with 27%; Rubio and Cruz are at 17% and 16%, respectively, with Carson also at 16% as he continues to fall. RELATED: Donald Trump leads as Ben Carson fades Trump announced Wednesday night a planned trip to Israel, and spent most of his speech making jokes about his familiarity with the crowd. \u201cI know everybody in this audience,\u201d he joked at one point after recognizing an associate in the front row. But he also conceded that the room was not his chosen crowd, and got boos from the audience when he refused to take a position on whether Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of Israel. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to support me even though I\u2019m going to be the best thing that ever happened to Israel,\u201d Trump had said earlier. \u201cAnd I know why you\u2019re not going to support me, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want your money.\u201d In contrast, the Florida and Texas senators are both comfortable speaking about foreign policy and have historically pro-Israel stances, with Cruz making targeting evangelical voters a priority, especially as Carson has struggled of late, including on foreign policy issues. Both were clear audience favorites for their speeches Thursday morning. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was unable to make his speaking time at the forum due to votes in the Senate. All the other senators had morning speaking slots. The senators are also vying for support of Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate expected to spend millions of dollars backing a pro-Israel presidential candidate. Adelson\u2019s spokesman Andy Abboud said the billionaire will not be in attendance. The audience is larger than just those in the room, however. Gallup polls show that 83% of Republicans side with Israel over Palestinians, up steadily from 53% in 2001, and evangelical voters in particular favor a pro-Israel foreign policy. Thus far in the race, those themes have mostly played out as GOP candidates have railed against President Barack Obama and also his nuclear weapons deal with Iran. RELATED: Donald Trump: I\u2019m going to Israel Each candidate gets 30 minutes, which includes opportunities for questions. Tevi Troy, president of the American Health Policy Institute and a former George W. Bush administration official, said he expects Trump will have to show knowledge and mastery of foreign policy in order to impress the well-informed audience. Cruz and Rubio will have to live up to expectations. Carson had a chance rehabilitate himself on the foreign policy front. The rest of the candidates will be looking to have a breakout performance that could send them back into the top tier. Jeb Bush, for instance, will come out strongly in support of Israel and highlight his long track record of supporting the Jewish state, said Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a co-chairman of Bush\u2019s campaign. Carly Fiorina has often referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as her \u201cfriend\u201d on the trail. And New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will seek to avoid a repeat of his speech last year to the group, in which he ruffled feathers by referring to \u201coccupied territories,\u201d as he continues to make the case that he is the most experienced candidate in the race on national security. Carson, however, failed to impress the crowd, and delivered an uncharacteristic written address. Carson said he would be reading his remarks in order to make sure he made all the points he wanted to, but the wooden speech that was heavy on Israeli history and statistics failed to strike a chord with the audience. He also several times throughout the speech failed to correctly pronounce Hamas, the Palestinian terror group that is one of Israel\u2019s biggest adversaries. At one point, he described the Middle East as \u201creally complicated.\u201d \u201cHe missed a big opportunity,\u201d said former White House press secretary and RJC board member Ari Fleischer. \u201cHe read a good speech but the way he came across, it just doesn\u2019t work, you can\u2019t read a big lengthy policy wonky speech like that \u2013 you have to make an emotional connection with the audience and he failed.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t advance his goal of showing any foreign policy,\u201d Fleischer added. As for Trump, Fleischer said he entertained the crowd, but didn\u2019t impress. \u201cTrump\u2019s speech was wildly entertaining, it was enjoyable, but he  comes across as if he lacks knowledge and lacks substance and doesn\u2019t know any of the nuance of the issues,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cFor a group that wants to hear his position on an undivided Jerusalem and the \u201967 borders, he either didn\u2019t have a position because he doesn\u2019t know the issues or he made a mistake by not saying it.\u201d The Paris attacks have put the spotlight again on ISIS and international terrorism, and that will be reflected at Thursday\u2019s event. \u201cThere\u2019s no question\u201d that the Paris attacks have made the RJC forum even more important, said Cantor, who was the highest ranking Republican Jew before losing a GOP primary in 2014. \u201cWe are in the process of nominating and electing a commander in chief. The gravity of the threat that continues to present itself as far as Israel is concerned reflects the gravity of the threat to the free world.\u201d For her part, Fiorina focused on the Bernadino shooting, and used remarks lifted from her stump speech to pitch to the group. \u201cHillary Clinton was tweeting about gun control while we learned that radicalized Islamic terrorists were building pipe bombs,\u201d the former Hewlett-Packard CEO said, one of the final 2016ers to speak, adding later. \u201cThe murder the mayhem that we see unfolding in Paris in Beiruit, San Bernardino are a direct consequence of this administration\u2019s polices. We cannot lead from behind.\u201d Winning over the room will have more implications than amplifying a candidate\u2019s image: It will have an impact on the money, as well. \u201cThe RJC is an excellent and skilled organization at bundling dollars in favor of preferred candidates,\u201d Troy said. \u201cThis is going to be a chance for candidates to talk candidly in real terms about foreign policy after Paris, in the context of Syria, and I think as a whole Republican candidates are going to be able to contrast their understanding of threats facing the country in contrast to the last seven years.\u201d",

Lindsey Graham may be languishing in the bottom of GOP presidential primary polls, but on Thursday he delivered a sharp rebuke of his GOP opponents before a Republican Jewish audience. \u201cThe one thing I can tell you is that what Mr. Trump\u2019s saying about how to handle this war is empowering the enemy,\u201d Graham said, referring to GOP front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s recent assertion that the U.S. should \u201cgo after\u201d the families of terrorists. \u201cISIL loves Donald Trump because he is giving them an opportunity to bring people their way,\u201d Graham said during a gathering with reporters following his formal speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. Also among the digs: He guaranteed that Republicans will lose the race for the White House if they nominate his opponents like Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz. The South Carolinian spoke just after the Texas Republican senator, and declared himself so frustrated with Cruz\u2019s speech that he deviated from his prepared remarks. \u201cNot the speech you thought you were going to hear, right?\u201d he said. \u201cNot the speech I thought I was going to give.\u201d Graham launched into an attack on Cruz and Trump right from the top of his remarks, not starting with the San Bernardino shootings the day before as most candidates did. Could Trump win the GOP nomination? He took issue with Cruz\u2019s preceding remarks that Republicans need to vote in strength, and low turnout is why the party failed to win in 2008 and 2012. \u201cHow many of you believe we\u2019re losing elections because we\u2019re not hard-ass enough on immigration?\u2019 Graham asked the crowd, to light applause. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t agree with you. He said the party is losing Hispanic voters and women, and needs to be more practical about who it elects as its candidate for president. \u201cI think Donald Trump is destroying the Republican Party,\u201d Graham said, to a smattering of applause. Trump is leading the field at nearly 30% in most polls \u2013 Graham rarely hits the 1% mark in polling. Graham appealed to the Jewish Republican crowd \u2013 which tends to be more moderate on social issues and focused on supporting Israel and tough foreign policy. He compared his opponents\u2019 rhetoric on illegal immigration to the Holocaust. \u201cNow it\u2019s not self-deportation, it\u2019s forced deportation,\u201d he said, referring to Mitt Romney\u2019s much-assailed position in 2012. \u201cWe\u2019re literally going to round them up \u2013 That sound familiar to you?\u201d He continued: \u201cYou think you\u2019re going to win an election with that kind of garbage \u2013undercut everything you\u2019ve worked for?\u201d He also knocked Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for supporting banning abortion even in cases of rape or incest, saying the party will lose young women \u201cin droves\u201d with that position. And Graham  mocked Cruz\u2019s stump speech line about the Obama administration fighting a group on nuns in the courts over its contraceptive mandate, saying the general election will become about the rape exception, instead. \u201cYou really want to win this election? Start taking everything that we say seriously and push back when we make absolutely no sense,\u201d Graham implored. \u201cAfter Mr. Cruz, I\u2019m going to talk to you about winning an election.\u201d Trump on terrorists: \u2018Take out their families\u2019 He did mention foreign policy, which the crowd expects to hear in heavy amounts from the entire field on Thursday. But he got a strongly positive reaction from the crowd in citing his extensive track record as a foreign policy hawk. \u201cWant to talk a little bit about foreign policy?\u201d he said. \u201cDo you even think I need to talk about you about my support for Israel?\u201d Amid the applause, some audience members could be heard saying \u201cNo.\u201d He asked the crowd to help Graham \u201cstay in this race\u201d so that he can be a voice of reason. \u201cYou know how you win this election? You don\u2019t lose it,\u201d he said. All the GOP candidates are speaking at the forum on Thursday. CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Top GOP Senate strategists outline Trump candidacy in seven-page internal memo The leaked memo refers to Trump as a Trump a \"misguided missile\" The campaign arm for Senate Republicans is imagining a world in which Donald Trump is the party\u2019s standard-bearer for the 2016 election, with a leaked memo noting, \u201cTrump could win.\u201d In a seven-page internal memo, the National Republican Senatorial Committee\u2019s executive director Ward Baker lays out a game plan for Republicans running for Senate in 2016 to ride Trump\u2019s populist fervor while dodging the brash billionaire\u2019s controversy-prone candidacy should he win the party\u2019s presidential nomination. \u201cTrump has risen because voters see him as authentic, independent, direct, firm, \u2014 and believe he can\u2019t be bought. These are the same character traits our candidates should be advancing in 2016. That\u2019s Trump lesson #1,\u201d Baker writes in the memo, obtained by CNN and first reported by The Washington Post. \u201cWe should prepare for 2016, by understanding the environment and recognizing the Trump phenomenon.\u201d Republican Party elites and elected officials have privately fretted in recent weeks over Trump\u2019s continued front-runner status in the GOP presidential contest, concerned that Trump, who has made divisive and controversial statements about Mexican immigrants, Muslims and others, could be a liability for the party in the general election. Now, the NRSC memo appears to shed light on the party\u2019s thinking as Trump\u2019s odds of winning the nomination have waxed, and not waned, with Baker noting that \u201cTrump could win.\u201d Reacting Thursday to the memo, Trump told CNN that he was \u201cvery flattered.\u201d \u201cThey put out a memo saying they think I\u2019m going to win \u2013 basically, so I am very flattered by the memo,\u201d Trump said. But Baker also painted Trump in a more unforgiving light in the memo, calling Trump a \u201cmisguided missile\u201d and urging 2016 GOP senate candidates to \u201crun your own race\u201d and not \u201cget drawn into every Trump statement and every Trump dust-up.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s face facts. Trump says what\u2019s on his mind and that\u2019s a problem. Our candidates will have to spend full time defending him or condemning him if that continues,\u201d Baker writes in the memo. And the memo makes particular note of Trump\u2019s at-times controversial comments about women, which have included calling fellow GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina too ugly to be elected and suggesting Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly was menstruating when she asked him a tough question at the first Republican presidential debate. \u201cHouston, we have a problem: Donald Trump has said some wacky things about women,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cCandidates shouldn\u2019t go near this ground other than to say that your wife or daughter is offended by what Trump said. We do not want to re-engage the \u2018war on women\u2019 fight so isolate Trump on this issue by offering a quick condemnation of it.\u201d Trump refuted that assertion on Thursday, saying he has \u201cmore respect for women than anyone would understand\u201d and pointed to his rise in the polls in the weeks following the terrorist attacks in Paris. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get people jobs and I\u2019m going to protect people. And that\u2019s why whenever there\u2019s a tragedy, everything goes up, my numbers go way up because we have no strength in this country we have weak, sad politicians,\u201d Trump told CNN. But Baker also urges the Senate candidates whose names will appear on the ballot below Trump\u2019s to capitalize on some of Trump\u2019s populist-themed message and his results-driven authenticity. The memo notes that \u201cTrump can hit the right cord,\u201d connecting with voters\u2019 concerns over issues like China and the U.S.\u2019s immigration system and calls on candidates to attack Chinese espionage and trade imbalance as Trump has, but to avoid some of Trump\u2019s \u201cmore extreme positioning\u201d on controversial issues like immigration, where Trump has staked out a hardline stance. And if there\u2019s one thing Republican candidates shouldn\u2019t do, according to Baker, it\u2019s attacking Trump should he become the Republican nominee. Instead, he advises striving for a delicate balance. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to depress the GOP vote. Spending full time attacking our own nominee will ensure that the GOP vote is depressed. That will only serve to topple the GOP candidates at every level,\u201d Baker writes. \u201cMaintain the right amount of independence, but avoid piling on the nominee.\u201d The memo appears to be one of several internal documents Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm has drafted in preparation for the 2016 election and the different candidates who could emerge at the top of the party\u2019s ticket \u2013 a factor that is hugely important to congressional candidates running in a presidential year. \u201cIt would be malpractice for the senatorial committee not to prepare our candidates for every possible Republican and Democrat nominee and election scenario,\u201d NRSC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said in a statement. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Gloria Borger contributed to this report.",

Texas had initially asked for a 30-day delay, something that could have potentially put off oral arguments and a ruling until after the November election. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli suggested the shorter extension instead. The issue of timing is critical for the administration because a lower court has blocked the programs from going forward. The White House is hopeful the Supreme Court will allow millions of undocumented immigrants to apply for programs that could make them eligible for work authorization and some associated benefits. The order posted on the Court\u2019s docket indicates that Texas\u2019 brief should be filed by December 29 instead of the previous deadline of December 21. The Court still has to meet and vote on whether it will take up the case, and other delays could arise, but today\u2019s action by the Court increases the chances that the case could  be heard and decided this term. Immigrant rights groups \u2013 fearful that the case might be pushed off until next term and decided after the presidential election, expressed relief by the Court\u2019s decision. \u201cImmigrant families have waited too long already for their day in Court and we are delighted that this gives the chance for the Court to hear the case this term,\u201d said Karen Tumlin of the National Immigration Law Center.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's presidential campaign unharmed by most controversies Trump has a real chance of capturing some early voting states By conventional political wisdom, Donald Trump should be a presidential has-been by now. But two weeks ahead of the final Republican debate of the year and two months before the first votes of the primary season are cast, Trump\u2019s rambunctious presidential campaign is thriving. Controversies and outrages that would topple ordinary political candidates leave Trump without a scratch. In fact, the Republican front-runner seems to be deliberately stoking the outrage among his supporters that sustains his campaign \u2014 whether it\u2019s by embracing unsubstantiated claims that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheered the fiery collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, or by advancing his disputed charge that the Obama administration wants to ship 200,000 Syrian refugees to the United States who could include terrorists. In a season of political anger, a pundit-confounding, anti-establishment wave has lifted political newcomers like Trump and left conventional candidates like Jeb Bush and John Kasich floundering. And, in the absence of a unified GOP establishment opposition, the fractured, bloated GOP field gives Trump a real chance of capturing early voting contests that are the gateway to a sustained bid for the nomination. \u201cI think he is going to continue to surprise people,\u201d said Bill Miller, a veteran Republican political consultant from Texas. \u201cThe question about Trump is: Can he go the distance? We will see. But I would not sell him short,\u201d said Miller, who believes  the tumultuous Republican race could go all the way to the party\u2019s national convention in Cleveland next July. READ: Trump on meeting with black pastors: \u2018I saw love in that room\u2019 Should Trump manage to rack up multiple primary wins and hundreds of delegates, the 2016 election would recast long-held conventions of the rhythms of presidential nominating contests and could even reshape American politics itself. Pundits, GOP party officials and campaign reporters have for months expected the surge of the anti-politicians to crest and for traditional hopefuls to rise to the top of the polls, a pattern familiar from previous campaigns. Who's running for President? But surveys have repeatedly shown roughly half the Republican primary electorate spurning candidates preferred by party elites in favor of Trump, retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson and, fleetingly, businesswoman Carly Fiorina \u2013 driven by visceral hostility to Washington, establishment GOP leaders and even the idea of governance itself. Trump in particular has demonstrated remarkable staying power. In the latest national poll of the Republican race, by ABC News and the Washington Post, he led with 32%, followed by Carson at 22%. Still, as the first-in-the-nation caucuses and primaries loom closer \u2014 and as more voters tune in \u2014 the challenges and pitfalls facing Trump and Carson intensify. To start, polling this far out is still not a foolproof predictor of who will turn out to vote and who those voters will choose. \u201cI don\u2019t think any political scientist would have thought in November that Trump would still be ahead in the polls,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless, a political scientist at American University. \u201cThat said, most of us would say it\u2019s still pretty early,\u201d she continued. \u201cUntil those first votes are counted, we don\u2019t know what his ground game is.\u201d While Trump has dominated polls and media coverage of the race for months, the only real test of whether a political neophyte can build the kind of precinct-by-precinct machine normally required to win in Iowa and New Hampshire is on voting day itself. Many political scientists, who base their analysis on long-term trends and data rather than daily ups and downs, say it is too soon to determine whether Trump or Carson will open a new chapter of campaign lore or whether political precedent built up over multiple elections, in which an establishment front-runner emerges and outsiders drop off, will prevail. \u201cI am uncertain that we are yet at a place where we should say the pattern of history is about to be broken,\u201d said John Sides, a George Washington University professor. \u201cI am a little bit cautious about saying this is the year of the outsider and everything we thought we knew about primaries has to go out of the window because this time is different.\u201d READ: Christie on Trump\u2019s 9/11 claims: \u2018It\u2019s just wrong\u2019 Still, Trump has already won a significant victory \u2013 he has dominated a campaign in which many pundits expected him to be merely a fast-rising, fast-fading sideshow. Showing a mastery of the media, flouting political correctness and identifying and then harnessing outrage seething in the Republican base more effectively than any other candidate, Trump has led national polls since July. In the process, his jeremiads on immigration and Syrian refugees have dragged his rivals further right than they might have wished to go. And he\u2019s proven he is no shooting-star outsider like Michele Bachmann or Herman Cain in 2012. Though Carson\u2019s ascent has slowed in recent weeks amid questions about his biography and foreign policy credentials, Trump remains dominant. In first-in-the-nation Iowa, for instance, Trump leads Carson, and their combined slice of the vote is between 49% and 45% in most polls. And there are signs that what Trump calls his \u201csilent majority\u201d \u2013 which many others consider an angry, vocal block of the Republican electorate \u2013 is standing firm behind him. A CNN/ORC Poll published on November 6, for instance, found that among Iowans who have definitely decided whom to support in that state\u2019s caucuses, Trump led with 39%, ahead of Carson at 22%, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 14% and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 8%. But despite Trump\u2019s poll numbers \u2013 which often are his focus for a large portion of his stump speech \u2013 elections are not won in the calendar year before anyone votes. And his campaign will soon face real tests. There is, for example, strong evidence that despite the huge viewing figures piled up by televised presidential debates and a rollicking Republican campaign, many GOP voters have yet to make up their minds. That means that polling numbers two months out from the early state voting contests may not be as solid as they appear. A Monmouth University Iowa Poll in late October found that 19% of Republican voters were completely set on their choice of candidate. Monmouth found a similar story in South Carolina this month, where 17% of likely primary voters in that early state were settled on their pick. Another 39% said they had a strong preference but were willing to look at other candidates. READ: A tale of two Donald Trumps The nominating process, particularly in caucus states like Iowa, relies on a high level of organization and self-motivation of voters to participate on election night. Some observers question whether those attracted by Trump\u2019s denunciations of the political establishment and furious at government will ultimately be sufficiently committed to brave chilly winter temperatures to participate in the ritual of voting. \u201cTrump and Carson are banking on the fact that people who are so turned off by politics are going to rally and get behind them. But political scientists have long known that people who are turned off by politics don\u2019t engage (in) the system,\u201d said Lawless. Still, Miller, who believes that ultimately, Rubio may be the best bet to win the Republican nomination, nevertheless argued that \u201canger is a pretty strong motivator in politics,\u201d and that Trump was doing a good job of keeping the pot boiling among his base of supporters. \u201cI think the most important thing for them is to stay angry. As long they are mad, they will vote.\u201d Another factor helping Trump and Carson so far has been the packed Republican field \u2013 the establishment vote is splintered among candidates like Rubio, Bush, Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u2013 and no clear front-runner from this group has yet emerged. But the newcomer candidates can also expect more scrutiny as the first ballots near. After the Paris terror attack earlier this month, for example, foreign policy knowledge has become more of an issue \u2013 perhaps putting Carson at a disadvantage. Among his supporters at least, Trump\u2019s bombast on national security has been welcomed. A further challenge for the outsiders lies in expanding their appeal. The polling ceiling that is consistently evident in Trump\u2019s performance could become a major detriment. READ: 10 groups Donald Trump offended since launching his campaign Though he leads in almost every national and early state poll, it\u2019s not often that Trump polls above the low 30% range. With a fragmented field, that\u2019s sufficient to keep him at the top of the pack. But that could change if the GOP unites behind \u201canyone but Trump.\u201d While outsiders Trump and Carson together poll around 50% in most surveys, it\u2019s also not clear whether their vote is interchangeable. The support that the pediatric neurosurgeon wins among evangelical voters may not be available to the more raucous Trump. In fact, a recent spike in Iowa polls by Cruz may indicate the Texas senator is already profiting at Carson\u2019s expense. If Trump cannot break out, he would not be the only outsider candidate to discover limited horizons. There is, after all, precedent for angry, populist outsiders doing well in some states and polls but failing to build a true national movement. In the 1988 Iowa caucuses, television evangelist Pat Robertson polled nearly 25% but came second to an establishment front-runner, Sen. Bob Dole. Eight years later, the elites\u2019 choice was Dole again, who just edged out former Reagan aide and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan in Iowa. Buchanan actually won in New Hampshire that year, but Dole captured the nomination. And in 2000, media baron Steve Forbes polled 30% in Iowa \u2013 close to Trump\u2019s current ceiling \u2013 but it was the traditional candidate, George W. Bush, who won. Recent history shows no case in which a GOP \u201coutsider\u201d candidate has managed to transform popularity in early states into a formidable and victorious national campaign. Even successful candidates considered outsiders have had traditional credentials. In 1964, conservative icon Barry Goldwater ran as an outsider and won the nomination against the party establishment \u2013 but like Cruz was already a sitting senator. Ronald Reagan was seen by many conservatives as a rival of the Republican Party bosses, but by the time he won the nomination, he had already won two terms as California governor. It\u2019s also possible that Trump\u2019s own behavior could hamper his chances of breaking out. Tactics that make him beloved among his most faithful supporters \u2013 like vows to build a wall on the Mexico border, attacks on the press and his opponents and a volatile campaigning style \u2013 may harm him among a wider electorate. While his core support has been impervious to slippage after previous controversies, such behavior could complicate Trump\u2019s bid to appeal to more moderate primary voters and the broader country should he win the nomination. In turn, Republican voters may begin to question whether Trump is the GOP candidate with the most potential to beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a year\u2019s time. If he did prevail in the primary process, Trump would present the Republican Party with a dilemma \u2013 whether to accept a potential nominee who many fear could stumble in a general election or to try to install an alternative, perhaps in a coup at the party convention in Cleveland that might enrage the GOP base and tear the party apart.",

            "article_content": "The college debate champion turned lawyer turned Republican presidential candidate has a distinctive style \"Last I checked, we don't have a rubber shortage in America,\" Cruz said on Monday Ted Cruz is no stranger to colorful quips \u2013 as Monday night\u2019s riff about \u201cthe condom police\u201d showed. The college debate champion turned lawyer turned Republican presidential candidate\u2019s deliberate and confrontational speaking style is one of his signatures, and his comments are carrying more weight as the Texas senator ascends polls of GOP voters ahead of the 2016 election. He criticized Democrats, saying they portray Republicans as \u201cthe condom police\u201d in an effort to turn female voters against the GOP. \u201cLast I checked, we don\u2019t have a rubber shortage in America,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWhen I was in college, we had a machine in the bathroom, you put .50 cents in and voila!\u201d The comment came shortly after Cruz had defended anti-abortion activists and called the alleged gunman in last week\u2019s Planned Parenthood shootings in Colorado a \u201ctransgendered leftist activist.\u201d Here are seven more of Cruz\u2019s standout lines: \u201cIf standing for liberty and standing for the Constitution make you a wacko bird, then you can count me a very proud wacko bird.\u201d This was Cruz\u2019s response after Arizona Sen. John McCain tired of what he saw as his fellow Republican\u2019s obstructionist tactics and dismissed Cruz as, well, a \u201cwacko bird.\u201d \u201cLook, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, \u2018Accept the Nazis. Yes, they\u2019ll dominate the continent of Europe, but that\u2019s not our problem. Let\u2019s appease them. Why? Because it can\u2019t be done. We can\u2019t possibly stand against them.\u2019 \u201d Cruz wasn\u2019t talking about war and peace when he made these comments on the Senate floor in September 2013. He was talking about lawmakers who said his effort to defund President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law \u2013 an effort that ultimately failed \u2013 was futile. \u201cThere were fewer declared Republicans in the faculty when we were there than communists.\u201d Cruz declared that there was only one Republican professor at his law school alma mater, Harvard, but there were at least 12 communists. He said those faculty members \u201cwould say they were Marxists who believed in Communists overthrowing the United States government.\u201d Outside of politics, academia and media have been among Cruz\u2019s favorite targets. \u201cI expect them to start quartering soldiers in people\u2019s homes soon.\u201d That laugh line was one of many crowd-pleasers Cruz tossed out at the Values Voter Summit in 2013, where he courted the socially conservative Republicans who will be critical to his 2016 presidential hopes. He\u2019s accused the Obama administration of violating the Constitution repeatedly \u2013 over immigration, health care and more. \u201cIn my judgment, we are facing what I consider to be the epic battle of our generation, quite literally the battle over whether we remain a free market nation.\u201d Cruz wasn\u2019t shy about the stakes in his 2012 race for the Senate in Texas \u2013 where he called Obama \u201cthe most radical president this nation\u2019s ever seen.\u201d That sort of rhetoric, during a primary race against a more moderate Republican, made Cruz a darling of the tea party \u2013 and laid the groundwork for his fights with anyone in his own party who\u2019d give an inch to Obama in any policy fight. \u201cI kind of thought it was the job of a chaplain to be insensitive to atheists.\u201d That was Cruz\u2019s comment to a group of Iowa home-schooled children and parents about an Air Force chaplain in Alaska who was asked to take down a blog post in which he\u2019d written that \u201cthere are no atheists in fox holes.\u201d \u201cI will renounce any Canadian citizenship. Nothing against Canada, but I\u2019m an American by birth and as a U.S. senator, I believe I should be only an American.\u201d Cruz was born in Canada to an American mother \u2013 making him a dual citizen. Just years after the \u201cbirther\u201d controversy about whether President Barack Obama was actually born in Hawaii, the Texas senator renounced his Canadian citizenship in an August 2013 statement to The Dallas Morning News.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump say's he's 'Second Amendment 100%' The Sarasota, Florida rally came just hours after a shooting at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic that killed three people Donald Trump showed a more diplomatic side Saturday as a protestor was ejected from a spirited rally he held in Florida, where he otherwise minced no words in going after his opponents. Speaking in Sarasota, Florida, the Republican presidential candidate was interrupted briefly by a protestor who shouted during the opening moments of his remarks. The mogul looked on calmly from the podium as security escorted the protesters out. \u201cBe nice to the person,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt the person. \u2026 Please nicely escort the person out.\u201d The calm handling of the disruption was a change from last Saturday\u2019s campaign rally in Alabama, where a Black Lives Matter protestor was punched and kicked repeatedly by audience members when he interrupted the rally. After the incident, Trump suggested the man \u201cshould have been roughed up.\u201d Trump himself noted the change of tone on Saturday. \u201cYou see how diplomatic I\u2019ve become?\u201d he said as the crowd booed the woman being escorted out of the arena and chanted \u201cget them out!\u201d along with \u201cTrump! Trump!\u201d The whole disturbance took about three minutes to settle down. Trump stuck mostly to his stump speech to the assembled thousands, who cheered, jeered and chanted enthusiastically as Trump revved them up. As well as Trump\u2019s nearly hour long address, the crowd heard from a variety of colorful Trump supporters before he spoke, and children were given helicopter rides outside. There was even an elephant with the candidate\u2019s name and his trademark slogan \u2013 \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2013 chalked on her side. And Trump found ways to tailor his message to the room. He especially went after Florida\u2019s home-state politicians in the GOP primary, getting a roar from the crowd when he mentioned leading in the polls in the state despite Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush both running. He used his common attack lines against the two, including Rubio being \u201cso weak on illegal immigration\u201d and having \u201cthe worst attendance record in the United States Senate.\u201d Rubio has missed the most votes this year of any of the senators running for president, though he says he makes the ones that matter. He has said running for president means missing a few votes. Trump also noted that Rubio missed classified briefings about the Paris terror attacks just after they happened, though the Florida Republican did attend an Intelligence Committee briefing he has access to as a member that his campaign said is better than the information that would have been in the other briefings. \u201cRubio didn\u2019t go, he went to a fundraiser,\u201d Trump said as the crowd booed. \u201cYou tell me, is that right?\u201d Trump also went after Bush for supporting Common Core. Trump noted he attacks the \u201clow energy\u201d Bush less these days. \u201cI don\u2019t even mention him anymore,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know I hit him hard at the beginning. You know, because I think Bush, whether you like Bush or not, you would think he has an advantage because he\u2019s from a family that\u2019s been involved.\u201d Trump surmised he will hold his lead in the Sunshine State. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be an easy campaign, Florida, because I\u2019m leading by a lot already, and Bush is down in the tubes, and Rubio is a little higher than Bush,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t even have the courtesy to go and sit in Washington and represent the people of Florida there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to beat me in an election in Florida.\u201d The Saturday interruption from a protestor came as Trump also touted his opposition to gun control, the day after a shooting rampage outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado killed three people. Donald Trump: Mental health, not gun problem Trump didn\u2019t mention the episode, in which one officer and two civilians were killed. But the mogul did cite the recent Paris attacks, in which more than 130 people died. \u201cIf they would have had the guns, they wouldn\u2019t have had the carnage they had,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI just want to say upfront, right now, Second Amendment 100%.\u201d Trump\u2019s event was emblematic of his campaign so far. The Sarasota Fairgrounds estimated 4,500 people attended the event inside the arena, and thousands more were lined up outside the venue, some of whom he spoke with after he landed his helicopter and before he took off. While those outside listened to audio of his speech, children were given helicopter rides. The billionaire businessman\u2019s Thanksgiving weekend event also came amid mounting criticism over his apparent taunting of a New York Times reporter\u2019s physical appearance. Trump has denied mocking the scribe\u2019s physical disability. The New York Times earlier in the week issued a statement condemning Trump, while the mogul maintains it\u2019s the news outlet that should be saying sorry. Trump on Saturday said he meant no harm, and continued to stress he did not intentionally mock the reporter. \u201cI don\u2019t knock people that have problems, believe me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would never mock a person that has difficulties.\u201d Trump then heaped scorn on The New York Times. He cited what he called the news organization\u2019s business woes. \u201cWho else is going to take on The New York Times? I don\u2019t care. \u2026 They\u2019ll probably be out of business pretty soon.\u201d He also accused the reporter, Serge Kovaleski, of abusing his disability to gain fame. \u201cThe problem is, he\u2019s using what he\u2019s got to such a horrible degree, I think it\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d Trump said, saying The New York Times should apologize to him. Kovaleski has said he and Trump were on a first-name basis for years and the mogul knows who he is. Trump insists he does not know Kovaleski. It\u2019s only the latest brouhaha in a campaign filled with taunts and insults of political opponents, media critics and others. Trump didn\u2019t back down from recent suggestions that some Muslims in America should be watched by federal authorities. And he broadened his criticism. \u201cBy the way, everybody admits that worldwide, Muslims were absolutely going wild\u201d over 9/11 \u2013 a comment that drew quick scorn and rebuke online. Later in the rally Trump referred to the President as Barack Hussein Obama \u2013 an accurate description of his full name, but one often used by critics to question his legitimacy as commander-in-chief. Though before the Sarasota rally Trump showed a softer side, at least briefly. After his helicopter landed, Trump called for some children out of the audience to go up in it, a stunt he pulled in Iowa this summer as well. \u201cI can call her girl right?\u201d Trump said speaking to the parents of a young child at the rally. \u201cToday we have to be so politically correct.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign on Saturday also announced the endorsement of Kathryn \u201cKat\u201d Gates-Skipper, the first female Marine in combat operations.

            "article_content": "Texas asked the Supreme Court for a 30-day extension to file a reply brief to the Obama administration's immigration appeal The Obama administration intends to oppose the extension Texas\u2019 attorney general on Monday asked the Supreme Court for a 30-day extension to file a reply brief In a move that could derail the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to get the court to hear an appeal on a major immigration case this term. If the court were to grant the extension, it could mean that justices might only hear the case next term, and possibly only decide it after the presidential election. Patrick Rodenbush, a Justice Department spokesman, said the department intends to oppose Texas\u2019 request. \u201cThe case presents issues of national importance and the department believes it should be considered expeditiously,\u201d he said. RELATED: Obama administration appeals immigration case to Supreme Court It was only last week that lawyers for the Justice Department asked the court to reverse a lower court ruling and allow President Barack Obama\u2019s controversial immigration programs, meant to ease deportation threats to millions of undocumented immigrants, to take effect. The programs target eligible parents of U.S. citizens as well as some individuals who entered the country as children. In the letter to the court, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, writing on behalf of the 26 states that are challenging the programs, argues that there \u201cis good cause\u201d for the extension \u201cin light of pressing deadlines in other cases handled by counsel for the State respondents.\u201d RELATED: Ted Cruz-Marco Rubio immigration feud springs to life The clerk of the court ordinarily handles extensions, says John Elwood, a lawyer who argues frequently before the court. If the extension request is opposed, the request would likely go to Justice Antonin Scalia who has jurisdiction of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Elwood says that even if the extension is granted, it is not out of the question that the court could decide the case before the next election. \u201cEven if the case is delayed, there is a chance the court could grant expedited briefing, or a special extra sitting (as it did in the Citizens United case) but those options would be unusual,\u201d said Elwood. \u201cTiming will be very tight.\u2019 CNN\u2019s Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Voters' level of anger has significant impact on their preferences for the next president, the poll showed Three-quarters of Republicans say government is in need of major reform, compared with 44% of Democrats A sustained outburst of anger and deep disdain for government that has shaped the Republican race for president and confounded the pundits is not going away. The spirit of insurrection that has powered outsider candidates like Donald Trump to the head of the polls is threatening to close an already narrowing lane for more traditional candidates in the frenzied run-up to the first early voting contests early next year. A Pew Research Center poll published Monday showed that the deepest suspicion of government, though also elevated among the broader electorate, remains in the Republican Party. The intensity of that sentiment toward the nation\u2019s leaders helps explain the turbulent nature of the GOP\u2019s 2016 election race and the dominance of Trump. With his explosive anti-establishment rhetoric, attacks on political correctness and deeply personal swipes at rival candidates, Trump has successfully tapped into this palpable fury in sectors of the Republican primary electorate and has skipped unharmed through controversies \u2013 like branding undocumented immigrants from Mexico rapists and criminals and backing a database for Muslims in the United States \u2013 that might have ended more traditional campaigns. And with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire now just over two months away from weighing in on the contest, the conventional wisdom that outsider candidates such as Trump and neurosurgeon Ben Carson will fade seems to be on thinner ground than ever before. RELATED: Donald Trump leads new poll The Pew poll shows that candidates like Trump who have fanned the flames of anger at government have sound political rationales for doing so. Republicans and those who lean Republican are three times as likely as Democrats to say they are \u201cangry\u201d with government \u2013 32% to 12%. Among Republicans and Democrats who vote often and follow politics closely, the gap is even wider: 42% to 11%. And 89% of Republicans said they can seldom, if ever, trust the federal government. Among Democrats, that number is 72%, demonstrating that widespread cynicism about politicians is not a partisan issue. The findings confirm that the surge of distrust in Washington \u2013 aimed not just toward the Democratic administration of President Barack Obama but GOP leaders as well \u2013 remains a driver of the primary race, even if establishment candidates hope otherwise. Combined with GOP hopefuls\u2019 injection of terrorism and the politics of fear into the race after the Paris terror attacks, the polls suggest that any candidate seen as a creature of the establishment will continue to struggle this election cycle. The billionaire real estate mogul is viewed more favorably by the nearly one-third of Republicans and GOP leaners who are \u201cangry\u201d at the government (64% favorable rating) than by those who are \u201ccontent\u201d or  merely \u201cfrustrated\u201d with government (48 percent favorable rating). Other GOP presidential candidates like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Carson also do better among Republicans who are angry at government. Though Rubio and Cruz are sitting senators, both have taken pains to distance themselves from Washington and to position themselves as authentic voices for voters. And the struggles of one-time Republican front-runner Jeb Bush are laid bare by the poll. The former Florida Governor\u2019s favorable rating is 18 points lower \u2013 at 39% \u2013 among Republicans who say they are angry. READ: Ayotte among the 2016 GOPers who worry about Trump atop the ticket As the Obama era draws to a close, the poll suggests that skepticism about Washington institutions is growing across the board. Only 19% of Americans said they could trust government always or most of the time, close to the lowest level in the past 60 years, according to Pew. Although Trump is leading Republican national polls and surveys in many early voting states, he again this weekend refused to rule out the idea of running as an independent if he fails to capture the GOP nomination. And the Pew poll suggests that he may find a receptive audience for his anti-government message among a broader electorate than the Republican Party. Overall, 74% of Americans said that most elected officials put their own interests ahead of the country\u2019s. Fifty-five percent, meanwhile, believed that ordinary Americans would do a better job of solving problems than politicians. Still, when it comes to key areas of government responsibility, most people concluded that government had an important responsibility \u2013 even if it could be handling it better. Among all Americans, 94% said the government had a major role in keeping the nation safe from terrorism, 88% said handling natural disasters was a job for government, and 87% said that ensuring safe food and medicine was a key task for government. Further reflecting the popularity of Trump\u2019s message, 81% said that it was the responsibility of government to manage the immigration system \u2013 but only 28% said it was doing a good job in the area. Pew surveyed 6,004 Americans by phone from August 27 to October 4 for the poll, which carries a margin of error of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. Pew surveyed roughly 2,600 Republican and Republican leaners and an equal number of Democrats and Democratic leaners, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "The Obama administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to reverse a lower court ruling and allow the president's controversial immigration programs, meant to ease deportation threats to millions of undocumented immigrants, go into effect Administration wants case heard before the next election The Obama administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to reverse a lower court ruling and allow the president\u2019s controversial immigration programs, meant to ease deportation threats to millions of undocumented immigrants, go into effect. And the administration wants the case heard quickly \u2013 before the 2016 presidential election. \u201cA divided court of appeals has upheld an unprecedented nationwide injunction against implementing a federal immigration enforcement policy of great national importance, and has done so in violation of established limits on the judicial power,\u201d Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote in court briefs filed Friday. \u201cIf left undisturbed, that ruling will allow States to frustrate the federal government\u2019s enforcement of the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\u201d The brief represents the administration\u2019s last real hope of getting a court to green light the programs before the next election. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court and said that the administration lacked the authority to implement the programs, blocking them from going into effect. Read: Immigration ruling shows risks of relying on executive actions There are about 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the United States today and about 4.3 million would be eligible to receive some federal and state public benefits as well as work authorization if the Supreme Court rules in their favor. The programs target the eligible parents of U.S citizens as well individuals who were brought here as a children. Twenty-six states, led by Texas, are challenging the actions arguing that the President exceeded his authority. They note that the programs aren\u2019t just about making priorities about who can be deported, but that they grant individuals lawful presence and numerous state and federal benefits. Verrilli wrote to the Supreme Court that that 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \u201cfundamentally erred\u201d in its analysis and \u201ccommitted manifold and significant errors in affirming the unprecedented nationwide injunction,\u201d calling for \u201cimmediate review.\u201d \u201cThe court of appeals\u2019 judgment enjoins nationwide a federal policy of great importance to federal law enforcement, to many states, and to millions of families with longstanding and close connections with this country. A twice-divided court of appeals should not have the last word on whether that policy can be implemented,\u201d Verrilli wrote. \u201cThe great and immediate significance of the secretary\u2019s guidance, the irreparable injury to the many families affected by delay in its implementation, and the broad importance of the questions presented, counsel strongly in favor of certiorari now.\u201d In announcing the initiatives last November, the administration said it was trying to manage its limited immigration enforcement resources and prioritize who should be removed from the country. Verrilli argues that the administration has the authority to defer action on the removal of those who pose no threats and have close family ties. The states are expected to file their brief with the Supreme Court in the coming weeks, and could ask for an extension of time. The court\u2019s timing could be critical. Under normal circumstances, if the justices are to hear the issue this term, briefing must be completed by mid-winter. Immigrant rights activists hailed the administration\u2019s move Friday, emphasizing the court should take the case quickly. \u201cWe are determined to see these important protections become a reality,\u201d Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, said in a statement. \u201cWith this swift filing by the Department of Justice for Supreme Court review, the Court has plenty of time to hear the case this term and provide stability to the millions of families stuck in legal limbo.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Idaho billionaire Frank VanderSloot announced Wednesday he would be supporting the Florida Republican He also took aim at other heavy-hitting Republican donors who aren't investing in the primary \"I believe that Obama has demonstrated that a young senator can get a lot of stuff done\" One of Mitt Romney\u2019s top donors said Wednesday he is going to go \u201call out\u201d in supporting Sen. Marco Rubio, and he\u2019s citing an unlikely model for why the Florida Republican will make a good president: Barack Obama. Idaho billionaire Frank VanderSloot announced Wednesday he would back the freshman senator after his team determined in a 10-month evaluation that Rubio would both make the best President and be the most electable in a general election. And he said in an interview that criticism of the 44-year-old Rubio\u2019s inexperience at the national level won\u2019t harm him. \u201cThat is a valid question to ask, and yet we have a current President that was a freshman senator and \u2026 we\u2019ve seen that a freshman senator can get a lot of stuff done,\u201d VanderSloot told CNN. \u201cIt happens, in my opinion, to be all of the wrong stuff, but \u2026 I believe that Obama has demonstrated that a young senator can get a lot of stuff done.\u201d VanderSloot made the endorsement in a letter to top donors and the media, in which he laid out his thinking on each candidate that his team considered. \u201cIn our opinion, Marco Rubio far exceeds the other candidates as meeting our requirements to be the best president, and he, importantly, is by far the most electable,\u201d VanderSloot wrote in his endorsement letter of Rubio. He also took aim at other heavy-hitting Republican donors who aren\u2019t investing in the primary, calling it a \u201cdangerous strategy\u201d that could result in someone winning the primary who is \u201ctotally unelectable,\u201d slamming in particular Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and mogul Donald Trump. VanderSloot is the founder of health products company Melaleuca and has been a substantial Republican donor in the past. He was a national finance co-chairman for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, with his company donating more than $1 million to Romney\u2019s super PAC and with VanderSloot bundling $58 million for the 2012 campaign. He has also been a heavy donor to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and leading conservative nonprofit groups Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity. RELATED: Clinton trails GOP rivals in Colorado In the interview, VanderSloot said Rubio is seen as the best chance to \u201cunite\u201d a country badly in need of it, that he has the right perspective on economic issues, knows his foreign policy and is strong on immigration. \u201cI believe that Marco Rubio has the right approach to immigration,\u201d VanderSloot said. \u201cI know a lot of Hispanic people, I mean a lot of them \u2026 I\u2019ve talked to people and heard their stories, people who are not documented and what they\u2019re looking for, and honestly they love America.\u201d \u201cThese folks aren\u2019t looking for citizenship, they\u2019re looking for a job,\u201d he added. VanderSloot added that he hopes Rubio can bring Hispanic voters to the Republican Party, which should be attracted to the GOP\u2019s conservative values but turns off Latinos with many of the party\u2019s immigration policies. The failed Romney campaign was often criticized for its position on immigration, with Romney\u2019s talk of self-deportation facing ridicule. At the time, even, VanderSloot said he wished Romney would be more like Rubio. \u201cI recall talking to Marco Rubio during the Mitt Romney campaign trying to get some of the folks at the Mitt Romney campaign to go more the direction of Marco Rubio,\u201d VanderSloot said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t successful, but I tried.\u201d VanderSloot pledged not just to support Rubio heavily from his own pocket, but to go \u201call out\u201d in bundling money from other donors, as well. And he said he\u2019s heard from many friends who originally supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush that they like Rubio but are waiting until farther into the primary cycle to get involved. He is just the latest major donor to sign on to Rubio\u2019s campaign, after billionaire Paul Singer and hedge fund manager Cliff Asness. Rubio\u2019s last fundraising quarter was disappointing, but after strong debate performances, his rising poll numbers have placed him third in many surveys and big-money names have gravitated toward his campaign. In his letter, VanderSloot said Carly Fiorina was his second choice for support, and that while many of his peers initially supported Bush, Rubio\u2019s one-time mentor, he has now become a \u201cweaker\u201d candidate. \u201cIt has become increasingly clear that Jeb simply does not have the leadership skills necessary to unite the people behind him,\u201d he wrote. VanderSloot also called Cruz and Trump unelectable and said Trump \u201cwould make a particularly poor president.\u201d The Rubio campaign said it was \u201cthrilled\u201d to have VanderSloot aboard. \u201cMarco-mentum is building. Thrilled to have Idaho\u2019s Frank VanderSloot on @TeamMarco,\u201d Rubio\u2019s spokesman Alex Conant tweeted.",

            "article_content": "The three Democratic presidential candidates gathered for their second debate Saturday night Terror attacks in Paris hung heavily over the debate and foreign policy questions dominated the start of the debate Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders attacked each other, a contrast to previous debates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley met for the second Democratic presidential primary debate on Saturday night, an event that finally saw a fight between the front-runner and her chief opponent, but also coming a day after a deadly terror attack that shocked the world. Democratic debate in Iowa Here are the six key takeaways from the debate: Clinton distanced herself from President Barack Obama\u2019s now-controversial comment in an interview Thursday that the U.S. had \u201ccontained ISIS.\u201d During Saturday\u2019s debate, Clinton asserted that ISIS \u201ccannot be contained\u201d and must simply be \u201cdefeated.\u201d As she has in the past, Clinton also suggested that she had argued \u201cearly on that we needed to find a way to train and equip moderates.\u201d Clinton reportedly argued for a more forceful administration plan to help the Syrian opposition early on in the civil war that has since exploded. Hillary Clinton at Democratic debate: ISIS \u2018cannot be contained\u2019 The Vermont senator in the first debate appeared unprepared or unwilling to go after Clinton with any real vigor. But Saturday night, Sanders suggested Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street and tied her vote to authorize the war in Iraq to the rise of ISIS. Clinton, meanwhile, knocked Sanders on his mixed record on guns and suggested his policy proposals are too simplistic. In the most forceful exchange of the night, Sanders pointed to the millions of dollars in donations Wall Street has funneled to Clinton\u2019s campaigns over her political career. Wall Street has made Hillary Clinton a millionaire \u201cWhy over her political career has Wall Street been a major, the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? Maybe they\u2019re dumb and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to get, but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street from the military industrial complex, not one candidate \u2013 \u2018Oh these, these campaign contributions will not influence me.\u2019 But why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows that.\u201d Democratic debate: CNN\u2019s Reality Check team inspects the claims Clinton responded by accusing Sanders of impugning her \u201cintegrity,\u201d before claiming that Wall Street has supported her because of the work she did to rebuild the Financial District after it was hit in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. As she did in the first debate, Clinton hit Sanders on guns, calling the Vermont senator\u2019s vote to shield gun makers from some lawsuits a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d and urging Sanders to admit as much, as she has done regarding her Iraq vote. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton is wrong on gun liability Sanders responded by suggesting there\u2019s little daylight between himself and Clinton and O\u2019Malley on guns. Sanders didn\u2019t take the gloves off completely during Saturday night\u2019s debate in Iowa. Instead, he took a pass on one of the biggest points of contention of the 2016 cycle: Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state. Given a chance to slam Clinton\u2019s tenure, Sanders demurred, instead pivoting to his \u201cdisagreement\u201d with Clinton over her vote in favor of the Iraq War in 2002, more than six years before she became secretary of state. Republicans are already picking apart Clinton\u2019s track record as secretary of state, but Sanders\u2019 simply wouldn\u2019t take the bait. It was reminiscent of Sanders\u2019 \u201cdamn emails\u201d moment in the first Democratic debate, when he said Americans are tired of hearing about the controversy over Clintons\u2019 use of personal email during her time as secretary of state. The first Democratic debate However, Clinton\u2019s response to Sanders \u2013 when she beat back the suggestion that she is influenced by Wall Street donors \u2013 could really come back to bite her. Clinton explained her connection to Wall Street by tying her relationship to her role in helping to rebuild New York\u2019s financial district after the 9/11 attacks. Twitter was ablaze Saturday night over the response, and the Republican National Committee was quick to blast out a best-of compilation of political observers\u2019 reactions. It\u2019s not the only moment that could come back to haunt Clinton \u2013 especially if she faces a younger GOP nominee, like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Clinton at one point said she is \u201cfrom the \u201960s\u201d \u2013 a moment in the debate that could be replayed in political ads down the line suggesting she is part of the past, not the future, of American leadership. The debate Saturday night began with the candidates pausing on stage, taking a moment of silence to remember the victims of the terrorist attacks that ripped Paris apart just a day earlier. Clinton said while \u201cour prayers are with the people of France tonight\u2026that is not enough\u201d and called for better coordinated efforts to root out ISIS, the radical group that claimed responsibility. She said Americans should see the terrorist attack as a reminder that the election \u201cis not only about electing a president, it\u2019s also about choosing our next commander in chief.\u201d 6 questions for Democrats about Paris attacks Sanders made brief note of the terrorist attacks at the top of his opening statement, but quickly pivoted to the core message of the campaign: \u201ca rigged economy\u201d that benefits billionaires. Still, Sanders made a bold claim in his reference to Paris: \u201cTogether, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarist (sic) organization called ISIS.\u201d And O\u2019Malley, after saying his heart goes out \u201cto the people of France in this moment of loss,\u201d quickly called for \u201cfresh thinking\u201d and \u201cnew approaches\u201d \u2013 a definitive nod to his youth and the generational contrast the  52-year-old offers to Clinton\u2019s 68 years and Sanders\u2019 74. All three candidates refused to say the fight was with radical Islam, instead focusing on using the word \u201cjihadist\u201d to describe the threats spotlighted in the Paris attacks. Clinton calls out \u2018radical jihadist ideology\u2019 O\u2019Malley delivered several strong one-liners throughout the night, notably when he slammed Republican front-runner Donald Trump as a \u201ccarnival barker\u201d for his immigration policies. But O\u2019Malley also missed a couple of key moments where he could have shined. His central contention is that it\u2019s time for a new generation of leadership \u2013 meaning no more baby boomers like Clinton. But he lacked a strong, convincing response to one of the debate\u2019s final questions: When have you been most tested in your life, and how did it prepare you for the presidency? O\u2019Malley\u2019s response conceded that he is untested \u2013 that nothing he\u2019s been through as mayor of Baltimore or governor of Maryland comes close to the crises he would face as President. Trump later responded to O\u2019Malley\u2019s insult on Twitter by calling him a \u201cclown.\u201d Hillary and Sanders are not doing well, but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage? O'Malley is a clown.",

            "article_content": "The latest manifestation of ISIS' widening reach could shift the relative importance of a president's experience, strategic vision and temperament in the minds of voters While none of the candidates wants to be seen as politicizing such a terrible situation, their first comments hinted at a raging debate on the threat from ISIS A night of terror in Paris poses immediate implications for America\u2019s own national security and could reshape a presidential race in which political novices have turned the experience and knowledge of seasoned, conventional rivals into a liability. The attacks by a roving band of assassins for which ISIS has claimed responsibility represent a deadly new escalation in the war on terror and raise the bar for all the leading presidential candidates \u2013 none of whom has yet offered a cohesive, in-depth answer to the swift and deadly expansion of the group\u2019s international terrorism ambitions. Less than 80 days before the first nominating votes are cast, the attacks could provide an especially strong challenge for GOP candidates like real estate mogul Donald Trump and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson and for Democrat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Such hopefuls have mostly struggled when confronted with national security questions or have argued that their lack of experience is actually an asset that appeals to voters fed up with career politicians. But the latest manifestation of ISIS\u2019 widening reach, coming on the heels of the downing of a Russian airliner and a mass-casualty bombing in Lebanon for which the group is also suspected, could shift the relative importance of a president\u2019s experience, strategic vision and temperament in the minds of voters. In the Republican race, especially, it\u2019s possible that the attacks could tilt the balance back towards more \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates who tout administrative competence \u2013 like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \u2013 or who have put foreign policy expertise at the center of their campaigns, like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. While none of the candidates wants to be seen as politicizing such a terrible situation, their first comments hinted at a raging debate on the threat from ISIS that is now likely to become a major theme in the White House race. \u201cThis is the war of our time, and we have to be serious in engaging and creating a strategy to confront it and take it out,\u201d Bush told radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cWe cannot let those who seek to disrupt our way of life succeed,\u201d Rubio said in a statement. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz added: \u201cBetween the downing of the Russian jet over Egypt and this massive coordinated attack on Paris, we are seeing an unmistakable escalation of ISIS\u2019 ambitions.\u201d Trump sent his prayers on Twitter. Front-running Democrat Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, said Americans must help \u201cwage and win the struggle against terrorism and violent extremism.\u201d But none of those statements suggested that the top 2016 candidates yet have a comprehensive strategy to resolve the crisis or are ready to mobilize U.S. public opinion to a more intense campaign against the terror group. In fact, they seemed to encapsulate the impotence of politicians who so far have only words to combat a burgeoning terror threat. READ: 5 questions for Democrats about Paris attacks But the debate is likely to quickly intensify into a wider critique of existing U.S. policy on ISIS, offering an opening for a candidate who can frame the most compelling new strategy \u2013 and offer a confident contrast with an administration that now appears to lack success in the fight against terrorism. \u201cI think that at least from my point of view, the vacuum of American leadership in this space has, in my judgment, been one of the challenges and provided some of the opportunities for ISIS to move much more aggressively,\u201d Tom Ridge, a Republican who served as the first U.S. secretary of homeland security, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cSmerconish\u201d Saturday. \u201cI do think Republican candidates, writ large, will be required to respond to this in a public way and those of us who are involved in the race and those of you who analyze it and comment on it will see what response makes the greatest sense.\u201d Contenders, including those in Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Iowa, must now confront a question likely playing out on the minds of many American voters. If a small group of terrorists, apparently schooled in carnage in the Syrian war, can turn the streets of France into an extension of the Middle East killing field, why can\u2019t it happen soon in New York or Chicago or Dallas? \u201cWe have 250 fighters from the United States that have gone to fight in Syria as jihadists,\u201d Ed Royce, Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee said on CNN Friday night. \u201cWe have a similar challenge here in the United States in terms of those who would try to find their way back and take the demands seriously that the ISIS leadership is making \u2013 and that demand is to carry the attack to apostate civilian populations (to) attack soft targets, attack women and children, civilians,\u201d he said. CBS, which is hosting Saturday\u2019s debate, informed the Democratic candidates that the format would be changed to incorporate questions about the Paris attacks at the the start, a shift met with some resistance from the Sanders campaign. According to a source on a call between debate organizers and the campaigns, a Sanders aide \u201ccompletely lost it\u201d when informed of the change and argued that it shouldn\u2019t be allowed. After the rift was reported, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver denied the dispute was resistance to discussing the attacks themselves, saying rather the conflict revolved around a push to shorten opening statements in order to accommodate for time to talk about the attacks. \u201cThey wanted to make some last minute changes to the debate, we obviously wanted to keep the format to what had been agreed to, and I think people on our staff argued vigorously to that and were successful,\u201d Weaver said. The dispute was first reported by Yahoo news. It is already clear that the horrific, multiple Paris killing sprees leave the foreign policy legacy of President Barack Obama in the Middle East looking even more threadbare. It was a harsh political irony that the killings in France took place on the same day that an interview aired in which the President argued that his strategy had \u201ccontained\u201d ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Such comments, and the occasion when Obama referred to ISIS as a \u201cJV team,\u201d now represent a significant vulnerability for Democrats who want to succeed him and an opportunity for Republicans portraying his tenure as commander-in-chief as feckless. Clinton will get the chance at Saturday\u2019s debate to lay out a clear way forward on ISIS and make the case that her service in the Obama administration should be seen as an advantage, not a liability. Despite Republican criticisms of her record as secretary of state, the escalating power of global terrorism could bolster Clinton\u2019s claims that her experience on the global stage has left her with a resume of statesmanship vitally needed in an age of crisis. Trump on Paris attacks: Victims should've had guns That narrative could at the same time further diminish her less experienced and trailing rivals, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who lack such international experience. But any impulse from Clinton to call for tougher action against ISIS could also lead her onto dangerous political ground. She already appears to be much more hawkish than her party, which has little appetite for a new military commitment in the chaos of the Middle East. Her calls for a no-fly zone in Syria to protect refugees have already been attacked by Sanders especially, who has used them to focus attention on her backing for the Iraq war in a 2002 Senate vote that helped derail her 2008 primary campaign. An effort to lay out the more robust strategy against ISIS that the next president may eventually have to adopt would also put Clinton in the difficult position of criticizing Obama\u2019s current efforts at the same time that she is trying to reassemble the coalition of voters that helped the President win two terms. And despite making clear that she would have taken a more proactive approach earlier in the Syrian civil war, her role as Obama\u2019s first-term secretary of state exposes her to GOP arguments that her presidency would simply represent an extension of the failed national security policies pursued by the current administration. On the Republican side, Sen. Lindsey Graham has been a lonely voice calling for the deployment of American ground troops to fight ISIS in Syria. But the back and forth on ISIS that has played out in the GOP primary race has most exposed the two front-running candidates Trump and Carson \u2013 particularly in presidential debates. Trump for instance, said this week that he would \u201cbomb the s\u2014 out of ISIS,\u201d and while he may be tapping into deep public anger at the group, his comments hardly hint at a thought-out military strategy, nor does his other recent claim that he knows more about ISIS than U.S. generals. Carson, meanwhile, spent Thursday and Friday locked in a debate with the White House over his claim that Chinese forces, in contradiction of available U.S. intelligence, were in fact active in the Syrian war. It was a spat that seemed to reveal his idiosyncratic worldview and to suggest that he lacks a deeper grounding in national security policy. His campaign, though, later said Carson was referring to the presence of Chinese military equipment in the war-torn country. The aftermath of the Paris attacks is likely not just to fuel Republican criticisms of Obama\u2019s record but to offer an opening for GOP candidates to distinguish themselves on national security. One such candidate is Rubio \u2013 who appears to have laid a shrewd bet years ago on carving out a foreign policy lane for himself in a potential presidential campaign. In his statement on Friday night, Rubio offered the first hints of how his rhetoric on ISIS could evolve past his frequent and vehement critiques of Obama\u2019s leadership style. \u201cWe cannot let those who seek to disrupt our way of life succeed,\u201d said Rubio, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cWe must increase our efforts at home and abroad to improve our defenses, destroy terrorist networks and deprive them of the space from which to operate.\u201d READ: Why did Obama declare ISIS \u2018contained\u2019 the day before Paris attack? Ohio Gov. John Kasich spelled out an even clearer response at an event in Orlando Saturday. \u201cToday Nato should invoke article 5 of our NATO agreement, which basically says an attack on an ally is an attack on us and an attack on all of the Western world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as Americans must assert leadership and we need to stand shoulder to shoulder with France and the French people.\u201d Still, for the most part GOP candidates have yet to offer specifics on policy changes \u2013 a vacuum they may now be forced to fill. Some GOP candidates are already using the attacks to further their own political goals \u2013 for instance, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee leveraged the news in Paris to bolster his calls for a toughened policy on immigration. \u201cThese dogs are unleashed. The only thing we are going to ever do to stop them is to take aggressive actions,\u201d Huckabee said on CNN on Saturday. \u201cIf a left-wing, politically correct country like France will close its borders, it\u2019s time for us to put a moratorium on people coming here from countries where there are people with al Qaeda or ISIS ties.\u201d Trump, for his part, went after gun control on Saturday. \u201cWhen you look at Paris \u2013 you know the toughest gun laws in the world, Paris \u2013 nobody had guns but the bad guys,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Texas. \u201cYou can say what you want, but if they had guns, if our people had guns, if they were allowed to carry \u2026 it would\u2019ve been a much, much different situation.\u201d But the Paris attacks also expose Republicans to political vulnerabilities over ISIS. While the GOP base loves the kind of hawkish rhetoric that Rubio and others doled out at a presidential debate in Milwaukee this week, America remains weary of foreign wars, leaving little political room for new commitments by Republicans. And the legacy of President George W. Bush, whom many Democrats blame for ripping the lid off boiling sectarian strife in the Middle East with the invasion of Iraq, continues to haunt the GOP when it comes to national security policy.

            "article_content": "Marco Rubio is back in the fray of the immigration debate Rubio has sparked criticism from the left and right on immigration Marco Rubio insisted he learned his lesson when he abandoned his controversial immigration bill: Congress could not tackle such an issue in a comprehensive fashion. But on the campaign trail, Rubio says he\u2019s open to the most controversial aspect of that plan: a pathway to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants. Rubio laid out this week a list of criteria illegal immigrants would have to meet to earn citizenship \u2013 mirroring the controversial Gang of Eight bill that he has methodically been distancing himself from after it passed the Senate in 2013. \u201cI personally am open to that,\u201d he said of a \u201cvery long\u201d path to citizenship on National Public Radio. The comments drew Rubio back into the fray of an issue that has dogged him with the right wing of the party since he first tried to tackle it in 2012. He has tried to project himself as a leader trying to fix a vexing issue, while also trying to be sensitive to the anger from the GOP base. Memorable quotes from the fourth Republican debate But by playing to both sides, Rubio has sparked criticism from the left and right and prompted sharp charges that he\u2019s choosing his position for political expediency. It\u2019s a sign that the issue is only going to heat up as he continues to ascend in the GOP race. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, an immigration hardliner and an aggressive opponent of the 2013 bill, told CNN on Thursday that GOP candidates should drop out of the race if they back a path to citizenship. \u201cSupporting citizenship for illegal immigrants should be disqualifying,\u201d Sessions said when asked about Rubio\u2019s position. \u201cJust like we can\u2019t have a GOP nominee who supports Obamacare, we can\u2019t have a GOP nominee who supports amnesty.\u201d Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks said in an interview that Rubio\u2019s position on immigration would \u201cvery significantly\u201d depress conservative voter turnout in a general election if he were the nominee. \u201cWhen I see what Marco has said and done, along with other presidential candidates, that is: Their actions and their comments are a definite concern because they undermine the ability of American families to earn enough to take care of themselves,\u201d said Brooks, a conservative Republican who backs Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the nomination. On Thursday, Rubio tried to muddy the waters even further by telling reporters that Cruz was aligned with his position on immigration reform, citing positions on H-1B visas and other matters that the Texan took during the 2013 battle. READ: Why some conservatives are upset with Ted Cruz on immigration \u201cI don\u2019t think our positions are dramatically different,\u201d Rubio said. But Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said the Florida senator has made clear he  now opposes moving on a bill in a comprehensive fashion, saying Washington must enact individual pieces of immigration reform \u2013 starting with border and interior enforcement \u2013 before debating a path to citizenship. \u201cWhat he has said is that the Gang of Eight bill is dead, and it\u2019s not coming back and it has even less support now than it did two years ago,\u201d Conant said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the only way that the way to fix the broken immigration system is by first securing the border.\u201d In April 2012, a 41-year-old Rubio called a small group of reporters into his conference room to announce a rather bold step: He wanted to offer some children of undocumented immigrants the opportunity to apply for \u201cnon-immigrant\u201d visas before they would be allowed to earn a more permanent legal status. The plan stopped short of offering a full-blown path to citizenship, as Democrats wanted. But it elevated his stature and showcased his willingness to dive in the choppy immigration waters \u2013 just as the GOP\u2019s presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, had veered right on the issue and was considering picking him as the party\u2019s vice presidential nominee. Moments from Marco Rubio's career But in June 2012, Rubio gave up on that plan. President Barack Obama, in an election-year move, took executive action to defer deportations to certain undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Rubio said such executive actions undermined an effort to do anything legislatively. \u201cPeople are going to say to me, \u2018Why are we going to need to do anything on this now. It has been dealt with. We can wait until after the election,\u2019\u201d Rubio told the Wall Street Journal at the time. \u201cAnd it is going to be hard to argue against that.\u201d After Romney was routed with Hispanic voters in the 2012 elections, a bipartisan group of senators began negotiating behind the scenes to put together a sweeping proposal that they intended to push through Congress in 2013, when Democrats controlled the Senate and occupied the White House. READ: Bush on Rubio: \u2018I\u2019m a better bet\u2019 against Clinton For months, Rubio was flirting with the group and privately negotiating details, but hadn\u2019t made a formal decision about signing onto the legislative proposal until April 2013, when he went on all the Sunday talk shows to aggressively defend the effort. \u201cThis is not blanket amnesty,\u201d Rubio said at the time. As the measure headed to the Senate floor, Rubio sided with fellow negotiators to defeat any controversial amendments aimed at changing the structure of the plan. He voted against an amendment by Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, to require the completion of 700 miles of fencing at the border before allowing the pathway to citizenship plan to move forward. And he opposed a plan by Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, requiring that the country\u2019s biometric entry-exit system of tracking people crossing the border is fully implemented before giving legal status to undocumented immigrants. Moments before the bill\u2019s passage, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said: \u201cGenerations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass,\u201d adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why I support this reform.\u201d But after the bill\u2019s passage, Rubio began to speak much less frequently about the matter. Even though the rest of the Gang of Eight was still meeting regularly to strategize over how to ratchet up pressure on House Republicans to take up the bill, Rubio refused to do so, saying that the issue was now in the hands of the GOP-led House, which never called the plan up for a vote. By taking that approach, Rubio began to make amends with many conservatives who were furious at his position, but he angered fellow proponents of immigration reform who believed he was caving to political pressure. In an interview with CNN last week, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the co-authors of the bill, said Rubio was initially \u201ctotally committed\u201d to the Gang of Eight plan and that his fingerprints were \u201call over\u201d the creation of a pathway to citizenship. \u201cThe fact that he abandoned the bill so quickly because a bunch of right-wing commentators came out against it will not serve him well in his presidential campaign primary or general if he ever got there,\u201d Schumer said. By 2014, Rubio began to blame the president for scuttling immigration reform, saying voters had lost trust with him on enforcing existing law since Obama has acted, in his opinion, illegally by the executive actions he\u2019s taken. The crisis at the Southern border, where scores of undocumented children were trying to enter the country last summer, made it even harder politically for Rubio to defend the bill. And he has increasingly said that doing anything legislatively in such a major fashion would be a mistake. \u201cEvery massive piece of legislation that has passed over the last 20 years has by and large been disastrous,\u201d Rubio told Politico in April. In recent days, Rubio\u2019s immigration position has begun to come into sharp focus, even though he was spared from the back-and-forth during the GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee earlier this week. Despite being an early proponent to give relief to children who arrived in the country illegally at a young age, Rubio has made clear that the president\u2019s deferred action program must \u201cend.\u201d He cosponsored a bill last month to crack down on sanctuary cities. READ: Marco Rubio\u2019s quip about welders gets torched Rubio has dismissed Donald Trump\u2019s call to round up and deport the 11 million illegal immigrants as not \u201creasonable,\u201d but he added that some undocumented immigrants would be deported. \u201cThere are going to be people who are going to have to be deported,\u201d Rubio said in Hilton Head, South Carolina on Thursday. \u201cCriminals will be deported. People who have not been here long enough will be deported. We will enforce our immigration laws.\u201d Yet, Rubio has signaled an openness to eventually let the 11 million undocumented apply for citizenship, after paying back taxes and fines and taking other punitive steps \u2013 echoing the call in the Gang of Eight plan that would have created a 13-year pathway to citizenship. But that would only happen, he said, after separate individual pieces of immigration reform are enacted, including border security and fixing the existing legal immigration system. Some on the right are still not satisfied. \u201cRepublican voters are tired of leaders who promote an immigration agenda that serves everyone\u2019s interests but theirs,\u201d Sessions said.

            "article_content": "Each candidate needed something different from Tuesday night Jeb Bush needed a game-changing performance. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz wanted to maintain their momentum. And Rand Paul wanted to get into the act Carly Fiorina had another good night, but has struggled to maintain any momentum between debates As the first primaries creep ever closer, candidates are feeling the pressure to rise above the pack and prove their electoral viability. Each candidate came in with different marks to hit. Jeb Bush needed a game-changing performance. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz wanted to maintain their momentum. And Rand Paul wanted to get into the act. Here\u2019s how they fared: MARCO RUBIO Rubio was once again the debate\u2019s maestro \u2013 hitting all the right notes and not once appearing to bend under pressure. The Florida senator skillfully weaved his personal biography as the son of immigrant parents as he answered almost every question he fielded. He also flashed his foreign policy chops and seized the opportunity to set up a contrast between himself and the less mainstream non-interventionist views of his opponent, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. \u201cI know that Rand is a committed isolationist,\u201d Rubio needled, before offering a deftly handled rebuttal to Paul\u2019s questioning of how spending billions on the U.S. military was conservative. \u201cWe can\u2019t even have an economy if we\u2019re not safe,\u201d Rubio argued. \u201cYes I believe the world \u2013 I don\u2019t believe, I know the world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest military power in the world.\u201d As during most of Rubio\u2019s responses \u2013 the audience roared in approval. While Ben Carson did have to answer one question about the controversy that has swirled around his campaign in the last week, Rubio did not have to field the rolling questions about his finances, notably his use of a Republican Party credit card for personal expenses. Rubio\u2019s quip about welders gets torched TED CRUZ The Texas senator gave another classic Cruz performance on Tuesday night, one that could serve to further his steady rise in the polls \u2013 and the rising chorus of pundits viewing him as the eventual conservative alternative to whichever establishment candidate emerges in a two- or three-person race. The firebrand conservative slammed critics who dub his hardline position on illegal immigration as \u201canti-immigrant,\u201d calling that \u201coffensive\u201d; he staked out the middle ground as Rubio and Paul argued for opposing degrees of American intervention in Middle East conflicts; and he played to his base by slamming moderate, establishment Republicans. \u201cThe Democrats are laughing \u2013 because if Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose,\u201d Cruz said. He hit one snag reminiscent of a memorable 2011 debate moment when Rick Perry forgot the name of the third agency he would eliminate. Cruz, naming five federal agencies he would abolish, named just four \u2013 twice naming the Department of Commerce, leaving the Department of Education off of his list. Opinion: GOP race getting clearer BEN CARSON The retired neurosurgeon is sticking with what works, offering supporters more of the same mild-mannered, reserved demeanor that has rocketed him into a dead heat with Trump. Carson\u2019s most notable moment is one that is sure to please his supporters, who have been devouring his upbraiding of the mainstream media over the course of more than a week of questions about crucial elements of his inspirational biography. \u201cThank you for not asking me what I said in the 10th grade,\u201d Carson said to laughter as Fox Business moderator Neil Cavuto asked him about the impact of the media scrutiny on his campaign. \u201cWe should vet all candidates. I have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth,\u201d Carson proclaimed. \u201cPeople who know me know that I\u2019m an honest person.\u201d His closing statement was also a memorable break from the feisty tenor of the evening, coming right after Rubio and Cruz trumpeted their campaign websites. Carson, softly showed why he is connecting on the trail. \u201cIn the two hours of this \u2013 of this debate, five people have died from drug-related deaths, $100 million has been added to our national debt, 200 babies have been killed by abortionists, and two veterans have taken their lives out of despair,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a narrative that we can change, not we the Democrats, not we the Republicans, but we the people of America, because there is something special about this nation, and we must embrace it and be proud of it and never give it away for the sake of political correctness.\u201d Carson\u2019s debate strategy: Calm and cool JEB BUSH The former Florida governor improved, but he was still upstaged by the competition. After his widely panned debate performance last month, Bush got to work. He hired a media coach, got angrier on the campaign trail and attempted to reboot his struggling campaign with a new slogan: Jeb Can Fix It. The takeaway? Jeb Can (Sort of) Fix It. Bush forced his way into more speaking time, got his points across more clearly and concisely, and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 didn\u2019t pick a fight he wasn\u2019t going to win (against Rubio). But he also still appeared awkward at times and let up too easily where other candidates would have pressed further, adding to the impression that he lacks the verve to lead his party into the general election. And with several other candidates \u2013 namely Rubio \u2013 soaring above the field with exceptionally strong debate performances, Bush\u2019s slightly above-average performance just doesn\u2019t rank in the same category. Bush\u2019s two best moments came when he confronted Trump. Bush jumped in as Trump suggested the U.S. should stop being the policeman of the world to say that the billionaire \u201cis absolutely wrong on this.\u201d And on Trump\u2019s plan to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., Bush said \u201cit\u2019s just not possible and it\u2019s not embracing American values\u201d \u2013 drawing more applause. Opinion: Is GOP reality show over? DONALD TRUMP As he did in the last debate, Trump once again showed that he can be one man on the stump before a crowd of zealous supporters, and another when he\u2019s debating a range of issues before a national audience. Trump\u2019s tone was measured and his message was largely policy-centric. Even when he faced pointed criticism and pushback from his rival candidates \u2013 notably Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina \u2013 Trump didn\u2019t get personal. He challenged their contentions and stuck to his message: Yes, the federal government should deport all undocumented immigrants and build a wall, he insisted; No, the U.S. should not be the world\u2019s policeman. And while sticking with the debating style he first debuted at the CNBC debate, Trump even appeared to show some improvement \u2013 delivering longer and more in-depth responses to questions on everything from the economy to foreign policy. But some of Trump\u2019s persona bled out. When Carly Fiorina tried to get a word in, declared: \u201cWhy does she keep interrupting everybody?\u201d The crowd wasn\u2019t happy and booed. Trump: I \u2018loved doing the debate\u2019 CARLY FIORINA She\u2019s back. The former Fortune 500 CEO reclaimed her spot as one of the field\u2019s most effective and hard-hitting debaters \u2014 a quality that first hoisted her onto the main debate stage after a stand-out performance in the cycle\u2019s first primary debate. Fiorina played to her strengths as a business executive, status as an outsider and displayed her command of the biggest foreign policy issues confronting the U.S. Her sharp-elbowed strategy produced results as she nabbed her most impressive moment of the night when she jumped into a foreign policy debate between Trump and Bush \u2013 piling onto Bush\u2019s critique of the brash front-runner before putting forward her own credentials for the commander-in-chief post. Skipping from country to country in the Middle East after laying out specific steps she would take to bolster the U.S.\u2019s standing in the face of Russian aggression, Fiorina came away breathless, over time \u2013 but wildly successful. But there\u2019s a big footnote: Her previous strong debate performances didn\u2019t yield sustainable results because she failed to capitalize off her gains in the polls. She\u2019ll need to have a strategy ready this time. CNN\u2019s Reality Check team vets the candidates\u2019 claims JOHN KASICH A steady stream of interruptions. The Ohio governor didn\u2019t miss an opportunity to jostle his opponents and the moderators for more speaking time. As Trump defended his plan to deport all undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., Kasich looked to get in a word edgewise. \u201cMaria, can we comment on that? Can we comment on that?\u201d he asked a moderator in one of the rare occasions in which he actually asked \u2013 and got \u2013 permission to interject. But it\u2019s a strategy that Kasich has applied to previous debates \u2013 both taking on Trump and jumping in at every opportunity \u2013 without earning any real upward movement in the polls following the last debate. GOP debates policy \u2013 not personality RAND PAUL Rand Paul finally makes his case. The Kentucky senator with strong libertarian-leanings showed up at the Republican debate Tuesday night \u2013 diving into an impassioned defense of his foreign policy views, challenging the hawkish instincts of the Republican Party and most of his fellow contenders. Paul hasn\u2019t shined through in the previous debates, but a relatively long back and forth with the surging Rubio gave Paul the face time and the speaking time he needed to make his mark.

            "article_content": "Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz deliver strong performances at GOP presidential debate Candidates clash on national security, slam Hillary Clinton There were no scathing personal attacks, no sensational name-calling and no furious mud-slinging. The fourth Republican presidential debate of the campaign season marked a notable shift from the previous forums that were dominated by fireworks fueled by outsized personalities. The event, hosted by Fox Business, featured plenty of testy exchanges between the candidates on hot-button issues like immigration reform and national security. But the two-hour affair notably lacked the explosive personal confrontations as candidates sought to focus on drawing out their own policy views \u2014 and contrasting their profiles against Hillary Clinton. There was no single dominant performance as in the past when candidates such as Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio wowed audiences \u2013 and swiftly improved their place in the polls. Several candidates, including Rubio and Ted Cruz, were strong on the debate stage on Tuesday. And Jeb Bush, who has struggled in such environments, projected greater confidence, seeming to relish a confrontation with Donald Trump on national security. READ: Takeaways from the GOP debate One of the biggest questions heading into the evening was how Ben Carson would address the series of questions raised in recent weeks about his biography. The retired neurosurgeon and political newcomer appeared prepared with a ready quip, as he blasted the media. \u201cFirst of all, thank you not asking me what I said in the 10th grade,\u201d Carson said to applause and laughter. \u201cI appreciate that.\u201d He went on: \u201cI have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about.\u201d He accused the press of treating Clinton much more favorably. \u201cWhen I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that, \u2018No, this was a terrorist attack,\u2019 and then tells everybody else that it was a video, where I came from, they called that a lie,\u201d he said. Carson\u2019s comments came after CNN reported last week that nine childhood friends, classmates and neighbors who grew up with Carson said they had no memory of the anger or violence the candidate has described. Notably, Trump, the GOP\u2019s front-runner who is facing stiff competition from Carson, showed no interest in going after the neurosurgeon \u2013 despite delighting in slamming him at campaign events this week. The debate came at a crucial time in the 2016 race. Similar to Carson, Rubio is under intense scrutiny as his poll numbers have ticked up. But the moderators Tuesday did not bring up the Florida senator\u2019s use of a state Republican Party charge card \u2014 an issue that his critics have seized on. Meanwhile, the struggles of Bush \u2013 once viewed as the party\u2019s eventual front-runner but now stuck in the single digits \u2013 have created an opening that his peers are jockeying to fill. Bush has delivered underwhelming performances  in past debates, and on Tuesday appeared prepared to give punchier responses. While the event lacked some of the fireworks of previous debates, it did expose fundamental divides on immigration and foreign policy. READ: Carson\u2019s debate strategy: Calm and cool Bush and Trump butted heads on national security, disagreeing on the role for the U.S. in confronting the rise of ISIS. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to be the policemen of the world,\u201d said Trump, who has argued that the U.S. should let Russia take the lead in fighting ISIS in Syria. Bush quickly shot back. \u201cDonald is wrong on this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to be the world\u2019s policemen, but we sure as heck better be the world\u2019s leader.\u201d READ: Is Marco Rubio\u2019s Iowa operation strong enough to win? Carson, meanwhile, struggled when asked to address U.S. presence in Syria, offering a meandering answer. \u201cPutting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there,\u201d he said about President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to send 50 special operations forces to fight ISIS in Syria. \u201cThey\u2019re actually able to guide some of the other things that we\u2019re doing there.\u201d Immigration reform pitted those with more moderate views such as Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich against immigration hardliners like Cruz. Bush argued that mass deportation of undocumented people currently in the United States is \u201cjust not possible and it\u2019s not embracing American values.\u201d \u201cIt would tear communities apart and it would send a signal that we\u2019re not the kind of country America is,\u201d he said. Cruz appeared energized and aggressive in taking on his rivals. He made the case that following the law is not the same thing as lacking in compassion. \u201cEvery sovereign nation secures its borders and it is not compassionate to say we\u2019re not going to enforce the laws and we\u2019re going to drive down the wages for millions of hard-working American workers,\u201d the senator said. READ: Rubio\u2019s quip about welders gets torched Rubio, who had a standout debate performance last month in Boulder, Colorado, kicked off the prime-time showdown by arguing against raising the minimum wage \u2013 a popular view among Republicans \u2013 and pointing to the success of his own parents despite their humble backgrounds. \u201cIf you raise the minimum wage, you\u2019re going to make people more expensive than a machine,\u201d he said. Both Trump and Carson appeared to go one step further, saying wages in general were too high. Carson, the only African-American presidential candidate this cycle, said \u201chigh wages\u201d were at least partly to blame for high unemployment among black people. Trump argued that wages were \u201ctoo high,\u201d and that raising the minimum wage would hurt economic growth. Rubio also pressed for stronger vocational training, again seizing a moment to present himself as an advocate for the middle class. \u201cWe need more welders and less philosophers.\u201d Carson, Trump, Rubio, Cruz and Bush were joined by John Kasich, Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul for the prime-time showdown. READ: Republican candidates reject $15 minimum wage Four lower-tier candidates \u2014 Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum \u2014 kicked off the evening with a one-hour \u201cundercard\u201d debate. Christie and Huckabee had qualified for the main debates in previous gatherings. Christie, known for his bold style, used the earlier debate to repeatedly slam Clinton \u2013 part of a strategy to make the case that he could take on the Democratic front-runner during a general election. \u201cIf you listen to Hillary Clinton,\u201d Christie said, \u201cshe believes that she can make decisions for you better than you can make them for yourself.\u201d The New Jersey governor, whose political fortunes have fallen drastically following the state scandal dubbed \u201cBridgegate,\u201d also called on Republicans to train their fire on Clinton rather than each other. \u201cShe is the real adversary tonight, and we better stay focused as Republicans on her,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s coming for your wallet, everybody. Don\u2019t worry about Huckabee or Jindal, worry about her.\u201d Jindal made a contrasting case, insisting that not just any Republican was capable of taking on Clinton. \u201cLet\u2019s not just beat Hillary \u2013 let\u2019s elect a conservative,\u201d Jindal said, before going after Christie for his record in New Jersey. \u201cRecords matter.\u201d Tempers flared at the media when a moderator asked each of the candidates to name a Democratic member of Congress they admire the most. \u201cI think this is why people were so frustrated with the last debate, with these kinds of silly questions,\u201d Jindal shot back, adding that he would fire everyone in Washington as president. The other three candidates declined to engage the question, offering up unrelated answers. Lindsey Graham and George Pataki did not qualify for either debate.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton was at the front of people's minds at the Fox Business debate Tuesday Most candidates took aim at her economic policy or record as secretary of state Chris Christie made Clinton the focus of his attention during the undercard debate It was 12 against one at the Republican debates in Milwaukee. And the star of the show wasn\u2019t even on stage. Hillary Clinton has not yet won a single vote in the Democratic nominating contest, but the GOP candidates have called the race already. Every candidate in the prime-time show mentioned the Democratic front-runner at least once \u2013 and they didn\u2019t have good things to say. They called Clinton a disastrous secretary of state who helped President Barack Obama preside over a feckless foreign policy and as president, would come after Americans\u2019 wallets. Even the audience got into the act. Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo brought up Clinton\u2019s experience and \u201cimpressive resume,\u201d sparking boos and jeers from the crowd. For Republicans, the Clinton hits were chances for candidates to elevate themselves in comparison with the Democratic front-runner and tout their own credentials as the most likely Republican to topple her next year. READ: GOP debates policy \u2013 not personality It was also a sign that after a tough summer, the former secretary of state\u2019s campaign is acquiring the sheen of inevitability that was beginning to fade at this point in the 2008 race and that her operation is looking more and more like a general election effort. Jeb Bush, who needed a big night, used Clinton as an ideal foil. \u201cHillary Clinton has said that Barack Obama\u2019s policies get an A. Really? One in 10 people right now aren\u2019t working or have given up altogether,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an A. One in seven people are living in poverty. That\u2019s not an A. One in five children are on food stamps. That is not an A. It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do, but it\u2019s not the best America can do.\u201d Ben Carson, asked about media scrutiny of his personal history, shifted the question to Clinton, recalling the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi seizing on what Republicans say are inconsistencies to Clinton\u2019s public and private responses to the attack in 2012 revealed during a congressional hearing last month. \u201cWhen I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video,\u201d said Carson, accusing Clinton of lying. Former business executive Carly Fiorina has made Clinton a focus of her candidacy \u2013 making an argument that if she was the GOP nominee, she would defuse one of the top Democrat\u2019s major electoral assets \u2013 her gender. Fiorina asked the Republican audience at the debate to \u201cimagine a Clinton presidency\u201d which she said would see the military deteriorate and the Middle Class get crushed, before hinting at ethical questions which have haunted the ex-first lady and her husband. \u201cA Clinton presidency will corrode the character of this nation. Why? Because of the Clinton way. Carly Fiorina can beat Hillary Clinton. I will beat Hillary Clinton.\u201d Donald Trump also warned that Republicans couldn\u2019t risk a Clinton presidency, saying she had been the worst secretary of state in history. And Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who spent the night trying to insert himself into the middle of the action, much as he is struggling to grab a central role in the wider nominating race, used Clinton as a rallying cry for GOP unity. \u201cWe have got to have a CEO mentality and a way to beat Hillary Clinton and her allies in the fall,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cWhen the fall comes, and we run against Hillary \u2026. it would be a disaster if she was elected.\u201d READ: CNN\u2019s Reality Check team vets the candidates\u2019 claims When Bartiromo asked Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to assess Clinton\u2019s experience and \u201cimpressive resume,\u201d she was booed, but Rubio started to laugh, possibly unable to believe his luck at getting such a softball. He launched into his familiar and blistering stump speech critique of Clinton, saying \u201chumiliations\u201d heaped on the U.S. around the world were her fault. \u201cThis election is about the future,\u201d the 44-year-old Rubio said, setting up the conceit that his youth would make him the best possible candidate to take on the 68-year-old Clinton \u2013 a generational match-up that worries many Democrats. Rubio\u2019s fellow fortysomething, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, also managed to get in a shot. \u201cShe has a lot of experience, but her policies have been disastrous,\u201d Cruz said, adding that nothing embodied the \u201ccronyism\u201d of Washington like the Clintons. The Clinton-bashing started early, in the undercard debate. Chris Christie, the New Jersey Governor who is desperate for a leg up in the race, mentioned her over and over again. \u201cShe has made it very clear, she believes that she can make decisions for you better than you can make them for yourself,\u201d Christie said. \u201cBelieve me, Hillary Clinton\u2019s coming for your wallet, everybody.\u201d Christie also lashed the \u201cabsolutely weak and feckless foreign policy that was engineered by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama,\u201d and, not surprisingly had an idea for the best GOP candidate to take her on. \u201cThe fact is we need someone who knows how to beat Democrats, who knows how to beat Democrats in a Democratic area. I\u2019ve done it twice as governor of New Jersey, and Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t want one minute on that stage with me next September when I\u2019m debating her, and prosecuting her for her vision for America.\u201d WATCH: Fox Business debate in two minutes It was all too much for one candidate \u2013 Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. \u201cLook, we all agree Hillary Clinton is bad,\u201d he said. Of the 11 candidates on the stage all night, only former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee didn\u2019t mention Clinton. If Clinton\u2019s ears were burning throughout the evening, she wasn\u2019t letting on. But her campaign team \u2013 which has billed itself all along as an anti-GOP effort, partly to avoid offering her rival Bernie Sanders a role on the stage beside her, had a busy night. At one point, Clinton\u2019s team tweeted a gif of the Democratic front runner with her chin on her hand and an exasperated look on her face, taken during the Benghazi hearing. The intent was apparent to argue that the kind of rhetoric on display at the debate was just more of the same of what Democrats see as the same old tired attacks on the former secretary of state. And when Bush warned Republicans not to squabble over hard-line positions on immigration because they would bolster Clinton and trigger \u201chigh fives\u201d in her camp, her spokesman Brian Fallon was quick to offer a Tweet suggesting Clinton\u2019s delight in being center stage at a GOP debate and the level of confidence in her campaign. \u201cWe actually are doing high-fives right now,\u201d Fallon wrote.

            "article_content": "Democrats have struggled in non-presidential election cycles Since Obama's election in 2008, Democrats have lost 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats, nearly 1,000 state legislative seats and now 12 governor's offices In the wake of Democrats\u2019 shellacking in the midterms a year ago, party brass released a seven-page autopsy in an effort to explain why they can\u2019t seem to win big races if a presidential candidate isn\u2019t on the ballot. That document, issued by a 10-member task force in February, was a summary \u2013 but a full version with more detailed recommendations was supposed to follow in May. It never came. Democrats are still searching for answers. Tuesday, a Republican underdog \u2013 the bombastic, self-funding businessman Matt Bevin \u2013 snatched away a Kentucky governor\u2019s office that had been in Democratic hands for 40 of the last 44 years. Related: Election Day: Bevin wins in Kentucky, Ohio rejects pot Party honchos acknowledged that voters\u2019 disinterest in non-presidential elections is a problem they can\u2019t seem to solve. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi suggested that races for anything but the presidency just might not be sexy enough to draw the party\u2019s core voters to the polls. \u201cThe presidential race is the main event. It has everything: It has glamour, it has money, it has power \u2013 it\u2019s showbiz. It\u2019s an attraction,\u201d Pelosi said Thursday. \u201cAnd off years are like the lounge act. Who goes there \u2013 right?\u201d But if non-presidential elections are like seeing a play off Broadway or visiting a Las Vegas casino away from The Strip, their results have ways of handcuffing Democratic presidents, particularly in an era in which strategists in both parties acknowledge that winnable, independent voters are few and far between. Much of President Barack Obama\u2019s legislative agenda has been stuck since 2010, when Republicans won the House. He lost even more sway on Capitol Hill in 2014, when the GOP picked up the Senate majority. That\u2019s left him reliant on executive actions on issues like climate change and immigration that can\u2019t go as far as legislation would. And those rules and action are also subject to legal challenges and easy reversal by a future Republican president. Meanwhile, down-ballot losses have stymied the implementation of Obama\u2019s signature health care law in states like Virginia, where Gov. Terry McAuliffe failed to gain Democratic control of the state Senate this week and therefore won\u2019t be able to implement a Medicaid expansion. Related: What the election results mean for 2016 And losing state legislatures has meant losing influence in the process of redistricting \u2013 which allows for districts favorable to Republican congressional and state legislative candidates. The Obama era has been particularly brutal to Democrats. Since his election in 2008, the party has shed 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats, nearly 1,000 state legislative seats and now 12 governor\u2019s offices. There is reason for the party faithful to be optimistic: Democratic voters are certain to turn out at stronger rates in 2016\u2019s presidential race, and with the closest Senate races coming in usually-blue states like Illinois, Wisconsin and New Hampshire, the party could retake that chamber, too. Then, though, would come 2018 \u2013 and the same old problems. The Democratic National Committee has focused its recent efforts on building the party\u2019s voter-data operation and increasing its work directly with state Democratic parties. That coordination needs to grow dramatically, said Mitch Ceasar, the Democratic chairman in heavily-populated Broward County, Florida \u2013 who\u2019s also a DNC executive committee member and a former state party chairman. He said the focus should be electing Democratic state legislatures \u201cbecause if we don\u2019t do that, we lose the reapportionment.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some cataclysmic event \u2013 getting hit over the head with a 2-by-4 \u2013 to get them to say, \u2018We have to go out there and protect the bottom of the ballot so we can grow people up,\u2019\u201d Ceasar said. Ceasar suggested in an interview that the DNC launch and fund a national training program for state parties \u2013 which would then train local parties. A particular focus: Teaching the new voters the party has attracted in recent years the importance of voting in every race \u2013 not leaving the polling place with the first few boxes filled in an a massive \u201cundervote\u201d by failing to vote down-ballot. That problem reached record levels in 2008, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s training so you teach state and local parties how to successfully access the educational tools to make sure whoever you get there doesn\u2019t leave until it\u2019s all over,\u201d he said. Other Democrats pointed to messaging. \u201cI think it\u2019s communicating a clear message on policy and policy differences,\u201d said Holly Shulman, a Democratic strategist and former DNC official. The now nearly nine-month-old DNC task force document suggested a \u201cnational narrative project\u201d to advance the premise that electing Democrats everywhere \u2013 not just to top national offices \u2013 is what\u2019s necessary to promote some policy priorities. \u201cNo area of this review caused more debate or solicited more ideas than the belief that there is no single narrative that unites all of our work and the issues that we care about as a community of Democrats,\u201d the task force wrote. \u201cIt is strongly believed that the Democratic Party is loosely understood as a long list of policy statements and not as people with a common set of core values (fairness, equality, opportunity),\u201d the report said. \u201cThis lack of cohesive narrative impedes the party\u2019s ability to develop and maintain a lifelong dialogue and partnership with voters. Some Democrats said Kentucky\u2019s results aren\u2019t a useful check on where the two parties stand a year away from the presidential election. Their argument: The Democratic candidate, Attorney General Jack Conway, shied away from taking any Democratic-sounding positions. And two other statewide candidates, including failed 2014 Senate nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes as secretary of state and another Democrat as attorney general, actually won. Democrats also pointed to the success of an Ohio referendum that could lead to more evenly-drawn congressional districts and the election of three state Supreme Court judges in Pennsylvania who the party perceives as more likely to draw fair districts there, where the reapportionment process is in the hands of judges. \u201cEach race has its own thing,\u201d Shulman said. \u201cI think it really does have to do with the specifics of the race and the specifics of each cycle.\u201d The fact that pre-Election Day polls had shown a better outcome for Conway in Kentucky\u2019s governor\u2019s race had much to do with voter turnout in a very red state, Democratic strategists said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a Democrat running in a conservative state, you very often you don\u2019t end up leaning into your Democratic values or your Democratic policy positions,\u201d said prominent Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. \u201cAs a result, Democratic voters tend to be less excited and less enthused about showing up.\u201d Garin added that while Tuesday\u2019s results were \u201cdisappointing,\u201d they didn\u2019t speak to how the Democratic Party is positioned heading into 2016. \u201cThese are honestly very local elections driven by local considerations \u2013 they don\u2019t tell us very much about broad national trends,\u201d Garin said. \u201cCertainly not broad national trends in the kinds of places that will determine who will win the presidency in 2016.\u201d CNN\u2019s MJ Lee and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Chuck Schumer was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight that worked on comprehensive immigration legislation Rubio's \"fingerprints are all over that bill. It has a lot of Rubio imprints,\" Schumer said in a CNN interview Florida Sen. Marco Rubio can run away from immigration legislation as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination, but Sen. Chuck Schumer says he can\u2019t hide from it. As he has risen in the polls, Rubio has methodically sought to distance himself from the comprehensive immigration bill he coauthored more than two years ago. But Schumer, the veteran New York Democrat, is dragging him back into the fray, shining a spotlight on one of the 44-year-old\u2019s biggest vulnerabilities with the right as top Democrats seek to undermine the GOP senator\u2019s surging candidacy. \u201cHe was not only totally committed \u2013 he was in that room with us, four Democrats, four Republicans,\u201d Schumer told CNN Thursday in an interview in his Senate office. \u201cHis fingerprints are all over that bill. It has a lot of Rubio imprints.\u201d Schumer, the next Senate Democratic leader, painstakingly hashed out the immigration deal with Rubio and has previously avoided lashing out at the Florida Republican publicly. But as the presidential race heats up, Schumer is unloading the new line of criticism, saying Rubio was the main architect of the provision to provide a pathway to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants, something bound to give ammunition to his primary foes who call the measure \u201camnesty.\u201d Who's running for President? \u201cHe understood it, he molded it, he made it a tough path to citizenship,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cBut we all agreed to it, and it would have to be a tough path to citizenship. But he was all for it. \u201c Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said, \u201cit\u2019s no secret\u201d the freshman senator worked with Schumer and others on the controversial immigration bill. \u201cThat bill failed and has even less support now,\u201d Conant said. \u201cThe only way we can fix our immigration system is by first securing the borders.\u201d In the wide-ranging interview with CNN Thursday, a lively Schumer also boldly predicted a Democratic wave in 2016, with Hillary Clinton securing as many as 350 electoral votes and sweeping his party back into the Senate majority. He warned the Obama administration not to put \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Syria. He shed new light on his plans as the next Democratic leader, promising to be \u201cdirect\u201d with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with whom he has had a frosty relationship. And after breaking publicly with the White House over the Iran nuclear deal, Schumer said \u201cI worry\u201d the accord is making the United States less safe but he would not back further sanctions on the regime at this time. \u201cOverall I don\u2019t think we should undo the agreement before it starts even though I opposed it,\u201d Schumer said when asked about new sanctions legislation. As Clinton has seen her poll numbers falter amid the controversy surrounding her private email server, many in the party have grown unnerved that the Democratic frontrunner could blow the party\u2019s chance at taking back the White House. Not Schumer. The 64-year-old New Yorker was bullish about Clinton\u2019s prospects, saying that she would rout any of the GOP candidates who are seeking the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to win, and I\u2019ll stick my neck out,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to get 300, 325 maybe 350 electoral votes against any of the Republicans.\u201d Schumer added, \u201cThe hard right has such a grip on their party so \u2026 she is going to win and win big, and I think we\u2019ll also take back the Senate for that reason.\u201d But Clinton has seen many liberals rally behind the insurgent campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has recently stepped up his attacks against the former secretary of state\u2019s character for flip-flopping on policy issues. Schumer declined to say if Sanders should lay off those attacks, but he noted that the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist and Clinton have two very similar agendas. \u201cLook I have great respect for Bernie Sanders,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd let me tell you a lot of Bernie\u2019s platform isn\u2019t that far from Hillary\u2019s platform.\u201d In the general election, Democrats have looked towards Rubio as the toughest candidate for Clinton, given his polish on the stump and his ability to attract younger voters and offer a generational contrast. So Democrats have seized on two aspects of Rubio\u2019s short record in the Senate: His decision to abandon the immigration bill and his frequent absences in the Senate, including Thursday when he skipped a Senate intelligence briefing where officials discussed the downed Russian airliner. On immigration, Schumer said Rubio was \u201cproud\u201d of their comprehensive bill and \u201cran away from it so quickly\u201d even though he put \u201cso much work into it.\u201d Yet Schumer wouldn\u2019t go as far as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who has called on Rubio to resign because of his frequent absences. \u201cEvery one of us runs for election, a lot, and we try to do as many votes as we can,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cHe should be voting. The amount of votes he\u2019s missed is very bad.\u201d Schumer has been resistant about talking about the expectation that he will replace Reid as the Democratic leader after next November\u2019s elections. But despite his sharp criticism of Republicans in the interview in CNN, Schumer said he would try to usher in a new era of bipartisanship, something that has been lacking in a chamber often stuck in a state of partisan gridlock. The nearly 17-year Senate veteran singled out Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona as three Republicans with whom he would work closely to craft an agenda to \u201cget America moving again.\u201d Yet Schumer has had a contentious relationship with McConnell, the most powerful Republican, who, like Schumer, is his respective party\u2019s top political tactician. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll try to be direct with him; that\u2019s my way of nature,\u201d Schumer said of McConnell. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with him, and I\u2019ll say come and meet me partway.\u201d Schumer was far less charitable about his expectations for new House Speaker Paul Ryan. While Schumer has worked with Ryan on immigration and tax reform, he said that Ryan would be pulled to the far-right by the most conservative elements of his caucus. \u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d Schumer said of Ryan. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to prevail: The Paul Ryan who knows how to compromise or the Paul Ryan who has these very hard-right views on budget issues, tax issues and many other issues? My worry here is that the hard-right (Republicans will) whisper, \u2018I\u2019m with you, keep it up,\u2019 (and they) will have too much power and too much weight.\u201d After Schumer announced his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal in August, he faced a barrage of criticism from the left flank of his party and the White House \u2013 and he spoke sparingly about the matter to the media. But Schumer still opposes the deal and believes it could undermine the country\u2019s security interests. \u201cIt was not an easy judgment,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd those who were so sure it was the right thing to do and those who were so sure it was the wrong thing to do are different than me. I had to weigh it very, very carefully.\u201d Schumer, who represents a caucus strongly supportive of the deal and a pro-Israel constituency furiously opposed to it, said his decision boiled down to whether he believed the Iranian government will \u201cmoderate\u201d as a result of the accord, something he said Secretary of State John Kerry \u201cargued with me for a long time.\u201d \u201cUltimately the risk was too great, and I opposed the deal,\u201d Schumer said. Asked if he believed that the deal would make the country safer, Schumer added: \u201cI hope that those who disagreed with me are right but I worry they\u2019re not.\u201d But even as he broke with liberals on Iran, Schumer is firmly siding with the left against calls to send U.S. troops into Syria to help stem the rise of Islamic State militants. \u201cAnywhere we\u2019ve done that in the Middle East \u2013 it has not worked and the minute we leave it goes back to the same old status quo,\u201d Schumer said, praising the White House\u2019s current policy. \u201cI am dubious of any combat troops on the ground.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Marco Rubio reiterated Wednesday that he would end the program that shields undocumented immigrants brought here as children \"It will have to end. It can't be the permanent policy of the United States,\" Rubio said Marco Rubio reiterated Wednesday that he would end the program that shields undocumented immigrants brought here as children, a signature but controversial achievement of President Barack Obama. Rubio told reporters twice in New Hampshire that he would do so even if Congress does not put an end to the policy, guaranteed by a 2012 executive order, through comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cIt will have to end. It can\u2019t be the permanent policy of the United States,\u201d Rubio told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash after a town hall in Nashua. \u201cI\u2019ve said that consistently. I don\u2019t think we should be signing new people up to it. If you haven\u2019t applied by now, it\u2019s been three years, almost four, and I don\u2019t think, when it comes time to extend it, we should extend it.\u201d Immigration issues remain one of the Florida senator\u2019s biggest liabilities with the conservative base, and Rubio has walked a tight rope when explaining his current positions. As recently as 2013 Rubio backed immigration reform that would include a path to citizenship only to abandon it ahead of his presidential bid. He now says he believes immigration must be solved as part of a three-step, piecemeal process. In New Hampshire, Rubio called the deferred action program, or \u201cDACA,\u201d an \u201cunconstitutional policy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a supporter of immigration reform. I\u2019d like to see us make progress on that issue, but DACA cannot be the permanent policy of the United States,\u201d Rubio told Bash. \u201cI opposed it when the President announced it and I\u2019ve been consistent ever since.\u201d Democratic groups on Wednesday were gleeful to highlight Rubio\u2019s comments, which they perceive as a liability in a possible general election. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton tweeted that he was \u201cwrong.\u201d \u201cWe should not put 650,000+ promising young people at risk for deportation. Sen.

            "article_content": "GOP candidates complain that the moderators take too much air time and interrupt those on stage The Republican presidential hopefuls also said the moderators are biased against conservatives Each candidate has reasons for wanting a different format that most suits his or her campaign So much for a smooth Republican debate season. Just three debates in, the saga over the CNBC Republican showdown in Colorado last week has dashed the hopes of party bosses that the storm of controversy and recrimination over debates that clouded the 2012 campaign \u2013 and hampered eventual nominee Mitt Romney \u2013 could be avoided. Last time around, candidates griped that there were too many debates \u2013 there were 20 in all \u2013 and that their frequency and need for preparation interrupted campaigns and elevated long-shot hopefuls who had no chance of winning the nomination in the media spotlight. This time, especially following the CNBC debate Wednesday, candidates are complaining that the moderators are taking too much airtime, keep interrupting those on stage and are biased against conservatives. Front-runners say that those stuck in single digits in the polls shouldn\u2019t even be in the debates while the dark horses complain that being confined to second-tier events is killing their campaigns. The CNBC Republican debate in three minutes But while the candidates have been quick to jump on the moderators and the networks hosting them, in truth each candidate has reasons for wanting a different format that most suits his or her campaign. The result has been another round of controversy and recrimination. Sunday\u2019s meeting of campaign operatives produced a tentative truce with a modest set of demands for changes to the format of future debates, but even that initiative split the GOP field. By Monday night, Donald Trump, John Kasich, Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina had declined to sign on. The issue is likely to persist as long as the GOP field remains bloated, guaranteeing constant tensions as each candidate jockeys for position \u2013 whether for more time on screen or fewer minutes in the hot seat. Here is how the Republican White House hopefuls are playing the debate over debates for their own advantage. What he wants: Trump has made no secret of his desire for cuts in the size of the top-tier GOP debate. He\u2019s publicly warned the likes of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul they shouldn\u2019t even be sharing a stage with him. \u201cThere are too many people on the debate stage. It should be five. Let the other eight or nine or 10 go onto the second debate,\u201d Trump\u2019s special counsel Michael Cohen said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Monday. Trump, who faded during a three-hour-long debate on CNN in September, has also led calls for the events to be limited to two hours. Why he wants it: The billionaire front-runner is a master of manipulating the media and doesn\u2019t want to share his spotlight. The more candidates he can exclude from the stage, the less competition he has to confront head on at the top. Memorable quotes from the Republican debate What he wants: The former neurosurgeon has called for the GOP to abandon the current format for televised debates. He says journalist moderators ask \u201cgotcha\u201d questions and wants debates to be stripped from the networks and carried on YouTube or Facebook and become more of a forum-style event, according to The Wall Street Journal. Why he wants it: Since Carson is not a professional politician, he has far less experience in the cut-and-thrust of debate than many of his competitors. His soft-spoken, laid-back style seems a better fit for less adversarial settings. And some of his answers on the details of policy have been shaky during the past two debates, giving him even more incentive to avoid such scrutiny. What he wants: Rubio is happy to take the chance to turn tough questions or those he deems unfair into a chance to lash the \u201cliberal\u201d media. He\u2019s called the moderators of the CNBC debate biased and says they asked trivial questions. And he didn\u2019t wait until the showdown was over last week before castigating the media as a de facto arm of the Democratic Party. \u201cThe Democrats have the ultimate super PAC \u2026 called the mainstream media for every single day,\u201d Rubio said while on the debate stage. READ: 2016 Republicans vs. the media Why he wants it: Rubio wants to have his cake and eat it, too. He\u2019s got strong political reasons to slam the media, as doing so delights conservative voters who harbor suspicions about his record, including on immigration. But the Florida senator also wants to ensure GOP debates remain on platforms such as cable television outlets that draw huge audiences and are introducing him to a wide spectrum of voters before a possible general election campaign. Rubio has improved his performance in each of the three Republican debates so far and his sharp political skills \u2013 evidenced in his putdown of Jeb Bush in Colorado \u2013 are ideally suited to such an adversarial setting. What he wants: Jeb Bush probably cannot wait until the next Republican debate, on November 10, to try to dispel memories of his lifeless and disjointed showing in the CNBC clash. He partly blamed the moderators of the CNBC debate for his woes, telling NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that the event was \u201cweird\u201d and that he was stopped from answering a Rubio slapdown by moderators. Why he wants it: Bush is fighting a narrative of decay that is beginning to envelop his campaign after his disaster in the Rockies. He must seize on any and all debate opportunities to try to ignite a comeback narrative. What he wants: The New Jersey governor has one thing to say to those who complain that the debates are unfair: Bring it on. \u201cDo not count me in this group that is doing this moaning and complaining about this,\u201d Christie told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Monday. \u201cThe presidency is almost never scripted. We shouldn\u2019t have these debates scripted either.\u201d Christie: Not 'moaning and complaining' about debates Why he wants it: Christie has his own comeback narrative to work on as he languishes at 1% in national polls. So any time he can get into a debate with the front-runners, he benefits \u2013 as he did after a strong performance in the Colorado debate. Christie is another candidate who does well when the back-and-forth heats up, so he would join a debate every week if he could. Debate appearances also allow him to exploit the \u201cstraight shooter\u201d persona he adopted as governor of the Garden State and which he is using to try to haul himself into contention in the New Hampshire primary \u2013 his best chance for a decent result in an early voting state. What he wants: Thank the Texas senator for getting this ball rolling. Cruz, using the forensic debating skills honed at Harvard Law School and as one of the most talented Supreme Court litigators of his generation, lacerated the CNBC debate as it was still going on. He followed up that coup by demanding debates hosted by the high priests of the conservative talk radio scene \u2013 Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Mark Levin. GOP candidates skewer debate moderators Why he wants it: Cruz, who is quietly building a strong challenge for the nomination, is keen to do anything he can to dominate the conservative voting bloc, which also happens to revere the trio of talk show hosts. Though his rivals appear unlikely to allow it to happen, such a spectacle would leave Cruz basking in reflected glory. What she wants: \u201cI\u2019ll debate anyone, any time, any place,\u201d the only woman in the GOP field tweeted Monday. Fiorina would also be keen to get key conservatives into the mix. In another tweet, she said that conservative radio host Glenn Beck should be considered. Why she wants it: In a sense, Fiorina\u2019s campaign barely exists off the debate stage. Her fiery showing in the undercard debate on Fox in August nudged her poll numbers up sufficiently to get her into the top-tier debate CNN hosted in September. But away from the debate stage, Fiorina has struggled to keep in the public eye, and her hopes of a future in Republican politics rely on as much exposure as possible. What he wants: The Ohio governor is another candidate who wants more debates and is seeking the moral high ground by being happy to take any question that comes up. He told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday that he is \u201cthe governor of the seventh-largest state in America, and I have had so many questions thrown at me over the course of my time.\u201d READ: Republican debate: Winners and losers Why he wants it: Kasich is billing himself as the kind of candidate the Republicans need, someone who can win his own crucial general election swing state and others like it. So parrying hostile questions from moderators that other candidates consider biased and reaching out to the vast cable television audience watching the debates makes strategic sense. What he wants: Trust the libertarian Republican to have an idea far from the mainstream. The Kentucky senator and veteran filibusterer joked that he\u2019d back a 13-hour debate and give each candidate an hour to talk. He says having no moderator at all would be worth looking at and hit out at \u201cgotcha\u201d questions. Why he wants it: At this point, with his campaign falling well short of expectations, the more time before a national audience Paul can get, the better. What he wants: Mike Huckabee, the former cable news pundit and Arkansas governor, said on Fox News after Wednesday\u2019s debate that changes that were needed in the debate format because running for president was a serious business and candidates shouldn\u2019t be part of a TV station\u2019s effort to drive up ratings. READ: GOP debate revolt crumbles Why he wants it: Huckabee\u2019s campaign has barely made a ripple this time around, after he won the Iowa caucuses in 2008 on the way to coming second in the GOP delegate count. So any publicity is good publicity and Huckabee\u2019s brand of folksy humor is tailor-made for the debate stage. What they want: Each man, stuck in the purgatory of undercard debates, wants a chance to hit prime time. South Carolina Sen. Graham, for instance, wants two GOP debates of seven candidates each. \u201cWe have too many people on one stage and too few on the other,\u201d Graham told CNN on Monday. Former New York Gov. Pataki believes that if Americans only get to see him, they will view him as a potential commander in chief.

            "article_content": "Axiom Strategies, a firm owned by Cruz's campaign manager, has been hired to help take out Sen. John McCain in his GOP primary State Sen. Kelli Ward is launching an insurgent bid against the 28-year Senate veteran and former Republican presidential candidate The National Republican Senatorial Committee has flatly warned that any firm helping a primary foe take out a GOP incumbent would be blacklisted It\u2019s no longer just Ted Cruz angering Republican party leaders. It\u2019s now the company he keeps. A firm owned by Cruz\u2019s campaign manager has been hired to help take out Sen. John McCain in his GOP primary, inflaming tensions with party leaders that have grown more pronounced since the Texas firebrand announced his presidential campaign earlier this year. The Kansas City-based firm, Axiom Strategies, was founded by Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe. According to campaign finance filings reviewed by CNN, the firm has recently received roughly $60,000 in payments for consulting services from the campaign of state Sen. Kelli Ward, who is launching an insurgent bid against the 28-year Senate veteran and former GOP presidential candidate. Cruz officials said that the senator had no involvement in the firm\u2019s work. Roe referred questions to Axiom, which said that he has been working full-time on Cruz\u2019s campaign since February and has had no involvement in the Arizona Senate race. But the connection is the latest development in a long-running feud between Cruz and party leaders, a battle that has become central to his campaign for the presidential nomination. The National Republican Senatorial Committee \u2013 faced with defending 24 GOP Senate seats, including some in decidedly blue territory \u2013 has flatly warned that any firm helping a primary foe take out a GOP incumbent would be blacklisted. \u201cOur policy is clear,\u201d said Kevin McLaughlin, deputy executive director of the party committee. \u201cThe NRSC will not work with anyone who works against Senate Republican incumbents.\u201d A person familiar with Axiom\u2019s activities said the firm was looking at severing its work with Ward because its resources were stretched too thin to meet the candidate\u2019s needs. Cruz has become the scourge of his party leaders, increasingly calling out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in blunt terms and lashing his colleagues for cutting deals with Democrats. And if his colleagues despise him, it\u2019s something he\u2019s more than happy to tout on the campaign trail where voters view Washington with disgust. \u201cAs we look back over the last 10 months, one is left with the conclusion \u2013 and a rather shocking conclusion \u2013 that Majority Leader McConnell has proven to be the most effective Democratic leader in modern times,\u201d Cruz said on the Senate floor last week, as he lambasted a budget deal cut between GOP leaders and the White House. A spokesman for the GOP leader declined to comment on Cruz\u2019s speech. On the campaign trail, Cruz has taken a different tack than the one shown against McConnell, something that seems to be playing to his benefit as he remains in the top tier of contenders for the nomination. He has refused to attack most of his fellow GOP rivals \u2013 in an apparent attempt to showcase himself as a unifying figure who can encourage his opponents\u2019 supporters to jump ship. Cruz has been especially reserved with competitors whom he views as in his ideological lane. When asked this past weekend in Iowa if he had any problem with controversial research on fetal tissue conducted by Ben Carson \u2013 a conservative whom Cruz\u2019s team is watching closely given his fundraising might \u2013 the freshman senator paused before declining to weigh in. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Ben Carson,\u201d said Cruz, a former Texas solicitor general. \u201cWhen it comes to defending life, there is no candidate in this field that has a stronger record.\u201d The sole exception has been Jeb Bush, who Cruz has seen as a useful foil and as a stand-in for the Washington establishment. Cruz may have abandoned his verbal jab at Bush in his stump speech this summer \u2014 the only presidential candidate he would mention by name \u2013 but he has continued to use Bush as ammo for his invectives, at times saluting the former Florida governor for his \u201ccandor\u201d in supporting Common Core and a path to citizenship. Cruz likes to chide media who invite \u201cRepublican-on-Republican violence,\u201d but he has also pledged to draw more contrasts as \u201ccampaign seasons\u201d change. Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Cruz, said that the senator will \u201cnot engage in personal attacks,\u201d though he will showcase policy differences between him and his rivals. \u201cThe senator hasn\u2019t hesitated to shine a line on Washington\u2019s failures since arriving in Washington,\u201d Frazier said. Of late, Cruz has slipped up and said that Trump won\u2019t be the GOP nominee \u2013 a comment aides have characterized as perhaps inarticulate but not meaningful. Cruz has effectively \u2013 and successively \u2013 taunted fellow Sen. Rand Paul by arguing that it is Cruz who is the true successor to the legacy of Ron Paul. And he has even began to tangle with Rubio by pointing out the Floridian\u2019s work with the Gang of Eight immigration negotiators \u2013 singling out Rubio last week during a Fox News interview. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear on immigration: I led the fight against Obama\u2019s amnesty, against the Gang of Eight which was championed by Barack Obama, by Chuck Schumer and by Marco Rubio,\u201d Cruz said on Fox News. Poll: New leadership in Congress won\u2019t fix broken D.C. Even as he\u2019s sparred repeatedly with GOP senators, the 44-year-old Cruz has resisted aiding tea party challengers in their quests to unseat Republican incumbents. In the aftermath of the 2013 government shutdown fight, which many GOP senators blamed him for starting, Cruz privately told his colleagues that he would not try to defeat them in their primaries or fundraise for the group, Senate Conservatives Fund, which was at the time targeting an array of sitting senators. \u201cSen. Cruz is in the middle of his own presidential campaign, which is where his focus will remain,\u201d Frazier said. McCain, the 79-year-old chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is the biggest target for conservative groups, who have seized on his history of working with Democrats, particularly on immigration. But so far, influential conservative activists are not yet convinced that his main primary foe \u2013 Ward, a physician and state senator since 2013 \u2013 would be viable in a 2016 primary bid. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time McCain and Cruz have clashed. He memorably called Cruz, Paul and Rep. Justin Amash \u201cwacko birds\u201d in March 2013. \u201cThey were elected, nobody believes that there was a corrupt election \u2026 .\u201d McCain told the Huffington Post. \u201cBut I also think that when, you know, it\u2019s always the wacko birds on right and left that get the media megaphone.\u201d He later apologized for the remark. Roe\u2019s firm, Axiom Strategies, has tried to help Ward gain her footing. According to Federal Election Commission filings, Axiom received monthly retainers of $5,000 from Ward\u2019s campaign from June through August, with an additional $20,000 for media production and other fees for research. A subsidiary of Axiom also received more than $17,000 for renting lists and printing costs. While Axiom is now trying to help Ward find another general consultant to keep up with her needs, one official with the Kansas City-based firm said that Roe has been fully engaged with Cruz\u2019s campaign since he moved to Houston with his family in February. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him in KC once since (February) \u2013 at a Royals game,\u201d said Travis Smith, vice president of Axiom Strategies. \u201cHe was not involved in the Ward race whatsoever.\u201d Even so, McCain is not taking his race lightly. In 2010, facing primary opposition from the right, he ran an expensive, scorched-earth effort against radio host and former Rep. J.D. Hayworth. In an interview with CNN, McCain said he was planning a wave of positive ads to spotlight his record \u2013 and he would not rule out launching any negative ads against Ward, who has raised just over $500,000. \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the unhappiness that\u2019s out there \u2013 and it\u2019s at Washington. My view to a large degree is that it\u2019s justified,\u201d said McCain, who has nearly $5 million in the bank. \u201cI am working harder than I have in any Senate election since I first ran.\u201d How Paul Ryan unified a fractured GOP",

            "article_content": "Marco Rubio fended off an attack from Jeb Bush and then hit the Republican establishment, Democrats and the media Ted Cruz, Rubio, Trump and Chris Christie all went after CNBC's moderators The third Republican presidential debate is in the books after the top 10 leading GOP candidates debated for more than two hours. 2016 election candidates With fewer than 100 days until the first ballots are cast, the CNBC-hosted event was a critical test for many of the campaigns reaching the make-or-break point of their campaigns. A few candidates rose to the moment with strong performances that could bolster their standings in the polls and their pad their campaigns\u2019 coffers. But not everyone is leaving Colorado with a smile on their face. Seething GOP candidates escalate their CNBC grievances Here\u2019s our take on the night\u2019s winners and losers: Marco RUBIO The gloves are off. The young senator from Florida handily eclipsed his one-time mentor Jeb Bush, proving that he is more than ready for the big leagues. His strong night started off after Bush dug into him over his poor voting attendance record in the Senate. Rubio not only fended off the offensive, but returned in kind with a searing attack. \u201cThe only reason why you\u2019re doing it now is because we\u2019re  running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI\u2019m not running against Governor Bush, I\u2019m not running against anyone on this stage.  I\u2019m running for president.\u201d Moments from Marco Rubio's career From there, Rubio was off to the races, hitting the Republican establishment, Democrats and the media. \u201cThe Democrats have the ultimate super PACs: they\u2019re called the mainstream media,\u201d Rubio said after Trump railed against the influence of those outside groups on the political process, effectively stealing Trump\u2019s thunder on the matter. (Rubio is benefiting from an outside group boosting his candidacy, which was not mentioned.) And he pressed on with strong responses that tilted toward policy and his own success story as a son of immigrants as he fielded questions about his personal finances, the economy and immigration. The performance is one that\u2019s likely to pay off at just the right moment as Rubio has been rising in the polls. Opinion: Rubio steals the show, while Bush fades Ted CRUZ The firebrand conservative did Wednesday what he does best: He saw his moment, carefully prepared a response as he patiently waited his turn, and then brought the crowd to raucous applause with the reddest of red meat: the liberal media. Moments from Ted Cruz's career Cruz set the theme for the debate \u2013 and post-debate spin \u2013 with his fiery tirade against the CNBC moderators and the media more broadly. \u201cThe questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don\u2019t trust the media,\u201d the Texas senator said as the audience roared with approval. \u201cThis is not a cage match,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd you look at the questions: \u2018Donald Trump are you a comic book villain? Ben Carson can you do math? John Kasich will you insult two people over here? Marco Rubio why don\u2019t you resign? Jeb Bush why have your numbers fallen?\u2019 How about talking about the substantive issues people care about?\u201d Republican debates in Colorado But as he told a moderator who looked to reclaim the time, he wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cThe contrast with the Democratic debate where every fawning questions from the media was which of you was more handsome and wise,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me be clear, the men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.\u201d Cruz had a double-win. He both slammed the common enemy of the right \u2013 the mainstream media \u2013 and maintained his persona as a candidate who has avoided attacking his fellow competitors, almost appearing to defend them. Couple Cruz\u2019s strong performance on Wednesday night with his campaign\u2019s quietly effective ground operation in the early states and beyond, and the Texas senator may have just bumped his stock in the race. The GOP presidential debate decoded John KASICH As he fielded the first question of the night \u2014 name your greatest weakness \u2013 Kasich didn\u2019t even bother to feign a response. Instead, he went on offense, delivering a fiery \u2013 yet veiled \u2013 excoriation of the non-politician candidates (read: Donald Trump & Ben Carson) who have been leading the GOP presidential pack. John Kasich's political career \u201cMy great concern is that we are on the verge of perhaps picking someone who cannot do this job. I\u2019ve watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave our senior citizens out, out in the cold. I\u2019ve heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 (million) people here from this country out of this country, splitting families. I\u2019ve heard about tax schemes that don\u2019t add up that put our kids in a deeper hole than they are today,\u201d Kasich said. Along with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Bush and Rubio, Kasich is in the group of moderate Republicans who have been competing for establishment support \u2013 and financial backing \u2013 trying to make the case that they are best prepared to defeat the party\u2019s conservative alternative and that they have the best chance at defeating Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, in the general election. Throughout the night, Kasich delivered a mixture of slamming what he deemed to be the unrealistic proposals of some of his competitors \u2013 \u201cThis is the fantasy that I talked about\u2026these plans would put us trillions of dollars in debt\u201d \u2013 while also continuously pivoting to his record as a governor and as a member of Congress who worked to balance the federal budget. 2016 Republicans vs. the media Donald TRUMP Trump put on a different kind of show on Wednesday \u2013 in fact, he didn\u2019t put on much of a show at all. The brash billionaire showed a softer, more reserved and even more presidential side at the CNBC debate, refraining from the personal attacks on other candidates that have characterized his past debate performances and ditching his penchant for theatrics. The result was a win for Trump, who may have assuaged concerns of some voters skeptical that Trump has the temperament to be president. That\u2019s despite the fact that Trump took heavy incoming fire from the outset from CNBC moderator John Harwood, who asked whether Trump\u2019s candidacy was \u201ca comic book version of a presidential campaign.\u201d Donald Trump's empire Trump simply said the question was \u201cnot a very nicely asked\u201d one and \u2014 instead of flipping into his default attack mode \u2014 Trump played up the benefits of his proposals, which he continued to insist are achievable. And when Trump did go on the attack \u2013 twice against Kasich \u2013 it was with substance, not personal barbs. He knocked Kasich for his time as an executive at Lehman Brothers and raised doubts over Kasich\u2019s role in Ohio\u2019s economic successes; given the role fracking has played in the state\u2019s economy. The candidate who has been prone to veering off on tangents stuck to his message throughout the evening. Trump touted his record as an effective negotiator and businessman while continuing to highlight the fact that he is not supported by outside groups or special interests. The biggest debate moments in GIFs Chris CHRISTIE The New Jersey governor showed throughout the night that he can handle himself well in a debate, but his breakout moment didn\u2019t come until late in the night, when he effectively schooled Jeb Bush on how to effectively field a question about fantasy football gambling. Chris Christie: New Jersey's other Boss After Bush gave a rambling response that suggested fantasy football should in some form be regulated, Christie jumped in with a swaggering incredulity: \u201cAre we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?\u201d Christie said as the crowd laughed. \u201cWait a second: we have $19 trillion in debt, we have people out of work, we have ISIS and al-Qaeda attacking us. And we\u2019re talking about fantasy football? Can we stop?\u201d Beyond that moment, Christie consistently found the right moments to interject himself in the debate and made a point of staring right into the camera, as if to take his message directly to voters \u2013 an effective touch. Fact-checking the candidates\u2019 claims Jeb BUSH For a campaign that began as a sure bet for the Republican nomination, Bush\u2019s White House bid could not have appeared in more dire straits than it did Wednesday. But hey, at least Bush is 7-0 in his fantasy football league. Silver linings. Even without Trump\u2019s consistent attacks that Bush is too \u201clow-energy\u201d to be president, Bush appeared to fade away into the background as other candidates jostled with the moderators as they eyed every opportunity to inject themselves into the debate. Memorable quotes from the Republican debate When he did go on offense with a targeted barb against Rubio\u2019s voting attendance record, he failed to jump back in after Rubio deflected the attack \u2013 giving Rubio the win on what could have been a strong moment for the former governor who desperately needed a breakout moment. Even some of his fiercest backers, like CNN political commentator Ana Navarro, couldn\u2019t hide their disappointment. \u201cI\u2019m pretty damn glum tonight,\u201d Navarro said after the debate. \u201c(Bush has) gotta take the next 10 days\u2026to really figure out how to dominate in the debates.\u201d Bush addressed the criticism later Thursday night in an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, saying: \u201cI\u2019m running for president. If they\u2019re looking for entertainer in chief, I\u2019m probably not the guy.\u201d Jeb Bush's life CNBC The network and its hosts on Wednesday took more incoming than anyone on stage as candidates from Cruz to Carson slammed the moderators for questions they deemed unfair. Even the audience got in on the act. The moderators repeatedly looked to corner the candidates on unseemly skeletons from their past, but the candidates would have none of it \u2013 rallying together to slam the moderators\u2019 questions and the mainstream media overall. As moderator Carl Quintanilla continued to press Carson on his association with a controversial nutritional supplement company, asking if it speaks \u201cto your vetting process or judgment in any way,\u201d the audience erupted in boos. \u201cSee? They know,\u201d a vindicated Carson said. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus took to the spin room as soon as the debate concluded to pan CNBC and the moderators\u2019 performance, saying the network \u201cshould be ashamed\u201d of its handling of the third GOP debate. \u201cI was very disappointed in the moderators. I\u2019m disappointed in CNBC,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought they would bring forward a pretty fair forum here tonight. But I think it was one gotcha question, one personal low blow after another.\u201d Opinion: Debate coach: CNBC\u2019s atrocious debate Ben CARSON Carson hasn\u2019t been one to make a big splash at the Republican debates. He didn\u2019t during the CNBC debate either \u2013 but he didn\u2019t necessarily need to. Ben Carson's career in politics The retired neurosurgeon has been surging in the polls amid a slew of controversial comments by remaining his low-key, authentic self. And as he has become the front-runner in Iowa and the GOP pack leader in one national poll released Tuesday, Carson rested comfortably atop his new perch, remaining unflinching as the moderators put his plans to a tough test of scrutiny. Carson didn\u2019t do much to dispel criticism that he has only a surface-level understanding of the issues and that his plans are overly broad, but he remained himself \u2013 and that\u2019s likely to be just fine for the more than 22% to 26% of Republican voters who have said they support him in recent polls.

            "article_content": "Just hours before the third Republican debate, Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign released a hard-hitting video against one of his rivals, but it\u2019s not someone who will be on the stage Wednesday night. The highly-produced video goes after Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, portraying her as a \u201cthird-term Obama,\u201d with ominous music playing in the background. Video of trash on the ground, homelessness and smoke in the air are just some of the images that are seen while juxtaposed with footage from Clinton in the Democratic debate. The 1:45 minute video, \u201cFailed Agenda,\u201d shows a clip of Clinton giving Obama the letter grade of \u201cA\u201d and praising the executive action he\u2019s taken on immigration, vowing, as she did in the debate, to go even \u201cfurther\u201d on the issue.

CNN has reached out to the Clinton campaign for response to the video. The second half of the video takes a more uplifting \u2013 though still dramatic \u2013 tone, focusing on Bush\u2019s pledges at campaign events to \u201cfix\u201d Washington. While Bush has slipped into the single digits in the polls and won\u2019t hold a center spot at the debate, the video\u2019s release signals his campaign\u2019s strategy to stay focused on the general election and paint him as the candidate most electable and capable of facing the eventual Democratic nominee.",

But she added that she\u2019s glad that the former Florida Gov. is \u201cexcited to watch the show,\u201d Benoist added. Last week Bush was thrown a softball while speaking at an event in Las Vegas after nearly an hourlong discussion on serious policy: Who is your favorite Marvel superhero? Badass women of sci-fi Bush was amused that he was being asked the question but struggled to come up with an immediate answer. And then, as he confessed after the fact, dug himself into a hole. \u201cI like watching the movies. I wish I owned Marvel, as someone that believes in capitalism,\u201d Bush said, speaking at the Libre Forum in North Las Vegas. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m kinda old school,\u201d he continued. \u201cI like the old school guys like Batman, a little dark these days.\u201d But then he kept going, saying that he saw an ad for the new CBS show \u201cSupergirl\u201d featuring former \u201cGlee\u201d actress Melissa Benoist. \u201cI saw it when I was working out this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cShe looked kinda \u2026 she looked pretty hot. I don\u2019t know which channel it\u2019s on, but I\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d He paused, letting the audience laugh, then added: \u201cThat\u2019ll make news.\u201d Supergirl, it should be noted, is a character from Marvel\u2019s rival comic universe DC, as is Batman. It was a moment of levity for the audience after listening to Bush talk about his plans to grow the economy and tackle complicated issues such as immigration, the debt, and foreign relations with Latin America. The forum was sponsored by the Libre Initiative, an effort backed by David and Charles Koch and aimed to lure more Hispanics into the Republican column by promoting conservative principles. The group has previously held forums with Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Rand Paul. Bush opened up the event speaking in Spanish about how he studied Latin American affairs at the University of Texas. Then he switched to English to add: \u201cI had a Latin American affair. It was with my wife, Columba.\u201d He highlighted his experiences living in Venezuela and Miami, as well as the bicultural family he started with his Mexican wife, to demonstrate his appeal to Hispanic voters. Donald Trump\u2019s attacks force Jeb Bush out of his malaise Though he has faced criticism from Donald Trump for speaking Spanish on the campaign trail, Bush has embraced his ties to the Hispanic community. It\u2019s an aspect of his campaign that he hopes will boost his electability and convince primary voters that he can win in a general election. During the \u201cSupergirl\u201d moment at the end, Daniel Graza, the group\u2019s executive director and a former member of the George W. Bush administration, was moderating the discussion and tried to move on to the next question as the audience was laughing. But he kept laughing himself.  \u201cI\u2019m trying to move quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah you want to get me out of my hole I just dug?\u201d Bush joked.",

            "article_content": "Trump flung criticism at politicians spanning the spectrum But, he said, \"I will be a great unifier for our country\" Donald Trump believes he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be a force for bipartisanship, but in an interview this weekend neither Republicans nor Democrats escaped a barrage of attacks from the GOP presidential candidate. Who's running for President? 2016 election candidates Trump flung criticism at politicians spanning the spectrum from presidential primary opponents Jeb Bush and Ben Carson to the Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and the man he hopes to succeed, President Barack Obama, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that aired Sunday on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d And he lamented the House Select Committee on Benghazi\u2019s questioning of Clinton, a hearing he called \u201cvery partisan\u201d that \u201churts both parties\u201d and \u201churts the country.\u201d \u201cThe level of hatred between Republicans and Democrats was unbelievable. The level of \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m going to unify. This country is totally divided. Barack Obama has divided this country unbelievably.  And it\u2019s all, it\u2019s all hatred, what can I tell you. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it\u2026I\u2019ve gotten along with Democrats and I\u2019ve gotten along with Republicans. And I said, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Tapper asked Trump if his presidency would result in an era of bipartisanship. The many facial expressions of Donald Trump \u201cI absolutely think so,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI will be a great unifier for our country.\u201d Trump says world would be better with dictators still in power While Clinton has taken flak for what she\u2019s described as a tongue-in-cheek statement that the enemies she\u2019s most proud of having are Republicans, Trump said he doesn\u2019t consider Clinton an enemy \u2013 simply, \u201can opponent.\u201d Still, for all the talk of bipartisanship and unity, Trump did not pull punches as he vigorously took on his opponents. Trump hit Bush, the former governor of Florida, and Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, with the same line of attack \u2013 one he has frequently used against Bush, but has only just begun using against Carson, whose reserved and calm tone strongly contrasts with Trump\u2019s brash appeal. \u201c(Bush is) a low-energy person. By the way, Ben Carson is a very low-energy person. We need high-energy people,\u201d Trump told Tapper. \u201cI think Ben Carson is a very low-energy person. Actually, I think Ben Carson is lower energy than Jeb, if you want to know the truth. We need strong energy.\u201d Trump\u2019s dipping poll numbers in Iowa Trump also knocked both Bush and Carson for the support they receive from super PACs, groups that can take in unlimited amounts of money. The developer dinged super PACs as a \u201cbig fat scam\u201d and a \u201cdisaster\u201d in the \u201cState of the Union\u201d interview, a line of criticism that he brought out more arduously than ever this weekend, just days after the super PAC backing his candidacy shuttered its operation after the group\u2019s ties to the campaign drew scrutiny last week. But Trump suggested that he may turn his sights away from Bush and toward Carson. That\u2019s because Carson is now the man to beat in Iowa, stealing first place from Trump (who was relegated to second place) in two polls released Thursday and Friday. \u201cThe thing with Ben is he\u2019s got a very good PAC, and he\u2019s got people running his PAC, and in my opinion, he\u2019s got people all over Iowa from his PAC, and they are running \u2013 Ben doesn\u2019t even go to Iowa that much. And he\u2019s doing well in Iowa?\u201d Trump said. \u201cI did talk about Jeb because I thought Jeb was going to be the front-runner. Obviously, he\u2019s no longer the front-runner. I probably won\u2019t talk about him so much anymore.\u201d In a previously released segment of this interview, Trump also knocked Carson for his stances on immigration and questioned his capabilities as a negotiator. Trump tied in his \u201clow-energy\u201d attacks with what he dubbed the \u201cmedieval times\u201d that the world is currently living in \u2013 saying that as ISIS beheads people, the U.S. needs a strong leader. But as to whether he would approve a special forces operation to rescue hostages being held by ISIS \u2013 similar to the one that resulted in the death of an American soldier this week\u2013 Trump demurred. \u201cI think I might, but I\u2019d have to look at the situation,\u201d Trump said. Pushed further to explain what the Trump doctrine would be in such situations, Trump explained that it \u201cis very simple.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s strength. It\u2019s strength. Nobody is going to mess with us. Our military is going to be made much stronger,\u201d Trump said.",

            "article_content": "Republicans face off for third time on Wednesday Rubio on the attack, Trump's got Carson in crosshairs If the weekend news shows were any indication, the next Republican debate in a few days is going to be a doozy. In a flurry of appearances on Sunday political talk shows, Donald Trump let it be known that he\u2019s ready to take off the gloves and hammer Ben Carson. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was increasingly willing to hit fellow Republicans. And, on the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders indicated he\u2019s not going to let Hillary Clinton set her campaign in cruise control, even after two strong weeks. Who's running for President? 2016 election candidates Here\u2019s a look at three themes that will reverberate through this week: According to Trump, Carson is \u201cvery weak on immigration,\u201d \u201ccannot do with trade like I do\u201d on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and has \u201csuper low energy\u201d levels \u2013 lower, in fact, than Jeb Bush. The attacks \u2013 many coming in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d \u2013 signal that Trump has been stung by new polls that show Carson has seized the front-runner\u2019s mantle in the first state to cast votes in the presidential nominating contest. The week in politics Trump like to call himself a \u201ccounter-puncher,\u201d but he\u2019s attacked Carson even while the retired neurosurgeon has largely stayed away from initiating clashes of his own. Trump blasts Carson, says he lacks energy to be president The aggressive approach suggests Trump is ready to draw the typically more reserved Carson out of his shell when Republicans meet Wednesday in Colorado for the their third debate, this one hosted by CNBC. \u201cHe can\u2019t do with a lot of things like I do, so we\u2019ll just have to see what happens,\u201d Trump said of Carson. Carson, meanwhile, told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he has dropped his angry teenage past, one in which he was violent. \u201cI do have a tendency to be relaxed,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t always like that. There was a time when I was, you know, very volatile. But, you know, I changed.\u201d Carson\u2019s violent past: Bricks, bats, hammers Trump and Carson are also exchanging shots over religion after Trump told a crowd in Florida of Carson\u2019s faith: \u201cI mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I don\u2019t know about. I just don\u2019t know about.\u201d Carson questions authenticity of Trump\u2019s faith As he settles in the top tier of Republican presidential candidates, Rubio, the Florida senator, is increasingly willing to slam his primary rivals. He hit Trump on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d saying the real estate mogul is unfit to become commander-in-chief due to his limited foreign policy expertise. Rubio: Trump immigration plan 'borders on the absurd' Santorum: Trump\u2019s remarks show he still learning foreign policy \u201cTo this point in the campaign, he has not proven an understanding of these issues or the preparation necessary to be the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military force in the world,\u201d Rubio said. Among the biggest questions of the GOP nominating process thus far has been whether Rubio can eventually overtake Bush as the favorite of moderate and moneyed \u201cestablishment\u201d members of the party eager for an alternative to political newcomers and outsiders like Trump, Carson and Carly Fiorina. Rubio has also begun taking aim at Clinton, the Democrat who he says is certain to be that party\u2019s nominee. Look for Rubio to come on strong in the debate this week. It was a big two-week string of victories for Clinton: A funny and well-received appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d a widely praised showing in the first Democratic presidential debate, a decision by Vice President Joe Biden to stay out of the 2016 race, and an escape from an 11-hour hearing on Benghazi without being hit by any new bombshells. Clinton imitates Trump on 'SNL' 5 ways Joe Biden\u2019s decision changes the 2016 race But with the more solid ground she finds her campaign on now comes a bigger target she\u2019ll wear. With Biden staying out of the race and Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee dropping their longshot campaigns, Clinton now faces a much Sanders says he is not \u2018shouting\u2019 at Hillary Clinton Sanders showed new willingness to go after Clinton on Sunday, saying on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that both Bill and Hillary Clinton supported a measure \u2013 the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman \u2013 that was \u201chomophobic.\u201d It was the latest in his efforts to cast Clinton as a late comer to liberal causes he has supported for decades. He said the law, since struck down by the Supreme Court, was pushed by GOP lawmakers \u2013 and \u201cmany of them, I\u2019m sorry to say, were homophobic.\u201d \u201cI think everybody at the time knew that it was simply homophobic legislation,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat legislation was anti-gay legislation. It was playing off the fears of a lot of Americans,\u201d he added. \u201cNow the good news \u2013 as Hillary Clinton just indicated \u2013 the culture has changed radically. \u2026 We have come a long, long way since that vote in 1996.\u201d",

But he rejects the idea that Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2013 which many believe has been on a hot streak lately following an appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d a well-received debate performance and Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to not seek the White House \u2013 ended the week on a high note following her lengthy testimony before the House Select Committee on Benghazi. \u201cPeople may think she had a good week,\u201d Rubio told CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel in an interview that aired Sunday on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI think this is the week it was proven that she lied about Benghazi.\u201d The Florida senator said he believes Clinton will be the Democratic nominee, thanks in part to her belonging to a \u201cpolitical dynasty\u201d that will help her fundraising. Rubio under fire for missed Senate votes As for Donald Trump, the party\u2019s current front-runner, Rubio charged the developer\u2019s immigration proposals \u201cborder on the absurd.\u201d \u201cHis rhetoric is a little louder but, if you think about where he was six months ago, his position on immigration six months ago was nothing like what he\u2019s saying now. And even what he\u2019s saying now borders on the absurd,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to deport all these people and then he\u2019s going to allow back in the ones that are good. His plan makes no sense.\u201d RELATED: Rubio defends skipping Senate votes Overall, Trump has failed to communicate a clear, deep understanding of America\u2019s most pressing issues, Rubio said. \u201cI would say that ultimately the next president of the United States, on their first day in office, must understand the threats that face this country and must have shown good judgment about what to do about those issues,\u201d he said. And despite Trump\u2019s current success, Rubio is confident that the former reality television star\u2019s popularity will wane. \u201cI\u2019m going to support the Republican nominee, and I\u2019m comfortable that it\u2019s not going to be Donald Trump, and I\u2019m increasingly confident that it\u2019s going to be me,\u201d he said. Confidence and optimism aside, Rubio isn\u2019t blind to his low presidential poll numbers \u2013 even in his home state \u2013 and blames them on \u201ca very unusual year.\u201d \u201cIf you start paying attention to these polls in October, I mean, you\u2019ll go crazy. I\u2019ve been up, I\u2019ve been down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unusual year, and I think part of it is that people are really angry about the direction of our country.\u201d CNN\u2019s Paige Hymson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "There was no mistaking the new confidence pumping through Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign Friday after a banner October. Rather than spiking the football after her 11-hour showdown with Republicans over Benghazi, Joe Biden\u2019s decision against mounting on a 2016 campaign and a strong debate performance, Clinton sought to consolidate recent gains after a disaster-strewn summer. \u201cAs some of you may know, I had a pretty long day yesterday,\u201d Clinton told around 600 people in a friendly crowd at the Women\u2019s Leadership Forum in Washington, referring to her daylong test of political stamina in front of GOP lawmakers seeking to trip her up over the Benghazi tragedy. \u201cI finally got to answer questions, something I have been pushing for literally a year and I am just grateful I recovered my voice, which I lost a little bit, but like I said at the start, I wanted to rise above partisanship and and reach for statesmanship.\u201d While the hearing did little to satisfy Republican critics who argue Clinton is responsible for lax security that contributed to the attack in Benghazi that left four Americans dead, she appeared to escape the showdown without serious damage. RELATED: Six moments that made Hillary Clinton\u2019s big October The hearing was seen by many Democrats as a bid by Republicans to incite a gaffe or public show of petulance by Clinton that could be used by GOP candidates later in the race to weaken her presidential hopes, and she managed to avoid serving up such a soundbite. Her campaign team awoke Friday convinced that the hearing, which garnered largely favorable press reviews and showed off Clinton\u2019s coolness under pressure and comfort with detailed policy questions, had strengthened the Democratic front-runner. \u201cI think we have seen some shift in the numbers in the last week because of the debate, and I think yesterday, too, she looked extremely presidential, kept her cool,\u201d Clinton\u2019s spokesman Brian Fallon told reporters on Friday morning. \u201cHer temperament was exactly what you want to see from a future president and I think voters will respond to that.\u201d Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a long time Clinton family political ally, was characteristically effusive. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he roared as he introduced Clinton at her second event of the day in the picturesque and historic Washington suburb of Alexandria. \u201cI almost want to thank (Republicans), because you saw in those 11 hours of testimony why she needs to be our commander-in-chief.\u201d Clinton herself did not mention what her brain trust clearly sees as a triumph in Alexandria, preferring instead to reel off a crowd pleasing speech on policy goodies for Democrats, hitting her lines on immigration reform, economic inequality, health care, gun control, voting rights and student debt. But Clinton is by no means in the clear from wider questions arising from the Benghazi committee. Republicans are sure to highlight the U.S.-led operation that led to the toppling of Moammer Gadhafi in Libya to frame a wider critique of Clinton\u2019s foreign policy acumen and record as secretary of state. They argue because the operation yielded to political chaos and a power vacuum exploited by terror groups like ISIS. And the furor over the private email server she used as secretary of state \u2013 uncovered by the Benghazi panel \u2013 is being probed by the FBI and has all the hallmarks of a political imbroglio that will be tough to shake. Still, the Clinton campaign believes the events of the last months will fill a reservoir of trust and confidence among voters that could sustain her through tough times. \u201cPeople see her being substantive and in command on the issues, that is a constant in terms of her attributes as a candidate,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cWe think (that) will position her to weather whenever the headwinds come because we know that they will come back.\u201d The former secretary of state also referred in Washington to the other big news of her week, the decision by Biden to pass on the race, that spared Clinton a challenge by a Democratic heavyweight and further boosted her position atop Democratic polls. \u201cI am confident that history isn\u2019t finished with Joe Biden,\u201d Clinton said, paying tribute to the vice president, who could still be a key general election asset among blue collar audiences she needs to court. \u201cIf I know Joe, he will be right there with us on the front lines,\u201d Clinton said. There was more good news for Clinton on Friday, as a Quinnipiac University poll found her leading her top Democratic rival Bernie Sanders 51% to 40% among Iowa caucus goers, a day after a Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll had her up seven points. Clinton\u2019s decision to host a noon event in Alexandria, Virginia, on Friday had several messages. First it was an easy trip for Washington-based news crews keen to follow up on Clinton\u2019s performance before the hearing on Friday. The event also allowed Clinton to pivot from deadly serious issues of life and death she faced before the Benghazi committee to a more political posture. The presidential campaign cranks up another notch for Clinton on Saturday, when she travels to Iowa for the state party\u2019s Jefferson-Jackson dinner \u2013 a vital staging post on the road to the caucuses \u2013 the first nominating contest scheduled for early February. For the first time in the 2016 race on Saturday, Bill Clinton, who has had a mostly behind-the-scenes role so far in her 2016 White House effort, will headline a rally for his wife, in Des Moines, that will also feature singing Katy Perry.",

            "article_content": "The Wisconsin Republican's decision comes two weeks after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled out of the race While Ryan initially resisted calls for him to run, he said earlier this week he would consider a bid if he could be a \"unity candidate\" Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s winning pitch to House conservatives amounted to this: Let\u2019s start over. For years, tensions had been boiling between the hard right of the Republican Party and the House leadership, a battle that effectively pushed Speaker John Boehner out of office and ended the bid of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to succeed him. But Ryan, facing skepticism from hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus, spoke bluntly to the conservatives, telling them that he was more ideologically in line with them than with moderates in the so-called Tuesday Group. He said he was not the type of leader who is out to seek retribution, unlike past leaders. The 45-year-old Wisconsin congressman said he would only push important bills such as immigration that have a majority of support from Republicans \u2013 abiding by the \u201cHastert Rule.\u201d He promised bold policy ideas on the House floor like welfare reform, health care legislation and a tax overhaul \u2013 and that the chamber would stand firm on those policy proposals with Senate Republicans and the White House. He softened his demand to roll back a procedure allowing lawmakers to overthrow a sitting speaker. And perhaps the most disarming pitch: He said he was ready to walk away if they said \u2018no\u2019 to him. Paul Ryan, rising GOP star What he achieved was a truce between disgruntled conservatives and a GOP leadership desperate to get the House back on track. It\u2019s a ceasefire in a long-running intra-party war that has cost the Republicans Senate seats, bottled up legislation in Congress and weakened their hand against President Barack Obama. With his national profile and bona fides with the right, Ryan was perhaps the only Republican who could make that pitch, showcasing strength that will immediately be put to the test when he\u2019s expected to be elected speaker next week. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said a Ryan pitch that won him over was: \u201cGo early and be firm\u201d \u2013 the idea that the House would stand on its principles in fights with the other body. \u201cFind a policy, take a position as a conference and make the Senate do something to stand firm,\u201d Jordan said, paraphrasing Ryan. After the conservative caucus announced it would support him \u2013 but not endorse him \u2013 Ryan later won over the two other coalitions in the House: The Tuesday Group and the Republican Study Committee, another conservative faction. By Thursday evening, Ryan made it official: He was running for speaker, telling his colleagues in a letter he was \u201ceager\u201d to do the job. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be speaker,\u201d Ryan said in a statement. \u201cBut I pledged to you that if I could be a unifying figure, then I would serve \u2013 I would go all in. After talking with so many of you, and hearing your words of encouragement, I believe we are ready to move forward as one, united team. And I am ready and eager to be our speaker.\u201d Poll: New leadership in Congress won\u2019t fix broken D.C. It\u2019s a dramatic political twist for Ryan, the GOP\u2019s vice presidential nominee in 2012 and someone who thoroughly enjoys his policy-heavy role as the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. In the immediate aftermath of McCarthy\u2019s sudden decision earlier this month to drop out of the speaker race, Ryan appeared to be doing everything he could not to run. Moments after McCarthy dropped out during a meeting in the ornate Ways and Means Committee Room earlier this month, Ryan grabbed Rep. John Kline of Minnesota and told him to take the top job instead. \u201cHe spun around and almost choked me and said, \u2018Kline you gotta do this,\u2019\u201d Kline recalled Thursday. \u201cI knew then, and I think Paul knew then, he really had to be the guy.\u201d Ryan knew his life would change moments before McCarthy made his bombshell announcement. He was slated to give the nominating speech to McCarthy in the conference, but instead got a heads-up that those remarks wouldn\u2019t be necessary. The majority leader instead urged Ryan to consider a bid. McCarthy knew Ryan was reluctant, but he immediately began to figure out what he could do to help, according to people familiar with the matter. There was discussion about divvying up responsibilities, but also about redefining the role of the speaker. Ryan envisioned being a more prominent face for the party \u2013 someone willing to deliver the message in the media, and spreading out some of the fundraising and operational duties to other members of the leadership team. McCarthy served as a counselor to Ryan throughout the process. He had a partial playbook already in hand since he had previously met with House GOP members, especially the conservatives in the Freedom Caucus, and had a good read on their concerns about shifting to a more \u201cbottom-up\u201d process. The hand-off: How Speakers Boehner to O'Neill came to power And since Ryan didn\u2019t want the job, many conservatives in the caucus seemed to believe him that he wouldn\u2019t try to make the speakership more powerful. Conservatives had long complained too much power resided in the leadership office, and it would be a non-starter for a candidate who wanted to centralize more power. It remains, of course, to be seen how Ryan operates over the long-term. \u201cMy question is who in their right mind would ever want that job?\u201d said Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Georgia, a member of the Freedom Caucus. \u201cWe can\u2019t survive another eight years like the ones we just had. We won\u2019t recover from that. He\u2019s willing to put his own self on the line.\u201d After the Freedom Caucus voted Wednesday to support Ryan, but not officially endorse him \u2013 which was one of his preconditions for taking the job \u2013 there was little option for Ryan to walk away. While they left themselves some room to say they still had issues with Ryan\u2019s conditions, they were also aware in their internal discussions that if they blocked yet another candidate - and one who had majority support - they would be overplaying their hand. Asked why he was confident Ryan would be elected speaker next week, McCarthy told reporters flatly, \u201cwhen I ran, 80% of the Freedom Caucus was against me. Now they\u2019re not.\u201d Boehner sets speaker election date Ryan\u2019s problems, however, are bound to grow with the right as soon as he takes the gavel \u2013 namely on two matters: Fiscal issues and his desire to make it harder to overthrow a sitting speaker. On the latter, there\u2019s no agreement between him and the Freedom Caucus. But he clarified his demand by saying he only wants to \u201cchange\u201d the rule \u2013 not eliminate it. And he agreed to consider the matter later as part of other rules changes the caucus has sought to enact in order to give the rank-and-file a bigger say. \u201cWe are not changing this fundamental right that members have relative to the \u2018motion to vacate,\u2019\u201d Jordan told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re not for that. We made that very clear.\u201d Ryan was not pressed on many policy matters, but will have to weigh in on the contentious issue of raising the national debt ceiling as early as next week \u2013 and extending government funding past Dec. 11. But he promised that immigration reform, an idea he has been warm to in the past, would not be a measure he would pursue in a Ryan speakership. As he continued to dither about taking the speakership, Republicans began looking for alternatives \u2013 and a growing number looked at Kline, a back-slapping pol who likes to smoke cigars. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., liked the idea. \u201cI\u2019d be able to drink and smoke in the speaker\u2019s office for another year,\u201d Cole said, referring to Boehner\u2019s penchant for puffing cigarettes. After next Thursday, he will likely have to ask Paul Ryan. Is Paul Ryan the new poster child for work-life balance?",

            "article_content": "House Freedom Caucus members skeptical of Paul Ryan's conditions to be speaker Ryan wants to make more difficult to remove a sitting speaker after conservative effort to force a vote to remove John Boehner The Wisconsin Republican also wants to do less fundraising than Boehner Conservatives in the House are saying not so fast to the idea of Speaker Paul Ryan. On Tuesday night, the Wisconsin Republican laid out his vision to his GOP colleagues and said he would be willing to serve as speaker \u2013 if the whole conference could unite behind him. But Wednesday morning, many of the conservatives that consistently fought outgoing House Speaker John Boehner and helped scuttle the bid to replace him by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy signaled they aren\u2019t ready to jump on the bandwagon for Ryan. Related: Ryan willing to serve as speaker, but with conditions \u201cI thought we did the coronation last night,\u201d Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert cracked Wednesday morning when asked if he would support Ryan. Gohmert had been backing Florida Rep. Daniel Webster and said he was still supporting Webster. And while Gohmert was never likely to be a vote Ryan would pick up, having voted for himself instead of Boehner in past speaker elections, key members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus were also not rushing to endorse Ryan. Boehner has scheduled an election for Republicans to pick their nominee to be his successor on October 28, with the full House to then vote on the next speaker the next day. Ryan is scheduled to meet with the Freedom Caucus on Wednesday afternoon and sit down with the other caucuses from whom he seeks support, as well, including the conservative Republican Study Committee and the moderate Tuesday Group. Paul Ryan, rising GOP star Ryan\u2019s conditions includes rules changes that would make it more difficult to overthrow a sitting speaker - a provision that Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, a leader of the Freedom Caucus, said is a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d \u201cWe have to remember everything in the House and everything in Congress is about checks and balances,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cWe have two houses of Congress for that reason. We have three branches of government for that reason, and one of the reasons that every board has the freedom to vacate (the chair).\u201d Ryan\u2019s spokesman Brendan Buck said the proposal on the vacate motion is not to eliminate it, but to either raise the threshold of members needed for such an action to a majority or supermajority of the conference. After hearing from Ryan in the RSC meeting, Labrador said he still had questions. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any signs of how anything\u2019s going to change,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have our Freedom Caucus meeting with him and I\u2019m going to ask him specifically. Now, he said a lot of really good things.\u201d After Ryan\u2019s meeting with the RSC, one Freedom Caucus member said the RSC gathering was \u201chelpful\u201d and Ryan gave some good answers, including on the hot-button issue of whether to change the rules to make it more difficult to vacate the speaker chair. \u201cThe trick is how do you do it and still protect membership\u2019s ability to deal if there was ever a bad egg. So we need to give that choice a little more intellectual capital,\u201d said Rep. David Schweikert, R-Arizona. And fellow Freedom Caucus member Rep. Mo Brooks said in addition to that concern, he takes issue with Ryan\u2019s track record on immigration. \u201cPaul Ryan\u2019s support for amnesty and open borders, that is a significant factor,\u201d the Alabama Republican said. In still another line of attack, caucus member Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, said Ryan\u2019s insistence that he spend time with his family on weekends and not carry on the grueling record of fundraising established by Boehner on his own shoulders is a major problem. \u201cYou can\u2019t do the job 9-5, Monday through Friday,\u201d Huelskamp said, noting Boehner\u2019s raising of more than $50 million for the party. \u201cThe speaker has to work on weekends. I\u2019m not running for speaker, I\u2019ve got young kids at home. \u2026 The time commitment is not 40 hours a week.\u201d The Freedom Caucus endorsed Webster in the race before McCarthy\u2019s dramatic announcement he was dropping out and Ryan\u2019s subsequent decision. Caucus rules state an endorsement requires at least 80%, and so it would take another four-fifths vote to rescind that endorsement and transfer it to Ryan. And there\u2019s no guarantee an endorsement means all members would vote the same way, Brooks noted, adding he had always supported Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, for the spot. Buck said without the Freedom Caucus\u2019 support, Ryan won\u2019t proceed with his campaign. Huelskamp said he was still supporting Webster,  but said he was open to hearing from Ryan. And many of the caucus members did the same. \u201cOn the positive side. Paul Ryan is a very charismatic individual, he\u2019s an eloquent spokesman, he\u2019s a good fundraiser, all of those are positive factors. So you have to weigh all of these factors,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThis place has to change. It can\u2019t be business as usual, status quo. There are a number of candidates, including Paul, who understand we need to change the way this place operates,\u201d caucus Chairman Jim Jordan said. \u201cWe just want to talk to him about what those specific changes are.\u201d OPINION: Will tiny minority wreck Paul Ryan\u2019s bid for speaker? Boehner says he believes Ryan will win over his colleagues. \u201cListen, I think Paul is going to get the support that he is looking for,\u201d Boehner told reporters Wednesday morning. \u201cI thought he laid out a very clear vision of how he would run the speakership. And I thought the members responded very well to him.\u201d He added: \u201cWe all know Paul Ryan, right? He\u2019s a very good member. He works hard. He\u2019s very bright. And he has good relationships, I think, with all the wings of the party. That\u2019s why I think he\u2019ll be doing fine.\u201d Many Republicans fear that if Ryan doesn\u2019t earn the conservatives\u2019 support, the party will be in total disarray. \u201cIf Paul Ryan can\u2019t get 218, no one can,\u201d Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo told reporters. READ: Boehner sets speaker election date Ryan\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, are helping the effort to bring his opponents around. \u201cFirst of all you have to remember this is more like a class president election, we all know one another, it\u2019s a pretty small school,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma. \u201cHe\u2019s not running a formal campaign,\u201d Cole added, saying in a traditional whip operation he\u2019d have a list of people to call and convince. \u201cPaul Ryan has a lot of friends in this conference. \u2026 I think those people are reaching out on their own to friends.\u201d Cole predicted that while a majority of the Freedom Caucus may back Webster in conference, once Ryan receives an \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of votes, many will ultimately support Ryan on the floor. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty hard to go home and explain why you didn\u2019t vote for him, not why you did,\u201d Cole said. The clock is ticking for more than just Ryan and Boehner (who is eager to leave Washington) \u2014 Congress faces a number of deadlines on must-pass legislation that will require a deft negotiator. The Treasury says the U.S. will hit its debt limit on Nov. 3, meaning Congress will need to pass a bill raising it in the next few legislative days. And the continuing resolution funding government only runs until Dec. 11, as the leaders in Congress and the White House continue to have a stalemate on the budget. Boehner is in some ways liberated by his decision to leave Congress at the end of the month, and is expected to take a heavy role in negotiating and pushing through deals on the debt ceiling, budget and other hot topics, like the renewal of the Export-Import Bank. That would take some pressure off his successor. But what he can\u2019t accomplish before his hopes to leave at the end of the month will fall to the next speaker, who will already be inheriting the divided conference.",

            "article_content": "\"I don't believe, like some do, that it is naive to talk to Republicans,\" Joe Biden said That line appears very clearly directed at Bernie Sanders When Vice President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he would not run for president, he did so with a very clear message for Hillary Clinton. He faulted some Democrats who \u201clook at Republicans as our enemies.\u201d The line, which Biden also used on Tuesday, is a direct knock against Clinton, who described Republicans as among her enemies at the first Democratic primary debate earlier this month. But that was not the only subtle message the vice president had for a 2016 Democrat on Wednesday. Shortly before his line admonishing labeling Republicans \u201cenemies,\u201d Biden said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe, like some do, that it is naive to talk to Republicans.\u201d That appears very clearly directed at Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who has repeatedly called President Barack Obama naive for believing Republicans wanted to work with him when he came into office in 2009. At an August 24 town hall in New Hampshire, Sanders told the audience that \u201cthe biggest mistake Barack Obama made\u201d was not keeping his supporters together after his 2008 election and thinking that Republicans wanted to work with him. \u201cWhat he said in so many words was, \u2018Thank you so much for electing me to be president, but I will take it from here. I will go forward and I will negotiate with (House Speaker John) Boehner and (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell and the Republicans,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe did this because he is a decent guy and he thought naively that Republicans really wanted to work or negotiate compromises. Truth is, they never, ever did.\u201d Sanders does not just use the answer in rallies, either. The sentiment of Obama being naive to assume Republicans wanted to work with him has became Sanders\u2019 fallback answer when asked about how he would be different than Obama and how he would accomplish some of the legislative priorities the president failed to do. In a September interview with CNN, Sanders said, Obama \u201chad the illusion \u2013 the mistake \u2013 of believing that he could sit down with Republicans and just work out some good compromises.\u201d \u201cThat was never going to happen,\u201d Sanders said. In an interview with David Axelrod, CNN senior political correspondent and a longtime top Obama aide, Sanders made a similar case. He said while Obama ran a \u201cbrilliant campaign,\u201d he wasn\u2019t clear-eyed when he came into office. \u201cHe thought he could walk into Capitol Hill and the Oval Office and sit down with John Boehner and Mitch McConnell and the Republicans and say, \u2018I can\u2019t get it all. You can\u2019t get it all. Let\u2019s work out something that\u2019s reasonable,\u2019 because he\u2019s a reasonable guy,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThese guys never had any intention of doing (serious) negotiating and compromising \u2026 I think it took the President too long to fully appreciate that.\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign spokesman did not respond to request for comment. Biden made the case on Wednesday that working with Republicans is not \u201cnaive,\u201d but necessary. \u201cI believe that we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart, and I think we can,\u201d said Biden. \u201cFor the sake of the country, we have to work together.\u201d Biden, however, has made his share of statements disparaging Republicans. During the 2012 presidential election, he told a largely black audience that then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s policies were \u201cgoing to put y\u2019all back in chains.\u201d At a speech to Latino Victory Project PAC earlier this month, Biden said that Republicans were administering a \u201cbeating\u201d to Hispanics. Biden also compared the Republican Party to the Know-Nothing Party, a 19th-century political party that was anti-Catholic and anti-immigration.

            "article_content": "Watch CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d Friday at 4 p.m. for an exclusive interview with Hillary Clinton. Castro is a rising star in the Democratic Party and a potential vice presidential candidate Latinos are a critically important voting bloc for the Democratic Party This was not your normal Hillary Clinton rally: Supporters stood outside the venue to hear the 2016 candidate, Clinton worked the ropeline before and after the event and chants of \u201cHill-ar-y, Hill-ar-y\u201d were heard multiple times throughout the fiery gathering here. Going into Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate, Clinton occasionally suffered from a lack of audience excitement. Venues that were less than full, applause lines were sometimes few and far between for speeches that were more lists than stem-winders. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight But standing outside Sunset Station on Thursday afternoon, Clinton tapped into her confident debate performance, delivering a direct speech on immigration and guns while pledging to fight for Latinos. She also picked up an endorsement from Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, a rising star in the Democratic party and a widely speculated vice presidential option for Clinton. \u201cI know you have heard a lot of politicians asking for your support at election time. And then they disappear the rest of the time,\u201d Clinton said to a heavily Latino audience. \u201cBut that is not me. That has never been me. Your fights are my fight, they always have been and they always will be. I am standing with you today just as firmly and proudly as I ever have.\u201d The audience was inspired by the debate, too. Standing outside the event and noticing the fired-up crowd, Angela Culley, 46, said she feels different about the Clinton campaign than she did just days ago. \u201cShe showed herself to be presidential, she was the most presidential candidate up there in my opinion,\u201d said Culley, a tourist visiting from Maryland who works for NASA. \u201cIt brought a lot of excitement to everything.\u201d Clinton walked into the event with Castro, and the two worked the ropeline before climbing on stage. Afterward, they clasped hands and raised them in the air, striking a pose often associated with presidential running mates. Introducing her as the country\u2019s next \u201cDemocratic nominee and the next president of the United States,\u201d Castro cast Clinton as the candidate best prepared to address the immigration system and someone who has \u201chas a strong vision for America\u2019s future.\u201d Clinton returned the favor. \u201cOf course, I am thrilled to have the support and endorsement of your former mayor,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cJulian, thank you, not only for those kind and stirring words, but for your leadership.\u201d The drumbeat around Castro becoming Clinton\u2019s vice presidential candidate is louder than any other rising Democrat. And nowhere can that drumbeat be felt louder than in San Antonio, where men and women at Thursday\u2019s event spoke of growing up with the Castros or knowing their parents well. \u201cHe is the perfect one,\u201d said Angie Perez, who, speaking of Clincton and Castro, said they \u201crepresent the color of the nation.\u201d Perez is a resident of San Antonio for over 30 years who worked in Democratic politics with the Rosie Castro, the Castro brother\u2019s mom. After rallying with Clinton, Castro told CNN that he endorsed Thursday, in part, because of the first Democratic debate. After the debate, he said, \u201cI wanted to make sure I lend all of my support to Secretary Clinton. I believe she is going to be the next president.\u201d Castro has long played down the speculation around him and the vice presidency. \u201cIt\u2019s flattering,\u201d he said of the speculation at an event in Kansas City in July, \u201cbut there really is not anything to make of it. \u2026 This is not like something you run for. Nobody signs up for that. So I\u2019m just gonna keep doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d From Castro to the crowd, though, the debate loomed large Thursday. \u201cAs I said the other night in the debate, I am a progressive that likes to get things done,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI know how to stand my ground and find common ground.\u201d She also subtly went after her top Democratic opponent, Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told Clinton on Tuesday \u201cthat all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want\u201d on gun control. \u201cNow,\u201d Clinton said, offering a slight smile, \u201cI have been told by some quit talking about this, quit shouting about this. I will tell you right now, I will not be silenced and we will not be silenced.\u201d The first Democratic debate Thursday\u2019s rally comes in the middle of a frenetic criss-crossing of the country with seven events in four states in four days. After picking up Castro\u2019s endorsement, Clinton heads to New Hampshire for two events and Alabama for another. She spent Wednesday on Wednesday where she rallied with roughly 2,500 supporters in Las Vegas. In addition to rallies, Clinton has looked to capitalize on her well-received debate performance by sitting down for local interviews across the country. On Wednesday she spoke with stations in Hampton Roads, Virginia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Denver; Minneapolis; and Atlanta. But while Clinton\u2019s recent success played out inside the event, an upcoming challenge was on display just outside Sunset Station\u2019s tan gates, where protesters held signs reading \u201cHillary 4 Prison\u201d and \u201cWake Up America.\u201d The protesters were there to heckle Clinton about the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, an issue she will speak about when she testifies to Congress on the matter next week. Clinton never mentioned the terrorist attack during the speech, instead choosing to focus on immigration. \u201cI will defend President Obama\u2019s executive actions,\u201d she said. \u201cI will stand up against any effort to deport DREAMERs and if Congress still refuses to act, I will go even further. There are more people with deep ties to our communities like many parents of Dreamers who deserve the chance to stay in America and I will fight for them too.\u201d Latinos are a critically important voting bloc for the Democratic Party, one that could possibly sway both the race for the party\u2019s nomination and the general election. Clinton finds herself in a tighter than expected race with independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and her move to consolidate Latino support is a sign the candidate is trying to solidify her base. Latinos voters have never been a problem for Clinton, however. During the 2008 Democratic primary, Hispanics picked Clinton over then-Sen. Barack Obama by a nearly two-to-one margin. And recent polling shows Clinton far ahead of Sanders with non-white voters. Clinton was well aware she had a good day, too. She worked the ropeline for longer than normal after the event, shaking hands and taking selfies with excited supporters. When asked by CNN if, after the debate, she was having a good day on the trail, Clinton gave a nonverbal response: A confident thumbs-up.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump holds double-digit leads over Ben Carson in both South Carolina and Nevada, the third and fourth states scheduled to hold nominating contests in next year\u2019s race for the presidency, with Trump widely seen in each state as the best candidate to handle a range of top issues, according to new CNN/ORC polls. Trump holds 38% support in Nevada, with Carson in second with 22%, and in South Carolina, Trump doubles Carson\u2019s support, 36% to 18%. No other candidate comes close to those top two in either state; the third-place candidate in each case has less than 10% support. Trump\u2019s backing in both states outpaces his support in most recent national polling, where he tends to draw around a quarter of Republican voters. FULL RESULTS: CNN/ORC Poll: South Carolina and Nevada Republicans In Nevada, where more than half of likely caucus participants say they have made up their mind or are leaning toward someone, Carly Fiorina takes third place with 8%, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with 7% and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush with 6%. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee are next at 4% each, with the remainder of the field at 2% or less. Trump\u2019s supporters in Nevada are more committed than others: Among those likely caucus-goers who say they have made up their minds or are leaning toward someone, 53% support Trump, 21% Carson, 7% Rubio and everyone else is at 5% or less. Those who say they are still trying to decide whom to support break 21% each for Carson and Trump, 12% for Fiorina, 10% for Bush, 9% for Huckabee and 6% for Rubio. Jeb Bush lands key endorsement in New Hampshire Among all likely voters in South Carolina, Rubio takes third with 9%, followed by Fiorina at 7%, Bush at 6%, Cruz at 5% and the state\u2019s senior senator, Lindsey Graham, also at 5%. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul follows at 4%, with Huckabee at 3% and the rest at 2% or less. Fewer South Carolina Republican voters say they have made up their minds about whom to support than among Nevada Republicans: 60% say they are still trying to decide, and the difference in candidate support between the two groups is not large enough to be significant. Trump\u2019s lead rests on widespread perceptions that he\u2019s the best candidate to handle the economy (67% say so in Nevada, 59% in South Carolina, while no other candidate hits double-digits) and illegal immigration (55% in Nevada and 51% in South Carolina, topping the other candidates by 40 points or more). About 6 in 10 in each state say Trump is the candidate most likely to change the way things work in Washington (60% in Nevada, 58% in South Carolina). Furthermore, nearly half \u2013 47% in Nevada and 44% in South Carolina \u2013 view Trump as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election next November. Trump: If I were a Democrat, I\u2019d have Secret Service by now Trump\u2019s strength fades somewhat on foreign policy, handling ISIS and social issues. Although Trump tops all other candidates by significant margins when voters and caucus-goers are asked which candidate would best handle foreign policy (he\u2019s up 21 points in Nevada, and 13 points in South Carolina) and ISIS (he tops Rubio by 33 points in Nevada and tops Graham by 27 points in South Carolina), his advantages are smaller than those he\u2019s built on the economy and immigration. Trump is also slightly less dominant on which candidate best represents the values of Republicans like themselves. In Nevada, 34% say that\u2019s Trump, 19% Carson, 10% Cruz, 9% Rubio and 7% each Bush and Fiorina. In South Carolina, 25% say it\u2019s Trump, 19% Carson, 10% Bush, 8% Rubio, 7% Graham, 6% Cruz, and 5% each Fiorina and Huckabee. On social issues, Trump runs about even with Carson as most trusted in both states, 25% Trump to 23% Carson in Nevada and 26% Carson to 22% Trump in South Carolina. Trump: \u2018I actually look forward\u2019 to attacking Ben Carson Among white evangelical protestants in South Carolina, who made up about two-thirds of South Carolina Republican voters in the 2012 GOP primary and are far more likely than other Republicans to call social issues their top concern (15% among white evangelicals vs. 1% among all other likely GOP voters), Trump tops Carson by 8 points, 32% to 24%, with Rubio at 11%. In both states, the economy was the top issue for those who say they\u2019re likely to participate in the nominating contests, with 39% of Nevada Republicans and 41% of South Carolina Republicans calling it the most important issue in deciding their presidential vote. The CNN/ORC polls were conducted by telephone October 3-10. A total of 1,009 South Carolina adults were interviewed, including 521 who said they were likely to vote in the Republican presidential primary. In Nevada, interviews were conducted with 1,011 adults, including 285 who said they were likely to participate in the Republican presidential caucus.

            "article_content": "Watch the first Democratic presidential debate Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. ET live on CNN and CNNgo; join the conversation at #DemDebate. Hillary Clinton will be put on the defensive over policy changes, such as on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Keystone XL pipeline Bernie Sanders faces pressure to prove why he belongs Five Democratic presidential candidates are about to try their luck at the first Democratic debate of the 2016 election in Las Vegas on Tuesday night. But the spotlight is largely on two: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The former secretary of state needs to remind viewers of the debate sponsored by CNN and Facebook about why she began the year as the overwhelming front-runner and is best able to take the torch from President Barack Obama. Sanders has the opportunity to prove to millions of voters why a 74-year-old self-described democratic socialist can take on both Clinton and Republicans. There\u2019s also a lot at stake for the three lesser known underdogs, particularly former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, whose stalled campaigns could benefit from an \u201call in\u201d performance Tuesday. Here are CNN\u2019s six things to watch in Tuesday night\u2019s debate: Hillary Clinton will have to answer for the original sin of politics: flip-flopping. Hillary Clinton's past debate moments Clinton came out against the Trans Pacific Partnership last week, when as secretary of state she heralded the agreement as the \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade deals. Her critics quickly accused her of shifting positions for the sake of political expediency in both appealing to liberals and creating distance between her and Barack Obama. \u201cWow, that\u2019s a reversal,\u201d O\u2019Malley, a TPP opponent, said last week. \u201cI can tell you that I didn\u2019t have one opinion eight months ago and switch that opinion on the eve of debates.\u201d Clinton has also been accused of doing a course reversal on issues important to the Democratic base, like same-sex marriage and whether she supports allowing undocumented people to obtain driver\u2019s licenses. She also only recently opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, after months of dodging the question. \u201cThe greatest opportunity for these other candidates is going to be to go after her on shifting positions, mostly recently on the TPP trade deal,\u201d Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Obama, said on CNN Monday. Clinton and Sanders finally face off Clinton has battled, unsuccessfully for months, to overcome the political storm over her private email server. The attacks have been led by Republicans while Democrats have mostly averted their gaze, hoping it would go away. It\u2019s a tricky issue for a rival candidate to bring up \u2013 they could risk harming their own support among Democrats by raising the divisive issue. But it\u2019s still possible that Clinton\u2019s rivals \u2013 perhaps Webb or O\u2019Malley \u2013 will gingerly point to the issue on Tuesday as a way of suggesting that she abhors transparency and scrutiny. \u201cShe needs to answer the email questions with transparency and openly,\u201d Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign manager, said on CNN Monday. She added that Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge is to avoid getting \u201criled up\u201d if put on the defensive. Clinton\u2019s campaign has seized on comments by GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that the congressional Benghazi committee was created to hurt her politically, as well as criticisms of the panel by a conservative former staffer. South Carolina, Nevada CNN polls find Clinton far ahead If Democrats don\u2019t attack Clinton, who will they hit? Republicans. Especially Trump, the GOP front-runner whose unorthodox campaign has dominated the 2016 narrative so far. Look for the five Democrats on stage to go after Republicans from the start. The wealthy New York real estate developer presents an alluring target, and the more they can tie Trump to the overall Republican Party, the better. The Democratic Party has used some of Trump\u2019s unfiltered remarks on everything from immigration to women to paint the GOP with a broad brush and label the party as exclusive and intolerant. Trump will live-tweet the debate By now, Bernie Sanders is used to being the star at the center of the stage. He\u2019s drawing tens of thousands of supporters to campaign rallies, and he\u2019s become a liberal sensation, inspiring the popular slogan \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d among progressive Democrats. He\u2019s also giving Clinton a run for her money in early states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Still, the pressure Tuesday night will be like none the Vermont senator has faced so far in the cycle. How a Bernie Sanders event differs from a Hillary Clinton one Sanders has decades of experience in public office, but in some ways, he seems like a stylistic misfit for the presidential debate stage based on the campaign he has run thus far. He tends to give long and at times rambling speeches, he has repeatedly said he has no interest in attacking his fellow Democratic rivals, and his aides say he\u2019s barely engaged in traditional debate prep in the days leading up to Tuesday. The added challenge for Sanders will be to win over viewers who are skeptical about whether the senator can rise to the occasion of being a national leader. Why libertarian Penn Jillette likes Bernie Sanders Clinton has spent months on the defensive, due to the controversy over her private email server and surprised by the strong progressive surge that\u2019s powering Sanders to her left. She\u2019s come across as not forthcoming in some interviews, reminding voters of the political obfuscation that at times clouded her husband Bill Clinton\u2019s administration in the 1990s. Clinton\u2019s poll numbers and approval ratings have dipped as a result. But she\u2019s a known strong debater, and went toe to toe with Barack Obama again and again in 2008. A repeat of those assured, likable performances on Tuesday night could go a long way toward reminding 18 million Democrats why they voted for her in her first presidential primary campaign. \u201cHillary Clinton is an excellent debater,\u201d said Pfeiffer. \u201cShe is excellent, crisp, knows the substance up and down, is very good in the back and forth.\u201d For all her struggles in the race so far, she is still the overwhelming front-runner and faces by far the highest expectations. Clinton also knows the dangerous potential of debates. Her halting answer about driving licenses for undocumented migrants in the 2008 season was the first crack in a front-running White House campaign that Obama eventually overhauled. What celebrities want to ask the candidates O\u2019Malley has spent months berating Democratic leaders for failing to schedule more debates, all as he has struggled to climb above single digits in the polls. Once seen as a fresh and accomplished new Democratic voice, the former Maryland governor \u2013 partly due to his failure to command much media coverage \u2013 is badly in need of a fresh boost of energy. He and his other underdog rivals, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, will want to emulate Carly Fiorina. The former Hewlett-Packard CEO used fiery performances in the GOP debates to jump-start a stalled campaign and put herself into the top tier of GOP candidates. O\u2019Malley, 52, is also by far the youngest person on the stage. Sanders is 74, and was born months before America entered World War II. Most of the rest are baby boomers. Clinton is 67, Jim Webb is 69 and served in the Vietnam War, and Lincoln Chafee is 62. Unlike the Republican primary, which features candidates spanning generations  \u2013 Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal are just 44 \u2013 the Democratic contest looks like it is for seniors only. The age gap could give O\u2019Malley an edge. And he\u2019ll need any advantage he can get. \u201cThe one person who has a great opportunity here is Martin O\u2019Malley,\u201d former Mitt Romney adviser Kevin Madden said on CNN Monday. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at 1%, and you\u2019re Martin O\u2019Malley, that\u2019s very easy. He has nowhere to go but up.\u201d Clarification: This story has been updated to better reflect Clinton\u2019s position on immigration policy. Everything to know about the #DemDebate",

            "article_content": "Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley will debate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday Sanders said he plans to 'contrast my consistency' with the Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s Democratic opponents offered a preview of Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate, when they used the Sunday news shows as a chance to cast her as a relative newcomer to progressive policy positions. Who's running for President? Both Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley are turning up the contrast between themselves and the party\u2019s front-runner, who, despite having faced heavy scrutiny all summer for her email use as secretary of state, appears to have stabilized her dominance in national polls. In a not-so-subtle jab at Clinton, Sanders highlighted his \u201cconsistency\u201d Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d saying he\u2019s been in sync with the party\u2019s electorate on issues like trade and income inequality much longer than the former secretary of state. \u201cSo people will have to contrast my consistency and my willingness to stand up to Wall Street and corporations, big corporations, with the secretary,\u201d Sanders said. And O\u2019Malley played up his record on issues like gun control and immigration on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d saying that \u201cit\u2019s about the doing, not the saying.\u201d 2016 election candidates \u201cI\u2019m going to lay out the vision \u2026 but also, 15 years of executive experience, which I alone will have on that stage, of actually accomplishing progressive things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the words, it\u2019s about the actions.\u201d The candidates\u2019 criticism of Clinton comes as the hours count down to the first Democratic primary debate. The party\u2019s presidential field will share a stage in the CNN and Facebook-hosted event at 8:30 p.m. ET Tuesday in Las Vegas. Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee will also be on the stage. After months of struggles as Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state has dragged on her campaign, she has regained her footing in recent weeks \u2013 in part thanks to a political gift from Republicans. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, in an interview on Fox News, credited the committee investigating the Benghazi incident with dragging down Clinton\u2019s poll numbers \u2013 opening the door for her campaign to go on offense, accusing the GOP of a taxpayer-funded political crusade. Exacerbating the comment\u2019s effect, a conservative former employee of the committee also derided the panel as \u201cpartisan\u201d in a CNN interview over the weekend, which forced the committee\u2019s supporters into another round of defending their work. There will be one elephant in the room Tuesday \u2013 or, in this case, outside it. Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he\u2019ll mount a late bid for the Democratic nomination. He\u2019s not participating in the first debate \u2013 though if he enters after it\u2019s held, his presence could shake up the race. Though Sanders has taken the lead in New Hampshire and is within striking distance in Iowa, Clinton\u2019s lead nationally has stabilized. A new CBS News survey had her support among likely Democratic primary voters at 46% to Sanders\u2019 27%. Clinton in recent weeks has been playing up differences with President Barack Obama\u2019s administration \u2013 which, of course, includes Biden. She has opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Keystone XL pipeline. She has argued for a no-fly zone in Syria. She has said the administration should allow more Syrian refugees into the United States, and should deport fewer undocumented immigrants. But she also has a number of divides with her Democratic primary foes \u2013 particularly over issues like college debt and Wall Street reform. Her opponents have argued for the re-institution of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banks until it was repealed under President Bill Clinton. On Sunday, Sanders specifically criticized Clinton for taking positions against President Barack Obama\u2019s administration on two issues \u2013 construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 on which he and other liberals have long fought the White House. RELATED: Five times Clinton broke from Obama Clinton last month said she\u2019d grown tired of waiting on the State Department to finish its review of the Keystone pipeline. And she said after the Obama administration\u2019s trade negotiators finalized the 12-country Pacific Rim deal, which she\u2019d hailed as the \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade agreements while serving as America\u2019s top diplomat, has fallen short of her expectations. Drawing an implicit contrast with Clinton, Sanders highlighted his positions from the outset of debates over those issues. \u201cFrom day one, I opposed the Keystone Pipeline because I believe that if you\u2019re serious about climate change, you don\u2019t encourage the excavation and transportation of very dirty oil. That was my view from day one,\u201d he said. He also pointed to his votes against free the North America Free Trade Agreement, normalized trade relations with China and more. \u201cI believe that our trade policies going way back when \u2026 I think they have been a disaster for the American worker,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Unlike Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, there is no reliable polling in Nevada No one has any idea how many voters will turn out in Nevada on February 20 Long before Donald Trump swept in and upended the GOP race for president, the teams of Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson and Ted Cruz were building the kind of ground game here that it takes to win in a state where just 7% of GOP voters turned out to caucus in 2012. That has made Nevada, often called the wild west of the early state contests, even more of a Silver State scramble this year \u2013 looming as one of the biggest mysteries on the presidential nominating calendar. The main Republican presidential debate Unlike Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, there is no reliable polling here, in part because so few people could show up. The campaigns do not have a reliable list of caucus-goers from 2008 and 2012, because the state party did not maintain that data in a fashion that they could use. And unlike Iowa \u2013 which has long been the first-in-the-nation caucus \u2013 very few Republican voters here are familiar with the basic drill of what a caucus entails. The bottom line? No one has any idea how many voters will turn out in Nevada on February 20, and that makes it anyone\u2019s game to win. In that sense, Nevada offers a key test next year of whether an untraditional candidate like Trump can muster the kind of organizational strength that more establishment campaigns like Bush and Rubio are bringing to bear. \u201cThis is a movement,\u201d Trump told an enthusiastic crowd inside the Mystere Theater at the Treasure Island casino on the Las Vegas Strip Thursday. \u201cThis is a movement to take our country back.\u201d But any longtime political hand in Nevada will say that it will take a lot more than a movement to win in the Silver State. And that is the emerging test here for Trump\u2019s team here: whether they can channel the energy for his candidacy into a reliable turnout organization of volunteers. Donald Trump's number one fan \u201cIt\u2019s happening; I\u2019m on Team Trump,\u201d said A.J. Maimborg, who previously caucused for Ron Paul and is now volunteering to train caucus-goers for Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re having a lot more meetings now; we\u2019re getting together to get the organization done, and we get more supporters every day.\u201d Maimborg, who was at the Trump rally wearing a black \u201cTrump 2016. Build the Wall\u201d T-shirt, said she ruled out Rand Paul \u2013 once thought to be a serious contender here \u2013 because \u201che\u2019s not his father\u201d and \u201che flip-flops too much.\u201d She ruled out Bush, because \u201cwe don\u2019t need another Bush,\u201d and ruled out Rubio because she didn\u2019t like what she read about him and doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s up for the job. 2016 election candidates \u201cI was a Republican for years and I got tired of both parties, so I went to the American Independent Party. Donald Trump brought me back as a Republican,\u201d said Maimborg, adding that she likes him \u201cbecause he can\u2019t be bought.\u201d That energy for Trump \u2013 and for Ben Carson, who was most often named by voters as their second choice at Trump\u2019s rally here Thursday \u2013 has raised the stakes in Nevada for Rubio and Bush, who both hoped Nevada would serve as a firewall that could create momentum for their candidacies before they faced off in their home state of Florida. Top quotes from the Republican debate After less than 33,000 of the state\u2019s 400,000 GOP voters showed up to caucus in 2012, allies of Bush had hoped the state\u2019s leaders would agree to switch from a caucus to a primary to ensure greater participation. But the legislature adjourned without taking that step earlier this year. So Bush\u2019s team, headed by Nevada-based strategist Ryan Erwin, who led Mitt Romney\u2019s successful efforts here in 2008 and 2012, is engaged in a labor intensive effort to train potential caucus goers nearly every other day. Polls: Trump still tops in Iowa, New Hampshire The hope through those trainings, he said, is to \u201cremove the fear of the unknown\u201d in the caucus process. \u201cWe are well organized. We understand what it takes to win, and we are keeping our head down and focused on the task at hand,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cA caucus is, by its nature, is a clunky process and difficult to understand \u2013 it\u2019s not what people are used to doing,\u201d said Erwin, noting that Nevada voters are used to the ease of being able to cast ballots early at their grocery store. He noted that Nevada also has a disproportionately high number of people that work off-hour shifts: \u201cIt\u2019s a different commitment than a primary or a general election vote and it takes longer.\u201d To help round up and organize those core Republican voters, both Bush\u2019s team and Rubio\u2019s have worked assiduously to notch endorsements of party leaders here. Bush won the support of Nevada U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, and has played up his potential to do well among the sizable population of Hispanic voters here in the general election, because of his more welcoming tone on immigration. (Though Nevada is often referred to as the first Latino primary, there is little evidence to suggest that many Hispanic voters will turn out to caucus for Republicans in February.) Who's running for President? Rubio, who began a three-day swing here Thursday night in Summerlin, has played up his Nevada roots after spending time here as a youth. He has also made strong entreaties to the Mormon community here, which helped deliver the state twice to Romney. The Florida senator also recently landed the support of Scott Walker\u2019s Nevada campaign chairman, former Nevada Gov. Bob List. Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, Rubio\u2019s campaign chairman in the state, pointed to that pickup as another good sign for the Florida Senator as he rises in national polls. \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing a lot of momentum here in Nevada for Senator Rubio,\u201d Hutchison said. \u201cPeople just see him as a next-generation leader. \u2026 One thing that you\u2019re seeing is that a lot of people who saw Governor Walker as attractive are now are moving their allegiance and their resources over to our effort.\u201d While Paul was viewed as a strong contender earlier this year, because it was assumed that he would inherit the organization of his father, Ron Paul \u2013 the elder Paul\u2019s support has splintered among the many candidates in the GOP field. One of the beneficiaries of that splintering has been Carson, who has not campaigned as much here as Bush and Rubio, but is, by all accounts, building a strong ground organization. Jimmy Stracner, the former state director for the Republican National Committee, shrugged off the endorsement battle between Bush and Rubio for the top names: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that the political class has gone with Rubio and Bush,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a race for endorsements. Dr. Carson is not part of the political class,\u201d Stracner said. \u201cHe\u2019s said from day one he\u2019s not going to lick the boots of billionaires\u2026 People are truly inspired by him, meaning we have the ability to pull in people who have never caucused before.\u201d With so much interest in the race, the caucus experience may be a first-time experiment for many Republicans in Nevada, and the state may ultimately be won not with momentum, but by the campaign who shows the kind of relentless follow-through needed to turn them out.",

Biden, who is closing in on a decision on whether he should run for president, recalled a recent event he held at the vice president\u2019s mansion in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. The vice president said Latino attendees at the function were hanging their heads as a result of comments made by GOP front-runner Donald Trump and other top Republican candidates. \u201cPeople walked in like literally down because of the beating, the beating Hispanics are taking at the hands of the Republican caucus \u2026 I mean the Republican presidential race,\u201d Biden said in the video which was obtained by CNN. \u201cPeople are depressed. And the message I have for you guys is these guys don\u2019t remotely speak for America,\u201d the vice president continued, waving his arms in front of the crowd at the Latino Victory Project fundraiser. \u201cThe American people are so much better.

They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.

How to woo a Latino voter The former secretary of state will roll out Latino endorsements and is campaigning in areas with large Latino populations in the coming weeks. Clinton will travel to San Antonio, Texas on Oct. 15 for her first organizing event in the state. The trip, according to aides, will focus on Latinas and Clinton\u2019s personal story, which includes registering voters in South Texas in the 1970s. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Clinton has looked to Texas as part of a potential firewall in the battle for Democratic delegates, and her visit to San Antonio will be her second bid to shore up that support. On Wednesday, liberal hero Wendy Davis officially endorsed Clinton at an event in Austin, and Clinton has visited Texas to raise dollars and to speak on voting rights there in the spring. But since that speech, Sanders touched down in Houston and Dallas for two massive rallies. Texas poll: Trump edges out Cruz Latinos are a critically important voting bloc for the Democratic Party, one that could possibly sway both the race for the party\u2019s nomination and the general election. Clinton finds herself in a tighter than expected race with independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and her move to consolidate Latino support is a sign the candidate is trying to solidify her base. What Latino voters care about more than immigration Clinton has long performed well with Latino voters. During the 2008 Democratic primary, Hispanics picked Clinton over then-Sen. Barack Obama by a nearly two-to-one margin. In recent polling, Clinton consistently outperforms Sanders with non-white voters, including Latinos. In a CNN/ORC poll released in September, Clinton won 55% of non-white voters polled, compared to 17% for Sanders. But the group is far from monolithic and Clinton\u2019s campaign hopes her message on raising wages, affordable college and health care \u2013 in addition to immigration reform \u2013 will resonate with Latino voters. Rep. Joaquin Castro will campaign for Clinton in Nevada on Oct. 11, ahead of the first Democratic debate, and Clinton will campaign in Southern Nevada on Oct. 14, according to aides. Clinton will also speak at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s Annual Awards Gala on Oct. 8 and will do conference calls with a number of high powered Hispanic groups, including the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus members. The month-long push for Latino support mimics what Clinton\u2019s campaign did in September for women voters, creating events that focused on the candidate\u2019s record with the voting bloc. But October could prove a critical month for Clinton. In addition to the debate, Clinton will testify before Congress later on Oct. 22 and will look to continue to fend off a surging Sanders. Aides said Thursday that the campaign will also roll out endorsements from a host of Latino community leaders, elected officials and celebrities throughout October.",

            "article_content": "Clinton will hold 58 fundraisers in the third quarter, which ends Wednesday In Bay Area events this week, Clinton stayed away from attacks on Republicans or fellow Democrats Hillary Clinton stayed on message during her final sprint towards the close of 2015\u2019s third fundraising quarter, despite facing a surging Bernie Sanders and the possibility Vice President Joe Biden may join the race. At closed fundraisers around the Bay Area on Monday and Tuesday, Clinton told familiar stories from her stump speech, talking more about policy and personal priorities than politics. At a 150-person event at a hilltop home in Saratoga, Clinton called for investment in \u201ca big infrastructure program\u201d and told the audience of tech investors \u201cthat one of the biggest opportunities that we are missing is getting really serious in the fight against climate change.\u201d \u201cI have set some big goals,\u201d Clinton said, before talking at length about equal pay and affordable education and pledging to defend the Affordable Care Act. Though the event was closed, part of her speech was audible from the street. She repeated her familiar line on women\u2019s issues: Telling the audience that if Republicans want to say she is playing the gender card, her response is \u201cdeal me in!\u201d These events are very much in Clinton\u2019s comfort zone and are part of a comprehensive effort to post an overwhelming fundraising number for the third quarter, which ends Wednesday. It is especially important now as Sanders has surged in the polls of late, and the email controversy continues to hamper her campaign. Attendees at the four Bay Area fundraisers said Clinton rarely attacked Republicans and made no mention of Sanders or emails. In total, Clinton will have personally headlined 58 fundraisers from July 1 to Sept. 30, a pace identical to the 58 fundraisers she headlined in the second quarter. After leaving California, she headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, for a Monday night fundraiser hosted Erskine Bowles, Bill Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, and his wife, Crandall. On Wednesday, the last day of the quarter, Clinton will headline a quarter closing party at the 40/40 Club, a club owned by rapper Jay-Z that is known more for its late night parties than its political fundraisers. Based on CNN\u2019s analysis of figures provided by the Clinton campaign, the 2016 candidate likely raised well above $22 million at the events she personally headlined, a figure that does not include fundraisers headlined by surrogates and the campaign\u2019s digital fundraising operation. Overall, the former secretary of state covered 22 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and spent most of her time in California (for 11 fundraisers) and New York (for 13 events). RELATED: Poll: Clinton tops Trump in general election The campaign raised $45 million in the second quarter, the most ever raised by a campaign in their first full quarter, and while aides are hopeful they\u2019ll post a similarly sizable haul, they are lowering expectations by saying the third quarter has historically been the least profitable for political campaigns. Aides have long said that they hope to raise $100 million by the end of 2015, a goal that the campaign will likely be able to meet. Fundraising totals are both practically and symbolically important. Money is the lifeblood of any presidential operations, but campaigns quarterly fundraising hauls are regularly used to show signs of strength and weakness. And the amount of time Clinton has spent fundraising - the former first lady broke up her vacation to raise money in New York - ups the ante on her haul. The small size of the events is helping Clinton win over people who already sizable amounts of money - between $1,000 and $2,700 - to meet her. \u201cMaybe it is always true that when you see somebody in person you really feel their humanness,\u201d said Janet Harrington, a retired school teacher who attended the event in Saratoga. \u201cBut she seemed smart, sincere, and such a wonderful contrast to all those Republican clowns.\u201d Harrington said she fell in love with Obama in 2008 and went into the Monday event hoping to \u201cfeel that same kind of enthusiasm for Hillary.\u201d After the event, Harrington said Clinton \u201cput me over the edge.\u201d RELATED: Sixth-grader goes Secret Service, meets Hillary Clinton Other attendees, like Ruchi Goyal, an engineer and product executive at eBay, said she was struck by how much time Clinton spoke about policy, particularly issues not always discussed like infrastructure and mental health. \u201cShe didn\u2019t really bash anyone,\u201d said Robert Villarreal, vice president of Global Accounts at Tintri, a Silicon Valley digital storage company. \u201cI think she is going to have to get into that pit that all politicians seem to fall into but I think she didn\u2019t really get into it today.\u201d Clinton told stories about her granddaughter, spoke the need for comprehensive immigration reform and pledged to do what she can to help refugees from Syria at a late afternoon event in Belvedere, and took questions from the young people (under 18) at the fundraiser designed for kids and their parents. While Clinton\u2019s quarter ending push for cash has been a success for the campaign - the former first lady has headlined 15 fundraisers in the last week - it offers her opponents a strong contrast. Sanders, Clinton\u2019s most formidable Democratic opponent, has only headlined seven fundraisers in his entire time as a candidate: Two in Los Angeles and one in Seattle, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Atlanta, and New York. And the candidate is not very involved in fundraising, according to campaign aides. While Sanders writes his own fundraising emails and \u201cknows it matters,\u201d he rarely checks in on fundraising and is more interested in other aspects of the campaign. RELATED: Bernie Sanders\u2019 Supreme Court litmus test: Overturn Citizens United Instead, his campaign is focused more on turning their sizable online following into donations. During the second quarter, Sanders raised about $15 million from 400,000 donations of around $33.51. In emails to supporters over the last week, Sanders\u2019 campaign has asked for small donations, hoping to reach 1 million contributions by the end of the day on Wednesday. \u201cIn just three days, we\u2019ll close the books on a critical FEC fundraising deadline,\u201d Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, wrote in an email. \u201cWe have a chance to announce that our supporters have made 1 million online contributions faster than any presidential campaign in history.\u201d Clinton will likely not compete with those small donor figures, but that doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t try. In an email to supporters on Monday, Clinton\u2019s campaign asked for $1 donations, a clear sign the campaign wants to expand its donor base before the close of the quarter. The subject line: \u201cHillary needs your help today.\u201d",

Hanen sided with Texas and 25 other states challenging the Obama administration programs and temporarily blocked them from going forward U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard arguments in July but has not ruled Mario Sidonio is an aspiring astrophysicist with big American dreams. But lately the 17-year-old has been waking up every day hoping a federal appeals court will come down with a ruling that could help his family secure a better future. Mario is a U.S. citizen born and raised in Texas. But his father is an undocumented worker, trying to support his six children who are all U.S. citizens. The family has been on an emotional roller coaster since last November when President Barack Obama announced executive actions that would ease deportation threats to some 4 million undocumented workers. Mario\u2019s father would have been eligible for one of the programs. But last February, U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen sided with Texas and 25 other states challenging the programs and temporarily blocked them from going forward. RELATED: CNN/ORC poll: Guns, immigration, abortion increasingly important to voters Temporary, however, could mean more than a year. The Sidonios and millions of other similarly situated families across the country have seen their dreams turn into a slow-moving court case that remains stalled. Meanwhile, several Republican candidates have seized on the President\u2019s programs as a talking point on the campaign trail, with some presidential hopefuls endorsing strict deportation policies and suggesting that not all children born in the U.S. should be eligible for citizenship in the first place. After losing in the district court, the administration appealed its case to a three judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit based out of New Orleans. The appeals court heard arguments in July \u2014 and both sides are getting impatient. \u201cAlmost three months later, we are still waiting on a decision,\u201d said Josh Blackman, an Associate Professor of Law at the South Texas College of Law. Blackman, working with the libertarian CATO Institute, has filed a brief in support of Texas and the other states who believe the President\u2019s executive actions were an unprecedented expansion of executive power. Blackman supports comprehensive immigration reform, but he writes in the brief, \u201cit is not, however, for the President to make such changes alone, in conflict with the laws passed by Congress, and in ways that go beyond constitutionally-authorized executive power.\u201d This step won\u2019t be the last. This court battle will most likely reach the Supreme Court, and the appeal process might outlive Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cWe\u2019re very frustrated,\u201d Mario said in an interview. His father planned to apply for a program called \u201cDeferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \u201d (DAPA) that would have made him eligible for work authorization and associated benefits. \u201cWe are wondering what is taking so long,\u201d said Mario. He hopes that even if his side loses at the Fifth Circuit, the case could be appealed to the Supreme Court in time for it to be heard and decided this term. But for that to happen, the case would need to be decided very soon. On dark days Mario fears the appeals court, which is generally considered to be very conservative, is slow-walking a decision as a way to run out the final months of the Obama administration. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s being delayed on purpose, but maybe that\u2019s just the frustration talking,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a distinct possibility that if this case is decided too late, there may not be enough time for the Supreme Court to argue and decide the inevitable appeal by June 2016,\u201d said Blackman who added that if the case is kicked to the fall of 2016, the decision could come after the next presidential election. RELATED: Jeb Bush on immigration: my plan is \u2018dignified\u2019 According to the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at  the University of Southern California, there are approximately 6.3 million children who live in a household with a DAPA eligible mother or father, and 5.5 million are U.S. Citizens. In a recent study, CSII says that nearly 600,000 children of parents that could be eligible for DAPA currently have the right to vote. Next fall, that will include Mario who was shocked when he hear  Republican front-runner Donald Trump explain his immigration views during the most recent debate. \u201cA woman gets pregnant. She\u2019s nine months, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States, and we take care of the baby for 85 years. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Trump said. Mario said he expects to respond at the voting booth.",

            "article_content": "Rubio has avoided direct confrontations with Trump Focus on smaller events and meetings Will face attacks on immigration record Marco Rubio has missed more votes than virtually any other senator this year. He has avoided the back-and-forth shouting matches with Donald Trump and other fellow Republican presidential nominees. And he hasn\u2019t made a splash with major campaign rallies that fill arenas. Yet he is now in the top tier of candidates, according to the most recent CNN/ORC poll. Rubio has been criss-crossing the country, attending small-bore fundraisers for potential allies in key states and holding policy events that barely register on the national radar. These type of events \u2013 aimed at courting allies in early states and locking up big donors \u2013 are all part of a strategic effort by Rubio to stay below the radar and avoid the scrutiny that comes with being a front-runner in the race. Earlier this year, Rubio raised money for fellow Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the dean of Iowa politics. And he also headlined a big money event for the senior senator\u2019s grandson, Patrick, a state senator. The moves didn\u2019t generate much attention, and it didn\u2019t seem to matter much that Rubio has spent little time in Iowa in his five months on the campaign trail. Grassley was happy to see his warchest \u2013 and his grandson\u2019s \u2013 filled. \u201cIt would be hard for Grassley to say he\u2019s not spending enough time in Iowa,\u201d Grassley said with a big smile Tuesday. On a day in early September when the political world was abuzz over a fresh clash between Jeb Bush and Trump, Rubio was raising cash in Oklahoma \u2013 a state of less prominence in the presidential calendar than the first four early contests \u2013 and talking about energy policy with business executives. Tuesday, after campaign events in the South, Rubio slipped into the Senate to cast a vote reaffirming his opposition to abortion before catching a flight to Dallas for a high-dollar fundraiser at the home of real-estate investor Harlan Crow. His rival, Ted Cruz, stayed in the chamber and held court with reporters to lash Republicans for caving to Democrats. In the summer of Trump, where candidates are making bombastic statements and dominating the headlines, Rubio has mostly tried to avoid drawing attention to himself, hoping others implode \u2013 like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker did this week. In the first two debates, Rubio didn\u2019t deliver a knockout blow, but his steady performance, polished answers about national security and his Cuban roots and lack of verbal gaffes helped his poll standing. While his 11% rating still is far off Trump, who remains in the lead, senior Rubio officials argue they are more than content seeing their candidate sitting quietly in fourth place at this stage of the race. His rivals have seemed to noticed. \u201cI think he\u2019s running a good race \u2013 he\u2019s doing better than I am,\u201d admitted Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who is also running for president. The strategy boils down to this: Pick and choose your spots, and \u2013 for now \u2013 stay away from the fray. And if Rubio continues to keep his head down, and avoids spawning much controversy, his campaign hopes a late surge could propel him to win the Iowa caucuses next year and win one of the first four early primary states. Rubio, who declined to be interviewed, is publicly at ease with his standing in the polls. Flashing back to his 2010 Senate campaign in Florida, he said at an event in Charlotte this week: \u201cFive years ago around this time I was 30 points down in the polls. The only people who thought I could win all lived in my home. Four of them were under the age of 10.\u201d But like others, Graham was quick to warn such a strategy has its limits. \u201cLeadership is engaging when you need to. You don\u2019t need to fight every fight but some of this stuff we need to stand up to.\u201d Rubio is not without his vulnerabilities. As Fiorina\u2019s business record is starting to get new scrutiny amid her rise in the polls, Rubio\u2019s voting record and relative lack of experience are bound to get more attention as well. Both subjects offer ammunition for critics. \u201cInexperience because of (President Barack) Obama\u2019s inexperience,\u201d Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said when asked about Rubio\u2019s vulnerabilities. \u201cLook that would be one of the challenges.\u201d While Rubio has had few legislative accomplishments in his less-than-one-term as senator, immigration is the issue that he\u2019s most identified with in the Senate. It\u2019s an issue that cuts both ways and could be dangerous for the candidate in both the primary and if he makes it to a general election. Rubio cut a major immigration deal in 2013 that included a path to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants, he abandoned the measure after it passed the Senate and stalled in the House. He has referred to his involvement in the issue as a mistake, saying Congress should instead try to pass individual pieces to reform immigrations laws, starting with enforcement. But his handling of the matter has been a source of criticism for both sides. Trump, in a Tuesday tweet, referred to him as \u201cSenator Marco \u2018amnesty\u2019 Rubio,\u201d while proponents of immigration reform say the Florida Republican was quick to retreat when the going got tough. \u201cI was disappointed in that,\u201d said McCain, who worked with Rubio on the matter. \u201cIt seems to me when you work with a group of people and you agree, you keep your word,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said of Rubio. \u201cThat to me is kind of a danger signal.\u201d Graham, another co-author of immigration reform, refused to single out Rubio \u2013 but made a clear contrast with the junior Florida senator. \u201cRather than me talking about what he did, let me tell you what I did: I stuck with it,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to change stripes on this issue.\u201d It remains to be seen just how long Rubio can stay above the fray and if his standing will drop once the attacks start to sharpen. Few of his opponents have taken direct shots at him. Indeed, Cruz, the Texas Republican, at this month\u2019s CNN debate lashed \u201cWashington Republicans\u201d for backing the \u201cmassive amnesty\u201d plan that Rubio backed, though he didn\u2019t single out his colleague by name. In response, Rubio talked about his own immigrant family and laid out bite-size measures that should become law first, including tracking those who come into the country illegally, mandatory electronic verification of workers\u2019 citizenship and better border security. \u201cWe cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of legislation,\u201d Rubio said at the debate. \u201cI learned that. We tried it that way.\u201d Rubio\u2019s contrition on the issue seems to have won him plaudits on the right, stabilizing his poll numbers and allowing him to exert himself on other issues, namely a more hawkish view of foreign policy. And his polished speaking style and youthfulness have made allies think that he could help bridge the divide between the party\u2019s warring wings and provide a sharp contrast to the eventual Democratic nominee, presumably Hillary Clinton. At the same time, a top Democrat downplayed Rubio\u2019s strengths. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the 15 as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, when asked about Rubio, referring to the crowded primary field. \u201cI tell people it\u2019s like shopping for a car,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota., No. 4 in the GOP leadership, referring to the primary contest. \u201cPeople are taking these candidates out for a test drive, seeing what they like.\u201d Rubio\u2019s campaign hopes voters don\u2019t test out his candidacy until next January.",

            "article_content": "The first Latin American pope's blessings on America could also contain uncomfortable challenges. Francis is stepping into an intense domestic debate on issues close to his heart, including climate change and abortion. America may be in for some tough love from the Pope. After a lifetime of watching the world\u2019s most affluent and powerful nation from afar, Pope Francis walked on U.S. soil for the first time Tuesday, at the age of 78, when he arrived in Washington from Cuba. He\u2019s assured of a warm welcome from millions of U.S. Catholics, and his poll numbers \u2013 which would be the envy of any politician \u2013 suggest that curious adherents of other faiths and even the nondevout are also eagerly awaiting his visit.  But the first Latin American pope\u2019s blessings on America could also contain uncomfortable challenges as he addresses a country that encapsulates many of the ills he has denounced as the head of one of the world\u2019s largest religions. Though there are aspects of American life that Francis embraces, he has quickly become known for blunt critiques of contemporary society and global economics, and his criticism \u2013 from capitalism to climate change to technology \u2013 spans the political spectrum. \u201cPope Francis is the ultimate Washington outsider. His priorities are not Washington\u2019s priorities,\u201d said John Carr, director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University. \u201cWe think we are the center of the world. We are not the center of Pope Francis\u2019 world. He is frankly more comfortable in the slums of Argentina than in the corridors of power.\u201d RELATED: Welcome to our big, messy religious debate, Pope Francis From the flurry of encyclicals, writings and other commentary that Francis has issued since his election two years ago, the United States, home to the world\u2019s mightiest market economy, a ravenous consumer culture and nurturer of the World Wide Web, appears to represent much of what he abhors. That\u2019s why Francis faces a delicate political assignment as he meets President Barack Obama and addresses Congress, in addition to holding masses and other public events in Washington, Philadelphia and New York this week. Francis is stepping into an intense domestic debate on issues close to his heart, including income inequality, climate change, abortion, the definition of marriage, religious freedom and immigration. Rival politicians are sure to exploit his visit for their own purposes, and the messages he imparts could potentially reshape how those issues figure in the presidential campaign. One reason he may have little to lose: Unlike the lawmakers whom he will stand before during the first-ever address to a joint meeting of Congress by a Pope, Francis is accountable only to his faith and the Gospel and so is unlikely to hold back for political reasons. READ: The Pope vs. the GOP \u201cHe is coming to the richest country in the world. I believe he is going to challenge us to say with that comes great responsibility,\u201d said Rudy Lopez, executive director of Interfaith Worker Justice. Many observers expect Francis to implicitly rebuke Republicans \u2013 some of whom deny a link between human behavior and climate change, a topic which he addressed in an encyclical in June \u2013 for their reluctance to tackle global warming. The Pope may also wade into the raging debate about immigration in the United States, after warning earlier this year that nations that close the door on migrants should seek God\u2019s forgiveness. But he\u2019s going to be an \u201cequal opportunity disturber,\u201d said Rev. James Martin S.J., editor at large for America magazine, the journal of U.S. Jesuits. Democrats could find themselves criticized for support of abortion and same-sex marriage, policies that conflict with the doctrine of the Catholic Church. And the gesture Francis will make by going directly to lunch with homeless people rather than with his congressional hosts after his speech on Capitol Hill will resonate on both sides of the aisle. \u201cHe is a walking, talking parable,\u201d said Carr. \u201cThis is a Pope who looks at the world from the bottom up and from the outside in. I think he brings to Congress and the White House a different perspective than they are used to hearing.\u201d And that perspective could be galling for both parties. \u201cThe role of the Christian is to comfort the afflicted \u2013 of course \u2013 but also to afflict the comfortable. We have people who need to be afflicted a little bit, particularly in their outlook towards the poor and the marginalized,\u201d said Martin. The man who became Pope Francis Although the Pope hasn\u2019t articulated a clear view on the United States since being elected, much commentary has been devoted to his Argentine roots and whether he adheres to a Latin American worldview that is suspicious of the United States and aggressive capitalism. READ: The Pope: Not just for Catholics anymore But Francis is unlikely to openly wag a finger at the United States. His criticisms could be bold, but they will be implicit \u2013 possibly in one of his famous digressions from his prepared text \u2013 and they will be delivered with grace and civility. \u201cHe is a good teacher,\u201d said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Monday. \u201cHe knows one of the more effective ways to teach is to reaffirm what is good, to congratulate us on what we are doing well.\u201d For instance, he is likely to praise American liberty, democracy, opportunity and religious and racial plurality. \u201cWhen you do that, a savvy person says, \u2018Boy, that\u2019s sure good of him that he is affirming what we do good. But on the other hand, are we doing it as well as we should?\u2019 \u2018\u201d Dolan said. \u201cThere\u2019s where the examination of conscience comes in.\u201d But while Francis is almost universally praised for his personal example of humility and the way he lives his faith \u2013 his approval rating in the U.S. was at 59% in a Gallup poll in July \u2013 he\u2019s also attracted plenty of criticism here. His progressive political views on many issues \u2013 well to the left of any major U.S. political figure \u2013 are often criticized as those of a naif straying out of his lane, and conservatives say he misunderstands the role of free enterprise in lifting millions of people around the world out of poverty. His June encyclical provided a blistering critique of rich countries\u2019 energy consumption and their role in climate change, which he labeled \u201cone of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.\u201d Pope Francis visits Cuba In the same document, he also blasted social media, in a message that can make for uncomfortable reading in the nation that gave the world the iPhone, Google, Facebook and Twitter: \u201cWhen media and the digital world become omnipresent, their influence can stop people from learning how to live wisely, to think deeply and to love generously.\u201d READ: As Pope arrives, poll finds a welcoming America And he has reserved some of his harshest language for capitalism as it is practiced in the United States and elsewhere. \u201cAn unfettered pursuit of money rules. The service of the common good is left behind,\u201d he said at a conference in Bolivia in July. \u201cOnce capital becomes an idol and guides people\u2019s decisions, once greed for money presides over the entire socioeconomic system, it ruins society, it condemns and enslaves men and women, it destroys human fraternity.\u201d Six of the current GOP presidential candidates, including Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie, are practicing Catholics. They have all said that while they take their religious teaching from the Pope, they look for political guidance elsewhere. Much of Obama\u2019s agenda, in comparison, fits more comfortably with the Pope\u2019s positions. The Pope was influential, for instance, in brokering Obama\u2019s recent opening with Cuba, and the President has referenced the Pope\u2019s remarks in his own warnings about the dangers of economic inequality. But the administration also has its differences with the Pope. The President has been criticized for inviting an openly gay Episcopal bishop and several gay activists to a White House welcoming ceremony for the Pope. And the Democratic Party\u2019s traditional support for abortion rights collides directly with Catholic doctrine. Opinion: Pope\u2019s U.S. visit can unite the fight against modern-day slavery So it is not only the GOP that is awaiting the Pope\u2019s message with some anxiety. White House officials admit they have no idea what he will say. \u201cThe Pope is a very independent figure, and we know from his previous travels that we don\u2019t know what he is going to say until he says it,\u201d said Charles Kupchan, National Security Council senior director for European Affairs, which includes the Holy See. Kupchan said he expected that there would be some elements of the Pope\u2019s message with which the White House would not concur. But he added: \u201cWe are hoping that his moral authority helps us advance many of the items that we take to be very high on our policy agenda.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The politics of a papal visit, the impressions Joe Biden is leaving as he travels the country and the post-debate terrain for Ted Cruz and Rand Paul filled our final Sunday turn around the Inside Politics table. The Speaker and the Pope House Speaker John Boehner is about to experience a moment of great celebration and is determined to enjoy it despite the persistent challenges and frustrations that come with his job. There are more rumors of a conservative bid to oust Boehner, and the big debate over whether a government shutdown should be on the table in the latest spending skirmish with President Obama. But Speaker Boehner plans to block all that out this week, at least for a few special moments with a very special guest: Pope Francis. Robert Costa of The Washington Post shared insights on a Boehner milestone: \u201cAfter Pope Francis speaks at Congress this week, he\u2019s going to walk to the Speaker\u2019s balcony with House Speaker John Boehner,\u201d explained Costa, adding that Boehner has tried for years to bring the Pope to Washington. \u201cIt will be a moment for Boehner that many of his friends have told me will really cap Boehner\u2019s career in Congress. As a Catholic, it will be a public moment of Boehner\u2019s faith.\u201d Timing is everything in politics, and so it\u2019s impossible for Pope Francis to come to the United States without some chatter about whether his visit might impact the 2016 presidential race. On issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, the view of the Catholic Church are much more in line with the Republican platform. But on topics like wages, climate change and immigration, Pope Francis will have more allies among Democrats. Julie Pace of The Associated Press told us several of the 2016 contenders hope to share in the spotlight of the papal visit, even if they have a policy difference or two with the pontiff. \u201cA lot of these candidates are deciding that at least for this week, it\u2019s better to be with the Pope than against him,\u201d Pace told CNN. \u201cAll three of the senators running for the White House are returning to Capitol Hill to attend the Pope\u2019s address to Congress, Jeb Bush plans to attend a Mass with the Pope in Washington, and Chris Christie, who is another Catholic running, plans to attend one of his events on the East Coast.\u201d As he travels the country, Vice President Biden is promoting President Obama\u2019s agenda while also weighing his own political future. Florida and Michigan are among the states the vice president has visited over the past week or so - and it isn\u2019t lost on anyone that those and other Biden stops happen to be presidential battleground states. We know the V.P. is wrestling with whether to join the 2016 campaign, and Ron Fournier of National Journal reports that those who get a chance to talk to Biden face-to-face on these trips come away with a clear impression. \u201cI talked to a lot of folks who talked to him, talked to his people. They\u2019re convinced that he\u2019s more likely to run than conventional wisdom in D.C. would indicate,\u201d Fournier explained. \u201cOne person said, \u2018I got the clear impression talking to him directly that he\u2019s trying to talk himself into running,\u2019\u201d continued Fournier, who then went on to explain why Biden may run for president in 2016. \u201cThe two big reasons why he might get in are, one, once you run for president, it\u2019s hard to get that out of your system. And two, his son did call him to this job and that\u2019s weighing heavy on him.\u201d Ted Cruz is rare among the GOP presidential contenders in that he says he will not attack Donald Trump. The Texas senator has struggled in the polls, and it is clear Trump is part of the reason: the billionaire\u2019s support among evangelicals and tea party backers comes, at least, partially at Cruz\u2019s expense. But Cruz takes the long view, and believes if Trump slumps down the road, those voters will come his way, as long as he is properly positioned if and when that moment arises. CNN\u2019s Nia Malika Henderson shared reporting that the Cruz campaign strategy is to hammer home his reputation as an anti-establishment outlier. His campaign is \u201creally going to try to emphasize his record in Washington and going against the Washington establishment, whether it comes to voting against Chuck Hagel (the former Defense Secretary under Obama) and really leading that fight a long time ago, leading the fight against gun control, leading the fight against immigration reform, leading the fight against Obamacare,\u201d explained Henderson. \u201cSo that\u2019s one of the things they\u2019re really going to try do: (The rest are) sort of pretenders to the \u2018Outsider Throne,\u2019 but Ted Cruz is the \u2018Original Outsider.\u2019\u201d Rand Paul: Hard Choices Rand Paul is running for two jobs at once - president and re-election to his Kentucky Senate seat. But there is new, post-debate pressure for the GOP senator to reconsider his presidential ambitions. Strategists whose job it is to worry about the 2016 Senate races and protecting the GOP majority are grumbling that Paul\u2019s Senate campaign is in rough shape. Especially, they say, from a fundraising perspective. One GOP source says recent efforts to raise more cash for the Senate operation are meeting skepticism from GOP donors who say they don\u2019t see a clear Paul commitment to the Senate seat. Many of these Senate-focused strategists are making it clear they would prefer Paul shut down the struggling presidential campaign. So far, though, there is zero evidence Paul is in a mood to listen.",

            "article_content": "Big winners for the night include: Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie Less clear is how Wednesday's performance will affect the campaigns of Jeb Bush and Ben Carson The day after a marathon three-hour meeting of 11 top tier candidates, here\u2019s our take on the winners and losers of CNN\u2019s Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Carly Fiorina Fiorina insisted in the lead-up to the GOP debate that she belonged on the debate stage with the top-tier White House hopefuls. She proved as much Wednesday night. For the second debate in a row, Fiorina was once again the breakout star of the night, taking on Republican front-runner Donald Trump with finesse and capturing the crowd with polished, zinging answers and an impassioned charge against abortion. Fiorina earned perhaps the biggest applause of the night as she skewered Planned Parenthood. \u201cThis is about the character of our nation and if we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us,\u201d Fiorina said to raucous applause in what was her biggest moment of the night, one that will appeal to the socially conservative base of the party. Fiorina dodged an early opportunity to hit Trump but didn\u2019t make that mistake again when she was asked to address the businessman\u2019s recent comments about her appearance to Rolling Stone, in which he suggested her face would make her unelectable. \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,\u201d she said, once again to overwhelming applause. Fiorina takes on Trump New York journalist and CNN contributor Errol Louis said after the debate that Fiorina was \u201cthe clearest winner.\u201d \u201c(She) successfully challenged Trump \u2013 criticizing his wisecracks about her personal appearance and challenging his credentials as a global businessman by deftly ticking off hotspots around the world and suggesting ways she would tackle them,\u201d he wrote in a CNN op-ed. Fiorina distinguishes herself on debate stage Marco Rubio Rubio proved Wednesday night why so many GOP elites have long considered him a top contender for the Republican nomination: He can weave his strong handle of policy with a compelling personal narrative. Best debate moments from Christie, Fiorina and Rubio Rubio took on Trump differently than Fiorina or Bush, dispatching the front-runner without attacking him directly, instead steering the debate toward his strengths. When Trump pointed out Rubio\u2019s voting absences in the Senate, Rubio refused to retort with an attack of his own. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I have missed some votes, and I\u2019ll tell you why, Mr. Trump. Because in my years in the Senate, I\u2019ve figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m missing votes. Because I am leaving the Senate, I\u2019m not running for re-election, and I\u2019m running for president because I know this: unless we have the right president, we cannot make America fulfill its potential, but with the right person in office, the 21st century can be the greatest era that our nation has ever known.\u201d Most awkward moments of the debate Jeb Bush Bush stood out with several key moments during the debate that reassured his supporters after recently dipping in the polls and grappling with how to handle Trump\u2019s staying power in the race. Bush appeared to come out of the shell of the tortoise he has so heartily embraced as his symbol to give voters a taste of the passion he has struggled to showcase. \u201cYou know what? As it relates to my brother, there\u2019s one thing I know for sure. He kept us safe,\u201d Bush told Trump to one of his strongest applause moments of the night. \u201cYou remember the fire fighter with his arms around it? He sent a clear signal that the United States would be strong and fight Islamic terrorism, and he did keep us safe.\u201d And he also successfully tackled Trump over the billionaire\u2019s suggestion that Bush\u2019s Mexican-American wife was the reason for his support for comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cTo subject my wife into the middle of a raucous political conversation was completely inappropriate, and I hope you apologize for that, Donald,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you apologize to her right now.\u201d Trump declined. Republican debates: The main event With expectations low, Bush\u2019s several stand-out moments and overall improvement over his performance in the first debate sealed his spot as one of the night\u2019s winners. CNN political commentator Amanda Carpenter said Bush\u2019s references to his family were immediately beneficial for him. \u201cI think the most interesting subtext with Jeb Bush in this debate is his newfound willingness to defend his family,\u201d said the former Ted Cruz aide. \u201cHis best moment of the debate I think is when he came out and reminded everyone that his brother kept America safe. On the same hand, I think that will haunt him in the long term because I think tying himself to his brother\u2019s legacy is bad in the long run.\u201d On Thursday morning, Carpenter said the former Florida governor should have been more forceful in demanding an apology from Trump for comments that real estate developer had made about Bush\u2019s wife in the past. \u201cHe could have been stronger and I think a lot of women were thinking that,\u201d she said on CNN. Candidates pick their Secret Service code names Chris Christie While Bush and Fiorina milked their standout moments from their tiffs with Trump, the New Jersey governor snagged his by using a key moment to make his opponents look narcissistic and portrayed himself the adult in the room. \u201cWhile I\u2019m as entertained as anyone by this personal back-and-forth about the history of Donald and Carly\u2019s career, for the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight who doesn\u2019t have a job, who can\u2019t fund his child\u2019s education, I\u2019ve got to tell you the truth. They could care less about your careers, they care about theirs,\u201d Christie said. \u201cLet\u2019s start talking about that on this stage and stop playing \u2013 and stop playing the games.\u201d Earlier in the night, Christie suggested the problem with the debate was \u201cwe\u2019re fighting with each other up here\u201d over how to approach defunding Planned Parenthood even though \u201cwe agree.\u201d And that\u2019s when Christie \u2013 who\u2019s been accused of being too moderate \u2013 gave his best performance yet to prove his conservative credentials. \u201cShe (Hillary Clinton) believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb to preserve their body parts\u2026in the way that maximizes their value for sale for profit,\u201d Christie said. 5 memorable moments from the debate Donald Trump Trump faced a barrage of attacks from a field of contenders clearly more prepared, and eager, to take on the brash billionaire. Those who pulled punches in the last debate \u2013 like Scott Walker and Jeb Bush \u2013 didn\u2019t hesitate to tackle Trump, eager to regain their faltering standings in the polls. The result was mixed as Trump had both memorable highlights and cringe-worthy lowlights. But as the front-runner trying to hold on to the lead as retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson\u2019s numbers grow, it\u2019s difficult to see how Trump wasn\u2019t at least partially wounded by Thursday\u2019s performance. Trump stumbled in responding to Fiorina\u2019s deft answer to his comments about her face, awkwardly calling her \u201cbeautiful\u201d after suggesting her looks would keep Americans from voting for her. Former Bush aide and CNN political commentator Ana Navarro spoke highly of the move. \u201cI thought it was brilliant, because he surprised us all with his answer,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cHe shut it down.\u201d And when Bush attacked him for a \u201clack of judgment\u201d and \u201clack of understanding about how the world works,\u201d Trump resorted to an oft-used tactic of tying Bush to his brother\u2019s presidency suggesting that \u201cyour brother\u2019s administration gave us Barack Obama because it was such a disaster \u2026 that Abraham Lincoln couldn\u2019t have been elected.\u201d Bush\u2019s quick answer \u2013 that his brother kept the country safe \u2013 knocked Trump off balance as the crowd roared in approval. Trump\u2019s stamina tested in GOP debate However, Trump hit his high notes when he was on the offensive, delivering some of the standard fare that his supporters likely devoured. He said he never attacked Sen. Rand Paul on his looks though \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of subject matter right there\u201d \u2013 and he took on both Fiorina and Walker\u2019s records with numbers to back his rhetoric. Best Trump zingers of the CNN Republican debate And as he faced questions over foreign policy and his flubbed response to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who was one of the debate\u2019s questioners, Trump smartly pivoted to Hewitt, insulating himself from further attacks from his rivals. Trump managed to escape the main question over his knowledge of various terrorist groups and their leaders by pointing out that Hewitt had recently conceded to a misunderstanding between the two when Hewitt spoke of the Quds Forces, which Trump misheard as \u201cKurds\u201d \u2013 leading to crosstalk between the two, not between Trump and a fellow candidate. Conservative analyst Mercedes Schlapp said Trump was silent for more than 30 minutes of discussion n serious policy issues. \u201cThere was a point when he was speechless,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could tell he was so uncomfortable talking about any of the issues except for immigration.\u201d Odds of Trump nomination drop after debate John Kasich There wasn\u2019t much daylight between the Ohio governor\u2019s first and second debate performances. But Kasich\u2019s second performance lacked the umpf that defined his first appearance on the debate stage when he barely squeaked into the top-tier and impressed political observers just weeks after launching his candidacy. Fact-checking the candidates Rand Paul Paul continued to throw things at the wall on Wednesday \u2013 still nothing appeared to stick. The libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky once again went for Trump\u2019s jugular. When he was asked whether he would trust Trump with the nuclear codes, Paul gave a firm answer: absolutely not. But with each attack, Paul failed to do what candidates must do to break out in a debate: Pivot to his own strengths. Instead he simply pointed out Trump\u2019s weaknesses. Paul\u2019s strongest moments came when he defended his libertarian point of view on foreign military interventions and drug and criminal justice reform. But while those audiences likely played well to his libertarian base of support, Paul appeared the odd one out as he discussed foreign policy amid a field of foreign policy hawks. Scott Walker Walker came out swinging at the start of the debate, clearly eager to take on the front-runner after dipping in the polls in recent weeks off a strategy that largely avoided confronting Trump. \u201cWe don\u2019t need an apprentice in the White House. We have one there right now,\u201d Walker said of Trump in what was clearly a prepared zinger \u2013 one that drew an approving nod from Bush. Walker then took on Trump\u2019s attacks about his tenure as governor and then defended his opposition to the minimum wage, but soon faded from the stage. He delivered his responses with more zeal in a performance that topped his first debate night, but didn\u2019t come away from the night with any breakout moments that may prove necessary as Walker looks to regain his footing in the race. Graphic: Who attacked whom at the debate? Ben Carson The second Republican debate was all Carson\u2019s for the taking: the retired neurosurgeon\u2019s appearance comes off a recent surge that has rocketed him to the No. 2 spot in the race. But instead, Carson played it safe, clinging to his calm and measured demeanor, avoiding the food fights unfolding alongside him and injecting his trademark good humor into his responses. Memorable quotes from the #CNNDebate It wasn\u2019t for a lack of opportunities: Carson got several openings to knock Trump, but refused, even when Trump put forward some sketchy scientific backing for his views on vaccines. A few zingers could have delivered the bump Carson needs to overtake Trump in at least one of the early states where he has been slowly catching up to the billionaire front-runner. But Carson may get there anyway: his unorthodox appeal on Wednesday shied away from the spotlight-charging moments that often define presidential debates \u2013 not unlike his first debate performance. Mike Huckabee & Ted Cruz While both delivered solid responses to the questions they received, neither former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee nor Texas Sen. Ted Cruz seized opportunities to stand out on the crowded 11-candidate stage. They didn\u2019t want to take on Trump and both revealed an unwillingness to engage their fellow candidates on key policy issues. The result? They faded into the background. Candidates repeatedly attempted to distance themselves from the Beltway and paint themselves as anti-establishment, said former Obama aide David Axelrod. \u201cSo Washington was a big loser in this debate for sure,\u201d said Axelrod, a CNN senior political commentator. 6 takeaways from the debate CNN\u2019s Eugene Scott contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "For once, it wasn\u2019t the Donald Trump show. The billionaire businessman\u2019s uneven performance at CNN\u2019s prime-time Republican presidential debate Wednesday gave Carly Fiorina and Jeb Bush openings to seize the spotlight. And they did, putting Trump in the unusual position of being on defense throughout the evening. Fact-checking the candidates Fiorina, who fought her way onto the main stage with a breakout debate performance last month, pointedly confronted the real estate mogul. She was stern when asked about Trump\u2019s recent assessment of her appearance, when he told Rolling Stone: \u201cLook at that face!

Minutes later, Trump once again let a moment of potential confrontation slip by \u2013 this time in an exchange with Bush.

It was a notable shift for Trump, who galvanized last month\u2019s debate with his explosive rhetoric and unrelenting onslaught against his rivals. Wednesday\u2019s debate also crystallized a shifting dynamic in the large GOP field: Trump\u2019s competitors are done tiptoeing around their party\u2019s unorthodox front-runner. The three-hour debate touched on a wide range of issues, including immigration, national security, tax policy and legalization of marijuana. Candidates spoke passionately about Planned Parenthood and vowed to defund it as president.

Right out of the gate and without being prompted, he went after Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. \u201cRand Paul shouldn\u2019t even be on this stage, he\u2019s number 11,\u201d Trump said. Republican debates: The undercard That didn\u2019t sit well with Paul, who responded that Trump was \u201csophomoric\u201d and scolded him for criticizing people\u2019s physical appearance. Trump responded: \u201cI never attacked him on his looks and believe me there\u2019s plenty of subject matter right there.\u201d Top social media moments from the #CNNDebate Trump also pounced on Fiorina\u2019s controversial tenure as head of Hewlett-Packard.

Under pressure from his supporters to pick up his game, Bush seemed determined to prove that he could hold his own. He accused Trump of buying influence: \u201cYou got Hillary Clinton to go to your wedding.\u201d \u201cExcuse me, Jeb, I got along with Clinton, I got along with everybody,\u201d Trump responded.  \u201cExcuse me.\u201d Bush cut in with a curt: \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cMore energy tonight \u2013 I like that,\u201d joked Trump, who has been criticizing Bush repeatedly for lacking in charisma.

Bobby Jindal, former New York Gov. George Pataki, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum brawled over thorny issues such as immigration. When the conversation turned to the controversial issue of \u201cbirthright citizenship,\u201d Graham said there were certain \u201crich Asians, rich people from the Mideast\u201d that were \u201cbastardizing citizenship.\u201d Jindal, meanwhile, defended his policy views on immigration, repeatedly asserting that he did not support amnesty. 5 best moments of the GOP debate In another heated exchange, Pataki and Santorum butted heads about a Kentucky county clerk\u2019s refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The woman, Kim Davis, has reignited a national debate about a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that legalized same-sex marriage across the country. Santorum called the Supreme Court ruling \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d and said there is no more important right than the ability for a citizen to freely exercise his or her conscience. #Breaking: @GovernorPataki says he would have fired #KimDavis for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses http://t.co/jcEf6bW9ja But Pataki said he would have fired Davis for violating the law. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision but it is the law of the land,\u201d Pataki said. While the four candidates traded barbs over numerous issues, there were also calls for the GOP to focus on the ultimate prize of taking back the White House. \u201cIf it is Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders (that becomes president), they\u2019re going to pick people we\u2019re going to disagree with all the time,\u201d Graham said in reference to Supreme Court nominations. \u201cPlease understand that we have to win this election.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Second-tier Republican presidential candidates blasted Donald Trump as unfit to be president and feuded over Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis\u2019s stand against same-sex marriage in a spirited debate on CNN Wednesday. The four lowest-ranking GOP White House hopefuls, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, ex-New York Governor George Pataki, former Sen. Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal also squabbled over taxes, immigration, national security and the minimum wage. Fact-checking the candidates Right from the top of the debate at the Reagan presidential library, the candidates unloaded on Trump, the Republican front-runner, who was expected to face intense attacks in a later showdown between the 11 candidates at the top of national opinion polls. Republican debates: The main event Jindal said that Democrats were gifting the election to the GOP with front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s misfiring campaign, but he warned that the best way to hand it back would be to nominate Trump. \u201cHe\u2019ll implode in the general election or if, God forbid, if he were in the White House, we have no idea what he would do,\u201d Jindal said. READ: Lindsey Graham shines at undercard debate Pataki warned Trump was \u201cunfit to be the president of the United States or the Republican nominee,\u201d saying that the billionaire had once promised to make Atlantic City great, just as he now vows to make America great, but had instead turned the coastal resort into an economic nightmare. Graham, who at times seemed to seize the initiative in the debate, drove home his belief that only he, after decades in the Air Force and 35 trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, is qualified to be commander-in-chief. Carly Fiorina distinguishes herself on debate stage \u201cPresident Obama is making a mess of the world,\u201d he said, and warned it would be wrong to choose another \u201cnovice\u201d to be commander-in-chief, arguing Obama\u2019s inaction had provoked a humanitarian crisis in Syria. Lindsey Graham: \"In my world Hispanics are Americans\" \u201cHow does President Obama sleep at night? Look what you let happen on your watch,\u201d Graham said. Pataki and Santorum, meanwhile, haggled over the fate of Davis, who went to jail for several days rather than issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The former New York governor said that he would have fired Davis over her refusal to honor a Supreme Court decision opening the way to nationwide gay marriage, despite the fact she has emerged as a heroine among conservative voters. Jindal objected: \u201cWe need a president who\u2019s going to fight a court that is abusive, that has superseded their authority.\u201d Pataki hit back. 5 best moments of the GOP debate \u201cWow. You know, we\u2019re going to have a president who defies the Supreme Court because they don\u2019t agree\u201d he said, arguing that the Constitution requires legislators to act if previous laws were struck down. But while the four candidates traded barbs over numerous issues, there were also calls for the GOP to focus on the ultimate prize of taking back the White House to ensure there would not be a liberal majority on the court if a Democratic candidate became president. Republican debates: The undercard \u201cIf it is Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, they\u2019re going to pick people we\u2019re going to disagree with all the time,\u201d Graham said in reference to Supreme Court nominations. \u201cPlease understand that we have to win this election.\u201d Each candidate set out to plow his own route to better poll numbers in the debate. Graham narrowed in on national security, while Jindal eviscerated the Republican establishment in Washington, complaining that GOP leaders had failed to overturn Obamacare despite congressional majorities. Pataki said he would be the only candidate who could win support among Democrats and apparently also had an eye on independent voters who can be important in the New Hampshire Primary. Santorum, meanwhile, sought to court the social conservative voters who helped him win the Iowa caucuses in 2012. The most awkward moments Graham and Santorum also dueled over immigration. Santorum said he would start by reinforcing the southern U.S. border while ordering millions of people who had overstayed their visas to leave. But Graham countered that any Republicans who alienated increasingly important Latino voters were doomed to lose the White House. Governor George Pataki: I'd fire Kim Davis \u201cWho won Hispanics?\u201d he asked, referring to previous elections. \u201cIn my world, Hispanics are Americans.\u201d In an intense 75-minute debate among bottom-tier candidates who are desperate just to keep their long-shot White House challenges alive and to try to somehow leap into the top echelon of candidates, there wasn\u2019t much light relief. Graham repeatedly warned that the failure of the United States to destroy ISIS in Syria and Iraq would lead to terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. But despite his dark world view, Graham did have a few funny lines \u2013 in one case, for example, he recalled that Reagan used to share cocktails with Democratic House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill when he was president. He said the first thing he would do in the White House would be to reach out to Democrats to try to break Washington\u2019s legislative logjam, saying \u201cwe are going to drink more.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Watch the Republican presidential debates at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. ET this Wednesday live on CNN and CNNgo, and join the conversation at #CNNDebate. In 1979, as civil war in El Salvador began to grip the country, a young man named Aristedes Parada faced a choice: Stay home and be recruited into the bloody fight, or flee for a chance to survive. \u201cThere was no future there. I had to be hiding from the military, from the guerrillas,\u201d Parada told CNN of his youth in El Salvador. \u201cIt was horrible.\u201d He boarded a bus heading north for a days-long journey that would take him across his native country, through Guatemala and Mexico, and finally, to the U.S. border, where he hired a coyote to guide him into Texas illegally. Without papers, Parada worked in construction in Houston, and eventually made his way to Virginia, where he married Edelmira Parada, a young Salvadoran woman also lived there unlawfully. They had two children, both born as U.S. citizens. Capturing Ronald Reagan during the golden age of TV News The Paradas were among many who poured across the U.S.-Mexico border around the time when Ronald Reagan began his presidency.  He faced a situation that appears all-too-familiar to the 2016 presidential candidates, who are grappling with a similar problem three decades later. But Reagan\u2019s solution was very different: He eventually granted amnesty to millions. While Reagan is recognized among Republicans as the greatest president in modern times, most GOP presidential candidates are ignoring his approach to immigration. Much like the immigration discussion today, the influx of undocumented immigrants vexed lawmakers during the Reagan years, who struggled to with the question of how to balance border security and the rule of law with families who had put down roots in the country. The problem ballooned, and took center stage in the 1984 presidential election. GOP candidates battle to claim Ronald Reagan\u2019s mantle \u201cI believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and lived here, even though sometime back they may have entered illegally,\u201d Reagan said at a presidential debate in 1984. In 1986, Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which granted amnesty to 2.7 million undocumented immigrants who had arrived in the U.S. before 1982, had a clean record and registered with the Selective Service. Critics of the law, however, have pointed out that it failed to crack down on future waves of illegal immigration. The Paradas applied, and also sought sponsorship from their employers just in case they were rejected. By 1995, they too were granted U.S. citizenship. Heading into the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump, the GOP\u2019s front-runner, is calling for the deportation of millions back to their countries of origin, proposed doing away with birthright citizenship and promised to build a wall along the entire border with Mexico. Others have condemned amnesty. As a presidential contender, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker reversed his position on providing a pathway to citizenship to undocumented immigrants. Even Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who helped guide a comprehensive immigration bill through the Senate, has backed away from that legislation, even though he still supports the policies within it. Opinion: What Reagan knew about immigration Families like the Paradas have watched the rise of Trump and other Republican contenders closely. \u201cThey speak so much of Ronald Reagan. But when it comes to immigration, they try to hide it somehow and don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Parada, who has thrived in the U.S. in the construction business, said. \u201cA lot of people disagreed with his idea back then too, but he did it anyway.\u201d Reagan, Parada added, \u201cis a hero for a lot of people. He is for me.\u201d",

But she added, \u201cIt has crossed my mind.\u201d Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight The laughter at the thought of a \u201cVice President Bill Clinton,\u201d was a light turn for the besieged Democratic front-runner. Clinton has continued sliding in national polling based on voters\u2019 lack of trust in her, thanks in large part to how she has handled controversy over using a private email address for public work as secretary of state.

She had a nice way of introducing her husband, as if I didn\u2019t know who he was, right?\u201d Clinton said. \u201cCertainly think many people see her as someone who gets up every day and tries to figure out how to make that day successful.\u201d And of West, who joked recently he was running for president in 2020, Clinton said, \u201cWell, if I\u2019m going for my second term, (I would ask him) to wait four years, but if I\u2019m not \u2026 be sure he has comfortable shoes because there\u2019s a lot of walking involved.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Gun control, illegal immigration and abortion are taking the spotlight in 2016 Polling generally suggests Democrats have the upper hand in terms of public opinion Across three domestic issues that are shaping up to be more important to the 2016 presidential election than they were in 2012 \u2013 gun control, illegal immigration and abortion \u2013 polling generally suggests Democrats have the upper hand in terms of public opinion, but a new CNN/ORC Poll finds the nuances in views on these issues don\u2019t always favor one party over the other. All three have become increasingly important to voters and prominent within the campaign itself and could come up during Wednesday\u2019s Republican debate hosted by CNN in Simi Valley, California. In June 2011, 22% of voters called gun policy an \u201cextremely important\u201d issue in their vote for president, that\u2019s risen 20 points since to 42%. Likewise, 29% called illegal immigration a top issue in June 2011, that\u2019s up 10 points to 39%, while the share calling abortion an extremely important issue is up 7 points to 27%. Here\u2019s a look at where the public stands on each. Most polling has shown the public broadly in favor of expanded background checks for gun buyers and preventing those with mental health issues from purchasing guns, but the new poll shows majorities think current laws are about right or even too harsh, and doubt that expanded background checks would keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill or convicted criminals. READ: The complete CNN/ORC Poll results on guns Overall, 41% say existing laws make it too easy for people to buy guns, down from 56% saying so about a month after the shooting deaths of 27 people at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. About half, 49%, say current laws are about right, and 10% that they make it too difficult to buy a gun. These mixed overall views mask sharp divides by sex, partisanship, age and urbanity. Among women, 52% say the current laws make it too easy to buy a gun, while just 30% of men agree. Two-thirds of Republicans, 65%, think current laws are about right, just 28% of Democrats agree. And a majority of seniors, 51%, say it\u2019s too easy to get a gun, while only 37% of those under age 50 think the same. Urban residents are more apt than suburbanites or rural residents to say it\u2019s too easy to get a gun, 46% who live in urban areas say that compared with 40% in the suburbs and 37% in rural areas. At the same time, many express doubts that expanded gun laws would be able to prevent those with mental health problems from buying guns (44% see that as likely, 56% unlikely), or that such laws would keep guns out of the hands of convicted criminals (42% say that\u2019s likely, 58% unlikely). But most also say it wouldn\u2019t necessarily make it harder for a law-abiding citizen without mental health problems to buy one, 57% say it\u2019s unlikely to do that. Even among those who say it is now too easy to buy a gun, just small majorities believe that implementing more comprehensive background checks for all gun purchases would be likely to stop gun purchases by the mentally ill (53%) or convicted criminals (55%). President Barack Obama receives mostly negative reviews for his handling of gun policy, 59% disapprove of his handling of the issue on which he said he\u2019s been the \u201cmost frustrated and most stymied\u201d during his presidency; just 35% approve of his work. That\u2019s worsened since a June poll, and nears his 2014 low of 33% approval on it. That drop off comes particularly among liberals. In the new poll, just 53% of liberals approve of Obama\u2019s handling of gun policy, down from 63% in June. Among moderates (44% then, 41% now) and conservatives (23% then, 19% now), the declines have been smaller. Illegal immigration has become a defining issue in the race for the Republican nomination for president, as GOP front-runner Donald Trump has focused his campaign on claims that illegal immigration is destroying the country and his ideas for solving the problem. Most Americans say the solutions ought to focus more on border security and a path to citizenship over deportation, but about half are receptive to Trump\u2019s proposals including building a wall along the entire border with Mexico and ending birthright citizenship for children of those in the country illegally. Asked whether the nation\u2019s top priority in dealing with illegal immigration should be deporting those already in the country, developing a plan to stop new illegal immigration, or developing a plan to allow those already in the U.S. illegally with jobs to become legal residents, a plurality say a plan to make those here illegally legal residents is most important (46%), next, 39% chose border security, and just 14% called deportation the top priority. Border security leaps to the top of the list when Americans are asked what the next priority should be, with 88% overall choosing it as a first or second priority, 70% choosing a path to legal residency and 37% deportation. Republicans are most apt to have selected deportation as a top or second priority, 48% do so, compared with 38% of independents and 26% of Democrats. READ: The complete CNN/ORC Poll results on immigration Still, 52% say they favor building a fence along the entire border with Mexico, up from 45% who backed that idea in 2006. The public is more evenly divided on ending birthright citizenship for children born to parents in the country illegally, 50% say such children should be granted automatic citizenship, 49% that they should not. Among Trump\u2019s backers, 87% support building a fence between the U.S. and Mexico, and 82% think children born to parents in the U.S. illegally should not be granted citizenship. Republicans who do not support Trump tend to agree with these views, but there\u2019s greater dissent than among Trump\u2019s backers: 65% support a fence between the U.S. and Mexico, 67% ending birthright citizenship. Despite Trump\u2019s claims that Mexico has been intentionally sending their least desirable citizens to the U.S. illegally and poses a threat to the nation, just 37% say they see Mexico as a threat to the United States, that\u2019s well below the share that see Iran (82%), North Korea (76%) or Russia (70%) as a threat to the nation. Among Republicans, however, 56% say they think Mexico is a threat, just 23% of Democrats and 37% of independents agree. Trump supporters are particularly apt to see Mexico as a threat, 64% say so compared with 48% of Republicans who do not back Trump. Trump may be having more of an impact when it comes to perceptions of China\u2019s threat to the U.S. About 73% in the new poll said they see China as a serious threat, up from 54% in April, with the share calling China a \u201cvery serious threat\u201d nearly doubling from 18% to 33%. A congressional fight looms over funding for Planned Parenthood following the release this summer of several secretly recorded, heavily edited videos of Planned Parenthood employees discussing the sale of fetal tissue for scientific research, but the new CNN/ORC Poll shows the public would much rather continue funding Planned Parenthood than face a government shutdown. About 71% say it\u2019s more important for Congress to approve a budget agreement that would avoid a government shutdown than to defund Planned Parenthood, 22% say it\u2019s a bigger priority to eliminate the organization\u2019s federal funding. That\u2019s more saying it\u2019s important to avert a shutdown now than in September 2013, just before a budget fight over federal funding for some portions of the Affordable Care Act led to a partial government shutdown. READ: The complete CNN/ORC Poll results on abortion In the new poll, 87% of Democrats and 74% of independents say avoiding a shutdown is the key priority, while Republicans are just about evenly divided, with 48% saying avoiding a shutdown is more important and 44% saying ending Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding is most important. Even among those who say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, however, 63% say it\u2019s a higher priority for the government to approve a budget and avoid a shutdown than to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood. A CNN/ORC Poll conducted in August found that most Americans (66%) said that in general, the federal government should continue to provide funding for Planned Parenthood, 31% that the organization\u2019s federal funding should be eliminated. That\u2019s about the same as in April 2011, when some Republicans in Congress tried to cut funding for Planned Parenthood from the federal budget. Overall, 39% of adults in the new poll think abortion should be legal in most circumstances, 58% that it should be illegal in most. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone Sept. 4-8 among a random national sample of 1,012 adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.",

Here\u2019s a look at this week\u2019s political insults: On Wednesday, the Rolling Stone published a profile of the real estate mogul, and one specific comment received a lot of attention from critics. \u201cLook at that face!\u201d Trump said while sitting with a reporter as Carly Fiorina appeared on TV. \u201cWould anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president.\u201d Trump added, \u201cI mean, she\u2019s a woman, and I\u2019m not s\u2019posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?\u201d Trump was asked about that comment by CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo and he insisted, \u201cI\u2019m not talking about looks. I\u2019m talking about persona.\u201d On Thursday night, Trump attempted more damage control when he told Fox\u2019s Greta Van Susteren that remarks he\u2019s made about Fiorina and other women were made when he was acting as an \u201centertainer.\u201d \u201cMany of those comments are made as an entertainer, because I did \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019 It was one of the top shows on television. I decided not to do it again because I wanted to run for president. But some comments are made as an entertainer. And, as everybody said, as an entertainer [it] is a much different ballgame,\u201d Trump said. Trump hasn\u2019t been shy about his distaste for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Trump has repeatedly said that Bush has \u201clow energy,\u201d but this week he took it a step further when he published a video on Tuesday to his Instagram account, sarcastically asking, \u201cHaving trouble sleeping at night? Too much energy? Need some low energy?\u201d followed by \u201cJeb, for all your sleeping needs.\u201d While the narrator speaks, the Instagram video shows Bush speaking at a forum while a woman is asleep in the background. On Wednesday, Bush was quick to respond and say the woman featured is a \u201cbig supporter\u201d of his who had simply worked a long day and was tired. \u201cShe woke up at 4 o\u2019clock, she had a 12-hour shift, she had to take her child to drop her child off before she went to work,\u201d he said. On Thursday, the former Florida governor told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that Trump can\u2019t insult his way into the White House, referencing Trump\u2019s comments about Fiorina. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t see how over the long haul that you can insult your way to the nomination or the president \u2013 certainly not the presidency \u2013 and not the nomination either,\u201d Bush said. He added, \u201cThis disparaging of women is deeply troubling. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense to me.\u201d Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton was in Wisconsin on Thursday, where she told an audience of students in Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s home state that he is not a \u201creal leader.\u201d \u201cIt seems to me, by just observing him, that Governor Walker thinks because he busts unions, starves universities, guts public education, demeans women, scapegoats teachers, nurses and firefighters, he is some kind of tough guy on his motorcycle \u2013 a real leader,\u201d Clinton said, referring to Walker\u2019s motorcycle riding. \u201cWell, that is not leadership, folks. Leadership means fighting for the people you represent.\u201d .@HillaryClinton while you pander to union bosses, I give workers freedom to choose if they want to be in a union or not. - SW Walker took to Twitter to respond and said, \u201cWhile you pander to union bosses, I give workers freedom to choose if they want to be in a union or not.\u201d In an Aug. 28 interview on Ora.tv with Larry King, actor Robert Redford said he was glad that Trump was running in the 2016 presidential campaign, but not all of it was praise. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s in there because him being the way he is, and saying what he says the way he says it, I think shakes things up and I think that\u2019s very needed,\u201d Redford told King. \u201cBecause on the other side, it\u2019s so bland.\u201d Trump tweeted his appreciation, saying, \u201cWow! Such nice words from Robert Redford on my running for President. Thank you, Robert.\u201d But Redford also critiqued the candidate, saying that the real estate mogul has \u201csuch a big foot in his mouth, I am not sure you can get it out.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Looney Tunes\u2019 and not \u201cMerrie Melodies.\u2019 It\u2019s crazy stuff,\u201d he said, adding that Americans felt foolish watching all of the candidates running against each other. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has unleashed a verbal war against Trump this week. \u201cThe Donald Trump act is great, and the idea of Donald Trump is great,\u201d Jindal said during a speech at the National Press Club. \u201cBut the reality of Donald Trump is absurd.\u201d He also attacked Trump\u2019s character, calling him a \u201cnarcissist\u201d and \u201cegomaniacal.\u201d \u201cI like the idea of Donald J. Trump,\u201d Jindal told CNN\u2019s Carol Costello Friday morning. \u201cWhat worries me is, however, that as conservatives, we have a choice. Do we turn to our principles, or do we turn to a man who believes in nothing but himself?\u201d Trump tweeted that he wouldn\u2019t respond to anyone who isn\u2019t polling at less than 1%. He tweeted Friday morning, \u201cOh wow, lightweight Governor @BobbyJindal, who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls, just mocked my hair. So original!\u201d Oh wow, lightweight Governor @BobbyJindal, who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls, just mocked my hair. So original! On Thursday, Trump tweeted, \u201cBobby Jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met him \u2026 I only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls. I never thought he had a chance and I\u2019ve been proven right.\u201d Bobby Jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met him\u2026. .... I only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls. I never thought he had a chance and I\u2019ve been proven right. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was once protected from Trump attacks because the real estate mogul believed Carson was a \u201cgood guy.\u201d That changed once Carson spoke about his dislike for Trump\u2019s immigration plan and his faith. Carson said he believes that deporting 12 million undocumented immigrants isn\u2019t ideal. \u201cIt sounds really cool, you know, \u2018Let\u2019s just round them all up and send them back,\u2019\u201d Carson said in San Francisco this week. \u201cPeople who say that have no idea what that would entail in terms of our legal system, the costs - forget about it. Plus, where you gonna send them? It\u2019s just a double whammy.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the only comment Carson made toward Trump this week. Carson, who is usually regarded as the most mild mannered, also questioned Trump\u2019s faith. \u201cBy humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life and that\u2019s a very big part of who I am. I don\u2019t get that impression with him,\u201d Carson said of Trump. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t get that.\u201d Trump, who has said that the Bible is his favorite book, responded to Carson\u2019s comment on Thursday and told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, \u201cWho is he to question my faith? When I am \u2013 I mean he doesn\u2019t even know me.\u201d He added, \u201cWhen he questions my faith \u2013 and I\u2019m a believer, big league, in God and the Bible \u2013 and he questions my faith and he doesn\u2019t know me.\u201d He didn\u2019t stop there. He also compared Carson to Bush, saying that he makes Bush look like the \u201cEnergizer Bunny.\u201d \u201cAll of a sudden, he\u2019s becoming this man of faith and he was heavy into the world of abortion,\u201d Trump continued about Carson. He added that Carson, the first surgeon to separate conjoined twins, was an \u201cOK doctor\u201d with once \u201chorrendous\u201d views on abortion, referencing Carson\u2019s medical research in the early 1990s on tissue from aborted fetuses. Carson ducked an opportunity to hit back at Trump on Friday. \u201cWell, the question is, do I want to respond to Donald Trump\u2019s charges? The answer is no. I really don\u2019t,\u201d Carson told reporters in Ferguson, Missouri. \u201cBecause what I have discovered is the media loves to stoke up controversy and have people fighting each other like gladiators, and I think that\u2019s exactly the wrong thing to do. I\u2019ve made it clear that I was not attacking him. It was interpreted that way by the media and I think he took the bait. But I\u2019m not taking the bait. I\u2019m not going there. Next question.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A new CNN/ORC poll shows that Trump has increased his lead among Republican women The real estate tycoon has repeatedly defied the normal rules of politics, building his standing among almost every GOP demographic group For any other presidential candidate, making off-color \u2013 and arguably sexist \u2013 comments about a female competitor would likely result in an insurmountable problem with women voters. Not so for Donald Trump. At least not yet. A new CNN/ORC poll shows that Trump has increased his lead among Republican women, boosting his share to 33% of women voters, up from 20% a month ago. The real estate tycoon has repeatedly defied the normal rules of politics, building his standing among almost every GOP demographic group and leaving his opponents scrambling for how to respond. Jeb Bush said that Trump couldn\u2019t insult his way to the White House, yet Trump\u2019s insult-heavy strategy appears to be working, as Bush sits at 9% in the polls. Trump\u2019s success with Republican women follows a high-profile fight with Fox New\u2019s Megyn Kelly led both Republicans and Democrats to pound him over what many saw as gender-based attacks. Now, a Rolling Stone article has brought yet another headline-grabbing fight with a woman, this time with Carly Fiorina, who is the only woman in the GOP field. Related: Is Donald Trump sexist? \u201cLook at that face! Would anyone vote for that?\u201d Trump said to a Rolling Stone writer. \u201cCan you imagine that, the face of our next president.\u201d Trump added: \u201cI mean, she\u2019s a woman, and I\u2019m not s\u2019posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?\u201d Fiorina, who has been out front in attacking Trump over his comments about women, said that she didn\u2019t want to waste time wondering what he meant. Bush on Trump: You can\u2019t insult your way to the White House \u201cBut maybe, just maybe, I\u2019m getting under his skin a little bit, because I am climbing in the polls,\u201d she said in a Fox News interview. But no candidate has climbed as much as Trump, who stands at 32% in the recent CNN/ORC poll. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on \u201cNew Day,\u201d Trump went on clean-up duty, insisting that he was talking about Fiorina\u2019s persona and not her appearance.  He also criticized her stewardship of Hewlett-Packard, where she was ousted as CEO. But even with the Fiorina dust-up, Trump clearly wants to appeal to women, appearing Thursday morning on \u201cThe View,\u201d where he was taken to task for his comments. The real estate tycoon framed himself as a leader on women\u2019s issues, singling out his opponents. \u201cInteresting thing is my daughter and wife say you should speak more about women\u2019s health issues because they know how strongly committed I am,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd Jeb Bush and Hillary are not committed like I am.\u201d Trump has repeatedly attacked Bush for questioning whether \u201cwe need half a billion dollars for women\u2019s health issues,\u201d a statement the former Florida governor later backed away from. Trump\u2019s equal opportunity approach to hurling out loaded criticisms clearly resonates with some GOP women, who, like other Republicans, have been drawn to Trump\u2019s brash rhetoric. Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump: Bring it on \u201cAlthough there was once a strong component of feminism and women\u2019s rights advocacy within the GOP, feminism is now strongly associated with the Democrats,\u201d said Catherine Rymph, who wrote the book \u201cRepublican Women.\u201d  \u201cSo voters, including women, who don\u2019t like Democratic feminism or so-called \u2018political correctness\u2019 in general may very well find refreshing Trump\u2019s delight in using language about women that many find offensive.\u201d Among Democrats, Trump\u2019s comments are pure red meat, underscoring a line of attack that has been at the center of their strategy in past election cycles. Clinton, who has sought to brand the GOP as the party of Trump, later took a not-so-veiled swipe at Trump, who she has referred to as the \u201cflamboyant front-runner.\u201d \u201cWe hear from candidates on the other side about turning back the clock on women\u2019s rights,\u201d Clinton said Thursday at a Women for Hillary event in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cAnd there is one particular candidate who just seems to delight in insulting women any chance he gets. I have to say, if he emerges, I would love to debate him.\u201d Democratic National Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz called Trump\u2019s comments misogynistic. \u201cYesterday, in an interview, he even had the nerve to make an outrageous comment about one of his fellow candidate\u2019s looks, so I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just, I\u2019m not really willing to give Donald Trump credit for very credible, substantive beliefs,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said when asked about his actual policy proposals.\u201d In hypothetical match-ups, Clinton fares best against Trump among women, leading him by double digits. Burned by the gender gap in 2012, the GOP has tried to broaden its appeal to women by recruiting women candidates and downplaying divisive cultural issues. Trump, who was challenged in the first Republican debate over comments he made about women and got into a prolonged fight with Kelly, doesn\u2019t broaden the GOP\u2019s appeal to independent women. \u201cHe is a bully and he is obnoxious and he is all things that women don\u2019t really want in a husband in an employer or their president,\u201d said Katie Packer, who runs a firm dedicated to helping the GOP expand their appeal to women. \u201cBut there is a segment of Republican women who will put up with anything, as long as they have someone who will \u2018tell it like is,\u2019 because that\u2019s all they care about. He is doing well among the women that we already get.\u201d Packer is neutral in the race, but she is founding partner of WWP Strategies, which works for GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio in Michigan. Trump has staked his candidacy on a brand of populist bombast, with a hawkish approach to illegal immigration at its core. Among Republican women, 52% say that issue is \u201cextremely important,\u201d with 45% of men saying the same thing, suggesting that women are slightly more attuned to this issue. Since he joined the race for the White House, Trump has drowned out his opponents, forcing them to go on the attack to try to regain some ground. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whose seen his poll numbers plummet, struck out at the businessman on Twitter: \u201cTrump\u2019s personal attacks against @CarlyFiorina are plain inappropriate and wrong. It\u2019s time for these shameless attacks to end.\u201d Fiorina has argued that she is the ideal candidate to run against Clinton, as she would blunt the appeal of a historic run, but she remains at the bottom of the GOP pack.  Among women, she draws just 3% support. Engaging with Trump has proved a risky strategy for his opponents, with some seeing their poll numbers drop after taking him on. Yet for FIorina, such a move could pay dividends by allowing her to highlight her agenda and unique place in a crowded field. \u201cI think Carly Fiorina is saying good things, and she is the only one speaking up,\u201d said Sabrina Schaeffer, the executive director of the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, \u201cShe is the only one responding to the progressive women\u2019s agenda, which is going to be a cornerstone of the Democrat\u2019s campaign. It\u2019s a lost opportunity if the other Republicans stay silent.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump gained 8 points since August to land at 32% support, the new CNN/ORC poll says Ben Carson rose 10 points to land in second place with 19% Donald Trump has become the first Republican presidential candidate to top 30% support in the race for the Republican nomination, according to a new CNN/ORC Poll, which finds the businessman pulling well away from the rest of the GOP field. Trump gained 8 points since August to land at 32% support, and has nearly tripled his support since just after he launched his campaign in June. The new poll finds former neurosurgeon Ben Carson rising 10 points to land in second place with 19%. Together, these two non-politicians now hold the support of a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, and separately, both are significantly ahead of all other competitors. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush stands in third place with 9%, down 4 points since August, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz holds fourth place with 7%. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker follow at 5%, with all other candidates at 3% or less, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who notched the only other statistically significant shift in the poll by falling 5 points since August. READ: The complete CNN/ORC poll results Trump\u2019s gains come most notably among two groups that had proven challenging for him in the early stages of his campaign \u2013 women and those with college degrees. While he gained just 4 points among men in the last month (from 27% in August to 31% now), he\u2019s up 13 points among women, rising from 20% in August to 33% now. Trump has also boosted his share of the vote among college graduates, increasing his support among those with degrees from 16% in August to 28% now. Among those without degrees, he stands at 33%, just slightly higher than the 28% support he had in August. RELATED: Carson questions authenticity of Trump\u2019s faith Trump has also catapulted ahead of the rest of the field among Republicans who back the tea party movement, from 27% support in August to 41% now. Among that group in the new poll, Carson follows with 21%, and Cruz, another candidate with an anti-Washington message, holds third with 11%. No other candidate tops 5% among tea partiers. Carson\u2019s gains, meanwhile, have come chiefly among core partisans \u2013 he\u2019s up 13 points among Republicans and 11 points among conservatives \u2013 and he runs closest to Trump among white evangelicals (32% back Trump, 28% Carson), a key voting bloc within the Republican primary electorate. Carson also has enthusiasm at his side. Republicans are more than twice as likely to say they would be enthusiastic with Carson at the top of the ticket than if Rubio, Cruz, Walker or Bush led the GOP into 2016, and while he and Trump are about even in enthusiasm (43% would be enthusiastic if Carson got the nod, 40% if Trump did), fewer say they would be disappointed if Carson emerged the victor (20% would be dissatisfied or upset if Carson won, 32% if Trump did). Still, most Republican voters (51%) think Trump is most likely to emerge as the GOP winner, well ahead of the 19% who think Bush will top the party ticket and 11% who think Carson will. In a July poll, 14% of Republican voters said they thought Walker was most likely to wind up the winner, in the new poll, that figure stands at just 1%. Support for the \u201coutsider\u201d contingent of Trump, Carson and to some extent businesswoman Carly Fiorina (who hasn\u2019t built on her post-debate boomlet in this poll, she has just 3% support) rests more on their positions on the issues than their experience outside of Washington. RELATED: Trump insults Fiorina in Rolling Stone Among those backing one of those three candidates without experience in elective office, 75% say they back them because of their views on the issues, 16% because of their on-the-job experience and 7% because they dislike the other candidates. Among those backing candidates who have previously been elected to office, 34% say their experience is the main draw, 51% issue positions, and 14% say it\u2019s due to dislike of the other candidates. Although Bush\u2019s support for the nomination has dipped only slightly since the August poll, there are few positive signs for a man once seen as the front-runner for the nomination. The 19% who think he\u2019s most likely to win the party\u2019s nomination is down from 31% in July. Nearly half of Republicans (47%) say they would be dissatisfied or upset should he win the nomination, and just 16% say they would be enthusiastic about his candidacy if he did win. And his push to be the candidate of economic growth hasn\u2019t resonated: Just 7% who call the economy an extremely important issue say they would back him for the Republican nomination. As Trump and Carson have gained, Republican voters have begun to gain enthusiasm for the coming presidential election. While 28% described themselves as \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d about the election in July and August, that\u2019s now climbed to 34%, while deep enthusiasm among Democrats has dipped from 33% to 28%. RELATED: Trump slams Ben Carson Trump\u2019s growth in the field has also come alongside an increase in attention to the issue of illegal immigration. A majority of Republicans now call the issue extremely important to their vote for president, 51% now call it extremely important, up from 39% in a June CNN/ORC poll. Among that group, Trump holds a wide lead, with 42% support compared with 17% for Carson, 10% for Cruz, 9% for Bush and 5% for Walker. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone September 4-8 among a random national sample of 1,012 adults. This sample included 930 interviews with registered voters, 474 of whom were self-identified Republicans or Republican-leaning independents. For results among all registered voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. Among Republican voters, it is plus or minus 4.5 points.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s the riddle of Marco Rubio. The Florida Republican might be the most natural politician in the 2016 White House field. Yet for all his potential, he\u2019s stuck low in the pack of GOP candidates after a riotous summer hijacked by Donald Trump. His aspirational, optimistic brand of conservatism has struggled for traction in a season of seething political anger. Still, If GOP strategists had sat down to build a candidate to win back the White House, amid the wreckage of 2012, their prototype would look a lot like the youthful Rubio. With silky political skills, an American Dream story rooted in humble beginnings, hawkish national security reflexes and historic potential as a pioneering Latino, Rubio also offers a generational contrast with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. \u201cMarco Rubio is like Roy Hobbs in baseball: The Natural,\u201d said Bob Vander Plaats, a top social conservative activist in Iowa, referring to the movie about a young hotshot prospect played by Robert Redford. \u201cHe is very skilled at being a politician.\u201d Even Rubio\u2019s foes acknowledge his flair. \u201cWhen Marco Rubio speaks, young women swoon, old women faint and toilets flush themselves,\u201d said Dan Gelber, a former Florida House Democratic minority leader, recalling a warning he gave his troops when his silver-tongued rival was the state\u2019s speaker. \u201cThis guy is really good. Marco is instinctive. He is also very, very disciplined.\u201d But despite his credentials, which also include a statewide power base in the crucial swing state of Florida, the 44-year-old has yet to establish a strong position in the polls in any early voting contest. He failed to get the jump pundits expected after a strong first debate. His struggles are a reminder that in presidential politics, timing is as important as talent. In an election season that\u2019s giving outsiders the advantage, voters aren\u2019t very attracted to polished politicians. In fact, the candidates who are prospering amid a storm of anti-Washington anger are those who are not politicians at all, including Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. And it\u2019s possible that, after President Barack Obama, GOP voters are not looking to elevate another freshman senator. Rubio\u2019s campaign, however, is not panicking. The senator is working methodically through early states, raising cash at a healthy clip and laying out detailed policy plans, particularly on national security as he vows to rip up Obama\u2019s Iran deal and stiffen the U.S. stance toward Russia and China. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to the polls at this stage,\u201d said Rubio\u2019s communications director Alex Conant. \u201cIt\u2019s very early in the process \u2026 there are going to be a lot more debates.\u201d He added: \u201cIn the long run, Marco is somebody who can unite the party and inspire the nation.\u201d READ: September scramble looms for Congress History is on Rubio\u2019s side: Summer front-runners rarely prosper once the weather cools and primary voting starts. But given the scouting reports on Rubio, and buzz that he represents the future of the conservative movement, his polling does seem tepid. He averages seventh place in Iowa and South Carolina polls, came 10th in an NBC/Marist poll published Sunday in New Hampshire, and averages fifth place in national surveys, 20 points behind Trump. Of course, it\u2019s early \u2013 there are five months before the Iowa caucuses, plenty of time for the GOP race to mature, and thoroughbreds to move to the front. But Rubio\u2019s low-key start does beg questions about whether he has a viable path to the GOP nomination. Many Republican veterans feel he will improve over time. And he could benefit from a lack of early scrutiny as rivals like Scott Walker struggle to adapt to a national stage and his mentor, Jeb Bush, risks damage from a clash with Trump. \u201cRubio \u2026 has a combination of a factors that can make his fortunes rise if in fact he has the staying power,\u201d said Ken Blackwell, a former Republican secretary of state in Ohio. \u201cThat means he has to raise the money, he has to develop the organization and capacity in key states, he has to resonate on his message.\u201d In a normal year, Rubio\u2019s methodical strategy \u2013 touring battleground states, building a finance and get-out-the vote network, and laying out policy might be shrewd. But the 2016 race is on steroids. No one knows how its going to turn out. \u201cThere is just not a lot of oxygen left in the room. Donald Trump sucks the air out of any room he walks into,\u201d said Scott Huffmon, a professor of political science at Winthrop University, South Carolina. Rubio says he\u2019s playing the long game, and draws similarities with his 2010 Senate race, in which his tea party-backed campaign fought an establishment candidate and won. \u201cWhen I entered that race,  the only people who thought I could win all lived in my home. Four of them were under the age of 10,\u201d Rubio told crowds in South Carolina and Nevada during recent campaign swings. Late last month in Columbia, South Carolina, Rubio demonstrated his breadth before an audience of 900 students, getting into detail on poverty reduction, preserving the American dream and threats to U.S. national security. Rubio held another audience rapt the next morning at a steakhouse in Myrtle Beach, a tea party stronghold. His half-hour stump speech made a case for a candidacy anchored on a conservative approach to a key 2016 theme: the millions of Americans left marooned by the slow-growing economy. His stump persona suggests a politician in a hurry and a clipped delivery that contrasts with the halting style of Bush, his mentor. It\u2019s an emerging paradox about his campaign: While Rubio seems to be struggling to make noise in the GOP race, many Democrats privately say they fear him. READ: Marco Rubio: Donald Trump foreign policy answers \u2018very concerning\u2019 There\u2019s no mystery that Clinton was the target of Rubio\u2019s initial campaign mantra: \u201cYesterday\u2019s over.\u201d He jumps on chances to engage Clinton. He has said she\u2019s desperate for comparing GOP views on women\u2019s issues to those of terrorist groups. Rubio has recently stepped up attacks on Clinton over her email controversy, saying it is \u201cdisqualifying\u201d for someone seeking the presidency. But before he can battle the former secretary of state, Rubio must figure out how to confront the insurgent wave powering Trump, Carson and Fiorina. \u201cWe are trying to build a campaign here,\u201d Rubio told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny in Puerto Rico last week. \u201cWe want to be in first place in February, not in August or September. We have a campaign that is designed to achieve that goal.\u201d While other candidates have tried to match Trump in outrage, Rubio argues that being angry will not solve anything, countering the billionaire\u2019s promise to make America great again by arguing the nation is already pretty special. But he\u2019s got an ear to the ground on the economy. He frequently notes concern that millions of people think \u201cthe American dream is out of reach,\u201d talks about how to cut the cost of college and how free enterprise \u2013 not government power \u2013 is the way to cope with economic volatility. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Rubio\u2019s father was a bartender and his mother a housekeeper. It\u2019s an approach meant to address perceptions that Republicans simply don\u2019t care about those left behind by an economy that seems to favor the wealthy, a narrative that helped tank 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. While the campaign will not divulge its early-state strategy, it admits Rubio must perform well in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. \u201cAnyone who wants to win the Republican nomination has to prove themselves in the early states,\u201d said Conant. Rubio may have an opening in South Carolina, where he won support from former senator and tea party champion Jim DeMint, when he ran for the Senate. The state may also be a fit for his fiscal conservatism and robust foreign policy views. His Hispanic heritage meanwhile may be helpful in Nevada, a state where he has wide contacts along with family ties after living there as a teenager. Senior figures in his campaign brain trust also hail from the state. READ: Iran nuclear deal figures big in \u2018Day 1\u2019 presidential candidate promises In Iowa, Rubio could benefit from his backing of insurgent Republican Joni Ernst in her successful midterm Senate race. But a number of Iowa activists expressed private concerns that Rubio had yet to fully commit to the Hawkeye state. When conservatives are asked about Rubio, they often say they want to find out more. But he doesn\u2019t provoke the gushing response reserved for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Carson or Trump. While Cruz can convincingly argue that he lived up to his promise to sabotage what he calls the Washington \u201ccartel,\u201d Rubio still has to explain his ill-fated work on a comprehensive immigration reform package, which is radioactive among the conservative grass-roots. Some key Republicans also question whether Rubio really knows where his base is. \u201cI think he is trying to thread an awkward needle,\u201d said Vander Plaats. \u201cRubio might be able to be the establishment candidate. But he would also like to be the tea party, outside candidate.\u201d Ultimately, Rubio needs a moment in the spotlight \u2013 not easy to come by in such a crowded Republican field. \u201cIf Marco gets open water he is going to separate himself from a lot of the crowd, \u201d said Gelber. \u201cBut I am not sure when that is going to happen.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Congress comes back Tuesday from a five-week summer recess Congress's agenda includes the Iran nuclear deal, funding the government and the visit of Pope Francis Get ready for the September scramble. After more than a month off, lawmakers return to Washington on Tuesday facing the most frenetic agenda in recent memory. By the middle of September, Congress will have to decide whether to block President Barack Obama\u2019s historic nuclear deal with Iran. Lawmakers are also staring down a September 30 deadline to avert the second government shutdown in two years \u2013 a debate that\u2019s increasingly divisive as it becomes tied to the Planned Parenthood controversy. And in between these two showdowns, Pope Francis will become the first pontiff to address a joint meeting of Congress \u2013 a speech that will almost certainly highlight issues that make both parties uncomfortable. In a Congress that has lurched from crisis to crisis in recent years, lawmakers have struggled to address even the most basic issues without drama. With so many historic decisions to make at once, this is sure to be a September to remember. Here\u2019s what to expect: House and Senate votes on the Iran nuclear agreement are expected this week, but they are more about messaging since the White House has already secured enough votes to preserve the deal. Last week, Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski became the 34th Democrat to come out in favor of the agreement, giving the President the votes to uphold a veto on a Republican resolution to block it. Supporters continue to try to get enough support from undecided senators to prevent Republican leaders from even holding a vote on the controversial deal. They need 41 votes to block debate and currently are just shy of that threshold. What is the Iran deal, and can it pass through Congress? While the fight on the Iran deal is over in practical terms, the political war over the issue will continue through the next election, when Republicans vow they will elect a president who will roll back the agreement. Both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner argue that a majority of both chambers oppose the deal and point to some polls that show most Americans are critical. \u201cIf people vote for me, they know they\u2019re voting to get rid of that deal on the first day of my presidency,\u201d promised Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, a presidential candidate. The rhetoric will escalate Wednesday when a tea party group has scheduled a rally outside the Capitol to oppose the Iran deal. Headlining the gathering will be two Republican presidential candidates: Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. The deadline for Congress weighing in on the nuclear agreement is September 17. If both chambers are able to pass the resolution to block it, the House would vote first on overriding the President\u2019s veto. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi proclaimed last week that she is \u201cconfident we will sustain the President\u2019s veto in both houses of Congress.\u201d The hottest ticket in Washington will be to the September 24 speech by the extraordinarily popular Pope Francis in the House chamber. Boehner, who is Catholic, has tried to secure a papal appearance since he was first elected to Congress in 1990. Pope Francis Only a select few will get a seat inside. Boehner imposed a rule barring former members from using their floor privileges to attend, and each congressional office is given just one ticket for a seat in the visitor\u2019s gallery. Due to intense interest, a series of Jumbotrons will be set up on the West Front of the Capitol so the public can watch. The Pope is expected to appear briefly on a Capitol balcony to see the crowd. A limited number of tickets close to the balcony will go to House and Senate offices, some of which are setting up lotteries online to decide which constituents will get the coveted passes. McConnell told reporters last month: \u201cWe have more requests for this appearance than anything anybody can ever recall around here.\u201d Even as members from both parties say they are excited about the Pope\u2019s speech, there could be awkward moments. Most Republicans don\u2019t agree with Pope Francis\u2019 statements criticizing capitalism and promoting permissive immigration policies. Many Democrats are at odds with the social policy positions of the Catholic Church, although the Pope has made some modifications recently. Here we go again. Congress faces a September 30 deadline to pass legislation to fund the government, but a fight over abortion politics is threatening another possible shutdown. Republican leaders are expected to unveil a short-term funding bill that keeps federal agencies running through the fall or mid-December, but conservatives want to strip out federal funding for Planned Parenthood. That\u2019s a non-starter for most Democrats, and the White House says the President would veto such a bill. Multiple congressional committees launched investigations this summer into Planned Parenthood after an anti-abortion group released a series of videos that it says prove that some affiliates are selling fetal parts for profit. The group denies the allegations and has released its own report saying the videos are heavily edited. McConnell, who has repeatedly insisted there will be no shutdown, acknowledges Republicans don\u2019t have the votes to force the President\u2019s hand on the issue. \u201cI would remind all of your viewers: The way you make a law in this country, the Congress has to pass it and the President has to sign it,\u201d McConnell told WYMT, a Kentucky TV station, last week. He added, \u201cThe President has made it very clear he\u2019s not going to sign any bill that includes defunding of Planned Parenthood, so that\u2019s another issue that awaits a new president hopefully with a different point of view about Planned Parenthood.\u201d An effort to pass a bill defunding the group failed last month in the Senate. But Cruz \u2013 who in the past has led high-profile efforts to block legislation he opposes \u2013 has vowed to use every procedural tool at his disposal to ban federal funds for Planned Parenthood. House and Senate Republican leaders are urging their members to focus on the investigations, not another spending fight they don\u2019t think they can win. They believe the public hearings can potentially increase public pressure on Democrats and the White House. One idea leaders are considering is to include a provision to defund Planned Parenthood into a separate legislative package that repeals key parts of Obamacare. The so-called \u201creconciliation\u201d bill allows the Senate to pass legislation related to the deficit with a simple majority, not the 60 votes most legislation needs to pass the Senate. While approval of a short-term \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d averts a shutdown, it\u2019s a temporary Band-Aid. Partisan fights over the annual spending bills have caused the process to stall out, and leaders from both sides say the only way to find any medium- or long-term solution is to broker some type of broad bipartisan budget deal between the White House and Capitol Hill. \u201cOur Democratic friends want to spend more on everything. We\u2019d like to spend more on defense. And so there will be a sort of grand negotiation here in the fall between the two sides over just how big the discretionary budget of the United States government ought to be and how it ought to be spent,\u201d McConnell told WYMT. Congress will also need to address the debt ceiling, and that could be potentially wrapped into some kind of year-end budget deal. The debate over the nation\u2019s borrowing authority is always contentious because conservatives don\u2019t want to increase the debt limit without imposing new spending cuts. Those Senate Republicans running for president are expected to try to use their positions to make a mark in the crowded 2016 GOP field in the hopes they can raise their poll numbers after weeks of Trump dominance. That\u2019s likely to cause McConnell headaches given the list of high priority bills he needs to get done this fall. Boehner also has to deal with familiar fights with members of the right in his conference. Earlier this summer, one conservative, North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, attempted to oust Boehner by offering a resolution to remove him as speaker. The challenge went nowhere, and Meadows told CNN that for now he\u2019ll hold off pushing for a floor vote until he evaluates how much input from him and other conservatives is included in leadership decisions in September. \u201cThe only fair thing to do is see if that process is fixed,\u201d Meadows told CNN by phone last week. Funding for federal roads, bridges and transit projects will expire at the end of October so Congress will need to come up with a proposal to add money to the highway trust fund. After 35 short-term extensions, leaders of both chambers are hoping to find agreement on a five- or six-year deal.",

            "article_content": "The Club for Growth's plan to take on  Donald Trump Bernie Sanders' growing Iowa campaign operation A policy and a political move by Hillary Clinton, fresh reporting on Bernie-mentum, an overseas election that could impact the one here at home, and a Trump-inspired twist on an old proverb \u2013 those stories filled our \u201cInside Politics\u201d forecast. What do the Ellen DeGeneres show and a big speech on the Iran nuclear deal have in common? Clinton's next phase CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny connected those dots as he shared reporting on how the Clinton campaign hopes to change the subject as it emerges from the Labor Day weekend. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see Hillary Clinton a lot more than we\u2019ve seen her over the last few months or so,\u201d said Zeleny. \u201cShe\u2019s on the \u2018Ellen\u2019 show on Tuesday, she\u2019s giving an Iran speech Wednesday. Later in the week she\u2019s rolling out a new campaign finance plan. \u201cSo she\u2019s trying to combat all of these questions about email by actually getting out there, answering more questions and trying to talk about policy more than we\u2019ve seen so far. They know the emails are not going away, but they want to try to add to the soundtrack of her campaign.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont says he senses Clinton\u2019s campaign is getting a little nervous at his success in the presidential polls, and he seems determined to keep it that way. Juana Summers of Mashable joined us just after returning from a reporting trip to Iowa where she found not only a happy candidate \u2013 but also a growing Sanders campaign team in the Hawkeye State. \u201cHe\u2019s built up a campaign with more than 50 paid staffers on the ground, just added a new press secretary,\u201d said Summers. \u201cSo it will be interesting to see whether or not he can turn these big crowds and attention that he\u2019s got across the country into a real force in Iowa that can reckon with Hillary Clinton. And he said Saturday he thinks the Clinton campaign is getting a little bit nervous about him.\u201d Guatemala holds its presidential election Sunday, just days after its president resigned, and the results could well reverberate in the U.S. presidential election. An important 2015 election Ed O\u2019Keefe of The Washington Post smartly walked us through the reasons. \u201cDespite what Donald Trump thinks, most illegal immigration is coming from Central America \u2013 from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador \u2013 and economic and political instability is what causes it,\u201d said O\u2019Keefe. \u201cIf this new government that gets elected at some point this fall takes over, and things stabilize, we\u2019ll probably see a decline in illegal immigration. But if the problem persists next year, of course, illegal immigration might tick up, just in time for our own elections, keeping the issue alive.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s success is teaching us all some new and important lessons about today\u2019s political environment. But there also are some familiar lessons, like how politics makes strange bedfellows. The club against Trump Case in point: the conservative Club for Growth is about to launch a big TV ad campaign against Trump \u2013 pointing out things like his past praise of a single-payer health care system and his current call for higher taxes on hedge fund managers. For years, the Republican establishment has looked with scorn on the Club for Growth, criticizing it for attacking Republican incumbents as big spenders. This cycle, for example, the club has said it might support a primary challenge against Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But its plans to go after Trump in the days ahead are more than welcomed by GOP establishment groups and leaders, who in the past have used derisive labels like \u201cClub for Dopes\u201d to describe the conservative organization. Don\u2019t expect lasting peace here, but in Trump\u2019s case, this is a reminder of the old proverb: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Candidates who spend time in New Hampshire this cycle are hearing firsthand about a burgeoning heroin epidemic that not only tests families but is taxing local resources. It is an issue hardly unique to New Hampshire, sadly, but its high profile in the first primary state is getting some high-powered attention, including a new proposal from the Democratic presidential front-runner. Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast takes a look at the potential impact of Clinton\u2019s plan to help first responders get more \u2013 and less expensive \u2013 access to a key drug. \u201cLast week Hillary Clinton released her plan to deal with drug and alcohol addiction, and one part of that plan was allow first responders to have access to a drug called naloxone, which essentially stops a heroin overdose,\u201d said Kucinich. \u201cIt\u2019s a potentially life-saving drug that\u2019s very, very expensive, so the plan also includes a plan to pay for this.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve had Bernie Sanders looking into it, you\u2019ve had other politicians. Hillary Clinton is the latest person to put a focus on this drug, and you have to wonder if Congress or if this manufacturer will start lowering the price because of the attention.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The pledge means Trump has promised to not run a third-party candidacy It also means Trump would support the eventual GOP nominee, whoever that may be Donald Trump has signed the pledge. The Republican presidential front-runner met privately with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus Thursday afternoon, and soon after, came out to the lobby of Trump Tower to declare that he has signed a loyalty pledge. This means Trump has promised to support the party\u2019s eventual nominee \u2013 whoever that may be \u2013 and that he will not run as a third-party candidate. \u201cThe best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up. And for that reason, I have signed the pledge,\u201d Trump said, holding up the paper. \u201cSo I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and for the conservative principles for which it stands.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will go out and fight hard, and we will win.\u201d All 17 Republican presidential candidates have now pledged to support the GOP\u2019s eventual presidential nominee, Priebus announced Thursday evening in a statement, billing it as a sign of \u201cparty unity.\u201d But if Trump\u2019s official declaration of allegiance to the party serves to calm the nerves of establishment Republicans \u2013 at least for now \u2013 it could also invite backlash from some of the bombastic candidate\u2019s die-hard supporters. Trump has propelled himself to the top of the polls by casting himself as an anti-establishment, outsider candidate, railing against career politicians and the Washington political class. Signing an RNC pledge complicates that image. Katrina Pierson, a spokeswoman for the Tea Party Leadership Fund and a Trump defender, told CNN she personally does not condone the pledge. \u201cThe GOP has not been loyal to members of its own party during previous election cycles,\u201d PIerson said. \u201cI can\u2019t see any reason why he would give up that leverage considering a lot of his supporters like the idea that he\u2019s running against the establishment.\u201d Thursday\u2019s 15-minute sit-down with Priebus comes amid unease about whether the billionaire businessman would rebuff the party and seek the White House as an independent. Soon after Trump announced his candidacy, Priebus asked the real estate magnate to tone down his fiery rhetoric on immigration, as establishment Republicans grew increasingly worried that Trump was angering the Hispanic community. Trump explained Thursday that he came to the decision to sign the pledge because the Republican Party in recent months has been \u201cextremely fair\u201d to him. \u201cThe RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period and as you know, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be treated any differently.\u201d Asked what he got in return for signing the paper, Trump responded: \u201cassurance that I will be treated fairly.\u201d RNC officials began circulating a pledge to various GOP presidential campaigns this week, measuring up how much appetite there is in the field to commit to supporting the eventual nominee. \u201cI, ________, affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,\u201d it reads. RELATED: Source says Trump likely to rule out independent bid The pledge continues: \u201cI further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.\u201d Advisers to the candidate have said all along that Trump was never seriously interested in launching an independent run, which is an arduous \u2013 and costly \u2013 process. The pledge has not only put pressure on Trump to commit to the party, it\u2019s also forcing some of his rivals to promise to support Trump if he were to clinch the GOP nomination. It\u2019s a particularly uncomfortable position for a candidate like Jeb Bush, who in recent weeks has publicly clashed with Trump. The two men have released attack videos on social media, and openly criticized one another on the trail. On ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d Thursday morning, Bush lashed out at Trump, saying, \u201cI think Donald Trump is trying to insult his way to the presidency and it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d However, pressed on whether he would support Trump if he were to become the nominee, the former Florida governor answered in the affirmative. \u201cYes, I would, of course. We need to be unified. We need to win,\u201d Bush said. After Trump\u2019s press conference, Bush tweeted a tongue-in-cheek version of the pledge that said, \u201cVoted Republican since 1972.\u201d .@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/RbagyBXspr Meanwhile, others are raising questions about just how enforceable a loyalty pledge is. \u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s unenforceable,\u201d said Carly Fiorina on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cIt is, more than anything else, your word.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash contributed to this story.",

Speaking with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, Trump responded to a new video from the Bush campaign that slammed Trump for having espoused \u201cliberal\u201d positions in the past, as he explained once again why he used to be a Democrat. \u201cIn New York City, everybody was a Democrat,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere was almost no election because the Republicans hardly existed in New York City.\u201d Adding that former President Ronald Reagan was also once a Democrat with a \u201cpretty liberal bend,\u201d Trump even went on to predict that plenty of Democrats would end up supporting him. \u201cI think I will have a lot of Democrats voting for me \u2013 far more than any Republican for the last long period of time,\u201d he said. Trump on Black Lives Matter leaders Over the past few weeks, Trump and Bush have ratcheted up their attacks on one another, both on the campaign trail and on social media. Earlier this week, Trump posted a video on Instagram criticizing Bush\u2019s immigration stance. As he leads the rest of the GOP field in national polls, Trump has billed himself as a non-career politician candidate who doesn\u2019t need help from donors and won\u2019t answer to special interests. However, the real-estate mogul lamented on Tuesday that he is \u2013 like it or not \u2013 now a politician. \u201cI hate the term politician as it relates to myself. I\u2019ve only been a politician for three months but I guess that\u2019s what I am,\u201d he said. Trump also offered his thoughts on news unfolding Tuesday outside of Chicago, where a police officer was shot and killed. Asked whether recent events suggest that police officers in this country are in greater danger, Trump said he sees respect for law enforcement officials eroding. \u201cPolice are some amazing people but they\u2019re afraid to act and they\u2019re afraid do what\u2019s right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou see it more and more and the respect is taken away from the police and that\u2019s a very bad thing for the country and it\u2019s a very bad thing for our security and safety.\u201d Trump is no longer the sole leader in the early primary state of Iowa: Neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Trump are now tied at 23% in the early primary state, according to a Monmouth University survey. Trump said Tuesday he was \u201ca little bit surprised\u201d to see those new numbers. \u201cI\u2019ve been leading in Iowa by a lot,\u201d he said. But don\u2019t expect Trump \u2013 the king of going on the offense \u2013 to start attacking Carson any time soon. The GOP front-runner said he\u2019s more of a \u201ccounter-puncher\u201d \u2013 that is, he tends to hit back if he\u2019s first provoked \u2013 and that he enjoys a good personal relationship with Carson. \u201cI think Ben\u2019s nice person. I\u2019ve met him numerous times and I like him,\u201d Trump said. Trump said Tuesday that the media incorrectly referred to an event in Norwood, Massachusetts, last week as a fundraiser, even though a sign at the entrance had read: \u201cPlease have checks made payable to: Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. or cash ready on entry.\u201d Trump once again denied that the evening soiree, hosted at the home of local car dealership magnate Ernie Boch Jr., was a fundraiser. He even pledged to never attend an event where the campaign accepts donations of any size. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it anymore because it\u2019s too complicated,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know the difference between making a contribution to defer costs \u2026 I\u2019m just going to pay for the whole thing myself.\u201d The billionaire claimed that he\u2019s been turning away millions of dollars from potential donors so as not to be beholden to them. He said he hopes it\u2019s a decision that will pay off in the end. \u201cI just hope the voters appreciate it when it comes time to vote because I\u2019m spending my own money and it\u2019s going to be a lot of money by the time I finish,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s tax policy has been somewhat of a head-scratcher. In recent interviews, the candidate has said he wouldn\u2019t mind raising taxes on himself \u2013 comments that could be interpreted to mean he supports boosting taxes on Americans in the uppermost income bracket. On Tuesday, Trump said he is not proposing a tax hike and that he\u2019s only proposing that hedge fund managers \u2013 whose profits are taxed at a lower \u201ccarried interest\u201d rate compared to other regular income \u2013 pay more. \u201cI\u2019m not proposing to raise taxes,\u201d Trump told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m lowering taxes on the middle class and the upper-middle class and the moderately wealthy. I\u2019ll be lowering the taxes.\u201d",

CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates \u201cHe wants everyone deported, which would tear family lives asunder,\u201d Bush told New York radio talk show host John Catsimatidis, later calling Trump\u2019s plans \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Donald Trump's empire \u201cIt\u2019s not conservative and it\u2019s not realistic and it does not embrace American values,\u201d Bush added.

Forget love. It\u2019s time to get tough!!\u201d the video said. A post shared by President Donald J.

            "article_content": "Scott Walker says it's \"legitimate\" to discuss a U.S.-Canada border wall Most Republican rhetoric has focused on the U.S.-Mexico border It\u2019s not just the southern border: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says it\u2019s \u201clegitimate\u201d to discuss building a wall separating the United States from Canada, as well. The Republican presidential contender said the idea of a northern border has come up while he has campaigned in New Hampshire. In an interview for NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d available online, Walker said his tough talk to securing the borders and enforcing U.S. laws extends to the 5,525-mile Canadian border as well. It\u2019s a shift from most campaign-trail rhetoric, which has focused on the United States\u2019 border with Mexico, where millions undocumented immigrants have entered the country. Scott Walker's career \u201cSome people have asked us about that in New Hampshire,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThey raised some very legitimate concerns, including some law enforcement folks that brought that up to me at one of our town hall meetings about a week and a half ago. So that is a legitimate issue for us to look at.\u201d RELATED: Border walls around the world Terrorist attacks have been plotted in Canada \u2013 including the so-called \u201cMillennium plot,\u201d a foiled 2000 plan in which an Algerian national planned to cross into the United States from Canada and bomb the Los Angeles International Airport. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, slammed the comments on Monday, saying that having grown up near the Canadian border, Walker\u2019s suggestion is to him \u201cone of the craziest\u201d ideas to come out of the election. \u201cGov. Walker simply must be unaware of the economic prosperity that commerce across the northern border brings to the United States,\u201d Leahy said in a statement. \u201cThose of us who represent states that share a border with Canada know better. \u2026 It is disappointing but not surprising that yet another Republican presidential candidate is using the border to score cheap political points.\u201d Walker has focused his immigration remarks on enforcing U.S. laws already on the books in recent weeks. He ran into trouble two weeks ago after GOP front-runner Donald Trump proposed repealing the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s mandate that children born in the United States automatically become citizens, regardless of their parents\u2019 legal status. RELATED: Walker on birthright citizenship: 3 positions, 7 days Walker first said he favored Trump\u2019s idea of repealing birthright citizenship. He backed off that stance days later, telling a reporter that he hasn\u2019t taken a position. And then last Sunday, he said that he isn\u2019t advocating any changes to laws on the books \u2013 including the Fourteenth Amendment. Despite taking three different positions in the course of a week, Walker insisted Sunday on NBC, his stance has been consistent.",

Trey McCarley, Kris Money and Debbie Aleksander are no longer with the campaign, but now working with Bush\u2019s super PAC, Right to Rise. \u201cIt\u2019s a large finance operation with a lot of consultants around the country. Fundraisers tend to be hard-charging and assertive. Personality conflicts happen. Trey, Kris and Debbie are good people and seasoned fundraising professionals,\u201d said Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and CNN political analyst, told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job. That they\u2019re still working for the super PAC tells us it\u2019s not a Jeb issue.\u201d Navarro, who is supporting Bush in the 2016 election, was Bush\u2019s first director of immigration policy during his time as Florida\u2019s governor. Bush spokesman Tim Miller would not comment on the specific departures, but told CNN Bush has the deepest and widest fundraising operation of any candidate in the field, noting that longtime consultant Ann Herberger is leading the operation with more than two decades of experience. Politico first reported the departures. Bush and his super PAC have amassed the most impressive fundraising haul of any Republican candidate thus far, collecting $114 million over the first half of the year. Bush is now tapping into family as surrogates to bring in more money. Former President George W. Bush will headline a fundraiser for his brother in New York City next month. And the former president sent out a fundraising email on Jeb Bush\u2019s behalf last week. And both former Presidents Bush will attend a donor event in Houston this fall. Donald Trump, a frequent foil of Bush in the GOP presidential race, teased the former Florida governor over the departures.

            "article_content": "Direct and even personal verbal and social criticism has become the new norm in this presidential race Many of this week's hits, not surprisingly, involve the outspoken Donald Trump Something seems different about the 2016 election cycle. Direct and even personal verbal and social criticism has become the new norm as presidential candidates have compared each other to terrorists, promised to beat-out brains, called journalists crazy, endorsed the word \u201cbimbo\u201d and, reportedly, resorted to good old-fashioned name calling. Here\u2019s a look at the political hits this week; it should be no surprise that five of the eight involve Donald Trump: Clinton: 'Extreme views' hard to take from GOP candidates In a speech in Cleveland on Thursday, Clinton compared Republicans who oppose abortion rights and have vowed to strip Planned Parenthood of funding of having views you\u2019d expect from \u201cterrorist groups.\u201d \u201cNow, extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who don\u2019t want to live in the modern world, but it\u2019s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cYet they espouse out of date, out of touch policies. They are dead wrong for 21st century America. We are going forward, we are not going back.\u201d Presidential candidate Donald Trump fired back Friday morning, saying on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that \u201cher last statement on terrorists was a disgusting statement, by the way.\u201d On Tuesday, Graham told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan that Trump is a \u201ccomplete idiot.\u201d Earlier that day, Trump tweeted at the South Carolina senator, writing, \u201cCongrats @LindseyGrahamSC. You just got 4 points in your home state of SC\u2014far better than zero nationally. You\u2019re only 26 pts behind me.\u201d Congrats @LindseyGrahamSC. You just got 4 points in your home state of SC\u2014far better than zero nationally. You\u2019re only 26 pts behind me. Graham said Trump\u2019s lead is because of a \u201cdark side of politics that Mr. Trump is appealing to,\u201d channeling Republican voters who also believed President Barack Obama is a Muslim and was born in Kenya. \u201cCome to South Carolina and I\u2019ll beat his brains out,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI know my state. This is a silly season in politics.\u201d And Graham didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cHe is shallow, he is ill-prepared to be commander-in-chief, he doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about in terms of how our laws work, he says the worst things possible about immigrants and women, and he\u2019s a complete idiot when it comes to Mideast policy,\u201d Graham said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAt This Hour.\u201d \u201cSo I think over time, common sense will prevail.\u201d At a fundraiser for Rep. Scott Tipton in Colorado, two attendees told The Daily Caller that House Speaker John Boehner referred to GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz as a \u201cjackass.\u201d According to the Daily Caller, Boehner told the audience that he\u2019s glad the presidential campaign keeps \u201cthat jackass\u201d out of Washington, and is not keeping Boehner from doing his job, the report said. No additional details were offered in the report and CNN has been unable to verify it with Boehner\u2019s office. On Monday, in the midst of a Twitter tirade against her, Trump retweeted an insult to Fox News host Megyn Kelly, calling her a \u201cbimbo.\u201d \"@mstanish53: @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly  The bimbo back in town . I hope not for long .\" He fired a number of other tweets against Kelly, saying he \u201cliked \u2018The Kelly File\u2019 much better without @megynkelly. Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation!\u201d In an interview with CNN, Trump told a reporter that he endorses his retweets \u201cto a certain extent.\u201d \u201cYou know, I retweet, I retweet for a reason,\u201d he said. On Thursday, Trump tried to walk from the feud with Kelly, telling CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that he has nothing against her. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned it\u2019s fine, and she\u2019ll do her thing and I wish her a lot of luck,\u201d he said. Bush is taking the offensive against Trump this week, a complete turnaround from a month ago when he told Fox News he\u2019d already stated he was done talking about Trump, adding, \u201cI\u2019m through.\u201d This week, Bush published a video to his YouTube channel, criticizing Trump for backtracking his previous public comments on immigration, using pundits to describe his current views as \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d Related: Jeb Bush\u2019s new Trump strategy: Fight back Trump fired several personal attacks to Bush on Twitter, including retweeting a tweet that calls Bush out for speaking Spanish on the border and calling him out for never using Bush on campaign merchandise, asking, \u201cIs he ashamed of the name BUSH?\u201d Martin O'Malley: Mistake for Dems to 'circle the wagon' On Thursday, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley said Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s email controversy will continue to affect her campaign. \u201cUntil we start having debates, our party\u2019s going to be defined and branded by questions like: What did Secretary Clinton know, when did she know it, and when will the FBI conclude its investigation?\u201d O\u2019Malley said in New Hampshire. \u201cThat\u2019s not a formula for success in the fall.\u201d He added that it\u2019s a mistake for the Democratic Party to \u201ccircle the wagons\u201d around Clinton. No other Democratic candidate for president has hit Clinton this much as of yet, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has not yet commented on her email scandal. Donald Trump vs. Univision's Jorge Ramos While addressing reporters Tuesday night, Trump had his security escort Univision anchor Jorge Ramos out of his event after Ramos began firing questions about his immigration policies to the real estate mogul. On Wednesday, Trump said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cToday Show\u201d that Ramos \u201cwas totally out of line last night \u2026 He stood up and started ranting and raving like a madman.\u201d But Ramos said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Wednesday morning that Trump was the one who was out of line. On Monday, while visiting the south Texas border, Bush defended his use of the term \u201canchor babies,\u201d then said he referred more to Asian people who come into the United States more than he meant it for immigrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cWhat I was talking about was the specific case of fraud being committed where there\u2019s organized efforts, and frankly, it\u2019s more related to Asian people coming into our country, having children in that organized efforts taking advantage of a noble concept which is birthright citizenship,\u201d he said. \u201cI support the 14th amendment.\u201d His spokeswoman later clarified his comments, saying he was referring to federal investigations into \u201cbirth tourism.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop Trump and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie from attacking Bush about his comments. Trump tweeted at Bush, writing that Asians were offended that he said anchor babies applies to them \u201cas a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. A mess!\u201d Christie said that Bush was trying to downplay his use of the term to reassure Hispanics and ended up criticizing Asians. Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. A mess! \u201cI mean, the fact is that you don\u2019t need to be pandering to one way or the other. I\u2019ll tell you the way you don\u2019t do it: You don\u2019t do focus group-tested trips to the border, speak Spanish and then, you know, criticize Asians,\u201d Christie said.",

            "article_content": "There are two completely different campaigns taking place to claim the Republican presidential nomination. Donald Trump's unorthodox effort has proven to be more viable and sustained than any pundit ever thought possible. In one pocket of South Carolina on Thursday, Donald Trump invited a woman to stroke his golden hair. In another, Marco Rubio lectured students on eradicating poverty. There\u2019s only one slot for the Republican Party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination, but there are two completely different campaigns taking place to claim it. On Thursday in the Southern early-primary state, they collided. One is the chest-beating Donald Trump extravaganza, playing to packed houses as the billionaire tramples political rules and casts a spell over huge crowds with extended policy-free diatribes and boasts that he is out of sight in the polls. The other involves the 16 other GOP presidential hopefuls who are gasping for media coverage and playing politics the old-fashioned way, building networks, convening small events and talking dry-as-dust policy. There\u2019s no doubt which approach is working best so far: Trump\u2019s. Donald Trump: Macho Man of 2016 The real estate mogul\u2019s unorthodox presidential effort has proven to be more viable and sustained than any pundit ever thought possible as he has harnessed the fury of grass-roots conservatives at the political lifers in Washington. Established GOP stars such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had expected to be dueling for the top spot in the race. Instead, they are looking on in envy \u2013 and hoping that sooner or later conventional political logic will kick back in. In the upstate city of Greenville, the traveling Trump circus touched down amid nearly as much hullabaloo as if the real estate mogul had already been elected president. TV stations live-streamed the landing of his 757 jet. A news helicopter tracked his SUV while it raced down the highway \u2013 as if Trump were O.J Simpson in a police pursuit. Who's running for President? About 1,400 Trump supporters had lined up for hours outside a vast conference center. When the doors opened, they stampeded into a cavernous auditorium, packed with candlelit tables for a Chamber of Commerce, luncheon. Some 100 miles to the southeast, the traditional presidential contest was playing out, as Rubio wooed a room full of students at the University of South Carolina. At the Chamber of Commerce event, Trump\u2019s opening riff could hardly have been more bizarre. Brandishing a copy of The New York Times, he ridiculed a story that suggested he wore a toupee. Then he pulled a woman out of the crowd and invited her to stroke his golden mane, and she confirmed that it did indeed appear genuine. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got a very nice wife,\u201d Trump commented, looking at the woman with appreciation as she stepped off the stage. It was a moment that not only summed up the surreal and unexpected twists of the Trump campaign, but also showcased his ability to get away with stunts and comments that would sink any normal politician. Two hours later, in the state capital of Columbia, Rubio tried to fire up a curious crowd of students, which the campaign said numbered 900, practicing politics according to the traditional playbook. He earnestly held forth on race relations, college debt, fighting poverty and intricate twists of U.S. foreign policy. Trump\u2019s stump speech, in contrast, is largely a long list of self-tributes. He\u2019s rich, famous and tough \u2013 and everyone else is weak. He lambasts everyone from the media to his GOP foes to Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Japan. Where Trump paints in broad strokes, Rubio is a details man, passionate about policy solutions about which he seems to have thought long and hard. And unlike Trump, Rubio tries to put himself in his audience\u2019s shoes. \u201cI was raised paycheck to paycheck \u2026 I feel passionate about how hard it is to raise a young family in the 21st century because I am doing it now. It\u2019s hard,\u201d he told the students. And in an aside that might have been a subtle dig at Trump, he added: \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about what people are facing, if you never talk about what people are going through, they don\u2019t believe you care about them.\u201d Trump, for his part, compared himself to royalty. \u201cNobody played the game better than me. I was the king,\u201d Trump boasted Thursday, laughing about how he manipulated politicians by funding their campaigns. And again and again, Trump returned to his soaring poll numbers, singling out one Quinnipiac University poll showing him at 28% in the GOP race \u2013 16 points ahead of anyone else. Rubio meanwhile can\u2019t make it out of single figures in most national polls. Trump also touted a Monmouth Survey showing him at 30% in South Carolina. The Florida senator, playing the long game, had 6%. \u201cWe have a chance to be truly great again. We have a chance to be as good as ever if not better, believe it or not,\u201d Trump roared \u2013 repeating his mantra for the audience. Rubio calls for business tax breaks in economic plan pitch The most intriguing aspect of Trump\u2019s stump speech is that he hits few conservative sweet spots. Though he rages against illegal immigration, he rarely talks about anti-abortion issues, cutting the deficit and taxes, religious freedom or shrinking government. In fact, it seems as if he\u2019s already launched the third-party campaign he keeps threatening \u2013 it just happens to be hosted by a bewildered Republican Party. But his conservative apostasy went down successfully nevertheless. Robert Heacock, a Trump supporter from Simpsonville, South Carolina, praised him for \u201csaying things that are not politically correct.\u201d \u201cHe has kindled the spirits of people \u2013 that is the kind of message people want to hear, that we can regain some of the greatness we have lost,\u201d said Heacock, adding that he hoped Trump would pick another outsider candidate, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, as his running mate. Longtime South Carolina political strategist Chip Felkel, meanwhile, marveled at Trump\u2019s performance. \u201cI have never seen anything like it. I have been doing this since 1986. We are a low-information society and he is taking advantage of it 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is getting away with murder.\u201d But an hour-and-a-half southwest, Rick Arquell was won over by Rubio\u2019s more relatable approach. The Republican voter has seen both candidates live and doubts Trump\u2019s long-term viability. \u201cI like Trump because I grew up in New York City \u2013 but he\u2019s not a salable quality,\u201d Arquell said, drawing an analogy between the mogul and the tea party revolt of 2009. \u201cTrump is the same \u2013 he just has a different label. This time, I don\u2019t think it is enough. Trump will fade,\u201d he assessed. If Arquell and the other GOP candidates and establishment leaders who share his views are correct, normal political service may be resumed before primary and caucus voters go to the polls next year. If not, and the Trump-led rise of outsider candidates endures for the long haul, the 2016 election is going to become even more unpredictable.",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush drew a contrast with Donald Trump, who has advocated for doing away with birthright citizenship. With the exception the \"anchor baby\" exchange Monday, Bush did all the things his allies have been urging him to do on the trail. Jeb Bush\u2019s visit to the border town of McAllen, Texas, to meet with local elected and law enforcement officials Monday should have been a simple exercise in contrasting himself with Republican front-runner Donald Trump. Weeks after Trump flew to Laredo on his private jet with a presidential-style entourage to warn about grave dangers at the border, Bush hoped to highlight his more-nuanced immigration positions while projecting the kind of presidential demeanor that his allies believe will ultimately endear him to GOP voters who get queasy imagining Trump in the Oval Office. But once again, the former Florida governor found himself struggling to strike the right tone on the volatile issue and ended up provoking a new round of criticism over his recent utterance of the term \u201canchor babies,\u201d which is used to describe children born in the U.S. to parents who entered the country illegally in order to secure them American citizenship. While attempting to beat back Democratic attacks that he had used a phrase derogatory to Latinos, he ended up drawing another demographic group into the debate \u2013 Asians \u2013 and further embroiling himself in controversy. \u201cThis is ludicrous for the Clinton campaign and others to suggest that somehow I\u2019m using a derogatory term,\u201d Bush said of his previous reference to \u201canchor babies\u201d when asked about the phrase at a press conference. He continued, \u201cWhat I was talking about was the specific case of fraud being committed \u2013 where there\u2019s organized efforts, and frankly it\u2019s more related to Asian people coming into our country \u2013 having children in (those) organized efforts, taking advantage of a noble concept, which is birthright citizenship.\u201d RELATED: Jeb Bush defends \u2018anchor baby\u2019 use, at times in Spanish His linkage of the phrase \u201cAsian people\u201d to the term \u201canchor baby\u201d quickly rippled across social media, striking a nerve among those who feel that politicians often lump Asian Americans together in a monolithic block, instead of recognizing their many different ethnicities, cultures and languages. Indeed, Bush\u2019s efforts at outreach have repeatedly been complicated by his own verbal stumbles \u2013 and the shadow Trump has cast over the party in the eyes of some Latino voters, which comes as Latinos and Asians are already questioning what place they have in the GOP. Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, who advised the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain, said that in 2012, \u201cThe Asian vote collapsed along with the Hispanic vote. Because that community is looking at the party\u2019s posture toward Hispanics and saying: \u2018They probably don\u2019t like us very much either.\u2019\u201d Schmidt noted that Republicans have lost the popular vote in five out of the last six elections. The only election where that was not the case was the 2004 Bush reelection, where he got 43% of the Hispanic vote. \u201cA Republican can\u2019t get elected president without getting roughly 40% of the Hispanic vote. Can\u2019t make the math work,\u201d he said. The risk for Republicans as they look ahead to the general election is that perceptions are hardening that the leaders of the Republican Party are anti-immigrant, according to Schmidt. \u201cClearly there is enormous intensity around this issue inside the Republican Party. It shows the extent to which Donald Trump is now setting the agenda and controlling the conversation,\u201d he said. Bush, however, was looking to change that conversation and draw a contrast with Trump, who has advocated for doing away with birthright citizenship and promised to build a wall along the length of the U.S.-Mexico border. In his press conference, Bush took a swipe at \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and dismissed Democratic attacks, often responding to questions on them in Spanish, by noting that his own family has been \u201cimmersed in the immigrant experience\u201d because his wife is from Mexico. Ironically, with the exception the \u201canchor baby\u201d exchange Monday, Bush did all the things his allies have been urging him to do on the campaign trail. He showed more energy to match Trump\u2019s fire. He shot down Trump\u2019s border ideas as unfeasible, uninformed and expensive. He spoke in personal terms about his family and their immigrant experience, referring in particular to his wife Columba. He also pointed out that the majority of people crossing the border were not coming from Mexico but primarily from Central American countries to the south, and he added that Trump\u2019s plan would \u201ccost hundreds of billions of dollars\u201d \u2013 and was therefore not conservative. Visually, the contrast was crystal clear. Trump had flown into Laredo in his private jet wearing a white \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball cap; Bush wore a tan suit that one might expect to see at a Latin American policy summit. Trump wheeled around the border community in a presidential-style motorcade with a half-dozen SUVs; Bush took a small entourage and declined a police escort. Seeming to mock Trump\u2019s warnings about how dangerous the border was, Bush mingled with supporters at the Palenque Grill in McAllen as a mariachi band played in the background. Lanhee Chen, Mitt Romney\u2019s former policy director and a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, said the conversation around the Republican race could change over time as GOP voters begin to focus more on the electability of their nominee and their broader appeal after the primaries are over. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see someone who takes the positions Trump has being really electable in a general election context,\u201d said Chen. \u201cSo I think that particularly that for [Florida Sen. Marco] Rubio and Jeb Bush, doing what they are doing is certainly a reasonable and thoughtful way to approach it.\u201d RELATED: Trump slams Bush for tying Asians to \u2018anchor babies\u2019 Still, on Monday Bush couldn\u2019t avoid a quick backlash from his comments on \u201canchor babies\u201d and Asians. Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat, issued a statement late Monday evening blasting Bush\u2019s \u201cattack on Asian immigrants.\u201d \u201cJeb Bush\u2019s comments regarding the children of Asian immigrants are derogatory and offensive,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cHe should immediately retract his statements and apologize to the Asian community for his insensitive behavior.\u201d Bush\u2019s spokeswoman Kristy Campbell later clarified that the governor was \u201chighlighting \u2018birth tourism,\u2019\u201d which she described as \u201ca well-reported serious and growing problem, one that the Department of Homeland Security has been grappling with.\u201d \u201cThe next president must have a plan to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws,\u201d Campbell said in a statement. \u201cGovernor Bush is the only candidate in the entire presidential field who has presented a serious, conservative, comprehensive reform agenda to fix our broken system.\u201d If there is a silver lining for Bush, it is that he has managed to stay in the spotlight at a time when other GOP presidential candidates have faded from the headlines. The effectiveness of challenging Trump on immigration won\u2019t be clear for several months. But for now, Bush seems happy to take Trump\u2019s incoming volleys, since it gives him a chance to draw attention to his own record. When a reporter asked him Monday about Trump\u2019s latest slam on him on Instagram, Bush tried to make it sound like he wasn\u2019t paying any attention: \u201cI don\u2019t follow Donald Trump on Instagram,\u201d he replied.",

            "article_content": "For some 2016 presidential candidates, the massive stock selloff was nothing short of a political opportunity. The turbulence is shining a spotlight on the economy, though the issue has not taken center stage in the 2016 cycle so far. Investors watched in dismay as global markets spiraled into chaos Monday, sending the Dow plummeting 1,000 points within several minutes of the opening bell. But for some 2016 presidential candidates, the massive selloff was nothing short of a political opportunity. In an election cycle that has so far been dominated by issues like immigration and foreign policy, the abrupt course correction on Wall Street brought sudden renewed focus on the health of the U.S. economy. Republican contenders \u2013 including those with business backgrounds like real estate mogul Donald Trump and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina \u2013 seized on the volatility to go after President Barack Obama\u2019s policies and push their economic agendas. Trump, who is currently leading the Republican presidential field, was first to pounce. He said the enormous selloff was the result of the U.S. \u201callowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda.\u201d \u201cAs I have long stated, we are so tied in with China and Asia that their markets are now taking the U.S. market down,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cGet smart U.S.A.\u201d Who's running for President? Fiorina, whose political star has been on the rise since a standout performance at the first GOP presidential debate, lamented that the \u201cunderlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy are not that strong.\u201d \u201cTwo percent growth is pretty lackluster. Of course, now we have the Fed Reserve backing off on zero interest rates and China\u2019s economy is slowing,\u201d she said on the Fox Business Network. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that China has some real issues in front of it, and the devaluation of the yuan as well as the huge selloff in their markets spell trouble ahead.\u201d The recent turbulence in global markets is shining a spotlight on the economy, though the issue has not taken center stage in the 2016 cycle so far. One reason for this is that the economy has made notable progress since the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The unemployment rate is now down at 5.3% and employers have added nearly 3 million jobs over the last year. Home prices are up, and the recent dip in oil prices is giving consumers more financial freedom. It\u2019s a significantly different landscape than four years ago, when Obama was struggling to bring down a stubbornly high unemployment rate and inject energy into a sluggish economy. The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, staked his candidacy on offering an alternative to the weak Obama economy by playing up his experience in the private equity industry. This cycle, it\u2019s issues like immigration and foreign policy that have emerged the most political salient, thanks in no small part to Trump, the current GOP leader in national polls. The billionaire has made fighting illegal immigration the main pillar of his unorthodox campaign and is forcing his Republican rivals to also address the divisive issue. RELATED: Donald Trump on market crash: \u2018This could get very messy!\u2019 But economic concerns are traditionally a top priority for voters and the market\u2019s volatility could help put the issue back on agenda. \u201cGiven the seriousness of what\u2019s happened, this will bring some sanity back to the debate that\u2019s been going on and people will realize that there are more significant issues to be confronted than trying to change the Constitution to remove birthright citizenship,\u201d said Katie Packer Gage, deputy campaign manager for Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. But she cautioned that for candidates like Trump and Fiorina, touting their business backgrounds could very well be a double-edged sword. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful because they speak the language,\u201d Packer Gage said. \u201cBut Donald Trump is supposedly an expert and he has businesses that went bankrupt.\u201d After bouncing back from the initial dive in the late morning, the Dow plummeted again and was down about 600 points by mid-afternoon. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie placed the blame for the volatility squarely on the president\u2019s \u201cfailed policies\u201d and blasted  the White House for not getting a handle on the national debt. \u201cAs the Chinese markets tend to have a correction, which they\u2019re doing right now, it\u2019s going to have an even greater effect because this president doesn\u2019t know how to say no to spending, doesn\u2019t know how to say no to a bigger and more intrusive government,\u201d Christie said on Fox News. W.H.: U.S. economy durable despite market volatility On the other side of the aisle, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders seized on the chaos to reiterate grievances about \u201cWall Street and the billionaire class\u201d that he said have \u201crigged the rules.\u201d Sanders has made attacks on Wall Street and special interests a major part of his candidacy, as he seeks to draw a contrast with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Clinton has not yet weighed in on the Dow\u2019s drop. \u201cWe need banks that invest in the job-creating economy,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more speculation with the American economy hanging in the balance.\u201d Many economists urged market watchers to avoid panic, pointing out that a course correction in the stock markets should not be confused with fundamental weakness in the U.S. economy. \u201cWhenever you get large market moves, especially ahead of a presidential cycle, there\u2019 no question that people are going to talk about it,\u201d said Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief U.S. Economist Joseph LaVorgna. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy in the short-term, especially in the thick of things of both political and economic, to react to an event which oftentimes evolves in a way that many of us don\u2019t foresee.\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that the U.S. economy remains \u201cdurable\u201d despite increased volatility overseas. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the global economy is more interconnected than it\u2019s every been,\u201d Earnest told reporters in the White House briefing room. \u201cBut what I would encourage people to evaluate is the ongoing strength and resilience of the U.S. economy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Scott Walker on Sunday took his third position within seven days on Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to end birthright citizenship, this time saying he opposes Trump and supports the policy. The Wisconsin governor and Republican presidential candidate was asked on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d whether he backs Trump\u2019s push to end the 14th Amendment\u2019s mandate that all children born in the United States are automatically granted citizenship. CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates \u201cWell, I said the law is there. And we need to enforce the laws, including those that are in the Constitution,\u201d Walker said, adding that he favors addressing illegal immigration by improving border security and requiring businesses to use a system called E-Verify to check workers\u2019 legal status. ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos pressed further, asking: \u201cSo you\u2019re not seeking to repeal or alter the 14th Amendment?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Walker said. \u201cMy point is, any discussion that goes beyond securing the border and enforcing the laws are things that should be a red flag to voters out there, who for years have heard lip service from politicians and are understandably angry because those politicians haven\u2019t been committed to following through on those promises.\u201d It\u2019s a different answer than the one Walker gave Monday at the Iowa State Fair. Asked by MSNBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt whether birthright citizenship should be ended, he said then: \u201cYeah, absolutely, going forward.\u201d Scott Walker warms to New Hampshire Walker cited Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s support for ending the policy \u2013 in the early 1990s introduced legislation that would have revoked the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of citizenship for U.S.-born children. Reid has since reversed that position. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said on Monday at the fair. \u201cTo me it\u2019s about enforcing the laws in this country. And I\u2019ve been very clear, I think you enforce the laws, and I think it\u2019s important to send a message that we\u2019re going to enforce the laws, no matter how people come here we\u2019re going to enforce the laws in this country.\u201d Then, on Friday, Walker offered another stance \u2013 telling CNBC\u2019s John Harwood that he won\u2019t weigh in on birthright citizenship. \u201cI\u2019m not taking a position on it one way or the other,\u201d he said in that interview. The changing answers come as Walker\u2019s standing in polls \u2013 particularly in Iowa, which his campaign regards as crucial to his chances of winning the GOP nomination \u2013 has been hurt by the rise of Trump and other outsider candidates, like retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina. Walker has made an effort to play up his status as an outsider \u2013 a politician who came up through Milwaukee and Wisconsin politics, with no ties to Washington. He has attempted to avoid confronting Trump directly, saying his own immigration views are \u201csimilar\u201d and launching new broadsides at the Republican-led Congress in recent days. Scott Walker booed by protesters at Iowa soapbox Trump directly attacked Walker on Sunday during his own appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d citing Wisconsin\u2019s budget woes. \u201cI\u2019m honored that he wants to copy me and he\u2019s a nice man. \u2026 I gave him campaign contributions when he was running for governor. I like him very much,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut his state has not performed well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need somebody that\u2019s going to make it perform well, this country perform well.\u201d Given a chance to respond to Trump Sunday on \u201cThis Week,\u201d Walker accused the real estate mogul of making the same arguments Democrats in Wisconsin have in recent years. \u201cThose are the same talking points the Democrats used. They didn\u2019t work in the past. They\u2019re not going to work now,\u201d he said. Then, Walker pivoted to a broader anger represented by Trump\u2019s ascent to the top of national GOP polls. \u201cBut the one thing that I do want to clarify is I do think that there is some real frustration out there,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s way you not only see his numbers up, you see some of the other candidates who have not run for office before. They\u2019re angry at Washington. Heck, I\u2019m angry at Washington. I\u2019m angry at my own \u2013 my own party leadership, who told us they were going to repeal Obamacare and we still don\u2019t see a bill on the desk of the President. I think that\u2019s where the real frustration is.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The venue was changed from a 4,000-person venue to a football stadium that can hold up to 43,000 Attendees gathered as early as 6 a.m. CT Donald Trump brought 30,000 supporters from deep red Alabama to a Friday night pep rally in a football stadium, the latest sign that the Republican front-runner has broad, nationwide strength. Over an hour of often rambling remarks, the New York businessman reveled in the crowd size while he offered them his usual menu of patriotic pledges and carefree criticism of the media, his opponents and political correctness that he said his crowd similarly despised. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten an amazing reception,\u201d Trump said as he began his remarks, turning his back to the podium at the Ladd-Peebles Stadium and pointing to the rafters behind him. \u201cHas this been crazy? Man!\u201d The event had the trappings of a big Friday night high school match-up. Trump flew by the stadium in his private jet shortly before 6 p.m., doing a loop around the arena before landing. The fly-by was announced over the stadium\u2019s loudspeaker to cheers. The event was previously planned to be held at the nearby Civic Center but was moved to the 43,000-seat Ladd-Peebles Stadium \u2013 a venue normally home to high school football games \u2013 to accommodate the crowd. The City of Mobile confirmed late Friday that 30,000 people attended. \u201cIt was one of the greatest events Mobile ever put on aside from Mardi Gras,\u201d said Colby Cooper, Mayor Sandy Stimpson\u2019s chief of staff. 'Stump for Trump' girls: Trump is action, not talk Trump \u2013 whose victory in national and early-state polls is no longer a surprise \u2013 has in recent weeks taken steps to quickly professionalize his political operation. And his event at a stadium that each year hosts college football\u2019s Senior Bowl was an effort to assemble the grandest show of force yet. Those who attended saw Trump, clad in a navy blue jacket and his own cherry-red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d red baseball cap, win the admiration of hometown hero Jeff Sessions. The Alabama Republican senator did not endorse Trump, but came on stage to endorse Trump\u2019s immigration positions while wearing his own, off-white, Trump-branded hat. And those in the crowd also heard the new Republican front-runner train his eyes once again on the old one, Jeb Bush, needling him as having low energy and saying he would do the bidding of special interests. \u201cHere\u2019s a simple question: Who would you rather have negotiating with China, Japan, Mexico, any of them? Trump or Bush?\u201d he asked, as the raucous crowd chanted his name back to him. \u201cAh, what a group.\u201d Bush and his allies once again aggressively looked to rebut the real estate magnate\u2019s message, reflecting a new muscular stance against the Trump that Bush first unveiled this week in New Hampshire. This time, Bush supporters took his counterargument straight to Trump\u2019s own voters. Bush\u2019s super PAC, Right to Rise, arranged its own flyover at the stadium as a jet carried a banner reading: \u201cTrump 4 higher taxes, Jeb 4 prez.\u201d And Bush\u2019s official campaign said it also emailed supporters in Alabama pointing out Trump\u2019s previous liberal positions on abortion, gun rights and tax issues. \u201cTrump\u2019s positions are deeply out-of-step with the Alabama way of life,\u201d the email reads, according to the campaign. \u201cTrump\u2019s history of supporting Democratic ideas will not go unnoticed in Alabama and we trust you will make it known.\u201d Donald Trump: I'd like to have elections tomorrow Bush and Trump have sparred since the \u201cApprentice\u201d star launched his campaign in June. Most recently, they have fought over the former Florida governor\u2019s use of the term \u201canchor baby,\u201d which many see as derogatory toward Latinos. Much of Trump\u2019s remarks here rehashed the themes he has made central to his campaign, seizing upon an economy he said was stalling and immigration laws that he said need revamping. Barely mentioned at all: Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee who Trump thinks might not make it to the general election given unanswered questions about her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. Attendees gathered as early as 6 a.m., and some traveled from as far away as Florida and California to attend. The first 10 people in line were strangers this morning, but after waiting outside in the 90-degree heat, they befriended one another and all chipped in to buy a canopy from Walmart and a few pizzas from Dominos. Amanda Mancini, who said she is part of a new movement called \u201cWomen for Trump,\u201d flew in from Los Angeles. \u201cI wanted to be part of it. I initially thought it was going to be small, band I thought Trump wouldn\u2019t be coming to me in California, so I would have to come to him.\u201d Brent Fritz and Jacob Murray, 19-year-old students from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, drove in Friday morning to see Trump. They left at 4 a.m. ET and arrived around noon local time. The first person to get in line was retired Marine Keith Quackenbush. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Republicans, it isn\u2019t about Democrats, this is a movement of citizens across America tired of the BS,\u201d he said. Trump, Bush not apologizing for 'anchor babies' That\u2019s the message Trump dished to his voters. At times appearing more prepared than usual \u2013 referencing what seemed to be notes on his podium and relaying new statistics about illegal immigration to his crowd \u2013 a joyful Trump offered to sign copies of his book, waved his arms to encourage applause at some of his one-liners and made an effort to his southern crowd by calling the Bible his favorite book and lamenting the decline of the Alabama steel industry. \u201cWe have a stock market not doing so well, we have a country not doing so well, we\u2019ve been saying it for a long time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have politicians who don\u2019t have a clue. They\u2019re all talk, no action. What\u2019s happening to this country is disgraceful.\u201d The Republican front-runner, buoyed by his crowd, was nevertheless enjoying the moment. \u201cI\u2019d like to have the election tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump compared Clinton's situation to that of Gen. David Petraeus, who pleaded guilty to giving some classified information to his biographer and lover Trump said he predicts his campaign will \"do very well\" and said he also beats Clinton on their records Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump took on an array of subjects and political figures during a lengthy interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on Wednesday, including Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Pope Francis and even Caroline Kennedy. Asked first about his standing in a recent CNN/ORC poll, Trump said the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton\u2019s email use is \u201cdevastating,\u201d and that it\u2019s not surprising that he came within 6 points of the Democrat in a head-to-head polling match-up. \u201cI think it\u2019s devastating for the election, but I think her bigger problem is not the election. I think her bigger problem is going to be the criminal (problem),\u201d Trump said. While he said Clinton is not his \u201cfocus right now,\u201d he predicted she would struggle to get over the bad headlines generated by the investigation into her private server and the possible transmission of classified information in her private email, as well as the money she has raked in for speeches since leaving office. \u201cI think that Hillary\u2019s going to have a hard time being in the election based on what\u2019s going on with the emails, the servers, maybe even the speeches,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a very hard thing for her to overcome.\u201d RELATED: Trump competitive with Clinton Trump compared Clinton\u2019s situation to that of Gen. David Petraeus, who pleaded guilty to giving some classified information to his biographer and lover. \u201cWhen I look, Chris, at what happened with Petraeus \u2026 great general, wonderful guy, everybody loved him, and it destroyed his life over much less,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt would seem hard to think that somebody could have a much worse situation than him and escape.\u201d Cuomo countered that Petraeus knew the information was classified and intentionally passed it along, but there has been no indication to date that the Justice Department believes Clinton intentionally shared information she knew was classified. She has not personally been declared the subject of the investigation into her emails. \u201cIt certainly looks like it was high-level information,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s always skirting the edge. What\u2019s the purpose of it? \u2026 What is she doing, why is she doing it?\u201d He acknowledged that the investigation hasn\u2019t named her, but he said he believes what she did was criminal. RELATED: Fact-check: Trump misstates support from Rousey, Marines \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one. The FBI\u2019s involved, they only do criminal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow maybe it\u2019s somebody on her staff. But look, it\u2019s ether criminal or incompetent, it\u2019s one or another \u2026 either gross incompetence or criminal, and neither\u2019s acceptable to be president.\u201d On Tuesday, Clinton told the press at an adversarial news conference that the email story \u201chas nothing to do with me,\u201d made fun of questions about whether she \u201cwiped\u201d the server and said \u201cno one\u201d asks her about the emails and the servers but the press. Trump said he predicts his campaign will \u201cdo very well\u201d and said he also beats Clinton on their records, reiterating that he came out against the Iraq War in 2004. \u201cHillary\u2019s record as secretary of state was a disaster,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe was in favor, totally in favor, of the Iraq War, which is obviously not a good soundbite.\u201d Trump isn\u2019t backing down from his call to revoke automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrant parents despite concerns he\u2019ll turn Hispanic voters off to the GOP. \u201cI have to do the right thing,\u201d the mogul said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo Wednesday, when asked about his immigration plan being under fire. Trump has called for building a wall along the border with Mexico, revoking the right to citizenship to children born the U.S. if their parents aren\u2019t documented, and for deporting undocumented immigrants and then allowing \u201cgood ones\u201d to re-enter the country. He has been hit with criticism from some Republicans while taking and heavy fire from the left. He even took flak as he sat down for the interview with CNN in Trump Tower, when an onlooker in the lobby of the building shouted: \u201cYou will never win the Latino vote. The Latino (voters) don\u2019t like you.\u201d RELATED: Trump\u2019s immigration plan: the specifics Trump didn\u2019t respond to the heckler, and after the interview finished taping, two people watching from the crowd told Trump they were Mexican-American and would gladly support him, which he relayed to Cuomo. \u201cYou know, this country is so politically correct. Nobody wants to take a stance on anything,\u201d Trump told Cuomo. \u201cNow they like to use the word undocumented because it\u2019s more political \u2013 I don\u2019t use that word. They\u2019re illegal immigrants. They came over illegally.  Some are wonderful people, and they\u2019ve been here for a while. They\u2019ve got to go out. They\u2019ve got to leave.\u201d He did say there were \u201ca lot of good ones\u201d among immigrants, and that he would try to bring them back. \u201cThese people \u2013 the really good ones, and we have some great ones \u2013 we\u2019re going to try and expedite so they can come back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to come back legally.\u201d RELATED: Trump\u2019s immigration plan: the specifics The candidate also reiterated that he believes in changing birthright citizenship \u2013 which grants automatic citizenship to all children born in the U.S. \u2013 though he said he wouldn\u2019t need to amend the Constitution to do it. \u201cNo. 1, the 14th Amendment is very questionable as to whether or not somebody can come over, have a baby and immediately that baby is a citizen. OK?\u201d Trump said. \u201cAmending is too big a deal. It\u2019s going to take \u2013 it\u2019ll be two terms. I\u2019d be in my second term or my eighth year by the time \u2013 assuming everything went smoothly. \u2026 I believe you can win it legally.\u201d He said people can\u2019t be allowed to just \u201cwalk over\u201d the border to give birth. \u201cYou have people on the border and in one day they walk over, have a baby. And now all of a sudden we\u2019re supposed to pay the baby \u2026 medical, Social Security,\u201d Trump said. Getting military strategy by watching current and retired generals talk on TV isn\u2019t just OK with Trump \u2013 he says it\u2019s better than any team he could assemble to personally advise him. The mogul made the comment on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday \u2013 earning derision from one of those frequent TV pundits, retired Gen. Michael Hayden. But Trump defended his comments in an interview Wednesday with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, saying it allows him to get a lot of advice quickly. \u201cI watch your show.  And I watch other shows. And you have the best generals, the best everything \u2026 frankly probably better than I could get,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat do I know? I\u2019m a man that made a great fortune. I\u2019m gonna make our country rich and I\u2019m gonna make our country great.\u201d RELATED: Trump defends doing \u2018right thing\u2019 on immigration Rousey slams idea of Trump Presidency Trump said he watches shows as well as reading The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other newspapers and magazines, which allows him to \u201cget a lot of information in a very short time.\u201d He acknowledged that other candidates, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have a team of advisers, but he also dinged Bush for being \u201cvery low energy\u201d and not moving as quickly as Trump. \u201cYou get the best people,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the generals wanna be on television, right? Or they\u2019re retired generals in many cases. But I see a lot of good things by watching your show and other shows. And it\u2019s really nothing to be laughed at or scoffed at.\u201d In fact, Trump said his military savvy could be one of his biggest strengths in the general election. He pointed to a CNN/ORC poll that had him more trusted than other Republican candidates on fighting terror group ISIS. \u201cI think that I would be a great sleeper on the military, because people wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s my strength, but I think it would be one of my strengths,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOne of the things I noticed in your poll, I came out way, way ahead of everybody on the economy, and a lot of people weren\u2019t surprised to see that, but I also came way out ahead on the military \u2026 and ISIS.\u201d He added: \u201cI would build up our military so strong, so powerful that nobody will mess with us.\u201d Picture this: Trump and the Pope, face-to-face. And the Pope tells the mogul that capitalism can be toxic. How would Trump reply? \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018ISIS wants to get you,\u2019\u201d Trump said, when asked by Cuomo about that hypothetical scenario. \u201cYou know that ISIS wants to go in and take over the Vatican?  You have heard that. You know, that\u2019s a dream of theirs, to go into Italy,\u201d Trump said. Cuomo, taken aback, asked if Trump would actually scare the Pope, who is coming to the U.S. for his first visit next month. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to scare the Pope because it\u2019s the only thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe Pope, I hope, can only be scared by God. But the truth is \u2013 you know, if you look at what\u2019s going on \u2013 they better hope that capitalism works, because it\u2019s the only thing we have right now. And it\u2019s a great thing when it works properly.\u201d Trump said right now, capitalism was not working properly in the U.S. because of over-regulation of industry. The real estate mogul said that though he is a Protestant, he generally likes Pope Francis, who has been outspoken on a number of politically sensitive issues including poverty, climate change and judging gays. \u201cI have great respect for the Pope,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI like the Pope. I actually like him. He\u2019s becoming very political, there\u2019s no question about it. But I like him. He seems like a pretty good guy.\u201d Trump also noted he doesn\u2019t believe the Pope is actually opposed to capitalism. Trump says his famous family is totally ready to hit the campaign trail \u2013 and they will be great at it. In fact, he said before he jumped into the race, he sat down with his family to talk it over. \u201cMy wife said something very interesting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe\u2019s my pollster, OK? She said, \u2018You know if you actually announce you\u2019re going to win.\u2019 I  said, \u2018I don\u2019t know that.\u2019 But the response has been pretty amazing.\u201d Trump\u2019s third wife, Melania, hasn\u2019t been a huge presence on the campaign trail \u2013 yet. But Trump said she\u2019s ready for that and, potentially, being first lady. \u201cYes, she\u2019s ready,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has been (quiet so far) and purposely. You know, I haven\u2019t asked her to do anything. And she would certainly like to.\u201d Melania would be interested in working on women\u2019s health issues, for example, Trump said. And so would his daughter, Ivanka, who he acknowledged could be president in her own right. \u201cShe could be president \u2013 she\u2019d be great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe will be fantastic. My boys will be fantastic. \u2026 They wanna be out there. They believe in what I\u2019m saying.\u201d Trump has five children: the four adults \u2013 daughters Ivanka and Tiffany, and sons Eric and Donald Jr. \u2013 and 9-year-old son, Barron. He also dismissed questions about whether Melania, who was born in Slovenia but moved to the U.S. amid a successful modeling career, has any issues with the Republican\u2019s hard-line immigration policies. \u201cShe actually agrees with me because she went through a long process to become a citizen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s a wonderful process to go through. And when she got it, she was very proud of it.\u201d Trump took several jabs at his opponent, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in an interview with CNN on Wednesday \u2013 including Bush\u2019s Planned Parenthood flub on women\u2019s health spending. \u201cWhen I watch Jeb Bush a week ago not wanting to fund the women\u2019s health issues \u2026 I thought it was terrible,\u201d Trump said. Trump was referring to Bush\u2019s comments earlier this month on wanting to defund Planned Parenthood. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women\u2019s health issues,\u201d Bush said. His campaign later said he misspoke. Democrats seized on the line. \u201cI watched him make the statement,\u201d Trump said, alleging that only after Bush spoke to his pollsters did he say he misspoke. \u201cBut, how do you misspeak about something like that?\u201d Trump said. He said his wife and daughter both encouraged him to talk more about women\u2019s issues after the controversy. \u201cThey said, you know, \u2018The one thing you should do is talk a little bit about women\u2019s health issues, because you\u2019re so good on it,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201c\u2018You know about it. And you cherish women. You want to protect women\u2019. \u2026 I will protect women more than anybody.\u201d Trump has faced criticism of his treatment of women, exacerbated after he clashed with Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly in the first GOP debate over the epithets he has used for women in the past. But Trump didn\u2019t just beat up on Bush, who is running second in the polls to Trump, nationally, on women\u2019s health. He also hit the former governor \u2013 who has himself joked about being a \u201cjoyful tortoise\u201d \u2013 for his style. \u201cHe\u2019s a very low energy person, Jeb Bush,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s got very low energy, which is okay. It\u2019s good, if you want (to) lead a long life. But he\u2019s a low energy person.\u201d Trump says his administration would tap American businessmen Carl Icahn and Henry Kravis as top international negotiators \u2013 pledging they could do a better job than the diplomats currently in office. He also predicted he would be \u201cthe greatest jobs president that God ever created,\u201d and get tough on countries like China, Mexico and Japan. Pressed by Cuomo on how exactly he\u2019d get American companies to stop building factories overseas, where labor is cheaper, Trump said he\u2019d slap the companies with tariffs and communicate with them. He also said current U.S. efforts to improve its standing in the world were failing \u2013 and given overseas consumption of his products and real estate, Trump predicted his presidency would be the opposite. \u201cWe are getting killed on trade,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have diplomacy now. They\u2019re killing us, and they don\u2019t even like us. \u2026 With me, they\u2019ll like us and we\u2019ll beat them, OK?\u201d He said the nation\u2019s top businessmen are on his side. \u201cCarl Icahn agrees with me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd Carl Icahn, as you know, is a great negotiator. And I have many other great negotiators. They are dying to get involved.\u201d Trump said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d put Icahn in charge of China and Japan. \u201cYou take a guy like Carl Icahn, you take Henry Kravis, you take so many of the guys that I know and you say, \u2018You know what, I\u2019d like you to watch over the deals that are being made with China because we\u2019re getting killed on trade.\u2019 Believe me, we will be so good,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019d do it in two seconds. He\u2019s already told me he\u2019d love to do it.\u201d Trump said Icahn would be better than the current U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy. \u201cWe have the greatest business people in the world, we don\u2019t use them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe use people like, I mean, she\u2019s a very nice person, my daughter likes her \u2026 Caroline Kennedy. OK, in Japan. She didn\u2019t even know how she got the job.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the onlookers of Trump\u2019s interview were Mexican-American.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump maintains his lead over the GOP presidential field, according to a new CNN/ORC poll Jeb Bush comes in second place and Ben Carson in third place, the poll says Donald Trump has won his party\u2019s trust on top issues more than any other Republican presidential candidate, and now stands as the clear leader in the race for the GOP nomination, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. The survey finds Trump with the support of 24% of Republican registered voters. His nearest competitor, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, stands 11 points behind at 13%. Just behind Bush, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has 9%, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker 8%, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul 6%, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former tech CEO Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich all land at 5%, with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee rounding out the top 10 at 4%. Trump is the biggest gainer in the poll, up 6 points since July according to the first nationwide CNN/ORC poll since the top candidates debated in Cleveland on Aug. 6. Carson gained 5 points and Fiorina 4 points. Trump has also boosted his favorability numbers among Republicans and Republican-leaning voters, 58% have a favorable view of Trump now, that figure stood at 50% in the July survey. These nationwide findings follow recent polling in Iowa and New Hampshire showing Trump also leads the Republican field in those two key early states. READ: The complete CNN/ORC poll results Bush, who held the top spot in the field in most CNN/ORC polls on the race between last fall and Trump\u2019s entry into the race in June, has seen his favorability ratings drop alongside his standing in the contest. Overall, 56% hold an unfavorable view of the former Florida governor and 42% of Republican voters have a negative impression. That\u2019s an increase in negative views among all adults (up from 43% since July) and among Republican voters (up from 34% unfavorable). While Kasich and Fiorina remain largely unknown nationally, those Republicans who do have an opinion of these two \u2013 both widely seen as debate standouts \u2013 tend to tilt positive. Fiorina has a 45% favorable to 11% unfavorable rating among Republican voters, with 43% unable to rate her, while Kasich\u2019s is 32% favorable to 20% unfavorable, with 49% unable to rate him. The poll suggests those behind Trump love him: He holds a 98% favorability rating among his supporters. But those Republican voters who aren\u2019t supporting Trump are skeptical that he would help the party. Most Republicans (58%) say the party would have a better chance to win in 2016 with someone else at the top of the ticket, including 72% of those who don\u2019t currently back the businessman. Still, Trump has quickly won the trust of Republican voters on several top issues. According to the poll, 45% say they trust Trump more than any other Republican candidate on the economy \u2013 up 25 points since June, 44% say they trust Trump over the others on illegal immigration \u2013 up 30 points since June \u2013 and 32% trust him most to handle ISIS, no other candidate comes close on any of these issues. Trump campaign defends immigration plan On the economy and illegal immigration, Trump is far and away the top choice even among those Republicans who support someone else for the nomination (33% who say they will most likely vote for someone else say Trump is their most trusted on the economy, 29% say so on illegal immigration). Trump is also most trusted on social issues, 19% say he\u2019s their top choice to handle that. Bush follows at 15%. On two of these issues, Trump is more trusted among conservative Republicans than among moderate Republicans: When it comes to both the economy and illegal immigration, 50% of conservatives say they trust Trump, compared with 35% among moderates on each of those issues. The poll finds evidence of a slight gender gap in support for Trump, who has faced public questions recently about his treatment of women, though he does lead the field among both men and women. Trump stands at 27% among Republican men and at 20% among Republican women, a gap just outside the margin of error for each group. Can Trump change the Constitution? Bush is second among both men and women, standing just a hair behind Trump at 17% among women but well behind among men (10% of GOP men back Bush, no other candidate reaches double digits). Trump is less trusted by women to handle the economy (50% of male GOP voters say they trust Trump most, 40% of women voters do) and slightly less so on social issues (21% among men, 15% among women). But there is no gender gap among Republicans on favorable views of Trump: 60% of Republican women voters have a positive impression as do 57% of GOP men. Outside the Republican Party, women are less apt to hold a favorable view of Trump, just 17% of women voters who are independents or Democratic leaners see him favorably, compared with 29% of non-Republican male voters. New poll: Trump takes lead in Iowa, Walker drops There is also an education divide in Trump\u2019s support, with those Republican voters who lack college degrees more apt to back Trump than college graduates: 28% among the non-college graduate group vs. 16% among those who have graduated from college. Few other demographic divides emerge in Republican preferences, according to the poll. Rand Paul fares best among voters under age 50, 10% among the younger group vs. 1% among the older one, and supporters of the Tea Party movement are more likely to favor Ted Cruz, 10% vs. 2% among those Republicans who do not support the tea party. Trump outlines immigration specifics Among the most enthusiastic Republican voters, the mix of candidates at the top of the field changes. While Trump holds the top slot across the board with the support of roughly a quarter of Republican voters regardless of their level of enthusiasm, the group of candidates following Trump shifts among those who say they are \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d about the election. In that group, Carson has 13%, Rubio 11%, boosting both ahead of Bush, who holds 9% and ties with Cruz for 4th, Kasich holds 8% support and Fiorina and Walker tie at 7%. Bush has his best showing among those who are least enthusiastic. Among the group that says they are somewhat enthusiastic or less, 23% back Trump, 16% Bush, 10% Walker, with all others at 6% or less. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone Aug. 13-16 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults. The sample included 466 registered voters who are Republicans or independents who lean toward the Republican Party. For results among those Republican voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. For results among the full sample, it is 3 points.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's summer surge has left candidates such as Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul struggling for traction Trump is now the clear leader of the Republican field with the support of 24% of registered Republicans They were supposed to be the dream team. When the 2016 White House race ignited, the glut of talented, experienced, charismatic, young-but-seasoned and authentically conservative candidates delighted grassroots Republican activists. It was the GOP\u2019s deepest White House field in a generation. But Donald Trump\u2019s summer surge has stolen the spotlight from these challengers for the conservative crown and left candidates such as Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul struggling for traction. While their eclipse may yet prove to be temporary, it has raised questions about the political viability of this much-hyped group in the early primary states. The playing field on which the new GOP champions had expected to compete has dramatically shifted \u2013 as a new CNN/ORC poll makes clear \u2013 and the party\u2019s chaotic presidential battle is deeply volatile just six months before voting begins. READ: Trump outlines immigration specifics So far in this constantly surprising campaign, it turns out that a political track record, foreign policy expertise, standing in the national party and adherence to conservative values may be less important than harnessing the fierce anti-establishment feeling consuming the GOP grassroots. The tsunami of anger at party elites lifting Trump and other outsiders \u2013 anti-politicians such as Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson \u2013 is rendering any connection with the higher echelons of the GOP a liability for now. And Trump\u2019s outsize personality and talent for eviscerating what he sees as America\u2019s dysfunctional political culture has also blunted some of the assets of contenders as diverse as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. \u201cConservatives are really hungry for someone who is outside Washington, somebody who has not been on the treadmill of government, someone who will take on Washington and break up all these old models,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. \u201cI think we should move beyond the idea that Donald Trump is a flash in the pan. He is demonstrating that he is a real candidate who has sustained support.\u201d The new CNN/ORC national poll shows the consequences of that revolt. Trump is now the clear leader of the Republican field with the support of 24% of registered Republicans. Bush is now 11 points behind at 13%. Carson is third, just ahead of Rubio, Walker, Paul, Cruz, Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who are all in single figures. Carson and Cruz did even better in a Fox News national poll released Sunday, taking second and third place respectively behind Trump. Rubio was in a perilous position for a supposed future champion of conservatism at only 4% \u2013 behind former Hewlett-Packard CEO Fiorina, whose only political experience is a botched California Senate run in 2010. Trump encapsulated the simple appeal behind his campaign during an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d last week, declaring, \u201cI am not a politician.\u201d Fiorina, the only woman in the GOP race, is seizing on the troubles of Democrat Hillary Clinton to brand herself an insurgent by comparison, seeking to capitalize on anti-Washington feeling roiling the GOP race. Carly Fiorina: Trump's remarks are 'offensive' \u201c(Clinton) is the epitome of a professional political class that has managed a bloated, inept, corrupt federal government for far too long,\u201d said Fiorina in a commentary for CNN.com last week. The quiet style of surging pediatric neurosurgeon Carson is more stealthy than Trump\u2019s bombast, but his warnings that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t let the professional class pick our presidents\u201d helped him climb to second place in a CNN/ORC Iowa poll last week. The rise of Trump and the gang of outsiders did more than grab the headlines from the promising new class of Republican candidates; the mogul\u2019s stunning rise and sustained run as front-runner has damaged each of their arguments for why they should get the nation\u2019s top political job. Trump\u2019s coup has all but drowned out Florida Sen. Rubio\u2019s bid to promote himself as the candidate of generational change and as a foreign policy hawk. Texas Sen. Cruz, despite setting off political pyrotechnics in the Senate against the establishment\u2019s political \u201ccartel,\u201d has found himself overshadowed by the real estate magnate\u2019s seizure of the anti-Washington megaphone. Wisconsin Gov. Walker, building a campaign based on his appeal to conservatives after winning two elections and a recall in a liberal state, in part by bashing unions, has slipped in the polls as Trump claims he\u2019s left Wisconsin in a mess. Who needs straight talk from New Jersey Gov. Christie when rants and insults fly from the lips of Trump every day? And the man once branded by Time magazine as the most interesting man in American politics, Kentucky Sen. Paul, who reached Washington on a wave of anti-establishment anger that predated Trump, has slipped well down the list. So what should these full-time politicians do to slow their charismatic amateur rival? One option would be to keep their eye on the long game, to trust that historical precedents and the logic of political science will kick in and Trump, Carson and Fiorina, like other candidates taken for an early spin by GOP activists in past elections, will sooner or later fall to Earth. Bush, who slipped to 5% in the CNN/ORC Iowa survey, insists polls don\u2019t matter this far ahead of the election. \u201cLast time around, there were candidates that were winning at this point that never even made it to the starting line,\u201d Bush said in Iowa last week. So far, long-shot GOP contenders have been more willing than top presidential hopefuls to tackle Trump directly. READ: Donald Trump tweets insults at Jeb Bush, Rand Paul When Paul released an ad attacking Trump, the front-runner spat back that he was a \u201cnasty, nasty guy\u201d in a weekend New York Times story. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry last month branded Trump a demagogue in an apparent attempt to get some oxygen for his own lagging campaign. Another long shot, former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, suggested Monday that the real estate mogul\u2019s \u201coverheated\u201d rhetoric showed he\u2019d been \u201cout in the Iowa sun too long without his hat.\u201d Christie also chided Trump in an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Monday, saying his plan to saddle Mexico with the bill for constructing a wall along the border wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cThis is not negotiation of a real estate deal, OK. This is international diplomacy, and it\u2019s different,\u201d Christie said. Another long-odds candidate, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, told CNN on Monday that Trump\u2019s plan was \u201cgibberish.\u201d The three candidates seen by many analysts as having the best chance to win the nomination, however, have avoided a prolonged clash with Trump. But the time may be coming when they have little choice. Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who worked for 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, said Trump\u2019s opponents should be prepared to engage as a way of courting the 75% of the GOP electorate that does not support the real estate mogul. \u201cYou have to go out and draw these contrasts \u2026 the other campaigns have to hit back. Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio \u2013 they haven\u2019t really hit back and got into a one-on-one right now with Donald Trump,\u201d Madden told CNN. Bush is still on the fence. The one-time GOP front-runner appeared irritated when asked about Trump\u2019s new immigration plan in South Carolina on Monday. The episode was another sign of how the mogul\u2019s outspoken views on an issue that threatens to tear the GOP apart complicate life for conventional politicians. \u201cThis is not about the big personality in the room \u2026 we need to start solving problems instead of saying how bad things are,\u201d Bush said, betraying his frustration with the former reality star\u2019s surge but stopping short of a full-throated attack. Another candidate hurt by the Trump surge is Walker, who relinquished his position as the front-runner in the Iowa caucuses in the CNN poll. Scott Walker booed by protesters at Iowa soapbox Walker on Monday tried out an approach of responding to Trump not by attacking him, but by presenting himself as a more fitting vessel for the anti-establishment anger being exploited by Trump. \u201cI think it is a reflection that people are extremely frustrated with Washington \u2013 I have heard that for the last month or two. It is important for us to acknowledge that,\u201d Walker told reporters in Iowa on Monday. \u201cIf people are just angry, they check out \u2013 they want somebody who is going to do what they say they are going to do.\u201d The counterattack by Walker and other top candidates will be tested when they next meet Trump on stage, at CNN\u2019s Ronald Reagan Library debate on September 16. The event will mark a new escalation in the GOP race, and Trump\u2019s rivals in the political establishment will come under pressure to combat his rise. \u201cWe have gotten a look at the horseflesh, how they handle themselves on a big stage,\u201d said Schlapp, who said candidates could best tackle Trump by rolling out their own strong policy platforms and by demonstrating their own qualifications to lead. \u201cNow we need to see how they handle it when they are really pressed in prime time with all their competitors around,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind of temperament do they have? Do you have reasonable policy positions or is it just a bunch of pablum?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's helicopter provides a thrill for children at the Iowa State Fair The more entertaining he is, the higher in the polls he rises A helicopter landed here just after noon on Saturday, causing a short but violent windstorm. Large trees shivered; small ones bent nearly sideways. Dust swirled up from the parking lot, stinging the eyes of the onlookers. The pilot cut the engines. A man got out of the helicopter. He wore white shoes and white khakis with sharp creases and a red baseball cap that said MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. He strolled across the searing asphalt and stood at the edge of a field, where nearly 100 people waited to find out what he would do or say next. \u201cWe have quite a few children gonna take rides today,\u201d said Donald Trump, billionaire, celebrity, entertainer and Republican candidate for president. \u201cWhere are the children? Get them over here.\u201d CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates Half a mile northwest, beyond the railroad tracks and the Laurel Hill Cemetery, the Iowa State Fair proceeded as usual. You could see a cow made of butter or a 711-pound Giant Atlantic Pumpkin. You could eat a bacon-wrapped rib on a stick and drink a 32-ounce Miller Lite while watching a one-man band play and sing \u201cMustang Sally.\u201d You could strap into a ride called Slingshot, whose giant elastic bands would fling you toward the pale blue sky. 'Cold War' between Fox News and Donald Trump RELATED: Trump outlines immigration specifics But here in the parking lot was something else altogether: a chance to ride in a customized Sikorsky S-76B helicopter with one of the richest and most famous men in America. \u201cI love my kids,\u201d said Trump, a 69-year-old grandfather. \u201cCome \u2018ere.\u201d Taking their cue, nearly 50 children stood behind him on the asphalt as he answered questions about what he would do if elected president. \u201cUnder what circumstances would you use a nuclear weapon?\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cI don\u2019t even wanna talk about that question. It\u2019s a very serious question,\u201d he said before expounding on the importance of a strong national defense. After he went through his standard rhetoric about billionaires corrupting the political system, someone asked whether he thought anyone else was qualified to be president. \u201cNobody else will do the job that I will do,\u201d he said. \u201cI will bring back jobs, I will strengthen our military, I\u2019ll take care of our vets, I\u2019ll get rid of Obamacare, which is, by the way, a catastrophe.\u201d Trump dominates Republican polls RELATED: Trump breaks the rules at the Iowa State Fair Here the crowd interrupted him with applause; at least 10 children spontaneously joined in. Trump was on a roll now, casting aspersions on the local newspaper, describing the wall he would build along the Mexican border and assuring the media that actual voters trusted him so much they did not need to see the details of his immigration policy. The more entertaining he makes the race, the better he seems to do in the polls. His campaign has not been derailed by his inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants, or his verbal grenades at John McCain, or his denigration of Rosie O\u2019Donnell, or the tawdry complaints about Megyn Kelly that caused his banishment from the recent RedState gathering of conservatives. Who's running for President? He leads all competitors by at least eight percentage points among likely Iowa Republican voters, according to a recent CNN/ORC poll. \u201cSo I guess I haven\u2019t made any mistakes,\u201d he said as the children shifted their weight and tried to be patient. \u201cI\u2019m sure I will, at some point, but so far, you would have to say, it hasn\u2019t worked out badly, right?\u201d It\u2019s hard to say what the polls mean. The Iowa caucus is more than five months away, and most Republican voters remain undecided. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I hadn\u2019t even thought about it,\u201d said Rick Robbins, 46, a concrete worker selling cold water to fair-goers in his front yard on Saturday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a little early in the game.\u201d But this much is certain: Whether or not Americans intend to vote for Trump, many of them would like to catch a glimpse. Heather Kintzle, a 40-year-old administrative assistant from Cedar Rapids, went to the fair on Saturday to hear an impassioned talk about economic inequality from Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate who is calling for political revolution. Kintzle loved what she heard from Sanders, but she still wanted to see Trump, \u201cto see what all the circus was about.\u201d Just before Sanders took the State Fair Soapbox, a young woman wandered down Grand Avenue past his army of young revolutionaries. She was looking down, asking her smartphone a question: \u201cWhere is Donald Trump right now?\u201d The Bowman family had driven from the western suburbs to see Trump and his helicopter. Neither David nor Sarah Bowman had resolved to vote for Trump, at least not yet, but they had four little boys, and this chance was too good to miss. Into the helicopter went William, 9; Sean, 6; Brendan, 5; and Henry, who just turned 3. Their mother went with them. Henry got scared just before takeoff and left the aircraft to be with his father. The other boys remained. William brought a GoPro camera to capture the experience; a clip later wound up on Facebook. \u201cMr. Trump,\u201d he said, aiming the camera at his benefactor. \u201cYes,\u201d Trump said, pulling on the lapels of his jacket. \u201cAre you Batman?\u201d the boy asked. \u201cI am Batman,\u201d Trump said. The helicopter roared to life, causing another windstorm, hurling more dust at the people outside. William looked out the window, marveling at the power of the machine. Here was Trump\u2019s vantage point: a comfortable seat in the eye of the storm, a place to watch the rotor wash without messing up your hair. To William, this was the best moment of the whole ride. It felt just like a video game.",

Chris Christie said Monday he would have been blasted in the wake of the Bridgegate scandal if he had done the same as Hillary Clinton, and wiped a private email server clean. CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates \u201cCan you imagine, if after the bridge investigation began, I came out and said \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve done all my business as governor on a private email server. And, I\u2019ve deleted now 30,000 of those emails. But trust me none of it had to do with the bridge.\u2019 Give me a break,\u201d Christie said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d Bridgegate: 1 guilty plea, 2 indictments and \u2018liars\u2019 Clinton has repeatedly sparked criticism over the use of her private email server \u2013 and the decision to delete tens of thousands of emails from it while under investigation by a Congressional panel \u2013 most recently when she joked this past weekend about Snapchat\u2019s ability to make messages instantly disappear. Christie, who was weighing in on Clinton\u2019s dipping poll numbers, said a key part of the problem is voters dislike her lack of transparency. He also said the attacks on Clinton, which have largely come from Republican candidates but also a few Democratic opponents, are not about politics. Who's running for President? \u201cWhy not just answer that question instead of talking all the time like she does on television now about \u2018Oh, the politics and the Republicans?\u2019 It\u2019s not about the politics,\u201d he said. Christie also hit Clinton earlier Monday morning in an interview with Fox News, saying the former secretary of state is \u201ccapable of anything.\u201d \u201cHer arrogance is breathtaking. Breathtaking,\u201d Christie said. Former Christie allies plead not guilty in Bridgegate scandal Democratic groups quickly responded by pointing out that Christie deleted 12 text messages in 2013 during the height of the Bridgegate scandal. \u201cHas Chris Christie checked his own inbox recently or does he let his staff do that for him? In the federal criminal investigation into Bridgegate, Christie\u2019s staff was caught red-handed for using personal emails and text messages to conduct state business,\u201d said Adrienne Watson, communications director for Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton group that fires back against Republicans. On Monday, Christie also evaluated Donald Trump\u2019s immigration proposal Monday, saying he found constructing a wall along the entire southern border unworkable and also did not think Mexico would pay for it. Who's who in the Christie controversies \u201cThis makes no sense,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI\u2019ve met (Mexican) President (Enrique) Pena Nieto a number of times. I don\u2019t think if we present him with a bill he\u2019s gong to pay for it and this is not a negotiation of a real estate deal, ok?\u201d Instead, Christie said, he would build walls in selective spots along the border \u2013 like dense urban areas \u2013 and pay for it. He also wants to use drones to conduct border surveillance, have the FBI, DEA and ATF work with border patrol agents and use the e-verify system to check worker status. \u201cThe fact is these people are coming over here to work, they\u2019re not coming here to vote,\u201d Christie told CNN. \u201cAnd if, in fact, they know they can\u2019t get jobs then they\u2019re not going to come, and so that\u2019s the most important element of a ll four.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump is largely eschewing the classic retail politicking that has defined presidential campaigns in Iowa for decades Trump's strategy has drawn skeptical glances from other veteran Iowa operatives Veteran Iowa political operative Chuck Laudner spent the last presidential election crisscrossing the state in his own pickup truck with Rick Santorum at his side, driving the former Pennsylvania senator to a surprise victory in the crucial Iowa Republican caucus in 2012. This time around, Laudner is running Donald Trump\u2019s Iowa campaign. But don\u2019t expect Trump to hop in the passenger seat of Laudner\u2019s \u201cChuck Truck\u201d anytime soon. \u201cNo, no, not gonna happen,\u201d Laudner said in an interview Friday at the Iowa State Fair. That\u2019s because Trump is largely eschewing the classic retail politicking that has defined presidential campaigns in Iowa for decades, and much of Laudner\u2019s own career as a political operative. RELATED: Trump state fair helicopter rides still on Trump\u2019s jaunts to Iowa start and end with a flight on his private plane, and his travel to events involves a fleet of black SUVs, not an operative\u2019s pickup truck. Even as he heads to the fair on Saturday for the most conventional stop in Iowa politics, Trump will whirr above the crowds and land in his Trump-emblazoned helicopter. But Laudner sees no reason to bring Trump\u2019s campaign in line with the old mold \u2013 a whirlwind of small stops over several days that involves a lot of handshaking and personalized pitches to small crowds. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do the Chuck Truck bouncing around in small groups. We\u2019ve got to reach all of these people, and he can reach all those people. I don\u2019t want to go to an event that has 20-30 people at it when you can be talking to thousands,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s different. But isn\u2019t the difference because our crowds here are 10 times the size?\u201d Politicians flock to the Iowa State Fair At a typical campaign event, Trump meets privately with a handful of local leaders before or after a speech to a crowd of several hundred, and sometimes several thousand, potential supporters. RELATED: CNN/ORC Poll: Trump tops in Iowa as Walker drops \u201cThis isn\u2019t the campaign Chuck ran for Rick,\u201d said Iowa Agriculture Secretary Bill Northey, a Republican who is staying neutral in the GOP primary, after warmly bumping into Laudner at the fair. Trump\u2019s ability to draw large crowds might be at odds with the classic model of Iowa politics, but for Laudner it offers the surest path to victory for a non-establishment candidate to secure the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Laudner, who has a strong anti-establishment bent, said his pitch to potential caucus goers hasn\u2019t changed in his 30 years in the business \u2013 and it\u2019s still the same as he pushes Trump\u2019s candidacy. The difference, he said, is that Trump has the resources to take the same conservative message of a candidate like Santorum and actually produce results. \u201cI wanted to speak to 800, not eight, people,\u201d Laudner said of his decision to join Trump back when he was still considering a run in February. \u201cWe\u2019re casting such a wide net.\u201d The strategy appears to be working. Trump claimed the top spot in the latest CNN/ORC poll of likely Iowa Republican voters with 22%, and Laudner said he and his staff are constantly besieged by Iowans who notice the blue TRUMP buttons always pinned to their chests. RELATED: Can Trump turn poll numbers into votes? The new strategy has drawn skeptical glances from other veteran Iowa operatives who doubt that Trump can maintain his front-runner status in Iowa without getting out and covering more ground in the crucial primary state. Iowa state GOP chairman Jeff Kaufmann, who is also remaining neutral in the race, said he believes \u201cit\u2019s less likely they (the Trump campaign) can be successful\u201d without drawing from the retail politics playbook. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if the maxim holds when you\u2019re getting as much press coverage as he\u2019s getting,\u201d Kaufmann said, suggesting the lines were getting blurred between Trump\u2019s constant appearance in the news media and his visits to the state. \u201cThe 99-county tour, the meeting people up close and personal \u2026 I still believe that works and that\u2019s going to speak to the success of the candidate,\u201d he said. Donald Trump: His own words But Craig Robinson, an influential GOP activist who runs The Iowa Republican political blog, said he believes \u201cthe worst thing a candidate like Donald Trump could do is to stop being who he is.\u201d \u201cWhen Donald Trump comes to town, we want him to bring the entire circus with him because we want to see it,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Trump to make himself available to Iowans, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s required of him to have to go to the 900 town hall meetings and make himself available that way.\u201d And Robinson said Trump is bolstered by his front-runner status, allowing him to bypass the get-to-know-you stage and skip to firing up large crowds during brief jaunts to the state. That\u2019s not to say Trump\u2019s ground game is weak. Four years after Laudner led one of the most successful efforts in modern-day retail politics, the Iowa operative hasn\u2019t ditched the model altogether. He and his staff are just carrying it out without their candidate \u2013 going to small events and garnering pledges of support from voters enthused by Trump\u2019s nonconformist candidacy. And at the state fair, Trump\u2019s Iowa staff took turns at the Iowa Republican Party booth and stomped through the fairgrounds with pledge cards in hand. RELATED: Trump says he\u2019ll release details on immigration, tax code plans Laudner\u2019s team is also careening into local events with a TRUMP-branded bus that draws crowds even though the candidate is nowhere near it. And Laudner is still driving through Iowa fields in his Dodge Ram, which now has nearly 250,000 miles on the odometer. Santorum, for his part, is sitting low in the polls despite winning the caucus last cycle. And he\u2019s chasing the old model, hoping for a repeat of his surprise 2012 win \u2013 meeting with small crowds of voters throughout the state where he\u2019s heavily invested his time. One Iowan he crossed paths with Friday as he romped through the state fair was Laudner, who was wearing his blue Trump button. But as the old pals caught up, an enthusiastic supporter walked up to the pair to ask about the Republican running for president. About Trump, that is.",

            "article_content": "\"To me, conservatism is giving everybody a chance to be able to be successful,\" Kasich said Kasich has jumped to a strong third-place standing in New Hampshire since last week's debate Ohio Gov. John Kasich supports key exceptions for abortion, is open to a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and says he will make sure he protects the social safety net. And he says he\u2019s still a conservative. CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates He explained it this way to CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Wednesday during a break from the campaign trail in New Hampshire: John Kasich's political career \u201cI\u2019ve balanced more budgets than about anybody walking on the face of the earth \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m just kinda kidding, but I\u2019ve done that. I\u2019ve cut taxes in every step of the way \u2013 the largest tax cuts in Ohio of any sitting governor right now. I\u2019m for school choice. We\u2019re getting at the problem of higher education costs. And somehow because I care about people or I care about the environment, that makes me something other than a conservative?\u201d He then recounted how one attendee at one of his town halls whispered to him \u201cthanks for caring about people\u201d as he walked out. Kasich not ruling out pathway for illegal immigrants \u201cI think Republicans allow themselves to be put in a box,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s like whispering like that\u2019s bad to say. No. To me, conservatism is giving everybody a chance to be able to be successful. That\u2019s the way Reagan was.\u201d It\u2019s a similar pitch he\u2019s made since entering the race last month with an empathetic and sometimes emotional announcement speech at Ohio State University. And it\u2019s reflective of one of his best-received answers at last week\u2019s Republican debate, when he said he would always love a hypothetical gay daughter. But, following that debate performance, Kasich and his stances are getting a lot more attention. In a winding answer to his position on immigration Wednesday, Kasich explained that he wants to complete a fence along the southern border and generally crack down on illegal immigration. But he would not slam the door on a potential pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. \u201cI don\u2019t favor citizenship because, as I teach my kids, you don\u2019t jump the line to get into a Taylor Swift concert,\u201d Kasich told CNN. But, he added: \u201cI\u2019m just not going to pound the table on these things and say my way or the highway,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I will on some things, but I better be careful about that. Because you know what \u2013 I actually think about what it would be like to be president.\u201d He did, however, flatly slam the door on his previous support for ending birthright citizenship \u2013 a proposal he now says is too divisive. Asked about abortion, he said he favors three exceptions \u2013 in the case of the mother\u2019s life being at risk, rape or incest \u2013 a position which used to be standard among some of the most conservative Republicans but which has been ditched by many of his opponents, including, notably, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. The two-term governor and former House Budget Committee chairman has already taken heat for expanding Medicaid under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. He says, however, that he would repeal Obamacare if given the chance. Kasich weighs in on illegal immigration Kasich has catapulted to prominence in the New Hampshire race in the past few days due in large part to good timing. He announced his campaign later than most other GOP candidates and successfully rode the subsequent bump in the polls to a coveted spot onstage at the main Republican debate in Cleveland. Once there, he played well to his hometown audience \u2013 winning multiple applause lines inside the arena \u2013 and won some plaudits from the pundits afterward. He even thanked Donald Trump this week for drawing 24 million viewers to catch his own performance. Since then, he has jumped to a strong third-place standing in New Hampshire. And now the two-term Ohio governor is sticking close to the nice guy image he\u00b9s established in the wide-open field of Republicans. Now it\u2019s up to Republican voters to decide if he\u2019s conservative enough.",

            "article_content": "Trump tops the field with 22% and is the candidate seen as best able to handle top issues He's most cited as the one with the best chance of winning the general election Donald Trump has a significant lead in the race to win over likely Iowa caucus-goers, according to the first CNN/ORC poll in the state this cycle. Trump tops the field with 22% and is the candidate seen as best able to handle top issues including the economy, illegal immigration and terrorism. He\u2019s most cited as the one with the best chance of winning the general election, and, by a wide margin, as the candidate most likely to change the way things work in Washington. READ THE POLL RESULTS Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson follows Trump in overall preference with 14%, bumping Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who had held the top spot in most recent public polling in Iowa, down to third place with 9%. Walker is nearly even with a slew of other candidates. Previous public polls had found Carson with around 10% support, but most were released before last week\u2019s debate. A Suffolk University poll of Iowa Republicans released Tuesday found Carson\u2019s closing remarks to be the most memorable moment for those who watched the prime time debate. Related: GOP debate takeaways Texas Sen. Ted Cruz follows the top three at 8%, with businesswoman Carly Fiorina and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee both at 7%. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is tied at 5% with senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. The rest of the field stands at 3% or less. Two-thirds of Iowa Republicans who are likely to attend the caucus say they\u2019re still trying to decide whom to support. Among the 34% who say they have made up their mind or are leading toward a candidate, Trump\u2019s lead grows, and the top of the field shifts. Among that group, 33% back Trump, 14% Carson, 11% Fiorina, and 9% each back Paul and Walker. Cruz follows at 7%, and all others have less than 5% support. But Trump\u2019s advantages are not universal. He faces a large gender gap: While holding a 15-point lead over his nearest competitor among men (27% Trump to 12% Walker, Carson at 10%), he trails among women (20% back Carson, 15% Trump, and 11% support Fiorina). He runs behind Carson and about even with Walker and Cruz among those who describe themselves as \u201cvery conservative\u201d (25% Carson, 15% each Cruz and Walker, 12% Trump), and he runs even with Carson among evangelical Christians (18% each Trump and Carson, 12% Cruz, 11% Huckabee, 10% Walker). Related: Trump\u2019s \u2018whining\u2019 strategy Both evangelical Christians and those who call themselves very conservative make up a substantial share of Iowa caucus-goers. According to entrance polls conducted for CNN, half of caucus attendees considered themselves \u201cvery conservative\u201d in 2012, while born-again Christians were 57% of participants. Forty-three percent of 2012 Republican caucus attendees were women. Trump\u2019s support in Iowa rests on perceptions that he would do the best job handling several top issues and that he is most electable. He tops the list by wide margins when GOP caucus-goers are asked which candidate they trust most to handle the economy, illegal immigration and terrorism. And Trump holds his biggest advantage as the candidate who \u201cis most likely to change the way things work in Washington,\u201d 44% say Trump can do that, no other candidate hits double-digits. But while Trump falters somewhat on representing the values of Republicans, no clear leader emerges on that question, with nine candidates at 5% or higher: 14% Carson, 12% Trump, 11% Huckabee, 10% Cruz, 9% Walker, 6% each Bush and Paul, and 5% each Fiorina and Jindal. And he falls well below the lead when voters are asked which candidate would best handle abortion; 17% each say Carson and Huckabee would be best on that score, 7% each choose Bush and Trump, 6% each Cruz, Paul and Walker, and Rubio stands at 5%. Who's running for President? The reason behind Walker\u2019s tumble from the top of the pack in Iowa may be in those issue questions: Although 11% see him as the most electable in the field, he hasn\u2019t impressed on the issues. Walker falls below 10% on each issue tested, with his best showing the 8% who think he would best handle the economy. Related: Walker pivots from Clinton, knocks back at Trump When asked to name the issue that will be most important in deciding which candidate to support for president next year, Iowa Republicans likely to attend the presidential caucus most frequently cite an economic issue, with 33% naming an economy-related concern, 20% a foreign policy issue, 14% immigration, 8% social issues, and 6% government spending, taxes or the national debt. Among those who call the economy their top concern, 39% say they most trust Trump to handle it, 12% Fiorina, and 11% Walker. And those who cite a foreign policy concern also put Trump atop their list of trusted candidates for handling terrorism, but by a smaller margin: 17% trust Trump, 10% Cruz, 9% Paul. The poll was conducted August 7-11 among a statewide sample of 2,014 Iowa adults, 544 of whom were identified as likely Republican caucusgoers based on questions about whether they are registered to vote, likelihood of voting, past voting behavior and interest in the campaign. The margin of sampling error for results among the sample of likely Republican caucus attendees is plus or minus 4 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "Cruz has at times been careful to avoid criticizing candidates harshly by name But Cruz is indicating a fresh willingness to go after Bush Ted Cruz offered rare and most likely tongue-in-cheek praise to his ideological rival, Jeb Bush, for his \u201ccandor\u201d in not backing down from his more moderate positions on immigration and Common Core. Cruz, who has looked to position himself as the furthest-right candidate in the field, said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday that he appreciated that Bush, who may be the GOP\u2019s furthest to the left, was not changing his positions. \u201cThere are candidates in the field who attempt to change their position to do better in primaries, and Jeb Bush has demonstrated a remarkable candor defending positions,\u201d said Cruz, a Texas senator. \u201cJeb Bush has been straightforward and consistent and candid about his embrace of amnesty and Common Core, and I respect that he is willing to stand for those principles.\u201d A spokeswoman for Bush, Kristy Campbell, said in a statement that his plan \u2013 which offers \u201cearned legal status\u201d to undocumented immigrants \u2013 was not \u201camnesty.\u201d \u201cHe will continue to stand on his principles,\u201d she said. Cruz has at times been careful to avoid criticizing candidates harshly by name, preferring to speak in general terms about the contrast between himself and the rest of the Republican field. His backhanded compliment to Bush, the former Florida governor, mirrors what Cruz frequently says about Democratic candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who he praises as an \u201chonest\u201d socialist, unlike Hillary Clinton, who Cruz describes as a philosophical sibling. But Cruz is indicating a fresh willingness to go after Bush. This week he incorporated a new shot at him into his recorked stump speech, lumping him in with 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama for criticizing Cruz\u2019s comment that Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran makes him the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Shouting choice words, crowds booed at Bush\u2019s name at nearly every stop \u2013 sometimes even more loudly than they did at Obama\u2019s. Those mentions came as Cruz winds his way through the South, where he\u2019s hoping to score primary wins in the four states voting March 1. Cruz\u2019s advisers stress that the Texas senator is playing the long game, and the candidate himself downplayed the need for him to score a top performance in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina. (Almost never mentioned at any Cruz stop: Nevada, which votes fourth.) \u201cIn the previous election, it was possible for a candidate to go move to Iowa for a year, live there, and hope to capture lightning in a bottle, surprise everyone and ride that momentum and possibly win the nomination. I think the accelerated calendar makes that much less likely this time,\u201d Cruz said as his bus ambled from Olive Branch, Mississippi over the Tennessee border. \u201cOf the 17 Republican candidates, there are only a handful capable of running a national campaign.\u201d That \u201cnational campaign\u201d suggests that Cruz would remain in the GOP primary until late into the spring \u2013 and possibly even the early summer. Cruz has begun to organize in states as deep into the primary calendar as New Jersey, which votes in June, only weeks before the Republican National Convention meets in Cleveland. \u201cA brokered convention is certainly possible, but if history is any guide, it\u2019s quite unlikely,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Even by the colorful standards of presidential primaries, the 2016 election cycle has been filled with jaw-dropping, head-scratching moments. And though the Summer of Trump \u2013 featuring brawls over immigration, John McCain\u2019s war-hero status, Megyn Kelly\u2019s debate moderating skills and more \u2013 is dominating the campaign trail now, the presidential election season was surreal from the start \u2013 with the possibility of another Bush vs. Clinton matchup \u2013 and has already provided a host of standout assertions, attacks and missteps. Here are a baker\u2019s dozen of the most eye-popping moments so far: 1. Donald Trump says Megyn Kelly has \u201cblood coming out of her \u2013 wherever.\u201d And then he insists that \u201conly a sick person\u201d would think it was about menstruation. Donald Trump wasn\u2019t pleased with the question Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked about his history of attacks on women during the first GOP presidential debate. So he attacked \u2013 first on Twitter, and then in a Friday night interview on CNN during which he said Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her eyes; blood coming out of her \u2013 wherever.\u201d Was it a reference to menstruation? Most of Trump\u2019s Republican opponents thought so, and hit him for it. But Trump, standing firm in an extraordinary Sunday morning interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, said that \u201conly a sick person\u201d would make that assumption. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d make a stupid statement like that?\u201d he said. 2. Hillary Clinton says she and Bill Clinton were \u201cdead broke\u201d in 2001. The Clintons clean up 'dead broke' Still 10 months from launching her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton raised eyebrows during a book tour by declaring that her family left the White House \u201cnot only dead broke but in debt.\u201d The debt was the result of the legal expenses the Clintons had racked up, and the former secretary of state was attempting to explain the exorbitant speaking fees she\u2019s commanded since then. But she ignored another reality: The Clintons had the capacity then to quickly earn money in a way most Americans can only dream of. As she campaigns on a platform of middle-class economics, the remark could return in anti-Clinton ads. 3. Mike Huckabee says President Barack Obama is marching Israelis \u201cto the door of the oven.\u201d In an interview with Breitbart News, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee put his opposition to the Iran deal in the starkest terms possible, saying that President Barack Obama is on the verge of causing another Holocaust. \u201cIt is so naive that he would trust the Iranians. By doing so, he will take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven,\u201d Huckabee said. In a race where his presence has otherwise been low-key, the remark made Huckabee the center of attention for a few days, leading even some opponents of Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear pitch to say the presidential candidate went too far. 4. Ted Cruz calls Mitch McConnell a liar on the Senate floor. Since his 2012 election, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has taken pride in his willingness to fight longer and harder than other conservatives \u2013 even when that means the government shuts down. So Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s decision to allow a vote on an amendment that would extend the Export-Import Bank\u2019s charter was too much for Cruz, who said McConnell broke a promise not to do just that and that senators shouldn\u2019t \u201clie to each other.\u201d \u201cWe now know that when the majority leader looks us in the eyes and makes an explicit commitment, that he is willing to say things that he knows are false,\u201d Cruz said \u2013 potentially violating a Senate rule against attacking other members\u2019 motives, and earning a scolding from a handful of senior Republicans over it. 5. The Summer of Trump begins: Attack on John McCain\u2019s war-hero status follows \u201cWho\u2019s doing the raping?\u201d Donald Trump: 'Somebody's doing the raping' Donald Trump had already set off controversy by claiming that many of the undocumented immigrants who crossed into the United States from Mexico were rapists and killers by the time he went on CNN to ask: \u201cWho\u2019s doing the raping?\u201d But he managed to kick the controversy up a notch \u2013 and earn much stronger rebukes from other Republican presidential contenders \u2013 by attacking Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Of McCain, he said: \u201cHe is not a war hero.\u201d Trump went on to insist that veterans who weren\u2019t captured haven\u2019t received enough attention. 6. Donald Trump gives out Lindsey Graham\u2019s cell phone \u2013 and then Graham finds a bunch of ways to destroy it. Trump mocks 2016 opponents, discloses Graham's number The attack on McCain didn\u2019t sit well with one of his best friends in the Senate, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who happens to be running for president. After Graham hit back at Trump, the real estate mogul held up a card on which he\u2019d previously written Graham\u2019s cell phone number and \u2013 in the middle of a campaign event \u2013 read it to the world. But Graham would seize on the moment. In a video for IJReview, Graham crushed, pureed and set fire to his famous flip phone. Then he tweeted to ask his followers whether he should get an iPhone or an Android. 7. Chris Christie yells at a gun rights supporter to \u201cname one thing\u201d he\u2019s done to oppose the Second Amendment. New Jersey might not be the nation\u2019s most pro-gun state, but Gov. Chris Christie doesn\u2019t like to be challenged on his Second Amendment record. He displayed his confrontational style in an Iowa town hall, shouting down a pro-gun activist who asked about the state\u2019s restrictions. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for one fact from you, one fact about me being anti-gun,\u201d Christie scolded the man. \u201cGive me one. One fact. Got one?\u201d 8. Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders confront \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protesters at Netroots Nation \u2013 and then have to backtrack. Democratic presidential candidates under pressure at liberal event What would normally be a friendly liberal crowd for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley \u2013 the Netroots Nation conference in Phoenix \u2013 flummoxed both of them when \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protesters interrupted their appearances. O\u2019Malley declared that \u201cblack lives matter,\u201d but added: \u201cWhite lives matter. All lives matter.\u201d Sanders, meanwhile, shouted down the protesters, complaining that they\u2019d interrupted him. Both later had to apologize. 9. Jeb Bush stumbles over the most predictable question of the entire campaign: Would he have gone to war in Iraq? Can Jeb Bush recover from Iraq war stumble? Former President George W. Bush\u2019s reasoning behind his decision to go to war in Iraq \u2013 that the country had weapons of mass destruction \u2013 proved false. So former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, facing his brother\u2019s legacy, had to know he\u2019d be asked whether he\u2019d invade Iraq, knowing what he knows now. And yet he stumbled in a May interview with Fox News\u2019 Kelly. He said he would have gone \u2013 noting that Hillary Clinton voted, too, in favor of the war at the time. What he didn\u2019t address, and was then tripped by several more times in the days ahead, is whether he\u2019d have done that knowing everything that\u2019s known now. Several days later, Bush finally said he would not have. 10. Rand Paul shushes CNBC\u2019s Kelly Evans. Rand Paul's secret weapon: His wife Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky looked more than a little prickly \u2013 and raised questions about his treatment of women \u2013 when an interview with CNBC host Kelly Evans went awry. There were several awkward moments, but the one that stood out is when Paul held his finger to his lips and said: \u201cShhhh.\u201d 11. Lincoln Chafee announces his metric platform. Chafee bashes Clinton on war, promotes metric system Republican-turned-Democrat Lincoln Chafee announced perhaps the least-expected campaign platform when, during a speech entering the presidential race, he declared: \u201cLet\u2019s be bold. Let\u2019s join the rest of the world and go metric.\u201d The former Rhode Island governor and senator explained that the metric system worked well in Canada, where he once lived, and could save companies money and help avoid mistakes in measurements and international trade. It\u2019s still the most attention Chafee has received during his long-shot campaign. 12. Ben Carson says that some men enter prison straight \u2013 \u201cand when they come out, they\u2019re gay.\u201d Ben Carson: Prison proves being gay is a choice Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was forced to backtrack within hours after, in a March interview on CNN, he declared that being gay is \u201cabsolutely\u201d a choice because \u201ca lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight, and when they come out, they\u2019re gay. So, did something happen while they were in there?\u201d He very quickly apologized, saying he doesn\u2019t \u201cpretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation.\u201d Carson\u2019s comments, three months before the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage everywhere, also triggered questions for other Republican presidential contenders about whether they believe homosexuality is a choice. 13. Hillary Clinton hits the road in the \u201cScooby van.\u201d Hillary Clinton goes unrecognized at Chipotle When Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2008, her campaign\u2019s aura of inevitability ultimately proved fatal. So she was determined to prove that she\u2019s willing to earn the Democratic nomination in 2016 \u2013 and started trying to prove it by road-tripping to her first campaign stops in Iowa and New Hampshire. What got the most attention of all was the van she took to get there. Its name? \u201cScooby\u201d \u2013 as in, the green Mystery Machine, from the Scooby-Doo cartoons. Clinton\u2019s black van, though, came with a few more bells and whistles, and occasionally stops at Chipotle.",

            "article_content": "The team will pick the juiciest statements, analyze them, consult issue experts and then rate them The team rates each claim either True; Mostly True; True, but Misleading; False; or It's Complicated The CNN Fact-Checking Team worked through Thursday night to check some of the most notable claims made by all 17 Republican presidential candidates at the two debates hosted by Fox News. The team, comprised of researchers, editors and reporters across CNN, picked the juiciest statements, analyzed them, consulted issue experts and then rated them either True; Mostly True; True, but Misleading; False; or It\u2019s Complicated. Fact check: Ted Cruz says part of Iran deal includes lifting sanctions against leader of Quds Force. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s assertion that part of the Iran deal includes lifting sanctions against Qassem Suleimani, the Quds Force leader, is partially true. According to the White House, Soleimani \u2013 who was accused of involvement in the Shia insurgency against U.S. forces during the Iraq War \u2013 would not have United Nations sanctions lifted against him until eight years into a completed deal. Even then, U.S. sanctions will continue to be in place, according to the White House, and those sanctions are not connected to the Iran deal. There is another Soleimani who will have sanctions lifted sooner, but he\u2019s not a part of the Quds Force. Ghasem Soleimani is the director of Uranium Mining Operations at the Saghand Uranium Mine. We find Cruz\u2019s claim Mostly True. Fact check: Marco Rubio on allowing abortions in certain instances. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida disagreed with debate moderator Megyn Kelly for suggesting that he supports exceptions to an abortion ban in cases of rape and incest. But the record shows otherwise. Although Rubio has said he personally believes life begins at conception and that all human life is worthy of protection, Rubio cosponsored S. 1670, the Senate\u2019s Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act of 2013. The legislation would have prohibited abortion except in certain circumstances, including if \u201cthe pregnancy is the result of rape, or the result of incest against a minor.\u201d We find Rubio\u2019s claim False. Fact check: Ted Cruz on \u201cmajority\u201d of people on stage supporting \u201camnesty.\u201d If \u201camnesty\u201d is defined as any proposal that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Cruz is correct. At least five of the other nine candidates have supported citizenship at one point. We find Cruz\u2019s claim True. Fact check: Kasich\u2019s Ohio economic story. Kasich said, \u201cOur Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country, and finally, we went from eight billion in the hole to two billion in the black. We\u2019ve cut five billion in taxes and we\u2019ve grown 350,000 jobs.\u201d It\u2019s true that Ohio had an $8 billion budget gap when Kasich took office in 2011, but he was required to close it. The state does have a $2 billion surplus and has created 330,000 jobs since he took office. Kasich has heavily cut taxes, but the two governors before him also cut income taxes, according to Robert Greenbaum, associate professor at Ohio State University. But his claims on his tax cuts and balanced budgets driving economic growth and job creation are misleading since Ohio trails the nation in both. The nation\u2019s gross domestic product had a 2% compound annual growth rate, while Ohio\u2019s was 1.9%. We find Kasich\u2019s claim to be True, but Misleading. Fact check: Donald Trump says Mexico sends its criminals across the border. Trump said that Mexico sends its criminals across the border while the U.S. does nothing. \u201cThey send the bad ones over because the stupid leaders of the United States will take care of them and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, whether you like it or not,\u201d he said. But the Pew Center shows that the number of undocumented immigrants coming from Mexico has actually declined after the recession of 2008 and the undocumented population is stable at 11 million people. The Pew report also notes that the deportations hit a record high in 2013, around 400,000 per year, and many were criminals. We find Trump\u2019s claim to be False. Fact check: Rubio says Hillary Clinton has been in office longest of anyone on the debate stage. Rubio said: \u201cThis election cannot be a resume contest. It\u2019s important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, than Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president because she\u2019s been in office and government longer than anybody else running here tonight.\u201d Clinton served as a senator from 2001 to 2009 and as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. That\u2019s 12 years of experience in office and government. She also served as the chair of the Arkansas Educational Standards Committee from 1983 to 1992, which brings her to 21 years. Because Clinton has not been in office or government longer than anyone else on the debate stage, we rate Rubio\u2019s claim as False. Candidates hit Trump early in the 'undercard' debate The following fact checks come from the happy hour debate of seven candidates. Fact check: Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina says U.S. not arming the Kurds. Fiorina said: \u201cThe Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years. We haven\u2019t done so.\u201d In fact, the U.S. is arming the Kurds, but the arms need to go through the Iraqi government. \u201cWe are arming the Kurds,\u201d Defense Secretary Ash Carter told Congress in June. \u201cBut we\u2019re still doing it through the government of Iraq because we\u2019re still trying to support the prime minister in maintaining a decentralized but single unitary Iraqi state.\u201d We rate her statement False. Fact check: Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore\u2019s 9/11 warning. Gilmore said: \u201cI chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security for the United States. We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred. I was the governor during the 9/11 attack.\u201d Gilmore was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism, known as the Gilmore Commission, from January 1999 to 2003. This commission ultimately resulted in the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. But CNN reported in 2004 that President George W. Bush\u2019s August 6, 2001, CIA daily briefing included a warning that \u201cBin Laden implied in U.S. television interviews in 1997 and 1998 that his followers would follow the example of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and \u2018bring the fighting to America.\u2019\u201d In his debate statement, Gilmore implies that the government was warned by his commission about the specifics of the 9/11 attacks. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, warnings about any potential attack were vague and incomplete. We rate his statement False. Fact check: Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said that Trump supports a single-payer health care system. Perry said: \u201cI\u2019ve had my issues with Donald Trump. I\u2019ve talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who is using his celebrity rather than his conservatism. How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single-payer health care? I ask that with all due respect.\u201d Candidates hit Trump early in the 'undercard' debate Trump wrote this in his 2000 book: \u201cThe Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America. We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.\u201d But Trump has since reversed his position, telling The New York Times in 2011: \u201cWe had a much different country when I proposed those two things.\u201d And most recently, on July 31, a spokesman said: \u201cMr. Trump does not believe socialized medicine is the solution to expanding coverage.\u201d We rate Perry\u2019s claim False. Fact check: Fiorina said that Trump has flip-flopped on health care, abortion and immigration. Fiorina: \u201cI would also just say this. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?\u201d Trump, as noted above, did change his position on single-payer. As for abortion, he said, \u201cI am very pro-choice\u201d on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in 1999, but in a recent interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, he said he changed his position. And on immigration, Trump did flip: He was once sympathetic to a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants but now says the U.S. should deport them. He told Bill O\u2019Reilly in 2011 that the U.S. should determine which undocumented immigrants can stay on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s hard to generalize, but you\u2019re going to have to look at the individual people, see how they\u2019ve done, see how productive they\u2019ve been, see what their references are, and then make a decision,\u201d he said. Furthermore, in an interview on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d last month, he seemed open to a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. But on July 30, he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that he would deport all undocumented immigrants and then allow some of the \u201cgood ones\u201d to return. We rate Fiorina\u2019s claims True. Fact check: Perry oversaw the creation of 1.5 million jobs between 2007 and 2014. Perry said Texas created 1.5 million jobs between 2007 and 2014, when he was governor. See highlights from GOP 'happy hour' debate \u201cNot just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy of the world, which I might add we had 1.5 million jobs during that period of time, over that 2007 through 2014 period.\u201d According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas had 10,997,356 employed people in December 2007 and 12,570,050 employed people in December 2014. That\u2019s an increase of 1,572,694 people. But that data includes agricultural workers, and many economists prefer nonfarm payroll data, which shows that Texas had 10,529,900 nonfarm employees in December 2007 and 11,749,500 nonfarm employees in December 2014. That\u2019s an increase of 1,219,600 people. Texas did add 1.5 million jobs in seven years, but because that measure may not be the best gauge of employment, we rate Perry\u2019s claim as Mostly True.

            "article_content": "The prime-time debate didn't yield a clear victor, but it did offer a few breakout stars From the stand-out moments to the blows, here are the night's top eight takeaways The top 10 candidates for the Republican presidential nomination only had a few minutes each on Thursday to capture the attention of voters tuning in to the first big-league Republican presidential debate. Donald Trump may have grabbed the most headlines from the night, but the prime-time debate didn\u2019t yield a clear victor. The night did offer a few breakout stars, and no candidate seemed to have sunk their campaign by the end of the night. CNN fact checks the 2016 Republican debates From the stand-out moments to the blows, here are the night\u2019s top eight takeaways: Like the wall he\u2019s pledged to build along the U.S.-Mexico border, Donald Trump was immovable. Trump proved yet again that he\u2019s not going to back down from his bombastic rhetoric. The Republican frontrunner kicked off the debate by refusing \u2013 again \u2013 to rule out a third-party run and pledge his support to the Republican nominee, regardless of who takes the crown. Is Florida better off after Jeb Bush was governor? Instead, Trump said: \u201cI can totally make the pledge if I\u2019m the nominee.\u201d The moderators didn\u2019t mince words with Trump: Asking him about calling some undocumented immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and slamming women he\u2019s previously sparred with as \u201cfat pigs\u201d and \u201cslobs.\u201d \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell,\u201d Trump interjected, before saying he doesn\u2019t \u201cfrankly have time for total political correctness.\u201d But the result didn\u2019t give voters much in the way of specifics on Trump\u2019s policies, and he refused to do so when pressed on immigration by moderator Chris Wallace \u2013 instead saying \u201cour leaders are stupid.\u201d No one outshines Donald Trump at GOP debate Rand Paul was eager to grab headlines, jumping in even when he wasn\u2019t called on to rebut another candidate\u2019s point or lob attacks at Trump and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Paul jumped in immediately at the start of the debate to go after Trump\u2019s refusal to rule out a third-party run, saying the billionaire \u201cbuys and sells politicians of all stripes\u201d and accusing him of \u201chedging his bet on the Clintons.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt Paul was trying to stand out, and perhaps even steal Trump\u2019s thunder with the party\u2019s base as he described himself as a \u201cdifferent kind of Republican\u201d in his closing remarks. While Trump didn\u2019t go full-Donald to beat back the Kentucky senator\u2019s attacks, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took advantage when given the opportunity to address his beef with Paul over national security. Trump: I don't have time for total political correctness Months after Rand Paul\u2019s 10-and-a-half hour filibuster to block the NSA\u2019s reauthorization \u2013 which prompted attacks from Christie \u2013 the pair showed Thursday that they will continue to grapple on the issue. As the two squabbled, Christie slammed Paul for simply \u201cblowing hot air\u201d from the comfort of a Senate subcommittee. Paul fired back at Christie over his hugging of Obama right before the 2012 election. But Christie had the last word. \u201cSenator Paul, you know the hugs I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th,\u201d Christie said. It\u2019s a sign that Christie will continue to be Paul\u2019s foil on the campaign trail as the libertarian-leaning senator\u2019s unorthodox national security and foreign policy positions continue to clash with the GOP mold. For a guy who barely squeaked his way onto the debate stage, John Kasich\u2019s main goal was to get his name out \u2013 and his home state helped him meet and exceed his goal. Playing off a home-court advantage, Kasich deftly handled questions on the attacks Democrats would lob at him and took a pass on attacking Trump. And he did so with authenticity and while pivoting to his credentials as a budget hawk and his foreign policy resume. Kasich insisted that Trump is \u201chitting a nerve in this country.\u201d \u201cPeople are frustrated, they\u2019re fed up,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cFor people to just tune them out is a mistake.\u201d Bush started off his week stumbling in New Hampshire, pushed toward the debate with a major gaffe on women\u2019s health care and teed off the debate Thursday stumbling through his answers yet again. Bush \u2013 who has been out of the political glare for nearly a decade \u2013 appeared out of practice when fielding the first questions in the debate Thursday. But he got stronger as the night went on, and began hitting his stride after he was asked about his pledge to bring 4% economic growth to the country and as he defended his work for a Michael Bloomberg nonprofit that gave money to Planned Parenthood. However, Bush certainly didn\u2019t prove himself as the unequivocal frontrunner that many in the Republican establishment once believed him to be, as other candidates like Kasich and Rubio proved their top-tier status as well. RNC Chairman: 'The whole country is looking at us' Walker, who has consistently placed in second or third place in recent polls, didn\u2019t come away with a big moment from the debate. He stayed on message and delivered concise responses to the questions he was asked, but his responses were drab and he didn\u2019t break out from the rest of the field. Aside from Paul, the rest of the candidates largely avoided attacking Trump \u2013 several actually asked him for political donations in a light-hearted moment early on. Instead, it was the second rung of candidates who debated at 5 p.m. who took swings at Trump while he was absent. From former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, several of the so-called \u201chappy hour debate\u201d candidates swung at Trump for his policy positions and his association with the Clintons. GOP takes on Donald Trump While the prime-time debate didn\u2019t reveal any winners, Fiorina came away from the earlier debate as the clear victor, generating chatter on social media and buzz among political pundits. She came away as the clear winner of that debate, stealing the spotlight from the six other lower-tier candidates with jabs at everyone from Trump to Bush and, of course, Hillary Clinton.

            "article_content": "Trump: 'I've been challenged by so many people and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness' The challenge for Republicans was to step out of Trump's shadow There were 17 Republican candidates here tonight, but the first GOP presidential debate of the 2016 season overwhelmingly revolved around one man: Donald Trump. The billionaire real estate mogul delivered an unforgettably explosive performance Thursday night. He repeatedly attacked his rivals on stage, jousted with the moderators, drew jeers and laughter from the audience with his typically colorful language and, true to form, refused to apologize for anything. The nine candidates flanking Trump at the prime-time debate appeared emboldened at times by Trump\u2019s bluster and, at other moments, amused by the conduct of the GOP\u2019s current frontrunner. Meanwhile, the three moderators faced a difficult task: no matter how hard they tried to corner Trump on his inconsistencies and vulnerabilities, the businessman never gave an inch. The challenge for all of Trump\u2019s competition during the two-hour debate hosted by Fox News was to step out of Trump\u2019s shadow. The stakes were particularly high for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has been trailing Trump in the national polls and has suffered a series of missteps in recent weeks. Bush had an even performance, giving solid answers on his weak spots: immigration and Common Core. READ: Fox moderators get applause for tough debate questions Candidates like Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker accomplished an important feat for first-time, mid-tier candidates: they stayed clear of any major blunders. Others lower down on the totem poll who barely made the cut to participate in the 9 p.m. debate, like Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, injected fresh energy into their stalled campaigns. Kasich in particular had a strong debate, drawing an enthusiastic welcome from his home-state audience. The high-drama began Thursday within the very first moments of the debate. Trump drew audible boos from the stadium when he declined to rule out a third-party presidential run \u2013 a move that could seriously complicate the GOP\u2019s bid for the White House. \u201cI mean, this is what\u2019s wrong. He buys and sells politicians of all stripes. He\u2019s already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK?\u201d Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul cut in. Trump responded by chastising the country for being too \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been challenged by so many people and I don\u2019t frankly have time for total political correctness,\u201d Trump quipped. Moderator Megyn Kelly challenged Trump on some of his past comments about women. \u201cYou call women you don\u2019t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,\u201d she said. Trump quickly responded: \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell,\u201d sparking laughter from the audience. CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates Immigration loomed large at the debate \u2013 an issue that Trump claimed full credit for bringing to the nation\u2019s attention. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, you wouldn\u2019t be even talking about illegal immigration, Chris,\u201d Trump said to Fox host Chris Wallace. \u201cThis was not a subject that was on anyone\u2019s mind until I brought it up at my announcement.\u201d Bush, addressed the issue by stressing that he did not support \u201camnesty.\u201d \u201cWe need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic that people are dying because of the fact that local governments are not following the law.\u201d Bush\u2019s stance on what to do about the millions of undocumented immigrants in the country has dogged him, but his answer Thursday seemed to pass muster with the audience. Trump was smack in the center of the debate lineup. The lower tier of presidential contenders had their brief moment in the sun earlier Thursday at a separate debate in which Carly Fiorina delivered a memorable and polished performance. But the prime-time debate was easily the main attraction, and served as a particularly high-stakes moment for Trump. His early dominance has both stunned \u2013 and aggravated \u2013 members of his own party. National Republican leaders have at times seemed unsure of what to make of the fact that such a no-filter politician with no obligations to the party could unexpectedly become the GOP\u2019s standard-bearer. Jeb Bush stumbles into debate night The open contempt for Trump was on full display starting with the 5 p.m. debate. Lesser-known contenders including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Fiorina slammed Trump, blasting the celebrity New Yorker\u2019s conservative credentials and friendly relationship with Hillary and Bill Clinton. Who's running for President? \u201cI talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who is using his celebrity rather than his conservatism,\u201d said Perry, who has positioned himself as one of Trump\u2019s biggest antagonists on the trail. \u201cHow can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single-payer health care?\u201d For his part, Trump found plenty of openings to mock his rivals. When asked to address some of his businesses that went bankrupt, Trump pivoted to the financial woes of New Jersey \u2013 a clear swipe at New Jersey Gov. Christie. \u201cI had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesars just went bankrupt,\u201d Trump said, then gestured to Christie: \u201cChris can tell you.\u201d Later in the debate, Bush cautioned that Trump\u2019s \u201cdivisive\u201d language could be detrimental to the Republican Party. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message,\u201d he said. READ: Carly Fiorina shines in first GOP debate A Bloomberg survey released Tuesday had Trump at 21%, handing him a double-digit lead over both Bush, who was at 10%, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who was at 8%. The other candidates on the prime-time debate stage were Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson. It wasn\u2019t only Trump who had tense exchanges with his rivals. At one point, Christie and Paul tumbled over the issue of data collection after Paul said he was proud to stand for the Bill of Rights. \u201cMegyn, that\u2019s a completely ridiculous answer,\u201d Christie snapped. \u201cI want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people. How are you supposed to know?\u201d \u201cYou get a warrant!\u201d Paul responded. Photos: Political families Christie shot back: \u201cYou know, when you\u2019re sitting in a subcommittee just blowing hot air, you can say things like this.\u201d When Paul criticized Christie for hugging President Barack Obama several years ago, Christie went for the jugular: \u201cSenator Paul, you know, the hugs I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th.\u201d Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton was another frequent target at both debates. Describing her as \u201csecretive\u201d and \u201cnot trustworthy,\u201d candidates at the earlier event slammed her on issues ranging from foreign policy to her use of a private email server at the State Department. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham also took a more personal shot at Clinton, criticizing her now-infamous comments that she and Bill were \u201cdead broke\u201d after leaving the White House. \u201cI know the difference between flat broke \u2013 apparently she doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary, I\u2019ll show you flat broke. That\u2019s not it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bush's comments on family, Planned Parenthood raise concerns about his campaign Aides say Bush is keeping the long view After stumbling this week, Jeb Bush heads into Thursday\u2019s debate facing a key question: Is he ready to run for president in an era when every gaffe can go viral? Bush\u2019s latest challenge came Tuesday when the former Florida governor attempted to slam Planned Parenthood. But he appeared to veer off track when he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women\u2019s health issues,\u201d referring to the amount of money the federal government pays largely for low-income women\u2019s health services. Bush later said he \u201cmisspoke,\u201d but the line gave an easy opening to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, who immediately pounced to portray him as insensitive to the needs of women. CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates The fumble followed an uncomfortable moment Monday at a forum in New Hampshire when Bush struggled to answer a question about his family\u2019s political legacy \u2013 an issue that has repeatedly tripped him up during his campaign. Six things to watch at Thursday\u2019s GOP debate Jeb Bush's life Bush allies argue that these moments amount to blips that will soon be forgotten and say that by staying the course, he\u2019s showing an even-handed steadiness that could help him secure the nomination. Still, the incidents underscore how Bush, the powerhouse politician who was once thought to be the man who could clear the GOP presidential field, is struggling to find his footing in a race that\u2019s been upended by Donald Trump\u2019s surge in the polls. Perhaps more importantly, the missteps raise questions about whether Bush is ready to wage the type of disciplined, savvy campaign required in the modern political era to win the White House. \u201cIt speaks to the changes in campaigns since the last time he ran for office. It used to be you make a comment like that; by evening you put out your statement, and the statement ends up in the same story. That whole thing on women\u2019s health issues swept around the world before the campaign retracted it,\u201d said Katie Packer, a former adviser to Mitt Romney who specializes in helping candidates hone their message to Republican and independent women. \u201cThe speed at which things travel is probably new to him. You learn that when you\u2019re running, especially in the presidential cycle. All of this serves to make him look a little out of touch.\u201d Packer is neutral in the race but she is founding partner of WWP Strategies, which works for GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio in Michigan. When a candidate stumbles the first time, as Bush did earlier this year when pressed on his brother\u2019s invasion of Iraq, Packer said, some voters gauging his electability might have given him a pass \u2013 thinking he simply wasn\u2019t prepared for that particular question. \u201cBut if they keep not getting these answers sharp; it starts to look like you\u2019re just not sharp\u201d as a candidate, she said. While Packer said Bush won\u2019t ever be able to \u201ctotally clean that (Planned Parenthood comment) up, he\u2019s going to have to come out very strongly in advocating what his position is on women\u2019s health and what the federal government\u2019s role is in that.\u201d Some of the candidate\u2019s close allies are concerned that he has a tendency to come off as dismissive, particularly in group forums where he doesn\u2019t like the question. They hope he can keep that sort of demeanor in check, as it generally does not go over well with voters. On the policy front, he has been preparing intensively for weeks \u2013 working to get his complex policy positions boiled down into 30 second and 60 second bites. Still, many allies said he\u2019s simply playing the long game. Who's running for President? \u201cPresidential politics isn\u2019t very different from professional football \u2013 quarterbacks are going to throw interceptions, and sometimes those interceptions might fall at the feet of the quarterback. And Jeb Bush just threw one,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who advised George W. Bush and John McCain. \u201cHe has to understand the demographic challenges facing the Republican Party and little things like that make it difficult to win the game.\u201d \u201cThat being said, the proportionality of the reporting on this issue is completely overblown,\u201d Schmidt added. Bush has done all the right things, advisers said, by standing up to his critics on difficult issues such as immigration and the Common Core education standards and paying attention to the arcane but vital elements of a winning campaign \u2013 such as ensuring ballot access. Bush and Christie vow to double economic growth Bush has made countless phone calls to activists and influencers in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada \u2014 while simultaneously building his support slowly and steadily with a tireless campaign schedule. And then there\u2019s his treasury: the fact that he stockpiled more than $100 million through his campaign and pro-Bush political action committees that will allow him to stay in the race long after other candidates run out of money. Ultimately, he\u2019s embracing his image as the boring candidate and eschewing the theatrics of his fellow Republicans, who have done everything from taking a chainsaw to the tax code to putting their cell phone in a blender to get attention. Longtime Bush-watchers such as Susan MacManus, political science professor at the University of South Florida, said the former Florida governor should not be underestimated. \u201cHe is not a \u2018for-the-moment\u2019 person; he is more calculating and always looking long term,\u201d MacManus said. \u201cHe is trying to be the statesman and anticipating that Trump will wear thin. He\u2019s just really trying to stay the course right now, which compared to the others, he\u2019s doing pretty well with.\u201d Voters \u201care not really honed in right now and making decisions,\u201d MacManus said. \u201cPeople in Florida,\u201d for example, \u201cdon\u2019t care a whit about politics right now.\u201d Because of that, many longtime political observers say there is an advantage for Bush, and other strong candidates such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Veteran strategist Charlie Black said Bush\u2019s position is a comfortable place to be right now because \u201cthe race hasn\u2019t really started. It starts with these debates.\u201d For all of Bush\u2019s discipline and his mastery of the issues, he has yet to show he can channel the seething anger among Republicans like Trump. Jeb Bush: \u2018Bill Clinton is not my step-brother, OK?\u2019 Photos: Political families But from Bush\u2019s perspective, \u201cif you look at infrastructure, organization and money \u2013 he\u2019s the front-runner. And he\u2019s got a lot of appeal as people get to know him,\u201d which is the opportunity that the debates could offer, Black said. \u201cI think he\u2019s the best campaigner in the family; he\u2019s completely knowledgeable about policy and he can answer questions without hesitation, and personality-wise, he\u2019s just a little more engaging and smooth than his brother or his father. By contrast, Black predicted that the debates will be the arena where Trump begins to fade \u201cas voters learn more about his positions and lack thereof.\u201d \u201cMy guess is that Trump will play it straight here, abide by the rules, but he\u2019ll still be bombastic and not get into details,\u201d Black said, \u201cand if he does that for four straight debates, by then, people will figure him out.\u201d For Bush, the onus Thursday night will be to show voters that he is the calm, steady hand \u2013 the one, as Hillary Clinton might put it, who you wanted answering the phone at 3 a.m. in the middle of a world crisis. Longtime Democratic strategist Bill Carrick said even with all the anger festering in the Republican Party right now, that group of voters is not quite big enough to ensure victory. The quieter, more statesman-like candidates are ultimately due for a serious look from voters, he said. \u201cIn these multi-candidate debates early on, there is something to be said for staying out of traffic: because, you know, a lot of accidents happen in traffic,\u201d Carrick said. The silver lining for more understated candidates such as Bush, Carrick said, is that Trump\u2019s presence will ensure a blockbuster audience for this week\u2019s debates \u2013 including the independents and moderate Democrats that Bush would like to appeal to in order to ensure his path to the nomination. While Trump may entertain, Carrick said:  \u201cThere is a point at which people start looking for a president. And Republicans want to win.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump loves the spotlight and the camera. But when he takes center stage Thursday night, it won\u2019t be as the star of a reality TV show \u2013 it will be as the Republican Party\u2019s front-runner presidential candidate. Trump and nine of his GOP rivals will battle it out in the 2016 cycle\u2019s inaugural GOP primary debate, hosted by Fox News in Cleveland. The stakes are high, as each participant clamors to stand out from a nearly unprecedented pack of 17 declared GOP candidates. But the pressure is perhaps the greatest for Trump, whose coveted position center stage on Thursday marks his remarkable rise to the top of the national polls. With an unorthodox campaign style and at times inflammatory remarks, the real estate magnate has dominated the early 2016 media coverage and upended the GOP primary. Trump\u2019s performance will dominate the headlines, but h ere are six things to watch heading into debate night: Fourteen GOP candidates got a taste of what\u2019s to come on the debate stage during a forum in New Hampshire on Tuesday night. And it did not bode well for Jeb Bush. As he addressed a range of issues from education policy to the threat of ISIS, the former Florida governor appeared visibly nervous and flustered, more than once tripping over his words. The most uncomfortable moment came during Bush\u2019s last few minutes in the chair, when he was asked about the two ex-presidents in his family. \u201cMy dad is probably the most perfect man alive so it\u2019s pretty hard for me to be critical of him,\u201d Bush began. Then: \u201cIn fact I got a T-shirt that says, uh, at the Jeb swag store, that says, I\u2019m the, uh, I\u2019m, I\u2019m the, \u2018My dad\u2019s the great man alive. If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll take you outside.\u201d Beltway reporters and pundits expressed a mix of surprise and dismay at Bush\u2019s fumbled performance, particularly given his earlier struggles to discuss issues related to his family. It also revived fresh questions about whether Bush, who left the governor\u2019s office in 2007, has been out of practice for too long. He ran into trouble again on Wednesday when, during a riff against Planned Parenthood, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women\u2019s health issues.\u201d Hillary Clinton, the presumed Democratic presidential front-runner, hit back hard over Twitter and Bush later walked back his statement, saying he \u201cmisspoke.\u201d \u201cI was referring to the hard-to-fathom $500 million in federal funding that goes to Planned Parenthood \u2013 an organization that was callously participating in the unthinkable practice of selling fetal organs,\u201d he said. A solid performance on Thursday is particularly critical for Bush as he attempts to maintain his second-place standing in national polls. Opinion: If Bush wants to win, he should play chess Here\u2019s the near universal challenge for the GOP candidates whose last name isn\u2019t Trump: How to stand out? All of the Republican candidates with the exception of Bush and Scott Walker, who have broken into double digits in some recent polls, have struggled to catapult out of the very crowded middle-tier pack. A stellar debate performance this week \u2013 along with some favorable headlines \u2013 could be the boost some contenders need to catch up to their top-tier rivals. Who's running for President? The candidates on stage Thursday night whose poll numbers have been around the low- to mid-single digits include New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Former GOP presidential candidate and Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said the the first debate is a ripe opportunity for the governors on stage to make a splash. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for problem solvers, we\u2019re looking for solutions to the basics like jobs and a balanced budget and entitlements,\u201d Huntsman said on CNN Tuesday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s clearly an area where a governor can really differentiate himself from the rest of the pack.\u201d Kasich, in particular, is an interesting candidate to watch. He launched his campaign mid-July and his poll numbers ticked up recently, giving a last-minute boost to qualify him for the first debate. Kasich\u2019s allies view his record of fiscal conservatism as key to appealing to a broader electorate. GOP 2016ers ponder how to debate a wild card like Trump The earlier debate will include Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Carly Fiorina, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki and Jim Gilmore. This smaller group is at the very bottom of the polls for now. While the late-afternoon event will draw a much smaller audience than its prime-time counterpart, it will nevertheless show early signs of who in the group has the potential to shine later in the cycle. \u201cThe people in the five o\u2019clock debate should go into that debate with the idea that if they have the right performance, the next time around, they\u2019re going to be in the 9 o\u2019clock debate,\u201d Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and Republican presidential candidate, told CNN. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll have several people in the 9 o\u2019clock debate collapsing as serious candidates in the next few months. Both are true.\u201d Opinion: If you didn\u2019t make the cut for debate, forget about being president Three Fox News anchors will guide the candidates through two hours of grilling on Thursday night: Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace. It will be the role of those moderators to facilitate a fair and engaging discussion. A few things to keep an eye out for: \u2013 Three moderators, different styles? Baier, Kelly and Wallace each host a show on Fox and have varying interviewing styles. Will one emerge as the good cop, and another as the bad cop? \u2013 Who gets the toughest treatment? The moderators will push for details and clarity and call out obvious contradictions. Pushing a candidate extra hard in one policy area \u2013 Trump on immigration or Bush on Common Core, for example \u2013 could be a telling sign of those candidates\u2019 perceived vulnerabilities. \u2013 Do the moderators strictly enforce the timer? Every second at the debate is precious, and it\u2019s incumbent on the moderators to keep everyone in line. More time means more opportunities for a candidate to promote their platform  and go after a rival candidate. Expect to hear plenty of Clinton-bashing. The ultimate prize for the GOP candidates is not only to clinch the party\u2019s nomination, but to one day face off against the former secretary of state in a general election \u2013 and defeat her. The appeal that each of the Republican candidates has to make to voters, in other words, is not only that they\u2019re the best within the GOP field, but that they\u2019re also the best option for beating Clinton. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing. In order to beat Hillary Clinton, or whoever their nominee turns out to be, we have to have a nominee on our side who is going to throw every punch because this is a fight,\u201d Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who will participate in the 5 p.m. debate, said earlier this week in New Hampshire. There\u2019s a long list of grievances from which to choose. Clinton has been dogged by a series of scandals and accusations, ranging from the her use of a personal email server at the State Department to her handling of a deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, to the massive personal wealth that she and her husband, Bill Clinton, have amassed since he left the White House. Scott Walker unveils his Trump debate plan It was one of the most memorable gaffes of the 2012 election and a moment that all of the candidates on stage Thursday will try to avoid. At a GOP primary debate hosted by CNBC in November 2011, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry vowed to shutter three government agencies as president. But after naming the Commerce Department and Education Department, Perry lapsed into a momentary brain freeze. For an agonizing 45 seconds, Perry struggled in search of the third agency. Pressed by the moderator, Perry finally conceded: \u201cI can\u2019t. Oops.\u201d It\u2019s not that one gaffe could single-handedly tank someone\u2019s candidacy. But a bad stumble, particularly in the age of ubiquitous YouTube videos, Vines and GIFs, could follow a candidate around for months and make it frustratingly difficult for them to refocus. \u201cThere were a couple of debates where after the debate, you just knew that the candidate wasn\u2019t going to be there anymore,\u201d said Gingrich. \u201cI always tell people: the thing about the debate is not that you may win, but that you may lose.\u201d CNN Interactive: Who is in, who is out",

            "article_content": "The Republican field largely stuck to the script in Monday night's forum in New Hampshire. Candidates tried to position themselves as best able to take on Hillary Clinton One by one, they crossed the stage to sit for a round of what amounted to presidential speed dating. The rapid-fire format of Monday\u2019s Voters First Forum at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire left more than a dozen Republican presidential contenders awkwardly stumbling through questions on everything from immigration reform to the battle against ISIS. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush struggled to respond to questions about how he would differentiate himself from his father and brother \u2013 an issue that has daunted much of his campaign. \u201cMy dad is probably the most perfect man alive, so it\u2019s very hard for me to be critical of him,\u201d Bush said, with a hint of snark. \u201cIn fact, I got a T-Shirt at the, ah, Jeb swag store that says, ah, um, \u2018My dad\u2019s the greatest man alive. If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll take you outside.\u2019\u201d The forum provided a hint of what to expect during the GOP\u2019s first official debate of the election season on Friday night as candidates hedged their answers and sidestepped tough questions. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is unlikely to appear on stage during Fox\u2019s primetime debate, drew the most laughs during the pretty tame two-hour forum when he argued he best knew how to fight \u201cClinton-speak\u201d. He equated former President Bill Clinton\u2019s promise that he never had sex with Monica Lewinsky to Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s promises that she would explain her position on the Keystone XL pipeline if elected president. \u201cI\u2019m fluent in Clinton-speak,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand this crowd and I can beat them.\u201d Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is seeking the support of oil billionaires Charles and David Koch, sidestepped a question about whether he believed in climate change, saying instead that he supports balancing the economy with the environment. The biggest wild card of the 2016 primary battle, Donald Trump, was a glaring absence from the stage. He blamed a blistering editorial from the New Hampshire Union Leader condemning his candidacy as the reason he skipped the forum. Also skipping the forum were former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore. Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio participated remotely because of a late Senate vote to defund Planned Parenthood, but Graham attended in person. CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry claimed that Texas created one-third of the jobs in the United States while he was governor. He also argued that he was best prepared to protect the border. \u201cIt\u2019s like a serious wound you want to staunch the flow, that\u2019s not what happening in this country right now,\u201d Perry said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich argued that he was best positioned to handle the nation\u2019s fiscal woes. \u201cIt\u2019s about record and accomplishment. I was there, I spent 10 years of my life balancing the budget,\u201d said Kasich, who was House budget chairman last time the federal government sported a surplus. \u201cWhen people balance their budget, so should the government.\u201d Graham positioned himself as the security hawk in the field, but got a few laughs when he said he was best able to handle the Clintons. He said he understood \u201cClinton-speak\u201d and tied former President Bill Clinton\u2019s denial of having sex with Monica Lewinsky to Hillary Clinton\u2019s promises to explain what she would do with the Keystone XL pipeline. \u201cI understand this crowd and I can beat them,\u201d Graham said. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the War on Drugs a \u201cfailure\u201d and argued that his compassionate policies as governor proved successful. \u201cThis is a disease, the War on Drugs, has been a failure, well-intentioned, but a failure,\u201d he said. Christie said that nonviolent offenders should have sentences reduced and more treatment must be made available, in face of the growing heroin epidemic. Bush said that he would limit the number of legal immigrants allowed in the U.S. to spouses and children and would exclude adult siblings and older parents. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said that Clinton \u201clied\u201d about Benghazi and her emails and that it spoke to the \u201cvery core of her character.\u201d Fiorina added that the eventual GOP nominee must be ready to throw every punch at Clinton. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, in order to beat Hillary Clinton, or whoever their nominee turns out to be, we have to have a nominee on our side who is going to throw every punch because this is a fight,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fight for the future of this nation, it\u2019s a fight for the character of this nation and, unfortunately, we know that sometimes the right questions don\u2019t get asked in a presidential debate.\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a former House member, said he would seek term limits, to curb the \u201cpermanent political class\u201d in Washington. Jindal, who was elected twice to Congress, said he would pay lawmakers to stay outside D.C. while they served. \u201cI\u2019d pay them every time they stay outside D.C., rather than in D.C.,\u201d he said. Walker said as president he would send more power from the federal government back to the states. \u201cI think a big part of reform is taking big parts of the federal government \u2026 and take them from Washington and send them back to the states,\u201d Walker said. Paul, speaking remotely from Washington after a vote on Planned Parenthood, said he would address student debt by expanding the amount that people can deduct on their taxes. \u201cEssentially your college is a working expense,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThis makes more sense than the president who says, \u2018Hey, this is going to be free.\u2019\u201d Paul also defended his push to limit government data collection, criticizing their mishandling of information on attacks like the Boston Marathon bombing. \u201cI think we can catch terrorists if we get more information on terrorists \u2026 The information we\u2019re capturing indiscriminately on all Americans hasn\u2019t captured any terrorist.\u201d Cruz said he is being attacked by the \u201cWashington Cartel\u201d for criticizing them. \u201c(The cartel) is career politicians in both parties who get in bed with lobbyists, they get in bed with special interests and they grow and grow government,\u201d Cruz said. Rubio said he would consider approving medical marijuana, but ruled out legalizing marijuana outright. \u201cAs long as it truly is for medicinal purposes, that\u2019s something I\u2019m willing to explore,\u201d he said. Rubio also tried to address conservative criticism lobbed his way for his attempt to pass bipartisan immigration reform in 2013.",

            "article_content": "Koch brothers held a retreat for GOP donors in California this weekend Charles Koch: 'We must be true to it ourselves in our own activities and our own communities\" Donald Trump wasn\u2019t invited to address some 450 top conservative donors who gathered here at a lush oceanfront hotel for a policy-focused retreat hosted by the Koch brothers and their powerful political network. So the real estate magnate turned to Twitter on Sunday to mock rivals \u2013 former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Hewlett Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina \u2013 who were given entr\u00e9e to potential backers at the luxurious gathering. \u201cI wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday. \u201cPuppets?\u201d I wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers. Puppets? With that provocative two-pronged jab \u2013 charging the billionaire industrialist brothers with attempting to buy influence, while attacking the integrity of the five candidates favored by the Kochs \u2013 Trump may be asking for a fight. While the billionaire businessman likes to boast that he doesn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s money to fund his presidential ambitions, there are few independent organizations on the GOP side with political muscle to winnow the field \u2013 and potentially knock Trump from his perch \u2013 like the Koch-backed network. READ: What would a Donald Trump administration look like? The Koch\u2019s deep-pocketed political organization plans to spend $889 million by the end of 2016 to drive its free-market policy and philanthropic agenda, as well as direct electoral support to the candidates of its choosing. Exactly how that money will be spent was part of the agenda here this weekend. And for the first time, some sessions at the private gathering were open to reporters, as long as they agreed not to identify donors without their permission. The attendees were not permitted to take electronic devices into the strategy sessions; cell phones were collected at the door. Throughout the weekend, Koch network leaders briefed some 450 donors, who pledge six-figure sums to become members of the Freedom Partners organization, on their policy and philanthropic goals for the 2016 cycle. Many of the discussions were heavy on policy issues. A Sunday afternoon session, for example, attended by several hundred attendees focused on legislation that would limit mandatory minimum sentencing, as well as other forms of criminal justice reform. At an evening reception, the featured speaker was Dr. Michael Lomax, president of the United Negro College Fund. At this Koch network session and others this year, organizers said they will be seeking input from members to determine how the organization will spend its money and which candidates the Koch-funded groups will support in the 2016 cycle. Even in an election cycle awash in cash, those resources could be pivotal. The Freedom Partners Action Fund, the super PAC tied to the Koch organization\u2019s umbrella group, plans to spend $100 million this election cycle. Beyond the airwaves, the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity has spent the last few election cycles mining voter data and building a grassroots army that could help steer voters in the direction of one or several presidential candidates favored by the Koch network. Americans for Prosperity plans to spend at least $75 million this year continuing to build out those activities; and double that amount to $150 million next year. Already the Koch network is giving the top five candidates identified by Charles Koch as the favorites \u2013 Cruz, Walker, Rubio, Bush and Paul \u2013 a platform to share their ideas at well-lighted, well-attended events in early primary states like New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. READ: Charles Koch calls for unity against \u2018corporate welfare\u2019 Though the candidates could not explicitly ask for money at this weekend\u2019s gathering because it was hosted by the Freedom Partners non-profit, it gave them the chance for intimate chats about their policy goals and experience with potential backers. The Koch brothers have indicated that they are unlikely to settle on one Republican candidate when they are looking at what they view as a strong field of candidates aligned with their policy goals. In an interview with USA Today in April, Charles Koch said Bush, Rubio, Cruz, Rand Paul and Walker were \u201cthe ones we have talked to the most and who seem to be the possible leaders.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019ve told them all is that right now, we\u2019re not supporting anyone,\u201d Koch told USA Today. \u201cWe\u2019re telling them that if they want our support, one way to get it is articulating a good message to help Americans get a better understand and a better appreciation of how certain policies will benefit them and will benefit all America. At the top of that agenda, Koch told attendees this weekend, is convincing elected officials to phase out \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d in the form of subsidies, regulations \u201ctrapping people in poverty,\u201d as well as mandates and preferences for businesses \u201cthat enrich the haves at the expense of the have nots.\u201d READ: Trump \u2018not looking to attack\u2019 in debate, open to waterboarding \u201cThis is an inspiring vision,\u201d Koch told the group, \u201cbut to advance it, we must learn to be much more effective in articulating it and we must be true to it ourselves in our own activities and our own communities.\u201d \u201cWe talk here about dollars and raising money and they are absolutely critical to getting this done,\u201d Koch said. \u201cBut they alone will not do the job. We know this from the successful movements in our country\u2019s history. It took the full commitment from the founding fathers, Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the thousands of others who led successful movements. To defy the odds stacked against them, these leaders had to pledge their lives, fortunes and their sacred honor \u2013 often at great personal sacrifice.\u201d \u201cThat is the challenge before is. Will we rise to it? We\u2019re off to a good start,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you will join me. Our country\u2019s future depends on it.\u201d Though Democrats have spent tens of millions of dollars seeking to vilify the Kochs and their agenda \u2013 portraying them as wealthy industrialists who have put the disadvantaged at risk to help their bottom line, the candidates who came here to woo donors this weekend did not show any hesitation in seeking their favor. For the most part, they also ignored the needling by Donald Trump. Walker, who was aided by Koch allied groups in his fight against big labor in Wisconsin, said Saturday that he wished \u201cthe whole world could see what goes on here\u201d at the Koch network gatherings. \u201cI point out, time and time again, so many of you here aren\u2019t here because of any interests on behalf of your personal finances or your industries, you\u2019re here because you love America,\u201d Walker said, comparing frustrations of some Koch network donors to those he has heard from tea party supporters. \u201cYou care deeply about the future, you care about your children and your grandchildren, and I think David and Charles (Koch) have harnessed that frustration and said \u2014 instead of just being angry about it, let\u2019s do something about it.\u201d Bush, who received a very warm reception from Koch network donors during his session Sunday night, said he was honored to take part in the forum. He spoke freely about his plans for immigration reform and highlighted his record of cutting taxes in Florida. Bush also unabashedly owned the characterization of him as the \u201c$120 million man\u201d \u2013 a reference to the amount raised so far by his campaign and political action committees supporting his bid. \u201cHow much is too much?\u201d he was asked. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know, but you might as well frontload it if you can,\u201d Bush said unapologetically to laughter. \u201cThis is a long haul. Are we just supposed to say, \u2018Ok, let\u2019s just kind of warm up and work your way into it? Am I missing something here? I\u2019m not running to come in third. I\u2019m not running to, you know, have it on my resume that I ran for President.\u201d The point of his effort, he said, \u201cis to run with purpose, run with heart, run in a way that draws people toward our cause \u2013 and money helps,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI\u2019m playing by the rules of the game the way it\u2019s laid out. And if people don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s just tough,\u201d he said. All of the candidates dealt gingerly with Trump when asked to explain his position at the top of the polls in recent weeks. With Trump\u2019s appearance on the debate stage looming this week, Cruz used humor to defuse a question about how Trump would play in the debate. \u201cI have a lot of skills, but predicting Donald Trump is not one of them,\u201d Cruz said to laughter.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is reversing many positions he held before running for president Campaign isn't offering many policy specifics The frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination is a former pro-choice Democrat who once supported Canadian-style universal health care, tax hikes on the wealthy and said Hillary Clinton was \u201cterrific.\u201d As he prepares for the first GOP debate of the election season next week, Donald Trump is disavowing many of his former positions and earning support from about one in every five Republicans through a combination of blustering rhetoric and dogged condemnation of the political class. Now, the question is whether Trump\u2019s lead will hold up against the gust of attacks \u2013 and charges of hypocrisy \u2013 he is likely to face from his GOP foes during Thursday\u2019s debate. That threat hasn\u2019t compelled him, however, to detail his policy platforms. Donald Trump's empire Trump continues to describe his policies in broad strokes: A wall on the southern border that Mexico will be forced to pay for, or a \u201cterrific\u201d alternative to Obamacare and \u201cthe finest\u201d health care for veterans. And there\u2019s Trump\u2019s plan to deport all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants and then allow \u201cthe good ones\u201d to return and gain \u201clegal status\u201d through an \u201cexpedited process.\u201d When pressed for details on how he\u2019ll find those individuals, Trump told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, \u201cPoliticians aren\u2019t going to find them because they have no clue. We\u2019ll find them.\u201d His campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, had nothing to add. \u201cOur immigration plan is very comprehensive. It\u2019s available to us and when we\u2019re ready to release that to the media, you\u2019ll get a copy,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it on our time frame, not on the media\u2019s time frame.\u201d Still, it appears Trump is still fleshing out his immigration platform. When asked this week whether he would also force undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to leave the country before gaining legal status, Trump pursed his lips and looked up in thought. \u201cThey\u2019re with their parents, it depends,\u201d he said before pausing abruptly. \u201cBut look, it sounds cold and it sounds hard. We have a country and our country is going to hell.\u201d Donald Trump: Crimea is Europe\u2019s problem Lewandowski insists that the campaign, entering its seventh week, is still in the early stages and while Trump\u2019s policy proposals may be light on the specifics, Trump is the only candidate who\u2019s brought them to the forefront. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Donald Trump, none of these issues would have been addressed,\u201d Lewandowski said, pointing to immigration and other issues the billionaire businessman has brought national attention to. Donald Trump in the public eye If those issues come up Thursday night during the first Republican primary debate, Trump will have to confront his flip-flops and lack of specifics all at once. Republican strategist Rick Wilson believes Trump is \u201ctricking conservatives\u201d with his brash talk, but said the debate could mark the start of voters realizing that Trump is not a true conservative. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing there. There\u2019s no there there. There is no Donald Trump policy,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show that this is not really a guy who has thought deeply about big issues.\u201d Trump may come face to face with his own words, such as when he wrote in his 2000 book \u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d that \u201cwe must have universal health care.\u201d Trump told CNN on Wednesday that \u201cat the time we were having not the kind of difficulty that we\u2019re having now with Obamacare.\u201d But now, he is vowing to \u201crepeal (Obamacare) and replace with something terrific,\u201d explaining that  \u201cthe answer is going to be we have to knock down the borders and let people compete.\u201d He also said he wants \u201cto try to help\u201d lower-income people who get sick, describing a vague system that sounds similar to Medicaid. Lewandowski declined to explain Trump\u2019s proposal or how it would be different from Medicaid. Health care is one of a number of issues Trump has changed his views on over the years. While he used to endorse abortion rights, he told CNN he changed his position to anti-abortion after a friend decided not to go through with an abortion and \u201ctheir child is like this magnificent person.\u201d Trump still supports exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Donald Trump: His own words He has also hardened his position on guns as he dives into the Republican primary. After slamming Republicans in 2000 for walking \u201cthe NRA line\u201d and refusing any restrictions, Trump now refers to the Second Amendment as \u201ca bedrock natural right\u201d and touted \u201cthe great work the NRA does\u201d in an interview with AmmoLand this month. And he now opposes expanding background checks and suggested reexamining existing laws because they \u201cmake it more difficult for law abiding citizens\u201d to get a gun. Donald Trump\u2019s Achilles heel Trump could also face questions about the one-time 14.25% tax increase on the wealthy he proposed in the 2000 book, arguing \u201cit is only reasonable to shift the burden to those most able to pay.\u201d It\u2019s that proposal and Trump\u2019s inconsistent support for conservative economic policies that has earned Trump the ire of the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group that focuses on economic policy. \u201cI\u2019d love to see them press him for specifics,\u201d Club for Growth President David McIntosh said of the moderators and other contenders who will face off against Trump next week. \u201cIt would quickly become apparent there aren\u2019t specifics there.\u201d The group has been of Trump\u2019s most vocal critics on the right. When he jumped in the race, the group dismissed his candidacy and said he should be excluded from the GOP debates. Trump fired back by releasing a letter Club for Growth had recently sent him requesting a $1 million donation for the group. \u201cHe\u2019s not a conservative and barely a Republican,\u201d McIntosh said. Robert Kiger, who runs a pro-Trump super PAC, said questions about Trump\u2019s flip-flops are \u201clegitimate\u201d but said he\u2019s confident Trump will \u201cgive a fantastic answer.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody cares whether or not he changed his mind from 10 years ago, whatever the time frame might be,\u201d Kiger said. \u201cI think Americans \u2013 what\u2019s resonating with the American people is that he\u2019s really authentic and whether or not he changed his mind five years ago on a very specific issue is not going to matter to them one thin bit.\u201d Trump has won over voters with blunt talk and promises that he won\u2019t be like traditional politicians who say one thing to get elected then do another when they arrive in Washington. \u201cIn fact, his topsy-turvy back and forth on all these important issues tells me he\u2019d be exactly that way,\u201d McIntosh added. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Lewandowski, insists that Trump isn\u2019t the only one to have changed his tune on certain issues and pointed in particular to Clinton\u2019s reversal on supporting the Iraq War and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s shift on Common Core. But to confront his own reversals, Trump may need to delve into specifics to convince some that the is truly committed to his latest, conservative position. \u201cAs president, you can\u2019t govern by ad lib,\u201d McIntosh said. \u201cTell us exactly what would you do on health care.\u201d Conservative commentators and activists have, for the most part, held back their harshest criticism of Trump\u2019s evolving views on a number of policy issues. But that won\u2019t be the case if the brazen billionaire still sits atop the polls when summer comes to an end. Sarah Palin stands with Donald Trump, comes out swinging \u201cIf he\u2019s still in this position four months from today, then I think it\u2019s different,\u201d said Craig Robinson, a conservative activist and blogger in Iowa. \u201cAt some point, your conservative media is going to say, OK, wait a minute, let\u2019s take everything you say very seriously.\u201d For instance, on his proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, \u201cwho\u2019s picking up the tab?\u201d Robinson asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say \u2018Well, I\u2019ll make Mexico pay for it.\u2019\u201d GOP voters are becoming enchanted with his rhetoric, but many of them aren\u2019t familiar with his policy stances, said Erick Erickson, editor of the conservative RedState.com. Voters \u201cdon\u2019t know his positions on abortion or gay marriage or universal health care,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cThey just know Donald Trump is giving the business to people who deserve it.\u201d",

The former Maryland governor is making a one-day swing through the island, designed to highlight his position on two issues: Allowing Puerto Rico to declare bankruptcy and helping fund health care there by requiring the federal government to offer hospitals the same Medicare payment rates that U.S. states receive. Lagging far behind Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in the polls, O\u2019Malley\u2019s trip is his latest effort to court communities his campaign says are underrepresented \u2013 like Friday\u2019s tour of a Haitian cultural center in Miami. It will be O\u2019Malley\u2019s fourth visit to Puerto Rico the last two years. Republican former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush went to Puerto Rico in April, but he wasn\u2019t yet a declared candidate for president. O\u2019Malley will \u201chighlight he inequitable treatment that Puerto Rican citizens receive and to bring the magnifying glass of a presidential campaign to highlight issues of injustice in our hemisphere,\u201d said Gabi Domenzain, the campaign\u2019s public engagement director. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and, though it lacks electoral college representation, it participates in both parties\u2019 primaries \u2013 in March for the GOP and in June for the Democrats. RELATED: O\u2019Malley outlines criminal justice reform plan O\u2019Malley will meet with two of its political leaders: Pedro Pierluisi, a Democrat who is Puerto Rico\u2019s non-voting \u201cresident commissioner\u201d in Congress, and Jaime Perello, the speaker of Puerto Rico\u2019s House of Representatives. Who is Martin O'Malley? O\u2019Malley will call for the island to be allowed to declare bankruptcy amid a $73 billion public debt crisis. He\u2019ll also tour an assisted living facility to highlight the health care crunch the country faces amid lower Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. Its Medicare Advantage program also faces an 11% cut next year, while a Medicaid grant might not be renewed. O\u2019Malley\u2019s trip comes as Democratic presidential contenders heavily court Latino populations. RELATED: Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton support bankruptcy rights for Puerto Rico Clinton on Friday visited Miami to call on Congress to ends its embargo of Cuba \u2013 setting up a clash with Republicans like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio by taking the position in the city they call home. She, O\u2019Malley and Sanders have all also advocated overhauls of the U.S. immigration system, drawing contrasts with Republicans on an issue key to the Latino community which could be key in several 2016 election swing states. Clinton has not yet visited Puerto Rico, but she tweeted her support for the island\u2019s effort to resolve its debt crisis.",

            "article_content": "Mike Huckabee accused Obama of marching Israelis to \"the door of the oven\" As Obama fired back, Huckabee pounced -- seizing a chance to rise in the polls It's a strategy other 2016 hopefuls are following as they look to surge before the GOP debate A Republican presidential candidate upended the 2016 conversation with contentious comments over the weekend \u2014 and this time it wasn\u2019t Donald Trump. With the clock ticking down to the first GOP presidential debate and more than a dozen candidates vying to make the cut and appear on the Fox News debate stage, those headlines could be lifeblood. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee defended himself Monday after President Barack Obama slammed his comments linking the Iran deal to the Holocaust as \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201csad.\u201d 2016 election candidates \u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018ridiculous and sad\u2019 is that President Obama does not take Iran\u2019s repeated threats seriously. For decades, Iranian leaders have pledged to \u2018destroy,\u2019 \u2018annihilate,\u2019 and \u2018wipe Israel off the map\u2019 with a \u2018big Holocaust,\u2019\u201d Huckabee said in a statement Monday just hours after Obama spoke. \u201cNever again\u2019 will be the policy of my administration and I will stand with our ally Israel to prevent the terrorists in Tehran from achieving their own stated goal of another Holocaust.\u201d Huckabee has continued to capitalize on the moment, with his campaign posting a video to Facebook within hours of Obama\u2019s rebuke that earned more than 30,000 views within its 40 minutes online. Republican candidates have tripped over themselves to criticize Trump for his heated rhetoric about immigration, Mexicans and even GOP Sen. John McCain. Huckabee\u2019s Holocaust comparison drew no such rebuke, although several Republicans cautiously dismissed his language without rejecting his point. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2013 when asked by NPR about Huckabee\u2019s comments \u2013 said the comments could \u201cspeak for themselves.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what I\u2019m for, and you\u2019re not hearing me use that sort of language,\u201d Walker said. In Orlando on Monday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush offered a brief response, calling Huckabee\u2019s language \u201cwrong\u201d and urging Republicans to \u201ctone down the rhetoric.\u201d \u201cHaving said that, this is a bad deal, and I can see why people are angry about it,\u201d Bush said. Bush and Walker can afford to be cautious; they and Donald Trump are almost assured a spot on the Aug. 6 debate stage in Cleveland. But for Huckabee and most of the rest of the 16-person GOP Field, that debate spot could represent a key moment of truth. The first debate will include the 10 GOP contenders leading in an aggregate of the five most recent nationwide polls released before Aug. 4 at 5 p.m, two days before the first debate on Fox News. Until then, the bottom-tier candidates are making a mad dash for the headlines \u2013 with many using controversy to command attention in the press, and boost their poll numbers \u2013 as Trump\u2019s loud rise to the top of the polls has left little room for lesser known candidates to be heard. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is on the cusp of breaking into the top 10, has tried to seal his spot in the debate by positioning himself as the top Trump attack dog \u2013 relentlessly pursuing Trump in recent weeks in comments that quickly got picked up in news outlets. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has also hammered Trump, particularly in the wake of his comments questioning whether former prisoner of war and Vietnam veteran Sen. John McCain is a war hero. And after Trump disclosed Graham\u2019s personal cell phone number, the South Carolina senator took to the internet with a viral video of him destroying his cell phone. The strategy doesn\u2019t appear to have borne any results for either candidate though, as both stared down 1% of support in the CNN/ORC poll released Sunday. Mike Huckabee's political career Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who faces the same gloomy percentage, is also looking for a way out of the dredges. A Super PAC supporting the former Iowa caucus winner released an ad online Monday that goes after Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Huckabee, who came in 7th and 9th place, respectively, in the CNN/ORC poll. At the same time, Santorum is echoing Huckabee\u2019s harsh rhetoric, calling the Holocaust analogy \u201cabsolutely right\u201d in an interview on Fox Radio\u2019s \u201cThe John Gibson Show.\u201d \u201cLook, this is the same type of dehumanization of Jews, the same type of recreating history that we saw  in Nazi Germany. So no, I see this regime as equally virulent in its hatred of Jews,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cin my opinion there really can\u2019t be strong enough arguments again\u2013 strong enough language against this proposal.\u201d And while looking to boost their own fortunes, those candidates headline-grabbing antics also serve the purpose of looking to shift the conversation away from Trump. Huckabee\u2019s remarks \u2013 in which he accused Obama of marching Israelis to \u201cthe door of the oven\u201d \u2013 drew swift condemnation from top Jewish leaders, including the heads of anti-Semitism and anti-racism watchdogs like the the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Anti-Defamation League. Anti-Defamation League: Huckabee \u2018completely out of line\u2019 \u201cTo hear Mr. Huckabee invoke the Holocaust when America is Israel\u2019s greatest ally and when Israel is a strong nation capable of defending itself is disheartening,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt, national director of the latter group. In Huckabee\u2019s case, using a sharp tone to discuss Iran politics is nothing new. He has repeatedly slammed the Iran deal as dangerous for the U.S. and Israel since even before the deal was forged. Huckabee drew on a widely-repudiated ad from five decades ago to slam the Iran deal, posting an ad online slamming the Iran deal that raised the prospects of a nuclear bomb explosion. The ad included footage from the infamous \u201cDaisy\u201d ad from 1964, depicting a little girl picking petals off a daisy before a nuclear bomb explodes on screen. Huckabee\u2019s campaign did not respond CNN\u2019s request to comment. For their part, Democrats aren\u2019t missing an opportunity to slam Huckabee\u2019s comments, as Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley called the remarks \u201cout of line,\u201d eager to paint their GOP counterparts as extremists. RELATED: Clinton repudiates Huckabee\u2019s comments on Israel as \u2018over the line\u2019 The nation\u2019s top Democrat \u2013 Obama \u2013 suggested as well that Huckabee was playing politics and that \u201cthis is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines.\u201d \u201cThe American people deserve better,\u201d Obama said at his press conference. \u201cCertainly presidential debates deserve better.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough and Tom Lobianco contributed to this report.",

The former Florida governor granted his first Spanish-language interview as a presidential candidate to Telemundo Monday evening. In the interview, he talked about his immigration policies, his thoughts on Donald Trump and Cuba, and his home life and family. \u201cFirst, coming here legally has to be easier than coming here illegally,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there needs to be an agreement with the border \u2026 for the 11 million people (who are here illegally), they must come out of the shadows, receive a work visa, start paying taxes and also pay a small fine, learn English, don\u2019t receive government benefits, but they come out of the shadows and they receive legal status after some time.\u201d RELATED: Huckabee out-Trumps GOP ahead of debate Bush shook his head as D\u00edaz-Balart asked him to share how he felt about Trump\u2019s comments on Mexico. \u201cI was hurt hearing somebody speaking in such a vulgar fashion. This makes the solving of this problem much more difficult when we have politicians talking like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides that, he was offending millions of people that are here legally. It makes no sense. In a political sense, it\u2019s bad and it creates an environment that is worse.\u201d On Cuba, Bush said he opposes President Barack Obama\u2019s actions to mend relations with the country. \u201cI believe that the policy should be that we always want freedom in Cuba, we want democracy to change the relationship, but based on facts,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, there aren\u2019t even promises that he\u2019s received to do this. And dictators are not going to leave quietly at night. They don\u2019t leave. We must be vigilant and this president does not recognize that.\u201d RELATED: Republicans rebuke Cruz over his charge McConnell lied The presidential candidate also shared a little bit about his home life and marriage. He married his wife Columba, who is originally from Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, Mexico and an immigrant to the United States. \u201cShe\u2019s very Mexican and very proud to be Mexican,\u201d Bush said about Columba. \u201cWe eat Mexican food at home, our children are Hispanic, and yes the Hispanic influence is important.\u201d Parts of the interview were aired Monday, and an extended version will air Sunday on \u201cEnfoque con Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart.\u201d The interview was part of a daylong push to show that Bush could have appeal beyond the traditional Republican base. Spending the day campaigning in central Florida, a part of the state with a strong Puerto Rican population, Bush frequently spoke in Spanish at campaign events and noted that he won more Hispanic voters than white voters in his re-election bid as governor. And like he did in the interview, Bush pointed to his personal connection. \u201cI have a secret weapon,\u201d he told an audience of Hispanic pastors in Orlando. \u201cI have Hispanic children. I have Hispanic grandchildren. I\u2019m part of the community.\u201d Following Mitt Romney\u2019s loss in the 2012 presidential election, in which Romney only won only 27% of the Hispanic vote, Republicans immediately started calling for more robust efforts to appeal to minority voters. In a moment of confidence, Bush said he \u201ccannot imagine having the same kind of number (of Hispanic voters) that Republican candidates have had in past presidential elections.\u201d He pledged to \u201ccampaign everywhere,\u201d courting not just Hispanics, but African-Americans as well. He\u2019ll speak at the National Urban League conference in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to get outside your confront zone a bit. It\u2019s OK that not everybody is not OK with my views. It is not OK to not try. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s so-far durable support in the Republican race for the presidential nomination rests largely on widespread dissatisfaction with Washington, and has been bolstered by his vocal criticism of the country\u2019s immigration policies. A new CNN/ORC Poll finds that just 30% of registered voters nationwide say they feel their views are well represented by the government in Washington, while 40% say they are not represented well at all. That figure spikes among Republican and Republican-leaning voters. Among GOP voters, 53% say they don\u2019t feel their views are well represented in Washington at all, nearly double the 27% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who feel the same way. Read the full CNN / ORC poll results And these Republican voters who say their views are not represented at all by the government in Washington are far more likely than other Republicans to back Trump\u2019s run for the White House. Among this group, Trump holds a broad lead: 24% support him vs. 13% behind former Florida governor Jeb Bush, with the rest of the field at 8% or less. These disaffected voters are more likely to say they want Trump to stay in the race (58% vs. 45% among other Republicans) and more likely to think he will ultimately win the party\u2019s nomination: 27% say Trump will, 29% Bush. Among other Republican registered voters, those figures are 34% Bush and 18% Trump. The disaffected are slightly more likely to cite illegal immigration as their top issue in deciding whom to support for president next year (14% compared with 7% among other Republicans), but in both groups, the economy is the dominant issue, cited as tops by more than 4 in 10 voters. Although these voters say they feel left out of Washington\u2019s political process, they are more likely than other Republicans to say they are \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d about voting for president next year, 31% compared with 23% among other Republican registered voters. They are also slightly less satisfied with the field of Republican candidates (29% say they are dissatisfied compared with 22% among other Republican voters). Who's running for President? When they assess the traits they\u2019re looking for in the next president, those feeling disconnected from Washington are just as likely as other Republicans to say they want a candidate who stands up for his or her beliefs, but they are less likely to prioritize empathy or compromise, and are more likely to be looking for someone who\u2019s not a typical politician and who wants to change the way Washington works. Those attributes correspond well with Trump\u2019s strengths. Among those Republican voters who say it\u2019s extremely important that the next president stand up for his or her beliefs even in the face of criticism, Trump is practically a runaway winner: 25% back him compared with 11% behind Bush and 10% backing Walker. He carries similarly broad advantages among those who say it\u2019s key that the president is not a typical politician (23% vs. 14% for Bush and 13% Walker) and wants to change the way Washington works (23% Trump, 16% Bush, 10% Walker). Bush and Trump are tied among those who say it\u2019s extremely important for the next president to be able to compromise to get things done, 16% support each, 13% are behind Walker. The poll also finds Trump\u2019s positions on immigration are at odds with those of most Americans, but may be providing him a boost in the Republican nomination contest. Overall, 56% say that U.S. policies on immigration should largely focus on developing a plan that would allow illegal immigrants with jobs to become legal residents, while 42% prioritize stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S. and deporting those already here. That\u2019s a significant increase on the side of allowing immigrants living the U.S. illegally to become legal residents, up from 49% in February. Among the majority who say U.S. policy should focus on a path to legal residency, 72% say they have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, that dips to 41% among those who think the focus ought to be on border security. Still, few see illegal immigration as a puzzle that\u2019s been solved. The poll shows 69% of Americans think the number of immigrants coming to the United States illegally has increased in the last few years, just 25% think it\u2019s decreased. That\u2019s in contrast with a recent analysis from the Pew Research Center, which found the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. has stabilized, partly due to a \u201cslowdown in new illegal immigration since the Great Recession.\u201d According to Pew, most immigrants living the U.S. illegally have been in the country for a decade or more. The CNN/ORC poll reveals massive partisan divides in opinions on immigration, however, with Trump\u2019s campaign capitalizing on the imbalance in his bid for the Republican nomination. Nearly three quarters of Democratic registered voters (72%) say the country\u2019s immigration policies should focus on allowing immigrants in the country illegally to become legal residents, while just 38% of Republican registered voters agree. This issue sharply divides Republican preferences in the race for the party\u2019s nomination. Among those Republican registered voters who say that the focus of immigration policy should be helping illegal residents become legal ones, 19% back Jeb Bush for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, 13% support Trump. Among those who say the focus should be border security and deportation, 23% support Trump, 13% Bush. Those who think the government\u2019s focus ought to be on border security are more likely to call it a top issue in deciding their vote for president. Sixteen percent of such Republican voters call immigration their top issue, compared with 4% among those who think the focus should be on helping illegal immigrants gain legal status. Still, illegal immigration is not the most important issue for the Republican field. Just 11% call it key to their decision about whom to support in next year\u2019s presidential election. That\u2019s about on par with foreign policy (13%), health care and terrorism (15%) and all rank well below the economy (44% call that their top consideration). The economy is a dominant issue for Democrats as well, 45% of whom call it their top issue. And the poll suggests it may be boosting independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders as he seeks to topple Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the race for that party\u2019s presidential nomination. Although Clinton has focused recently on rolling out her proposed economic policies, she loses significant ground to Bernie Sanders among Democratic voters who call the economy their top issue. Among economy voters, a narrow majority of 51% say they back Clinton, while 24% support Sanders. Among those Democratic voters who cite a different issue as their main concern, 61% back Clinton, while 15% favor Vice President Joe Biden and 14% back Sanders. The CNN/ORC International Poll was conducted July 22-25 among a random national sample of 1,017 adults, including 898 registered voters. Results for all registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The registered voter sample included 419 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents as well as 392 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.",

            "article_content": "GOP's anger at Donald Trump could cause him to run as a third party candidate Ralph Nader: 'A jilted Donald Trump as a third party candidate can blow the presidential race wide open' Republicans dreaming of shooing away Donald Trump may want to think twice. By publicly rebuking the billionaire businessman for his inflammatory comments, the party may convince Trump to launch a third-party candidacy. That\u2019s a potential nightmare scenario for the GOP establishment: a populist outsider with unlimited resources attacking their nominee from the right in the general election, raising hell \u2013 and attracting votes \u2013 with his rhetoric on issues like illegal immigration. Ralph Nader, who has run for president multiple times as a third-party candidate and may have cost Democrat Al Gore the 2000 election by running to his left, said Republicans mishandle Trump at their own peril. \u201cThe Republican Party establishment is playing with nitroglycerine when it goes after Donald Trump and tries to minimize him and exclude him,\u201d Nader said in an interview Thursday. \u201cBecause a jilted Donald Trump as a third-party candidate can blow the presidential race wide open and turn it into a three way race.\u201d READ: Donald Trump at the border: \u2018I\u2019ll win the Hispanic vote\u2019 Trump has become a favorite punching bag since launching his White House campaign last month, angering fellow Republicans by questioning Sen. John McCain\u2019s status as a war hero last week. Trump has fired back at the criticism \u2013 especially a rebuke from the typically-neutral Republican National Committee. He\u2019s repeatedly declined to rule out a third-party White House run, saying in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper earlier this month that he\u2019s constantly being asked to run as an independent. This week, he told The Hill that his decision will depend on \u201chow I\u2019m being treated by the Republicans.\u201d Launching a third-party candidacy is no small feat. It is a time-consuming and expensive process riddled with logistical hurdles, including massive signature-gathering requirements to gain ballot access in each of the 50 states. But if it\u2019s tedious, it\u2019s hardly impossible \u2014 particularly for a candidate with money to throw around. Republicans remember all too well businessman Ross Perot\u2019s independent candidacy for president in 1992. The Texan made an appeal to voters looking for an alternative to establishment candidates, and his campaign is widely considered to have complicated George H.W. Bush\u2019s effort to win reelection against Bill Clinton. Clay Mulford, Perot\u2019s son-in-law and political adviser, said a third-party run from Trump has the potential to energize a part of the electorate that\u2019s itching for a fresh face. \u201cThere is just a sense of ineffectiveness of the two-party system. So I think he would do better than expected if he were in the debates and if he were considered viable,\u201d Mulford said. \u201cAnd having money helps.\u201d READ: Is Donald Trump a demagogue? Indeed, poll numbers suggest that a third-party candidacy from Trump would damage Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a top-tier candidate in the current Republican field. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton leads Bush, 50% to 44%, in a head-to-head match-up, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll out this week. But throw an independent Trump into that race, and Clinton\u2019s lead grows significantly to 46%, leaving Bush at 30%. \u201cHe\u2019d be the one person that would probably fit the bill. He\u2019s not really a Republican, he\u2019s not a Democrat,\u201d said former U.S. Sen. Dean Barkley of Minnesota, who was appointed and served briefly as an independent by Gov. Jesse Ventura. Independents \u201cdecide the election every four years and if all of them or most of them go to Trump, that leaves the Republicans too small of a base to have any chance of winning.\u201d At a campaign stop in New Hampshire Thursday, Bush made sure to emphasize that he isn\u2019t dismissive of Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cI think he\u2019s a serious candidate and he\u2019s going to have a lot of money. He\u2019s tapping into people\u2019s angst that are legitimate,\u201d Bush said. Meanwhile, during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, Thursday, Trump said his preference is to run as a Republican and he was confident that he could win the party\u2019s nomination. WATCH: Inside L.A.\u2019s pi\u00f1ata district in the age of Donald Trump But in many ways, a third-party run makes a lot of sense for Trump. The former host of the reality TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was once a registered a Democrat, donated money to members of both parties, and considered running for president in 2000 as an independent. At the very core of his campaign is the idea that he is the anti-politician. Trump has never held public office and he loves to point out that thanks to his massive wealth \u2014 which he claims amounts to more than $10 billion \u2014 he is not beholden to anyone, including party leadership. This last point has already created massive headaches for the GOP. Trump sparked furious backlash by referring to some Mexican immigrants that enter the United States as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists.\u201d Republicans criticized Trump\u2019s choice of words as being hurtful and insensitive to the immigrant community, but many chose their words carefully \u2014 a sign of how delicate of an issue illegal immigration is. For many Republicans, Trump seemed to cross the line last weekend with his critique of McCain. \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d Trump said of the Arizona Republican senator, who spent more than five years in as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. The RNC, which remains neutral in the GOP nominating process, took the unusual move of speaking out. \u201cThere is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably,\u201d said RNC spokesman Sean Spicer. The RNC declined to comment for this story. Bill Hillsman, a political consultant who has worked for a number of independent candidates including in gubernatorial races in Massachusetts and Texas, said the party\u2019s condemnation of Trump is likely to have helped fuel Trump\u2019s unorthodox campaign. \u201cI think the damage is already done to a large extent,\u201d Hillsman said. \u201cAll the people who said well, his campaign is over now and blasted him for some of his previous comments, many of which he\u2019s walked back, they already have just pretty much dismissed this guy and the polls are saying otherwise.\u201d READ: Why supporters like Donald Trump",

            "article_content": "First they ignored Donald Trump, but he wouldn\u2019t go away. Then they mocked him as a reality show star on a self-promotion binge, but The Donald refused to take the hint. So now the real estate mogul\u2019s rivals for the Republican nomination, spooked by his poll surge and fearing his potential to damage both the party and their own White House hopes, are taking it up a notch, significantly hardening their rhetoric. Trump, they say, is not just a threat to the GOP\u2019s hopes of winning back the presidency by alienating key constituencies \u2013 like Hispanic voters and veterans \u2013 he\u2019s a threat to the nation itself. The brash businessman is likely to provoke further vitriol on Thursday by touring the Texas border. READ: GOP to Trump: You crossed the line On Wednesday, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry lashed out at his rival for the Republican nomination for what he described as \u201cTrumpism.\u201d He charged that its author was a dangerous extremist who had whipped up a \u201ctoxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense\u201d and was spreading a\u201dcancer on conservatism.\u201d His criticism was matched by another GOP candidate, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who called the \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d star a \u201ccar wreck\u201d during an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d Tuesday. READ: What voters like about Donald Trump \u201cPeople who say the things he said will never lead a great nation in my opinion,\u201d he said. The attacks were just the latest efforts by those in the Republican Party to try to manage the Trump boom, which has hijacked the party\u2019s hopes of a smooth primary process and threatens to turn the first party debate early next month into a riot. For sure, Trump does not play the game like a regular politician. And with his tirade against Mexican immigrants and allegations that some are rapists and criminals, he seems ready to exploit fears and prejudices to boost his personal political ambition. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for the good of the country,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to do it. The politicians are never going to turn this country around.\u201d But by using the \u201cD-word\u201d \u2013 demagoguery \u2013 Perry appeared to be putting Trump among more dubious political company than he has hitherto been, a long list of rogues and firebrands that speckle American history. Its members include the race-baiting former Alabama Gov. George Wallace and the power-hungry former Louisiana Gov. Huey Long, who greeted prominent guests in green pajamas and built a personal fiefdom in his state in the late 1920s and early 1930s. And Trump\u2019s mastery of driving controversy in the media also has parallels with the bewitching talents of Father Charles Coughlin, a charismatic radio priest who used the wireless to harness opposition to Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and rail against Jews. \u201cThese candidates try to appeal to constituencies who feel that they have no other option,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history at Princeton University. \u201cThey play on the worst feelings of the electorate, economic and racial \u2026 or they step into where there is a vacuum where neither party is dealing with it.\u201d Inside L.A.'s pi\u00f1ata district in the age of Donald Trump But while Trump certainly is cranking up the populist rhetoric and doesn\u2019t shy from whipping up fears over illegal immigration, he is tough to classify as a classic demagogue. \u201cThere is a difference between demagogues and demagogic behavior,\u201d said Michael Signer, an author and lawyer who has made a 15-year study of political demagogues and wrote a book: \u201cDemagogue: The Fight to Save Democracy from Its Worst Enemies\u201d on the topic. \u201cEverything he has been doing has been at the level of him benefiting from controversy. There\u2019s a propagandistic element to it. He knows how to outrage people for his own benefit, and he\u2019s done that his whole career,\u201d he said. But he said that doesn\u2019t mean Trump can be classified as a genuine demagogue \u2013 even if his opponents think he\u2019s heading that way. Signer has established four tests to identify genuine demagogues, and so far Trump, for all his bluster, seems well short of membership in this notorious political club. Classic demagogues \u2013 like Venezuela\u2019s late dictator Hugo Chavez \u2013 tend to present themselves as men of the people, a rank that Trump seems to have little desire to join, considering he rarely tires of reminding voters that he is stinking rich. And under Signer\u2019s test, true demagogues strike an overpowering connection with the masses that they then use to power their own political development. Trump, for all his outsize personality, can hardly claim to have captured the public imagination at this point: His percentage in an ABC/Washington Post poll this week, though the best in the GOP field, was only 24%. Given that he also lacks a detailed program of political priorities and policies, he seems to fall short here, too. Many in the political world also doubt whether he will go to the trouble of building a full political operation that could get him on the ballot countrywide and power a genuine bid to lead the GOP into the general election. Finally, and most importantly, demagogues threaten to break established rules of governance and to challenge the power of political institutions \u2013 a feat that Trump\u2019s distance from power seems to render an unlikely prospect. \u201cThe question now is whether he\u2019s really going to set himself up to actually mirror the common people,\u201d said Signer. \u201cI don\u2019t see him seriously developing either a political persona or a program that\u2019s about regular people and their problems.\u201d So if Trump is not a demagogue in the true sense of the word, where can he be placed on the political spectrum? READ: Trump gives out Lindsey Graham\u2019s personal cell number With his background in business and refusal to rule out a independent bid for the presidency should he fail to win the nomination, Trump gives some Republicans nightmare flashbacks to Ross Perot \u2013 who helped defeat President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and handed the White House to Democrat Bill Clinton. Other observers see similarities to Pat Buchanan, the culture warrior who so softened up Bush in the New Hampshire primary that year that it helped seed the ground for Perot\u2019s challenge. And if Trump\u2019s campaign turns out to be a media comet that burns out and leaves no discernable impact on the Republican field, he may end up in the same category of busted politicians as Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain, who experienced stratospheric political ascents but couldn\u2019t keep up the momentum. Trump\u2019s rise and political persona also seem to bear some comparisons to Italian media mogul Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s talent for shaping media narratives. Berlusconi successfully navigated Italy\u2019s fractured political climate to grab genuine power as prime minister. Trump\u2019s use of public antipathy over immigration, meanwhile, is similar to that of flamboyant British politician Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party \u2013 who once threatened to rout Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives but didn\u2019t even win his own seat in Parliament in this May\u2019s election. Whatever his political fate, Trump clearly is determined to arrive at it his own way. Conventional politicians build coalitions. Trump takes delight in splintering them \u2013 as he alienates Hispanics, veterans and evangelicals and flings insults at GOP rivals he deems \u201cstiff\u201d or stupid and generic politicians who \u201cdon\u2019t know what they are doing.\u201d Most candidates with their eye on office avoid sacred cows. Trump slaughters them. Feel-your-pain politicians like Bill Clinton tell voters it\u2019s all about them. Trump wants you to know it\u2019s all about him \u2013 that, in fact, appears to be the central selling point of his campaign. Even a few months ago, no one thought he would risk his business interests and mammoth earnings and actually jump into the GOP race \u2013 let alone that he would lead the field, albeit it more than six months before the first nominating contests. But jump in he did. And despite suspicions he\u2019s on a mass publicity tour, he insists his motives are pure. READ: Trump: As president, \u2018I\u2019ll change my tone\u2019",

            "article_content": "The Republican establishment is making the most of the chance it had long sought to finally say this to Donald Trump: You crossed the line. Ever since announcing his presidential run last month, the brash, unfiltered billionaire businessman has created headaches for the party. Particularly, his comments equating some Mexican immigrants to rapists and criminals left GOP leaders struggling to appease those Trump had offended without alienating conservative voters attracted to his views on combating illegal immigration. But on Saturday, Trump seemed to hand party bosses and the pack of 2016 Republican presidential candidates a golden chance to take him down at almost no political cost \u2013 while making themselves look magnanimous. The spark for the latest political firestorm came when the New York real estate billionaire questioned on Saturday whether Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Vietnam War veteran who languished in a prisoner of war camp for more than five years, was a genuine \u201cwar hero because he was captured.\u201d \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d Trump said, drawing gasps and \u201cboos\u201d from a conservative crowd in Iowa. Jeb Bush defends McCain, but supported Swift Boat attacks against Kerry What transpired within minutes of those inflammatory comments was telling. The GOP pile-on was swift and outspoken. McCain might be a controversial figure with plenty of enemies in Washington but he\u2019s universally regarded as a rare example of pure heroism. The Republican National Committee, which stays neutral in the GOP primary and rarely weighs in on political debates, made the unusual move of publicly condemning Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cThere is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably,\u201d RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said on Twitter. While the GOP was shy in responding to Trump\u2019s tirade against Mexico, it became clear on Monday that the party\u2019s hierachy was not going to be bitten by the Donald again. \u201cRight now what you are seeing is the party taking a dramatic shift this weekend \u2013 taking Donald Trump head on,\u201d Mitt Romney\u2019s former senior political advisor and CNN contributor Kevin Madden told Wolf Blitzer. \u201cThis is their chance to really draw some stark contrasts about the direction of the party. This is an opportunity for a lot of these candidates.\u201d RELATED: Donald Trump snubs GOP power brokers One after another, Trump\u2019s fellow GOP presidential candidates were quick to go after the former host of the reality TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d \u201cEnough with the slanderous attacks,\u201d former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweeted. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close friend of McCain\u2019s, said Trump had \u201ccrossed a line today that will offend most every one that I know,\u201d and predicted that American voters would only have this message to Trump: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said that Trump\u2019s shot against a man who refused to take early release from the infamous Hanoi Hilton prison because his comrades could not come too disqualifed the billionaire as a potential commander in chief. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, an Air Force veteran \u2013 who is languishing in the polls and needs every headline he can get \u2013 upped the ante \u2013 calling on Trump to \u201cimmediately withdraw\u201d from the 2016 race altogether. Trump, by alienating sectors of the GOP electorate, is already breaking all the normal political rules, so it\u2019s not surprising he didn\u2019t choose to return to the high ground. True to form, he decided to intensify the row rather than walk away, or simply apologize, penning an opinion piece in USA Today, that was scathing of the media, the \u201cestablishment\u201d and McCain. \u201cThe reality is that John McCain the politician has made America less safe, sent our brave soldiers into wrong-headed foreign adventures, covered up for President Obama with the VA scandal and has spent most of his time in the Senate pushing amnesty. He would rather protect the Iraqi border than Arizona\u2019s,\u201d Trump wrote. One Republican candidate chose not to join the torrent of criticism of Trump. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was effusive in praise of McCain, who once called him a \u201cwacko bird\u201d but trod carefully on Trump, possibly hoping to appeal to the billionaire\u2019s supporters should he eventually exit the race. RELATED: That time Al Franken joked about McCain\u2019s war hero status \u201cI recognize that folks in the press love to see Republican-on-Republican violence, and so you want me to say something bad about Donald Trump, or bad about John McCain or bad about anyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d Hillary Clinton, enjoying a rare moment out of the political spotlight, also took a chance to have a shot at the \u201chate (Trump) is spewing\u201d towards Mexicans and stood up for her old Senate buddy McCain. Even the Obama White House, no friend of McCain, pounced on the opportunity to fan the flames of a controversy that Democrats hope will damage the Republican political brand. Spokesman Josh Earnest praised McCain\u2019s \u201cremarkable\u201d service. The GOP\u2019s swift and nearly unanimous criticism of Trump\u2019s remarks about McCain was particularly striking in light of how the party dealt with an earlier political row set off by his highly controversial comments \u2013 even if it marked an easy political choice. In his presidential announcement speech last month, Trump said that some people entering the United States from Mexico were \u201crapists,\u201d \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cdrug dealers.\u201d The comments flew in the face of the GOP\u2019s desperate need to improve its standing with the increasingly influential demographic of Hispanic voters which are vital in general election swing states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado. The episode suggests that though candidates like Bush and Rubio know very well the perils of estrangement from the community, they are not yet at ease with the base of their own party, which remains vociferously opposed to any immigration reform that would bring millions of illegal immigrants \u2013 eventually \u2013 into the U.S. fold. More immediately, there is increasing speculation on whether Trump\u2019s broadside against McCain would turn out to be the moment when the billionaire\u2019s political bubble bursts \u2013 in a way that would offer some relief to the GOP leadership. Immediate evidence \u2013 in the form of a new poll of Iowa voters \u2013 was inconclusive, though it may be several days before the true impact of his remarks plays out. A survey by Monmouth University published Monday put Trump in second place in the first in the nation caucus state, at 13%, nine points behind Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. The poll did not find any significant change in support in interviews that took place after Trump unloaded on McCain. A new ABC/Washington Post National poll on Monday had Trump leading the Republican field on 24% but his number dropped into the single digits in samples taken on Sunday following his McCain comments, albeit in a small sample size. Madden predicted that Trump\u2019s bombast would indeed sooner or later begin to take a toll on his poll numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the end \u2013 part of the process. This information is going to start to get to voters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to see a revelation in his character right now as well as his temperament that is going to lead them to look at other candidates.\u201d While it could be the case that Trump\u2019s remarks could narrow what many analysts already think is a virtually non-existent path towards the GOP nomination, that doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to an early exit for the reality show star. For now, the McCain clash seems to leave Trump where he most likes to be \u2013  in the middle of a raging storm of publicity generated by himself about himself, while taking shots at the media and the Republican political establishment. It\u2019s the kind of behavior that gave his presidential run a fast start among a certain sector of the Republican electorate in the first place. Donald Trump snubs GOP power brokers",

            "article_content": "Trump's comments were met with a mix of gasps, laughter and some applause from an audience They were also met with swift condemnation on Twitter Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t apologize Sunday after igniting a political firestorm a day earlier by questioning whether Sen. John McCain \u2013 who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War \u2013 is a war hero. Asked by ABC News whether he owes McCain an apology, Trump said: \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d \u201cPeople that fought hard and weren\u2019t captured and went through a lot, they get no credit. Nobody even talks about them. They\u2019re like forgotten. And I think that\u2019s a shame, if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump said Sunday. \u201cPeople that were not captured that went in and fought, nobody talks about them. Those are heroes also,\u201d he said. In an interview on Fox News, Trump hit the Arizona senator again, saying McCain has failed to play a positive role in fixing veterans\u2019 lagging health care system. \u201cHe\u2019s all talk and he\u2019s no action,\u201d Trump said. He also compared the criticism he\u2019s faced from Republican presidential contenders to the blowback his comments on undocumented immigrants from Mexico. \u201cI brought illegal immigration to the forefront. I believe now I\u2019m bringing the veterans \u2013 the plight of the veterans \u2013 to the forefront,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s comments came Saturday in Iowa. By mid-afternoon, Trump tried to walk back his blunder on Twitter, saying \u201ccaptured or not, all our soldiers are heroes!\u201d But his attempt at damage control seemed unlikely to diminish the anger his remarks had caused. They provoked an immediate outcry from his 2016 presidential rivals and the Republican National Committee, which has expressed concern about the impact his controversial remarks on immigration have had on the GOP brand. For Republicans waiting to pounce on Trump and knock him from his position as the party\u2019s leading presidential candidate, the real estate mogul may have handed them an opening. Cruz declines to denounce Trump\u2019s McCain comments The controversy began when Trump, speaking at a question-and-answer session at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, commented on McCain, with whom he\u2019s recently feuded over illegal immigration. \u201cHe is not a war hero,\u201d Trump told pollster Frank Luntz, who was hosting the session. \u201cHe is a war hero,\u201d Luntz interjected. \u201cHe is a war hero because he was captured,\u201d Trump said, cutting him off. \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK? I hate to tell you. He is a war hero because he was captured. OK, you can have \u2013 I believe perhaps he is a war hero.\u201d Donald Trump in 2008: I like, respect John McCain The comments met with a mix of gasps, boos, laughter and some applause from an audience. McCain, a Naval aviator, was shot down in 1967 over North Vietnam and fractured both arms and legs after being ejected from his aircraft. He was repeatedly tortured during his stay in the notorious \u201cHanoi Hilton\u201d \u2013 and refused early release when the North Vietnamese learned his father was a Navy admiral \u2013 until he finally returned home in 1973 following the Paris Peace Accords. The Arizona senator, who has limited mobility in his arms following his war experience, received the Distinguished Flying Cross, a Silver Star and a Purple Heart for his service. Trump believes in God, but hasn\u2019t sought forgiveness Trump, meanwhile, received several deferments during the war. According to The Smoking Gun, which obtained selective service records for Trump in 2011, he received four student deferments between 1964 and 1968, and later a medical deferment in 1968. McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told CNN that the senator would have no comment on Trump\u2019s statements. But McCain\u2019s daughter, Meghan, tweeted that she was \u201chorrified\u201d and \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the remarks. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what I am reading this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are no words.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments were swiftly condemned on Twitter Saturday afternoon, with multiple Republican 2016 candidates blasting the remarks. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in emotional comments made to an audience at the summit that if Trump doesn\u2019t apologize, he is unfit to be commander-in-chief of the United States. \u201cTo disparage a legitimate American hero like John McCain \u2013 you may disagree with his policies and that\u2019s fine. I tell people all the time it\u2019s OK to question your government,\u201d said Perry, an Air Force veteran. \u201cBut don\u2019t question the men and women of the military who sacrifice and sometimes pay a huge price for our safety and our freedom and our economics.\u201d Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a frequent target of Trump\u2019s criticism, also came to McCain\u2019s defense. \u201cEnough with the slanderous attacks. @SenJohnMcCain and all our veterans - particularly POWs have earned our respect and admiration,\u201d he tweeted. Enough with the slanderous attacks. @SenJohnMcCain and all our veterans - particularly POWs have earned our respect and admiration. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called McCain \u201ca hero\u201d on Twitter. John McCain is an American hero.  I have nothing but respect for his service to our country. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close friend of McCain\u2019s, fired off a series of tweets criticizing Trump and questioning his qualifications to be president in light of the comments. At the heart of @realDonaldTrump statement is a lack of respect for those who have served - a disqualifying characteristic to be president But while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 who has stood out in the 2016 field as a supporter of Trump\u2019s controversial remarks on immigration \u2013 defended McCain in a tweet, he notably declined to criticize Trump when asked by reporters to comment on the real estate mogul\u2019s remarks. Instead, he blamed the media for trying to turn Republicans against each other. \u201cYou know I recognize that folks in the press love to see Republican-on-Republican violence, and so you want me to say something bad about Donald Trump, or bad about John McCain or bad about anyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d Retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson was also asked if he defined McCain as a war hero, and said that while he believed the senator has \u201cdone some wonderful things,\u201d he also stopped short of denouncing Trump. \u201cIt depends on your definition of a war hero. I think he has done some wonderful things, certainly the history is consistent with what we would consider a war hero,\u201d Carson said. \u201cSo do we take that away from him because some people disagree with him politically? I think that\u2019s probably a stupid way to do things.\u201d Mitt Romney, the 2012 presidential candidate, vouched for McCain\u2019s heroism and praised veterans on Twitter. \u201cThe difference between @SenJohnMcCain and @realDonaldTrump: Trump shot himself down. McCain and American veterans are true heroes,\u201d he tweeted. The difference between @SenJohnMcCain and @realDonaldTrump: Trump shot himself down. McCain and American veterans are true heroes. But Trump dismissed Romney \u2013 and McCain again \u2013 in a tweet. \u201cWhy would anybody listen to @MittRomney? He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way, so did John McCain,\u201d he tweeted. Sean Spicer, the communications director for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement that McCain \u201cis an American hero because he served his country and sacrificed more than most can imagine. Period.\u201d \u201cThere is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably,\u201d Spicer said. On a campaign stop in Arkansas, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton weighed in. \u201cThere is nothing funny about the hate he is spewing at immigrants and their families and now the insults he has directed at a genuine war hero, Sen. John McCain,\u201d Clinton said.  \u201cIt is shameful and so is the fact that it took so long for most of his fellow Republican candidates to start standing up to him.\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran, said McCain is \u201ca hero, a man of grit and guts and character personified. He served and bled and endured unspeakable acts of torture.\u201d Donald Trump will talk about anything Speaking to reporters after the event in Ames, Trump sought to clarify his comments. \u201cIf a person is captured, they\u2019re a hero as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut you have to do other things also. I don\u2019t like the job John McCain is doing in the Senate. He\u2019s not taking care of our veterans.\u201d Borger: Trump is the guy GOP candidates can\u2019t afford to ignore His campaign also released a statement, in which Trump said McCain has done \u201clittle\u201d for U.S. veterans. \u201cI am not a fan John McCain because he has done so little for our veterans, and he should know better than anybody what the veterans need, especially in regards to the (Department of Veterans Affairs),\u201d Trump said in the statement. \u201cHe is yet another all-talk, no-action politician who spends too much time on television and not enough time doing his job and helping the vets. He is also allowing our military to decrease substantially in size and strength, something which should never be allowed to happen.\u201d Joel Arends, chairman of Veterans for a Strong America, in a statement said feuding between McCain and Trump over issues \u201chas nothing to do with Mr. Trump\u2019s high regard for the military or veterans as a whole. Mr. Trump is supporter of the U.S. military and of America\u2019s veterans. It is well known that when Mr. Trump is attacked by a detractor, he swings back.\u201d The group said it was glad Trump clarified his remarks and said McCain is a war hero. This is not the first time Trump has taken a jab at the 2008 Republican nominee this week. After McCain criticized Trump\u2019s visit to Phoenix last weekend, saying he \u201cfired up the crazies\u201d in regard to his controversial comments on illegal immigration, Trump called the Arizona senator a \u201cdummy\u201d on Twitter. \u201d.@SenJohnMcCain should be defeated in the primaries. Graduated last in his class at Annapolis\u2013dummy,\u201d he said. In his campaign\u2019s statement on Saturday, Trump again referenced illegal immigration as the main reason for his feud with McCain. \u201cFurthermore, he was extremely disrespectful to the thousands upon thousands of people, many of whom happen to be his constituents, that came to listen to me speak about illegal immigration in Phoenix last week by calling them \u2018crazies,\u2019\u201d the statement said. \u201cThese were not \u2018crazies\u2019 \u2013 these were great American citizens.\u201d Trump supported McCain\u2019s presidential candidacy in 2008. He donated $28,450 to John McCain\u2019s Victory Committee, a super PAC, and endorsed him on CNN\u2019s \u201cLarry King Live\u201d that year, calling him \u201ca smart guy and I think he\u2019s going to be a great president.\u201d During Saturday\u2019s Q&A session, Trump claimed he raised $1 million for the Arizona senator. After the event, Trump added on Twitter that McCain \u201clet us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!\u201d In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President! CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Jeff Zeleny, Kevin Bohn and Nancy Leung contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker predicts that he can finish first, second or third in all four of the first Republican presidential primary contests. \u201cI think we can place one, two or three in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada. I think for any of the other candidates who are in the front or who are near the front of the pack, if they can\u2019t go one two or three in each of these couple of early states, I think they face a real challenge,\u201d Walker told CNN in an interview aboard his campaign Winnebago traveling across the first caucus state of Iowa. \u201cI think we can make the case not only here in Iowa, I think we can make a compelling case with a win in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. We\u2019ve got great crowds in each of those states over the last week,\u201d said Walker, who formally announced his presidential bid last Monday. Walker has been ahead for months in most Iowa polls, ever since he gave a fiery, well-received speech at the state\u2019s first GOP candidate cattle call this winter. A significant number of Iowa Republican caucus goers tend to be quite socially conservative, and Walker has been emphasizing conservative positions on everything from same-sex marriage to abortion. He also flat out changed his position on illegal immigration, going from being open to a path to citizenship, to opposing it. RELATED: Rick Perry says Boy Scouts \u2018better off\u2019 without gay leaders We read a quote from former Iowa GOP chair Craig Robinson, saying Walker makes former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney \u2013 who changed his position over time on abortion, illegal immigration and other issues \u2013 look like a \u201cmodel of consistency.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s taking the lines form the opposition.\u201d Walker said, \u201cI said there should be a path (to citizenship) years ago, when I talked about going forward with legal immigration; I didn\u2019t talk about amnesty,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIn fact, I said in that specific interview I opposed the gang of five, the measure that Marco Rubio and others proposed.\u201d On abortion, when Walker was locked in a tough re-election bid last year in the blue state of Wisconsin, he aired a television ad, speaking straight to camera, in which he talked about the decision being between a woman and her doctor, which is the language of the abortion rights movement. \u201cI said I\u2019m pro-life but I can only imagine how difficult a decision must be for someone who\u2019s thinking about ending their pregnancy. That\u2019s why I support a law that provides more information to someone to make that decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe law still leaves the decision to the woman and her doctor. As for me, I want to look out for the health and safety of all citizens in my state.\u201d Walker said millions of dollars of attack ads where aired in his state over the law he signed, and his own advertisement was meant to clarify what the law did. \u201cOur point was the law that they were attacking us on merely provides more information,\u201d Walker said. On same-sex marriage, after not emphasizing it much in Wisconsin, and even suggesting it was settled in the state, he ended up giving one of the most critical statements after last month\u2019s Supreme Court decision making it legal, saying it was a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d and calling for a constitutional amendment giving states the right to decide. And, he had opposed ethanol subsidies, very popular in corn rich Iowa, but now says he supports them. On that, he insists his opposition was to state subsidies. \u201cI never said anything about federal. I said I opposed a mandate on ethanol in Wisconsin. I\u2019ve kept that commitment I\u2019ve kept my word on that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve said here in Iowa is because it\u2019s already in place, I thought that the renewable fuel standard should stay in place as a transition is given and they should phase it out within two years.\u201d Walker aides insist that on all of these issues, except illegal immigration, what opponents call flip-flops are just evolved positions based on the changing times, or the fact that he is now answering questions about federal policy, not just about his home state in Wisconsin. \u201cI would argue on any of those other issues that you brought up my position is as consistent today as it was all throughout that process,\u201d said Walker. \u201cAt town hall meetings, they ask me about that. When people hear the facts, as opposed to the spin, they say, \u2018Oh, that makes sense.\u2019\u201d",

The billionaire businessman is offending Hispanics and irking his GOP competitors but it\u2019s clear that his in-your-face demeanor and willingness to take on President Barack Obama \u2013 then just as quickly turn his sharp tongue toward members of his own party \u2013 is winning over Republican voters. \u201cEven though I\u2019m a Republican and I\u2019m obviously voting that way, I\u2019m very disappointed in the Republicans in the House. There\u2019s weakness there,\u201d said Julie Pagliarulo, a 56-year-old resident of Belmont, New Hampshire, who arrived hours early to see Trump speak. \u201cDonald just says it like it is. I love it.\u201d Friday\u2019s Fox News poll found Trump leading with support from 18% of Republican primary voters nationwide, compared to 15% for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and 14% for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Statistically speaking, the top three candidates are within the margin of error, and therefore tied \u2013 a point Trump tends to leave out of his speeches. READ: Trump says Bush\u2019s fundraising means \u2018he\u2019s doing favors\u2019 Belknap County, nestled in New Hampshire\u2019s picturesque southeastern lakes region, is home to 60,000 predominantly white residents. They tend to be middle class, with a median household income of nearly $59,000, according to Census data. The unemployment rate in May stood at a modest 3.3%, well below the 5.5% national rate that month. Each summer, Laconia \u2013 where Trump held his rally \u2013 plays host to one of the nation\u2019s largest gatherings of motorcyclists. The town is more than 2,000 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. On a recent muggy summer evening, residents here were angry about everything from border security and the economy to Benghazi, Obamacare and more. Trump was speaking to their grievances, an approach that helps explain his rise in the polls. Bert Hansen, 74 years old, joined hundreds of voters jammed into an overheated community center in Laconia waiting to see Trump. The soft-spoken veteran believes Obama is \u201cincompetent\u201d and bristles when recalling a relative who once said he was racist because he doesn\u2019t like the president. In fact, Hansen said, he\u2019s a big fan of GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, who is black. \u201cThere\u2019s some pent up frustration in the population right now that\u2019s ready to explode,\u201d Hansen said said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Trump\u2019s doing so well.\u201d New Hampshire voters said Trump spoke to their broad range of concerns. But his greatest appeal may be that they see him as authentic and unfiltered. The opposite, voters said, of even the Republicans they elected to serve them in Congress. \u201cWhen he talks, he talks like them. He has the same frustrations they do,\u201d said Craig Robinson, a GOP activist in Iowa and editor of The Iowa Republican website. \u201cThey still want someone who\u2019s just going to turn Washington on its head.\u201d READ: Donald Trump, Jeb Bush heckler Brenda Connolly, a 73-year-old independent voter, said she\u2019s disillusioned by politics these days. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re standing up to the president,\u201d she said of Republicans in Washington. \u201cI voted for them as an independent and I expected them to do a lot more.\u201d As for Trump, \u201cI\u2019m not even saying he\u2019s going to be the president, but I think he makes Republicans aware of what middle America wants,\u201d she said. It appears voters\u2019 views of Trump are not yet set in stone even though he\u2019s well known.  Some polls show his favorability numbers climbing among Republicans. The majority of Republicans \u2013 57% \u2013 had a favorable view of Trump and 40% had an unfavorable view or him in the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll. That\u2019s a big shift from late May, when the same poll found 65% of Republicans had an unfavorable view of Trump. There are limits to the billionaire\u2019s appeal in the context of a potential general election. More than six in 10 Americans viewed Trump negatively in the Post/ABC poll. And despite Trump\u2019s vow to win the Hispanic vote, his controversial comments about illegal immigration and America\u2019s relationship with Mexico are tarnishing him in the eyes of Latinos. More than seven out of 10 registered Hispanic voters said they had an unfavorable view of Trump, according to a Univision News poll. Univision recently cut ties with Trump and abandoned plans to air his Miss Universe Pageant. The former \u201cApprentice\u201d star\u2019s media savvy has helped his bid as well. Trump has pounced on a number of recent news events \u2013 the San Francisco killing of Kate Steinle by an undocumented immigrant and drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman\u2019s escape from the most secure prison in Mexico \u2013 to bolster his argument that the U.S. needs to secure the border and take a tougher line in its relationship with Mexico. Meanwhile, other GOP presidential contenders are trying to reclaim the mantle of Beltway outsider. Bush plans to deliver a speech Monday on how to reform Washington. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has tried to pitch himself as the straight talker in the field. Christie\u2019s performance so far hasn\u2019t impressed Bill Borrebach, a 68-year-old resident of Sandwich, New Hampshire, who makes it his business to see as many candidates as he can in this first-in-the-nation primary state. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he has the wherewithal to go to Mrs. Clinton and say we\u2019re tired of all her stuff,\u201d he said of Christie. Borrebach flashed a Trump bumper sticker he had tucked into the pocket of his floral shirt. Breaking into a smile, he added, \u201cit\u2019s going to drive my neighbors nuts.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama may be enjoying the best summer of his presidency, studded with diplomatic and legal wins, but come autumn he faces a series of hard fights to protect other key elements of his agenda. Over the next several months, his immigration reforms appear poised to suffer another blow in the courts, preventing the executive orders issued last year from taking effect. This week\u2019s Iran deal, while unlikely to be blocked outright by lawmakers, seems destined to be picked apart by a skeptical Congress. And on a slate of other domestic matters, from climate to taxes to highway funding, political brawls are brewing. The return-to-earth isn\u2019t necessarily a surprise for the White House, which has characterized the spate of achievements over the last several weeks as the result of months and years of persistent work. And Obama and his administration are hardly strangers to drawn-out battles with Republican opponents on Capitol Hill. But the looming flash-points could blunt what\u2019s been an unabashed winning streak for the White House, one that came after many of Obama\u2019s critics began writing him off as a lame duck. Obama: Deal cuts off Iran's pathways to nuclear weapon RELATED: Obama defends Iran deal \u201cMy instructions to my team and my instructions to myself have always been that we are going to squeeze every last ounce of progress that we can make when I have the privilege \u2013 as long as I have the privilege of holding this office,\u201d the President said at a news conference last month. The last two months have been fertile for Obama\u2019s legacy \u2013 beginning when a central component of his signature health care law was upheld at the Supreme Court. The ruling was the last legal challenge to Obamacare, and though Republicans have kept up their vows to repeal it, the law appears assured to remain in place at least until Obama leaves office. A day after the health law ruling, the court extended same-sex marriage rights to couples in every state \u2013 buttressing a push by the White House to eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation. To claim his stake in the decision, Obama lit the White House in rainbow; the images went viral. His diplomatic thaw with Cuba was finalized in early July with the announcement that embassies would soon open in Washington and Havana, a validation of Obama\u2019s vow at the beginning of his presidency to engage traditional U.S. foes. And after two years of talks, a final agreement to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program emerged, forestalling for now a military strike and providing vindication for Obama\u2019s pledge to place diplomacy ahead of force. But the Iran pact faces scrutiny from dubious lawmakers, who worry it doesn\u2019t have enough teeth to prevent Tehran from eventually obtaining a nuclear weapon \u2013 even if that prospect is now delayed. Obama comments on Bill Cosby RELATED: Obama defines rape when asked about Bill Cosby As soon as the administration formally submits documents to Congress, a 60-day review period will begin in which Republicans are already promising to expose what they regard as weaknesses in the Iran agreement. They plan to spend the August recess generating opposition outside Washington, including during home-district town halls \u2014 the same forums that helped stoke anger as Obama was rallying support behind his health law during his first term. The president has already threatened a veto on any legislation that scuttles his Iran deal, and it\u2019s unlikely opponents of the plan can muster the two-thirds majorities needed to override him. But the White House hopes it can generate enough support for the plan so a veto isn\u2019t necessary \u2013 recognizing that international perceptions of the agreement could be diminished if only a minority of U.S. lawmakers say they support it. As he makes his case for Iran, Obama\u2019s sweeping changes on another potential legacy item \u2013 immigration \u2013 remain unrealized, forestalling for now the major deportation relief that was promised to an estimated 5 million undocumented immigrants. The new regulations have been mired in legal challenges since February, when they were originally meant to take effect. Earlier this month, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals \u2013 considered one of the most conservative in the nation \u2013 heard oral arguments about the legal merits of the actions. The skeptical line of questioning from two of the three judges was an indication the panel wasn\u2019t disposed to reverse a lower court decision barring the programs from going into effect. They could issue a ruling soon. Upholding the injunction means it could be months, or even years, before the immigration actions Obama signed can be fully realized. And if a Republican replaces him as president, the rules could never become reality. Immigration isn\u2019t the first time one of Obama\u2019s chief priorities has been subject to high-stakes litigation; the June ruling allowing health care subsidies came after a string of legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act, all of which allowed the law to remain intact. But unlike Obamacare, the expansion of deportation relief has yet to take effect \u2013 meaning attempts by Republicans to block it won\u2019t mean taking away a benefit already being enjoyed by millions of people. With the presidential election campaign well underway, legislative immigration reform no longer appears tenable before Obama leaves office. The presidential election season makes compromise \u2013 already a difficult proposition with a GOP controlled Congress \u2013 even more improbable, though the White House did score a win when Republicans helped push through key trade authorities last month that will allow Obama to finalize negotiations on a deal with Pacific Rim nations. The White House hopes it can also strike a deal on highway funding, which runs out at the end of July. But for now the two sides are at odds on what should be included in a long-term plan, and have only been able to pass stop-gap measures that last through the end of the year. On taxes, the plan Obama submitted in January to simplify the code and wring more income from investment income faced fierce resistance from Republicans. A bipartisan plan that emerged in the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month has the support of Rep. Paul Ryan, the key Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But that won\u2019t stave off a battle between conservatives who are opposed to new revenue, and a White House looking to fund key new initiatives. The return to battles with Congress wasn\u2019t far from the President\u2019s mind on Wednesday, when he urged his Republican rivals \u2013 who have watched him score back-to-back victories for the past several weeks \u2013 to assess his Iran deal fairly. \u201cWe live in Washington and politics do intrude,\u201d Obama acknowledged during his press conference Wednesday. \u201cI do expect the debate to be based on facts and not speculation or misinformation.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump \u2013 to quote the businessman himself \u2013 seems to be a \u201cvery rich\u201d man. His campaign boasted Wednesday that the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s net worth is \u201cin excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS,\u201d and that his income in 2014 was $362 million. While the Federal Election Commission confirmed Wednesday afternoon receipt of Trump\u2019s personal financial disclosure, it is not yet available on the FEC website. When asked for a copy of the full disclosure, campaign officials told CNN to request it from the FEC. The Trump campaign also reported Wednesday that the candidate loaned his campaign $1.8 million in the first days of his campaign and raised $92,000 from other donors. The campaign has spent $1.4 million, leaving less than $500,000 in the war chest at the end of the quarter. For Trump, who has never held public office, his full personal financial disclosure would offer the most comprehensive public look yet into his massive wealth. Submitting this document to the FEC is also a requirement for any presidential candidate that intends to participate in the first GOP primary debate hosted by Fox News in August. RELATED: Donald Trump, Jeb Bush heckler \u201cThis report was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump\u2019s massive wealth,\u201d the press release said. \u201cAs an example, if a building owned by Mr. Trump is worth $1.5 billion, the box checked is \u2018$50,000,000 or more.\u2019\u201d The amount of cash Trump has on hand will be particularly significant, showing how much more money Trump could afford to potentially put towards his own campaign. His campaign previously released a summary of Trump\u2019s finances as of June 2014. It put Trump\u2019s net assets at $9.2 billion, and with approximately $500 million in liabilities, the businessman\u2019s net worth was stated as $8.7 billion. \u201c[T]hey said I would never file my personal financial disclosure forms. I filed them early despite the fact that I am allowed two 45 days extensions,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cNow I have surged in the polls and am fighting to Make America Great Again.\u201d RELATED: Trump tweets photo of Nazi uniforms The bombastic businessman, now just a month into his campaign, is a polarizing figure. His controversial comments that some people illegally crossing into the United States from Mexico are \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d have drawn widespread backlash and put national GOP leaders on the defensive. Fifty-one percent of Americans believe Trump would do a bad job on foreign affairs, while just 17% say he would do a good job, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday. Trump gets better marks on the economy: 36% of those surveyed said Trump would do a good job managing the economy as president, while 34% said he would do a bad job. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s inflammatory remarks about immigration have also hurt his profits. Numerous corporations have announced that they are severing business ties with Trump. Macy\u2019s said earlier this month that it is phasing out the Trump-brand menswear line. And with NBC, there\u2019s more than one business venture at risk: Trump was the host of the popular reality TV show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and the network also decided it would no longer broadcast the Miss USA pageant, which Trump partly owns. Tuesday\u2019s press release claims that Trump was paid $213 million over the course of 14 seasons of \u201cThe Apprenftice.\u201d Trump\u2019s business deals with the city of New York have also come under scrutiny: Mayor Bill de Blasio said he is reviewing the real estate mogul\u2019s contracts with the city, including for a recently opened Trump golf course in the Bronx. But Trump has downplayed whatever financial hit he\u2019s taken so far. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news. I\u2019m very rich,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper earlier this month. \u201cThe money you\u2019re talking about is a lot but it\u2019s peanuts for me.\u201d Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign and a pro-Bush super PAC announced raising more than $114 million. Sara Murray and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is the 15th declared Republican presidential candidate this cycle He made his announcement in a tweet Monday morning and he's holding an event this evening Walker's claim to conservative fame came from surviving a recall effort following an extended labor fight in his state Walker has been polling ahead in the important early caucus state of Iowa Scott Walker, the political phenomenon who rose to national fame by taking on unions in one of the most blue-collar states, announced Monday that he\u2019ll seek the Republican nomination for president, using his kick-off rally to throw red meat to his conservative supporters. \u201cAmericans want to vote for something and for someone,\u201d Walker told the roaring crowd in Waukesha, Wisconsin. \u201cSo tonight, let me tell you what I\u2019m for. I\u2019m for reform, growth, safety. I\u2019m for transferring power from Washington into the hands of hard working tax payers in all states across the country, that\u2019s real reform.\u201d About 5,000 attendees had RSVP\u2019d to attend his Monday afternoon event in the Republican enclave just outside Milwaukee. The rally will be a remarkable political milestone for the 47-year-old second-term governor, who vaulted from the obscurity of the Milwaukee County executive to the top tier of a presidential campaign, thanks in large part to a historic gubernatorial recall effort that nearly ended his career in 2012. Walker\u2019s rally featured a roster of conservative voices throwing red meat to the crowd of Walker supporters who had been through his heated campaigns and survival of a recall effort. One of the earliest lines to rev up the crowd came from Rachel Campos-Duffy, wife of U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy who took a shot at the former President Bill Clinton and with a not-too-subtle nod to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. When she was describing the relationship between Walker and his wife Tonette, Campos-Duffy said \u201cThey\u2019ve been married for 24 years. 24 is Bill Clinton\u2019s favorite age.\u201d Walker stuck to key conservative talk-radio points throughout his 30-minute speech, hitting on a wide range of issues from climate change to ISIS. And where he could, he tied Hillary Clinton\u2019s name to Barack Obama\u2019s. Walker also ventured into the world of foreign policy \u2013 a place where he stumbled earlier this year \u2013 with confidence. In one line, clearly made for campaign advertisements, Walker looked directly into the camera and said; \u201cGoing forward the world must know, there is no greater friend and no greater enemy than the United States of America.\u201d The line received huge cheers from the audience. Walker laid in talk of his union battles and tax-cutting throughout the speech, but the lines which received the heartiest applause were about his support for Voter ID and Walker played up the hard-working fighter image Monday night, walking out on stage with no tie and his sleeves rolled up. Throughout the speech, the two-term governor sweated under the lights but delivered his key points smoothly. Walker received general applause during his talk of taking on teacher\u2019s unions and making broad conservative education reforms similar to those former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush made about a decade ago. But he got his loudest applause  when he knocked the Common Core national education standards \u2013 which he and other Republican governors largely supported before it became politically toxic for its association with Obama. In his first foray into a presidential campaign, Walker \u2013 one of the most recognizable and polarizing governors in the country \u2013 has emerged as a potentially formidable opponent to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Polling has consistently shown Walker leading the pack in Iowa, which borders southern Iowa, but he has fallen off in other national polling following a series of gaffes. The biggest question for him now, as he becomes the 15th major-name Republican candidate, will be whether he can break out of the pack in other key states like New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Walker has been a torchbearer for top conservative priorities, showing again this that he had a few more presents for the party\u2019s rightwing base. Just a day before he was set to kick off his campaign, Walker was signing a $73 billion budget that only narrowly made it to his desk. Included in there was the elimination of the \u201cprevailing wage\u201d \u2013 a minimum wage for construction projects \u2013 and a sizable cut to the state\u2019s university system. Walker was forced to backtrack, however, on an unannounced plan to curb government transparency by limiting access to public records. Indeed, Walker has been a polarizing figure \u2013 infuriating and mobilizing the left, in particular organized labor. By Monday afternoon, nearly 100 protesters had gathered outside his rally at the Waukesha Expo Center, though no protestors appeared to get into the rally itself. Although Walker waited to launch his White House bid, he has been laying down the groundwork for a national campaign for months. The union-busting governor has been courting donors, traveling overseas and boosting his national profile by publicly tussling with President Barack Obama on issues like the nuclear deal with Iran. The next several months will be a critical test for Walker. After his campaign announcement, the governor will crisscross the country, including a three-day RV tour through Iowa this coming weekend. A few months after taking office in 2011, Walker signed a measure to curb collective bargaining rights for most public employees in the state, framing it as an effort to take on the \u201cbig government special interests\u201d and give power back to Wisconsin taxpayers. The move triggered fierce backlash from labor unions and their progressive allies, sparking massive protests at the state capitol in Madison. Conservatives in Wisconsin and around the country came to Walker\u2019s defense, helping the governor withstand a recall effort in 2012. Walker went on to win re-election by six points in 2014, his third statewide victory in four years. It is that recall experience, more than any other, that has helped lay the groundwork for Walker\u2019s presidential bid. At the time, Walker said his recall victory proved that \u201cvoters really do want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions.\u201d That is a message that Walker has promoted in recent months while exploring a presidential campaign, calling on the Republican Party to look for \u201cfresh leadership\u201d and someone with \u201cbig, bold ideas and the courage to act on it.\u201d Veteran GOP strategist Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012, says Walker\u2019s union-busting efforts helped him to burnish his conservative credentials by demonstrating his ability to taken on \u201cthe national [Democratic]establishment\u201d and beat them on three consecutive occasions. Beyond his record as governor, Walker\u2019s Midwestern roots will be an invaluable asset in the GOP nominating fight \u2013 Wisconsin voters haven\u2019t picked a Republican for president since 1984. Walker is poised to make the case that his candidacy could put other Great Lakes states on the electoral map that have been out of reach for Republicans in recent cycles, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, which haven\u2019t voted for the GOP nominee since 1988. \u201cThe path for a Republican to win the presidency comes through the Midwest,\u201d Walker told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in April. \u201cIt comes from Iowa and Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio and we\u2019re even going to include Pennsylvania because they\u2019re part of the Big Ten,\u201d he added. Walker also has a personal narrative that could enable him to appeal to low-income voters, a group Republicans lost overwhelmingly in 2008 and 2012, with the struggles in the latter campaign fueled in part by Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent\u201d comments. Walker is the son of a Baptist minister and an Eagle Scout, who attended Marquette University for three years before dropping out to take a job with the Red Cross. Walker has taken to citing his humble beginnings during recent appearances, setting up a contrast between his background and that of one of his key 2016 rivals \u2013 Bush. \u201cI realize unlike some out there I didn\u2019t inherit fame or fortune from my family,\u201d Walker said during a speech to a Christian broadcasters convention in February. \u201cI got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that. I got from my parents and my grandparents the belief that if you work hard and you play by the rules, here in America you can do and be anything you want.\u201d Walker  has already experienced challenges that come with being thrust into the national spotlight in the months leading up to his campaign\u2019s official launch. Unlike some of his peers in the Republican field like Bush, who lived through the White House campaigns of his father and brother, or former 2012 presidential candidates Rick Perry or Rick Santorum, Walker is facing head-on for the first time the reality of just how much scrutiny comes with a presidential campaign. And it\u2019s shown. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Walker raised eyebrows when he seemed to compare the task of fighting ISIS to taking on thousands of protesters in his state. Earlier that month, a trip to London resulted in a slew of unflattering headlines when Walker, despite his best efforts to avoid making news during the overseas trip, punted on a question about the theory of evolution. In March, several news outlets, including CNN, reported that at a private gathering in New Hampshire, Walker had endorsed a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants. This would have marked a notable reversal for Walker who had staked out a more conservative position on the divisive issue, and pundits were quick to suggest that the governor had flip flopped. Joe McQuaid, publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader whose office is a must-visit early state stop for presidential candidates, remarked at the time that the controversy surrounding Walker\u2019s reported immigration remarks showed that this is the governor\u2019s \u201cfirst time outside of Wisconsin.\u201d \u201cIt is a guy in his first presidential campaign trying to get himself grounded and see where he needs to be nuanced,\u201d McQuaid said in a recent interview. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t dealt with these issues on a regular basis.\u201d Walker could give Bush a run for his money. Over the past few months, the governor has made aggressive overtures to wealthy financiers and prominent Republican donors, presenting himself as a conservative alternative to others in the field. Bush\u2019s extensive fundraising network, founded on decades-old family friendships, will be difficult to compete with. But in the earliest stages of the campaign, Walker\u2019s political action committee, Our American Revival, has boasted impressive commitments and donations from prominent donors and bundlers in fundraising epicenters like New York, California and Texas. And it\u2019s not just deep-pocketed donors that Walker is banking on. The recall fight that made the governor a national figure could be a boon for his fundraising efforts among small-dollar donors. Walker raised more than $30 million for the recall campaign, which helped him grow his donor to list to some 300,000 supporters. Walker and his supporters say they\u2019re eager to win over a new generation of donors. \u201cOur donor is not the tried and true Republican donor in New York City that\u2019s given to everybody since Reagan, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of the investment firm SkyBridge Capital who is raising money for Walker, told CNN earlier this month. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the mercenary donor that\u2019s paying for past political favors.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Walker aides and allies admit that Iowa is their top prize Taking a sharp turn to the right to appeal to the GOP base is hardly new for Republican candidates The backlash began as soon as Scott Walker called for a constitutional amendment to allow states to decide whether same-sex marriage should be legal. Walker\u2019s forceful rhetoric, shortly after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, shocked some donors and their representatives \u2013 a message they passed along to campaign staffers, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations. He met disappointment at home, too. His two sons support same-sex marriage. A day after calling for the amendment \u2013 and pronouncing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d \u2013 Walker offered a different tone in a speech to conservatives in Denver. This time he called for respect on the same-sex marriage ruling. He made no mention of a push for a constitutional amendment. This, in a nutshell, is the central challenge to a Walker candidacy: Can a strategy tailored to winning Iowa allow him to survive beyond that? RELATED: Scott Walker\u2019s account tweets that he\u2019s running for President \u201cI think what he\u2019s trying to do is to find his voice and to try to find his voice nationally,\u201d said Doug Heye, a GOP strategist and campaign veteran. \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult thing for somebody who\u2019s only campaigned in one state his whole career.\u201d Walker will make his candidacy for President official on Monday and then embark on a tour of the early voting states, culminating in a three-day jaunt across Iowa in an RV. Privately, Walker aides and allies admit that Iowa is their top prize. Recent polls show Walker with an average lead of nearly eight points in the state, according to Real Clear Politics. For a candidate who is casting himself as \u201cfighter\u201d and touting three election victories in four years, the Hawkeye State is a must-win. Walker\u2019s advisers dismissed the notion that there\u2019s been any change in his approach on key issues. Scott Walker's career \u201cThere is no story behind the story,\u201d Rick Wiley, one of Walker\u2019s top advisers, said of his approach to the same-sex marriage decision. \u201cHe always thought that this should be a decision left up to the states.\u201d But Walker\u2019s shifting attempts to strike the right balance on lightning rod issues from immigration to same-sex marriage to abortion highlight the conundrum he faces in trying to build a winning coalition in socially conservative Iowa and remain viable in the states beyond, donors and GOP strategists said. Charlie Sykes, a Wisconsin conservative radio host who has known Walker well for two decades, said Walker\u2019s strident tone on the gay marriage ruling last month caught people back home off guard because historically he had been \u201calmost agnostic\u201d on the subject. \u201cI was surprised, because I thought there was probably an easier way to finesse that,\u201d said Sykes. When a federal court struck down a same-sex marriage ban in Wisconsin last year, Walker said the fight was over in Wisconsin and deemed it an issue for officials at the federal level. Even then he didn\u2019t call for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. \u201cI think it\u2019s resolved,\u201d Walker told reporters at the time. RELATED: Walker spars with GOP ahead of 2016 launch In Wisconsin, Sykes explained, Walker didn\u2019t have to navigate a fractured GOP, which is at the heart of the Republican presidential primary process. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Scott wants to be outflanked on the right,\u201d said Sykes. On immigration, Walker has moved from his support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to declaring he is not in favor of amnesty and, at times, even sounding protectionist as he questioned the country\u2019s approach to legal immigration. His packaging of his anti-abortion views has been through a similar evolution. In an ad for his 2014 reelection race, Walker touted his pro-life position, but went on to say he supported legislation that \u201cleaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor.\u201d Who's running for President? Now Walker is taking a harder line, preparing to sign a bill in Wisconsin that would ban all abortions after 20 weeks, including in the case of rape and incest. The approach appears to be currying favor for Walker among some social conservatives. Penny Young Nance, chief executive of the conservative group Concerned Women for America, said she\u2019s grown more comfortable with Walker\u2019s conservative credentials after spending time with him on a couple of occasions. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see who he is,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s being very plainspoken and gone the extra mile to be very clear on what he believes.\u201d Others still need some convincing. Bob Vander Plaats, chief executive of the Iowa social conservative group The Family Leader, describes his relationship with Walker as a courtship in the early stages. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t believe him,\u201d said Vander Plaats, who will host Walker and other GOP candidates at a forum later this month. \u201cWe have to kind of make sure that that\u2019s a genuine belief.\u201d Taking a sharp turn to the right in order to win the top spot in Iowa and other GOP primaries is hardly a new challenge for Republicans. Social conservative firebrands Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, and Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, both notched victories in Iowa but failed to win broader support to clinch the nomination. Mitt Romney\u2019s conservative shifts in 2012 gave Democrats plenty of ammunition to paint him as a flip-flopper. In an effort to bolster his credentials with the right, Romney called for \u201cself-deportation\u201d for undocumented immigrants, a comment that haunted him in the general election and helped President Barack Obama sail to victory. RELATED: Can Walker win the Harley vote? The far-right allure is a particular concern for Republican donors, who are tired of seeing their candidates bogged down in battles over social issues and crippling themselves with Hispanic voters. On some issues, such as gay marriage, many donors are more progressive. A number of prominent GOP donors support same-sex marriage. At a recent fundraising retreat in Utah, hosted by Romney, one donor asked Walker how he would avoid being dragged into a prolonged fight over social issues. Walker said it was important to be disciplined and cognizant that a national presidential race is broader than a gubernatorial campaign in Wisconsin. \u201cI\u2019m a social conservative, as well as economic and fiscal one, so I don\u2019t think that the answer is to run away from your position,\u201d Walker said. \u201cJust make it clear to the American people that this is where you stand.\u201d Will biker cred help Scott Walker with Harley voters? While voters might be familiar with the governor\u2019s election victories or his fight with the unions, his campaign plans to flesh out his record in Wisconsin, particularly on education and economic issues, to make their case. His advisers are already looking further down the field to opportunities in states that vote in early March, like Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama that could help him win the nomination. Walker\u2019s team hopes to prove his message resonates across party lines, Wiley said. One point in their favor: When Walker won re-election in Wisconsin in 2014, he carried independent voters by 11 points, exit polls show. \u201cYou can see the true benefit that a family in Wisconsin has received over the last four years,\u201d said Wiley. \u201cThat\u2019s the great untold story. Everybody just thinks this guy took on the unions and he won, but there\u2019s a lot more to it.\u201d In fact, Walker\u2019s early strength in Iowa shows that his message is already making inroads with different factions, from social conservatives to fiscal-oriented voters, said Matt Strawn, former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. \u201cThe good news for Walker is he\u2019s demonstrating support across disparate groups of Iowa Republicans,\u201d Strawn said. \u201cThe downside is that means the shots are going to be coming from all sides.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Maeve Reston contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Clinton is taking the most liberal positions possible on undocumented immigrants' rights Bush has tried to strike a more inclusive tone than many of his primary opponents There\u2019s a reason that Hillary Clinton\u2019s attack on Jeb Bush over immigration sparked one of the sharpest exchanges between the two 2016 presidential campaigns. They\u2019re holding mirrors up to each other. Clinton, who has at times been tepid in the past, is taking the most liberal positions possible on undocumented immigrants\u2019 rights \u2013 including supporting a pathway to citizenship. Bush, who\u2019s been a leading Republican advocate of immigration reform, doesn\u2019t share that position, even as he strikes a more inclusive tone than many of his primary opponents. It\u2019s a play by Clinton to broaden Democrats\u2019 appeal to Latino voters in key swing states, while also hurting the GOP. Bush, meanwhile, is trying to expand the Republican tent without alienating conservatives whose support he\u2019ll need to win the nomination. What they agree on, though, is that the other is a flip-flopper. RELATED: Fact checking Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush on immigration The campaigns traded barbs after Clinton hit Bush in a CNN interview, saying he\u2019s \u201con the spectrum of hostility\u201d with Donald Trump and accusing Bush of changing his position on allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain citizenship. Bush\u2019s campaign hit back by saying Clinton\u2019s newfound support for immigration reform comes out of political expediency, and is a break from her previous stances, as well. At this stage of the campaign, it might not be a bad fight for either of them to have. Clinton\u2019s strategy on immigration mirrors what she\u2019s done on gay rights, criminal justice and more: Run as far to the left as she possibly can in hopes of baiting Republicans into a fight and to position herself as the new leader of the young, diverse coalition of voters who propelled President Barack Obama into the White House. Donald Trump: Jeb Bush is weak on immigration It\u2019s an attempt to exploit issues that present a clear divide between the Republican primary electorate and mainstream American public opinion. If she succeeds in drawing out Bush and other leading GOP contenders now, while they\u2019re still courting conservatives, it could be more difficult for them to appeal to a broader swath of the voting public. That approach has won praise on the left. \u201cHis campaign goal is to blur the distinction between Hillary and himself, and her campaign objective is to make a bright-line distinction between the two of them,\u201d said Frank Sharry, the executive director of the progressive immigration reform group America\u2019s Voice. Still, for Bush, there\u2019s upside in the back-and-forth with Clinton, and it\u2019s all about the election he must win first. Immigration is an issue likely to prove challenging for Republicans in the 2016 general election, no matter the party\u2019s nominee. But Bush has to get there first. And conservative distrust of his position on immigration is a roadblock. Being attacked by Clinton for being too far to the right on the issue won\u2019t hurt him, particularly in Iowa, the first state to vote in the nominating process. RELATED: Hillary Clinton calls out Jeb Bush over immigration In the Hawkeye State, 46% of likely Republican caucus-goers say undocumented immigrants should be required to leave, while 17% say those immigrants should be allowed to stay but without a path to obtaining citizenship, according to Quinnipiac University polling data released Monday. Just 34% said they should stay with a path to citizenship. Jeb Bush goes off script with immigration protestors Bush has taken different positions on whether undocumented immigrants should have a path to U.S. citizenship. What he\u2019s talked about on the campaign trail is a path to legal status, which would allow undocumented immigrants to remain lawfully in the United States, work in the country and travel in and out of it. Citizenship, though, confers more rights, such as voting and eligibility for benefits like Social Security. Citizens also can\u2019t be deported for committing crimes \u2013 and Bush has supported that idea before. In his 2013 book, Bush opposed the idea of allowing undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. But when a Senate immigration reform bill that year included such a pathway, Bush called it \u201cfine,\u201d offering his endorsement for the bill and suggesting that while he prefers to grant immigrants only \u201clegal status,\u201d he was on board with citizenship if it was what was politically viable at the time. He has, however, been more supportive of providing citizenship to so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2013 or young people who were brought illegally into the United States as children. Clinton, meanwhile, has offered her full-throated backing for granting \u201ca path to full and equal citizenship\u201d to undocumented immigrants already in the United States while on the campaign trail. Still, Bush has sought to broaden the GOP\u2019s appeal, taking an inclusive tone toward immigrants. And his campaign was ready to respond when Clinton attacked. Clinton took the first shot at Bush in an interview with CNN\u2019s Brianna Keiler, using Donald Trump\u2019s controversial remarks about Mexicans to say that the entire GOP presidential field is \u201con a spectrum of hostility.\u201d Then, she went after Bush directly. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does,\u201d she said. Bush\u2019s campaign responded with an attack on Clinton, highlighting her statement that unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S.-Mexico border \u201cshould be sent back\u201d to their home countries last year \u2013 which Clinton walked back. She also said in 2008 that undocumented immigrants shouldn\u2019t be able to obtain driver\u2019s licenses. \u201cHillary Clinton will say anything to get elected, and her numerous flip-flops on immigration prove it,\u201d Emily Benavides, a Bush campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement. The hope for Bush, who once wrote a book called \u201cImmigration Wars,\u201d is that his history on the issue would make him more trustworthy to Latino voters in the general election. Sharry said Bush\u2019s comments during the current campaign have undermined those hopes, though. \u201cHe was hoping to take immigration off the table, and he can\u2019t do that now because he\u2019s had to make concessions in the primary that are going to haunt him in the general,\u201d Sharry said. \u201cHe can try to come back to the middle, but John McCain had the same experience,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t unring the bell.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A South Carolina lesson leads to buzz about a possible VP pick Bernie Sanders faces a big test with African-Americans Scott Walker's got a neighborly advantage in Iowa A South Carolina lesson, how Scott Walker could be the 15th GOP candidate to jump into the 2016 race but end up in the top spot, John Kasich\u2019s New Hampshire strategy, an important test for Bernie Sanders with African-Americans, and Jeb Bush\u2019s bid to win over Iowa conservatives \u2013 those stories filled a lively trip around the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker officially enters the GOP presidential race Monday, and despite a bit of a rough patch of late, it is clear he starts with ideological and geographical advantages. Walker...running Conservatives like Walker because of his repeated battles with labor unions in Wisconsin. And it should not be forgotten that his state shares a border \u2013 and television markets \u2013 with the leadoff caucus state of Iowa. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny noted that those and other advantages all but guarantee Walker will be an impact player in the GOP race. \u201cHe has one foot in the evangelical camp, one foot in a tea party camp, and he has shown that he can win election after election after election,\u201d said Zeleny. \u201cOnce he gets in on Monday, I believe he will be the most formidable candidate in Iowa.  So, he\u2019s No. 15 but he could be No. 1.\u201d Ohio Gov. John Kasich is next in line to officially join the crowded GOP field \u2013 and it is already clear he views New Hampshire as his critical early test. So his super PAC isn\u2019t waiting for the official announcement, but launching a pricey ad buy in recent days in hopes of building Kasich\u2019s profile \u2013 and support \u2013 in the leadoff primary state. Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast shared reporting on the Kasich calculation. \u201cNew Day for America, the group supporting John Kasich\u2019s run, spent something like $1.7 million in New Hampshire last week for an ad buy,\u201d said Kucinich. \u201cThat is the beginning of a very large ad buy for John Kasich in New Hampshire. They\u2019re going to dump a lot of money there to make sure every New Hampshirite knows his name.\u201d Jeb Bush has stabilized in national and New Hampshire polls, and reported some eye-popping fund-raising numbers this past week. But Iowa remains a struggle. So play it down and focus on New Hampshire and beyond? Ed O\u2019Keefe of The Washington Post reports that Team Bush isn\u2019t ready to make that concession \u2013 at least not until it makes a head-on effort to sway some skeptics in the state\u2019s most conservative pockets. \u201cI talked to Congressman Steve King this week who, of course, represents most of the area. He says, look, Bush may be the guy who comports himself most like a president, but nobody is talking about him up here,\u201d said O\u2019Keefe. \u201cBut they say, if he comes, if he explains himself, if he reminds them that he\u2019s quite the social conservative, perhaps he\u2019s got a chance.  And with so many other conservatives out there, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, there\u2019s a chance that he could perhaps do well enough.\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is making noise in the Democratic race because of his strong support among liberals. But there is a big missing piece, and Sanders is setting out to try to address an important campaign weakness. Sanders and the black vote Nia-Malika Henderson of CNN shared reporting on the stakes as Sanders ventures to Louisiana on July 23 to attend a major gathering \u2013 the Southern Christian Leadership Conference \u2013 and his biggest African-American audience to date. \u201cIn speeches lately, Bernie Sanders has been talking about \u2018white allies\u2019 in the civil rights movement; he\u2019s been talking about his endorsement of Jesse Jackson way back in 1988,\u201d said Henderson.  \u201cSome people want him to be a little bit more up-to-date in what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d So the gathering is a big test for Sanders to see if he will be able to retool his stump speech and gain any traction with a group that previously hasn\u2019t paid him much attention. South Carolina closed the page on a divisive chapter in its history Friday, and what a powerful example it was. The Confederate flag came down from its perch on the State House grounds, in a ceremony that was graceful and respectful. The flag debate has polarized state politics for years, but the flag is now off in a museum. And the Republican governor who pushed for fast action on the issue promises to lead the state in a conversation about race and tolerance. Without a doubt, Gov. Nikki Haley is now a rising national GOP voice and a certainty to make lists of potential vice presidential contenders. We will see over the next several months how she handles that spotlight. And we will see if by any chance the South Carolina example might be copied. The flag debate, after all, for years appeared as intractable as the divides over, say, immigration and gun control. Wishful thinking, no doubt, but you don\u2019t know if you don\u2019t try.",

            "article_content": "Supporters say Donald Trump speaks for them on immigration Republican presidential candidate says Mexico is being smart and sending criminals He scoffs at dozens of protesters, claims one was probably sent by Mexico because he speaks out on trade issues The father of a high school football star who was killed seven years ago by an undocumented immigrant praised Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday for his stance on illegal immigration. Jamiel Shaw Sr. said controversial statements about Mexicans and other immigrants the billionaire made during his announcement that he was running for office resonated with him. \u201cHe\u2019s speaking for the dead. He\u2019s speaking for my son,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cHe\u2019s speaking for the people who can\u2019t speak for themselves that demand that somebody do something.\u201d Shaw said Trump had gone easy with his language when he talked about Mexican undocumented immigrants being \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ccriminals.\u201d \u201cI would have said they were murderers. My son was murdered,\u201d he said. RELATED: San Francisco sheriff says feds to blame in immigrant shooting case Shaw\u2019s son was fatally shot in 2008 just outside the family\u2019s Los Angeles home by a gang member from Mexico. Trump met with Shaw and other relatives of victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.  Then flanked by the families, he gave another lengthy news conference, claiming Mexico was sending its criminals to the United States. \u201cThe fact that they are sending criminals and prisoners into our country and there are people stupid enough to put them in jails or let them roam the street, which is even worse, I have to respect (Mexico) for it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know it you know, (former Cuban leader Fidel) Castro, many years ago, opened up his prisons and sent his prisoners to the United States,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn a much more sophisticated manner, Mexico is doing the same thing.\u201d RELATED: Donald Trump moves immigration rally to larger venue The victims\u2019 family members spoke emotionally about their children, how they were killed and lamented that they received very little help from political figures and the media. Sabine Durden\u2019s son Dominic died three years ago when he was riding a motorcycle struck by a car driven by an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala. Durden said Trump is a voice for her and others who think the same way. \u201cWhen I heard Mr. Trump, I started screaming. I started hooting and hollering,\u201d Durden said. \u201cFinally, somebody that had the guts to say what millions are thinking but are afraid to say.\u201d During the hourlong news conference, Trump again insisted that he will win a majority of votes from Latinos in the presidential election next year. He blamed the controversy over his quotes about Mexicans on the media and predicted he would be misquoted again. RELATED: Military analysts say Donald Trump\u2019s plan to bomb Iraq\u2019s oil fields not a good one Several dozen people demonstrated outside the hotel where Trump was scheduled to speak after the news conference, not where he was meeting with the parents of the victims. They chanted and carried signs with messages such as \u201cEnd the Criminalization of our Communities.\u201d Trump scoffed at the protesters. He said one was well-spoken and was probably was sent by Mexico, because he was speaking out forcefully on what he called bad trade deals. Trump often sparred with several reporters who asked repeatedly about his prior comments and about the demonstrators. One asked how he could be misquoted if the statement was online for people to see. \u201cAll you have to do is read it. Did you go to college?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cDid you got to college?\u201d He was asked whether he needed to apologize. \u201cShould I apologize? It was stated as fact. I know it\u2019s not pleasant, but it was stated as fact,\u201d he said. Another brought up sanctuary cities, like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle was shot and killed while walking on a pier with her father. \u201cI think the sanctuary cities are a disgrace,\u201d Trump said. The brash real estate mogul said he is not against all immigrants. \u201cI want people to come into the country. Let it be legal,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s famous brawls with Democrats and labor unions put him on the political map. But squabbles with fellow Republicans here at the Wisconsin Statehouse are tripping him up as he prepares to formally enter the 2016 presidential race on Monday. Republicans in Madison had worked overtime in recent weeks to find an elusive deal for the state\u2019s two-year, $73 billion budget. Just a few months ago, Walker optimistically said he would announce his White House plans after he finished all-important budget negotiations. But fights among Republicans over road funding, cuts in higher education spending and a new arena for the Milwaukee Bucks delayed talks to a point where Walker had to tamp down that expectation a few weeks ago. In a rare move that has his fiscal conservative backers frustrated, Walker has been pushing hard to find $250 million for a new arena to keep the Bucks from moving. That effort to include the Bucks deal as part of the bigger budget was scrapped amid concerns that GOP leaders in the legislature would not be able to find enough support from their rank-and-file. With just four days left before the Walker announcement, the state Assembly passed the budget early Thursday, sending the bill to the governor\u2019s desk. The next day, Walker\u2019s office put out word that he would sign the budget on Sunday in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha, the same town where he will launch his bid the next day. READ: Immigration: The debate Republicans don\u2019t want For any governor running for President, it\u2019s a vexing problem. Walker\u2019s brand, like the other governors seeking the White House, is built on the promise that running their home state effectively makes them fit to lead the nation in a way that no senator ever could. But the national focus on Walker has shifted recently from what he accomplished between 2011 and 2014 to the intraparty struggles he has faced more recently. Charles Franklin, a veteran Wisconsin pollster and director of the Marquette Law School Poll, said Walker might be a victim of his own success after clearing a litany of top conservative goals from the shelf in Wisconsin. The list includes starting a statewide school voucher program, privatizing the state\u2019s economic development arm (albeit one plagued questionable decisions currently) and making Wisconsin a concealed carry state. \u201cIf you listed all of the things that have passed during Walker\u2019s tenure it\u2019s a long and impressive list,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cThe big and bold thing was Act 10 (labor measures from 2011), but to me all of the small ball things matter.\u201d Walker still sits atop most polls of Iowa Republican caucus-goers, but that early lead has dwindled somewhat. The Koch brothers, who were among many billionaire donors to Walker\u2019s 2012 recall battle, meanwhile have indicated they will likely wait before throwing their resources behind a single candidate (if they select one at all, this cycle.) Walker\u2019s meeting with state lawmakers this year hasn\u2019t carried the gravitas of the 2011 national labor fight. But he has pushed for some equally heavy conservative policies, many top priorities for the funders who could carry him through a very crowded Republican field. In March, Walker signed a controversial \u201cright to work\u201d ban on mandatory union fees. In May, he announced he wanted to repeal the state\u2019s \u201cprevailing wage,\u201d which establishes a minimum wage for construction workers on publicly financed projects. And a few days later, Walker said he would sign a new 20-week ban on abortions, even in cases of rape or incest. READ: Walker plans Super Tuesday presidential blitz Democrats are quick to point out that during the 2014 election, which Walker won by roughly 6 points, the governor made no mention of his support for any of the explosive issues and was often obtuse, as in an ad where he said that abortion should be a decision between a \u201cwoman and her doctor.\u201d Walker\u2019s office points to myriad accomplishments he\u2019s had, both at the start of his first term and in his latest budget proposal offered this year. Spokeswoman Laurel Patrick pointed out a two-year freeze in student tuition at public universities, drug-testing for welfare recipients and other items this year. \u201cSince taking office, Governor Walker has bucked the status quo in Wisconsin. His bold, common-sense reforms are about empowering taxpayers and putting them in control. Giving Wisconsinites the freedom to control their own lives creates prosperity for our people, as well as our state,\u201d Patrick wrote in an email. Behind the scenes at the Wisconsin Capitol, Walker has come under fire for spending too much time on the campaign trail, while major decisions linger. Walker\u2019s focus on the campaign trail, including high-profile trips abroad to Canada and Israel dubbed \u201ctrade missions,\u201d has left the state unattended, said the Wisconsin Assembly Democratic Leader Peter Barca, who has scrapped regularly with Walker throughout his five year\u2019s in the governor\u2019s office. \u201cYou just add up the time he\u2019s been away over the course of the past couple of months, on trade deals, not even to mention his political visits. I bet you he\u2019s been in 15-20 states in the last month alone,\u201d Barca said. \u201cHe\u2019s just obviously is not putting much attention here.\u201d It\u2019s a different governor, Barca said, than the man who pushed through \u201cAct 10\u201d and the major overhaul in labor laws that would eventually make him a national hero among conservatives and Republican donors. \u201cHe was very much hands on, he was here all the time and working it hard and talking to anyone he thought could help him have success,\u201d Barca said. \u201cWisconsin\u2019s in the rearview mirror, and it\u2019s getting more and more distant by the day.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A trio of super PACs supporting former Texas Gov. Rick Perry has raised neared $17 million, according to a senior adviser for the groups. Two pro-Perry groups \u2013 Opportunity and Freedom PAC and Opportunity and Freedom PAC I \u2013 raised $12.8 million in the first half of the year. A third super PAC, which was created Thursday, collected a $4 million check from a single donor, bringing the full tally for the three groups to $16.8 million as of July 10, said Austin Barbour, the senior adviser to all three affiliated entities. Just minutes after news broke of the super PAC\u2019s impressive haul, the official campaign said it had raised only $1.07 million, bringing the grand total of his collections to nearly $18 million. Perry had less time than his competitors to collect checks \u2013 he only announced his campaign about a month ago \u2013 but his headquarters\u2019 total was the smallest of any of the Republicans who have released their sums, and is slightly less than GOP contender Carly Fiorina\u2019s campaign haul. In a statement, Perry campaign manager Jeff Miller made sure to refer to the super PAC\u2019s success in pitching their viability. \u201cGovernor Perry is well positioned and between the campaign and independent sources, the necessary funds will be in place to run a competitive, successful campaign,\u201d Miller said. The super PAC total falls far short of the $103 million Jeb Bush\u2019s super PAC has raised, but it is competitive with others in the GOP field. That\u2019s a promising sign for Perry, who has faced questions from GOP voters and donors alike about whether he can mount a comeback after his embarrassing 2012 presidential bid. RELATED: Bush raises over $100 million to help his campaign \u201cLook, nobody\u2019s going to compete with Jeb Bush, it\u2019s impossible. Congratulations to them,\u201d Barbour said. But, \u201cwe have enough money now to keep us competitive in this process for a long time.\u201d Barbour said their robust fundraising lends his candidate additional credibility. It also gives bundlers an opening to circle back with hesitant donors and pitch them on supporting Perry or writing larger checks. Wealthy Texas donors helped fuel the fundraising for the pro-Perry groups. Kelcy Warren, a Dallas billionaire and chief executive of an energy company whose board of directors includes Perry, gave a $6 million contribution. Warren is also the finance chairman for Perry\u2019s presidential campaign. RELATED: First on CNN: Rubio super PAC pre-buy Darwin Deason, another Dallas billionaire who founded an information technology company that was later acquired by Xerox Corporation, gave $5 million. Brint Ryan, chief executive of tax services firm Ryan LLC, is serving as the finance chairman for all three groups, which have collected donations from dozens of contributors. Barbour said he and other Perry allies organized three super PACs because high-dollars donors want to have more input in the process this election cycle than they did in 2012. For instance, many of his biggest contributors are eager to tout Perry\u2019s record of job creation in Texas. \u201cIf they were going to give a million dollars or $5 million they really want to be able to participate,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cThey know that the final decisions on strategy and execution still lie with me and our team.\u201d RELATED: Pro-Rubio outside groups take in more than $30 million The super PACs still have most of their cash on hand, Barbour said, although they have spent more than $1 million already in paid television and digital advertising in Iowa. \u201cWe made this decision a long time ago that we were going to go early in Iowa,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cWe feel like we have clean air,\u201d giving them an edge to reintroduce voters to the governor before the airwaves become too crowded. The Perry campaign and super PACs are all betting heavily on a strong showing in Iowa and on the debate stage to carry the candidate further along in the process. That\u2019s why the super PACs have also spent a \u201csignificant amount\u201d to reach a large conservative audience nationally to try to boost Perry\u2019s polling and ensure he makes the debate stage, Barbour said. Perry comes in eighth place with 4% support among Republicans in the latest CNN/ORC poll. Averages of recent national polls indicate he will likely qualify for the first debate. As for the recent Donald Trump mania, Barbour said Perry\u2019s exchanges with the brash businessman over immigration policies are a welcome fight. \u201cIf the conversation is about border security, nobody knows it better than Rick Perry,\u201d Barbour said.",

            "article_content": "RNC Chairman Reince Priebus called Donald Trump on Wednesday evening Trump said Priebus was \"congratulatory\" but asked him to tone down his public remarks Donald Trump is pushing back against reports that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus voiced concerns to him about the billionaire\u2019s tone when talking about undocumented immigrants during a Wednesday phone call. Trump instead told CNN on Thursday the call had a \u201ccongratulatory\u201d tone \u2013 but conceded that Priebus suggested he \u201ctone it down a little bit.\u201d \u201cHe did say, \u2018you know, you could keep it down a little bit, but you can\u2019t change your personality and I understand that.\u2019 It was really a nice call, a congratulatory call,\u201d Trump told CNN. Trump said Priebus congratulated him on his surge in the polls, telling Trump that he\u2019s \u201cliterally not seen anything like this.\u201d The RNC declined comment on Thursday on Trump\u2019s version of events. The Washington Post first reported Priebus\u2019 phone call to Trump. Donald Trump: I stand by what I read from Univision RELATED: Top 6 Trump takeaways A Republican source familiar with the call told CNN on Wednesday that Priebus expressed his concern to Trump during the call and that they discussed a range of topics. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve gotta tell you, I spent four years trying to make inroads with the Hispanic community \u2026 how we address illegal immigration is very important,\u201d to winning back Hispanics politically, Priebus said at the end of the call, according to the GOP source. Trump first told CNN he may have brought up the issue of immigration himself, mentioning the San Francisco shooting at the hands of an illegal immigrant. The bombastic businessman also insisted he would \u201cwin the Hispanic vote\u201d because he will create the most jobs of any presidential candidate. Trump calls out Rubio for being \u2018weak\u2019 on immigration, praises Cruz And Trump gave an emphatic \u201cno\u201d when asked if his comments hurt the GOP\u2019s efforts to make inroads with Hispanic voters. Earlier on Thursday, Trump tweeted that the media had \u201ctotally false reporting\u201d on his call with Priebus, suggesting the RNC chief didn\u2019t suggest toning down his immigration remarks. \u201cHe called me, ten minutes, said I hit a \u201cnerve\u201d, doing well, end!\u201d Trump tweeted. Totally false reporting on my call with @Reince Priebus. He called me, ten minutes, said I hit a \u201cnerve\", doing well, end! But a source said on Wednesday night that Priebus was returning a message from Trump, who sits second in the race for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, according to recent national polling. The source said Priebus did not initiate the call to chastise the billionaire reality TV star. \u201cThey had a respectful discussion across a wide range of issues including illegal immigration,\u201d Sean Spicer, an RNC spokesman, told CNN on Wednesday. During Trump\u2019s announcement speech he \u2013 now infamously \u2013 talked about Mexican undocumented immigrants being \u201crapists \u201cand \u201ccriminals.\u201d In the 2012 presidential election, Mitt Romney won only 27% of the Hispanic vote after using harsh terms during the GOP primary like self-deportation. After that stinging loss, Priebus commissioned a so-called autopsy to analyze how Republicans could re-capture the White House. The subsequent report said Republicans must change their language and approach in the Hispanic community in order to win over voters. Macy\u2019s dumps Donald Trump Another top Republican distanced himself from Trump on Thursday: House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cI disagree with Mr. Trump\u2019s comments,\u201d Boehner said Thursday at his weekly press conference. \u201cWhen you look at the presidential  candidates, they\u2019ve all pretty well made their position clear (on immigration).\u201d Boehner, who has been repeatedly thwarted by his own party on efforts to move immigration reform legislation said, \u201cThis has become the biggest political football I\u2019ve seen in my Congressional career.

            "article_content": "As a presidential contender, Donald Trump has been sharply critical of rival Jeb Bush. But during Bush\u2019s two successful campaigns for the Florida governorship, The Donald was all in for Jeb. In December 1997, Trump co-hosted with Steve Forbes an exclusive $500-a-head fundraiser for Bush\u2019s election campaign at Trump Tower in Manhattan, according to news coverage at the time. Trump\u2019s fundraiser was part of a larger donor effort that \u201chelped Republican gubernatorial candidate Jeb Bush blow past his Democratic rivals,\u201d the Sun-Sentinel reported in January 1998, swelling Bush\u2019s campaign cash to $3.3 million. Bush himself attended the fundraiser. Jeb Bush: Trump does not represent Republican Party \u201cWithin a week of the event the campaign deposited more than $223,000 in contributions,\u201d the Sun-Sentinel went on to write. \u201cAbout $100,000 of that came from contributors who listed addresses outside Florida.\u201d Trump, who had business interests in Florida, also donated $50,000 in 1998 to the state\u2019s Republican Party, which was aiding Bush\u2019s election. Trump and Bush\u2019s campaigns did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Trump\u2019s support for Bush\u2019s Florida campaign continued into the 2000s. Trump, who has a long record of political donations to both parties \u2013 including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton \u2013 gave $500 to Bush\u2019s 2002 reelection campaign, and he praised the governor in his book \u201cThe America We Deserve.\u201d \u201cJeb Bush is a good man,\u201d Trump wrote in the book, which was unearthed by BuzzFeed. \u201cHe\u2019s exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future\u2026. He\u2019s bright, tough, and principled. I like the Bush family very much. I believe we could get another president from the Bushes. He may be the one.\u201d Trump\u2019s tune on Bush sounds very different now, however. READ: Trump gains on Bush in New Hampshire among Republicans, poll finds On the campaign trail in recent weeks, Trump has called Bush\u2019s support for education reform \u201cpathetic\u201d and called him \u201cweak\u201d on immigration. This week, Trump retweeted \u2013 but then deleted \u2013 a supporter\u2019s tweet about the Mexican heritage of Bush\u2019s wife, Columba. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper in an interview Wednesday. \u201cIf my wife were from Mexico, I think I would have a soft spot for people from Mexico.\u201d Bush has been reluctant to discuss Trump\u2019s criticism, telling Fox News in an interview Wednesday that he did not want to be drawn into a \u201cfood fight.\u201d But Bush did respond to Trump\u2019s jab at his wife while speaking to supporters in New Hampshire, calling it \u201cbizarre.\u201d \u201cYou can love your Mexican-American wife and also believe that we need to control the border,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThis is a bizarre kind of idea that somehow you can have an affection for people in a different country and not think the rule of law should apply.

            "article_content": "A shooting in San Francisco has become the latest flashpoint for political sparring over immigration On both sides of the debate, politicians are pointing to statistics to bolster their arguments With a presidential election looming, politicians on both sides of the aisle are sparring over immigration in a battle that shows no sign of stopping. Some are pointing to a recent case \u2013 a woman in San Francisco who was killed, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant who\u2019d already been deported five times \u2013 as another sign that the U.S. system is in serious need of an overhaul. But what are the numbers behind the rhetoric? Here\u2019s a look at some of the statistics, where they come from and what people on different sides of the debate say about them. That\u2019s the latest estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. And it\u2019s less than 4% of the total U.S. population. The number peaked in 2007, according to Pew, when there were an estimated 12.2 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. But since 2009, it\u2019s \u201cremained essentially unchanged,\u201d Pew reports, as the numbers of undocumented immigrants entering and leaving the United States \u201chave come into rough balance.\u201d The number of undocumented immigrants deported last year who were convicted criminals, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That\u2019s 56% of last year\u2019s total number of deportations, according to ICE, and it\u2019s a group that the agency says it\u2019s putting first when it comes to deciding which cases to prioritize. Ask someone like Republican presidential contender Donald Trump about this number and you\u2019ll get an earful about how this statistic and others show rampant crime among undocumented immigrants. Donald Trump: 'Somebody's doing the raping' Immigrant advocates say that\u2019s far from the truth, adding that it\u2019s important to look at how the term ICE uses when it talks about convicted criminals \u2013 \u201ccriminal alien\u201d \u2013 is defined. \u201cGovernment statistics on who is being removed from the country can be somewhat deceptive,\u201d says Walter Ewing, a senior researcher for the American Immigration Council who helped author a report released this week that argues immigrants are less likely to be criminals than native-born U.S. citizens. \u201cImmigrants who experience even the slightest brush with the criminal justice system, such as being convicted of a misdemeanor, can find themselves subject to detention for an undetermined period, after which they are expelled from the country and barred from returning,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn other words, for years the government has been redefining what it means to be a \u2018criminal alien,\u2019 using increasingly stringent definitions and standards of \u2018criminality\u2019 that do not apply to U.S. citizens.\u201d The number of people released from immigration custody who were later charged with murder between 2010 and 2014, according to figures from the Department of Homeland Security cited in a recent letter from two U.S. senators. That\u2019s about a thousandth of a percent of the total estimated number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States. How much crime is committed by undocumented immigrants? Sen. Jeff Sessions and Sen. Chuck Grassley, both Republicans, have been pointing to this number as they push federal authorities for answers, arguing that \u201ccountless innocent Americans every year are the victims of crime perpetrated by deportable criminals.\u201d And the recent San Francisco shooting has added fresh fuel to the debate over whether authorities are doing enough to keep harmful offenders off the streets \u2013 and kick them out of the United States. But other officials have stressed that it\u2019s important to look at the big picture and not to make knee-jerk decisions based on individual cases. \u201cOn the issue of immigration,\u201d California Attorney General Kamala Harris said this week, \u201cour policy should not be informed by our collective outrage about one man\u2019s conduct.\u201d The number of inmates in state and federal prisons who are not U.S. citizens, according to the latest prison population report from the Bureau of Judicial Statistics. That\u2019s about 5% of the total prison population. In his recent push for building a massive wall on the southern U.S. border, Trump has said that there are \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of undocumented immigrants in the nation\u2019s state and federal prisons. It was a claim that the PolitiFact fact-checking website gave a \u201cmostly false\u201d rating. \u201cThe basic claim is at best unsustainable or more likely pure fiction. A fact created out of thin air,\u201d Ramiro Martinez, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University, told PolitiFact. Why fact-checking presidential candidates is important The bottom line, PolitiFact says, is that it\u2019s unclear just how many undocumented immigrants are currently in prison, because the available statistics don\u2019t provide details about inmates\u2019 immigration status. Analysts on both sides of the immigration debate do agree on one thing: There\u2019s a lack of good data about this. But as to how likely it is for immigrants to commit crimes, that depends on who you ask. In a 2009 report arguing that immigrants have \u201chigh rates of criminality,\u201d the Center for Immigration Studies pointed to statistics that non-U.S. citizens represent a quarter of the U.S. prison population. This week\u2019s report from the American Immigration Council counters that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes and are overrepresented in the federal prison system. Citing the American Community Survey, the report also notes that the percentage of foreign-born men in the United States who are incarcerated (1.6%) is less than the percentage of U.S.-born men who are imprisoned (3.3%). And the reason they\u2019re behind bars is often tied to immigration offenses. \u201cWhile some may be there for committing a serious criminal offense, a great many more may be there because of an immigration violation,\u201d the report says. The number of so-called detainer requests issued by Immigration and Customs and Enforcement and sent to local authorities from 2008 to 2012, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. More than three-quarters of those were for immigrants who had no criminal convictions on their records. For the ones who\u2019d been convicted, only 8.6% were charged with serious offenses, based on federal standards. Federal immigration authorities use detainers to ask local agencies to hold unauthorized immigrants and eventually hand them over to the Department of Homeland Security. It\u2019s a controversial approach that\u2019s long drawn fire from immigrant rights advocates, who argue that the feds have used the tool inappropriately to detain and deport people who don\u2019t deserve it. As a result, some places \u2013 like San Francisco \u2013 call themselves sanctuary cities and say they won\u2019t honor those requests, demanding that federal authorities go through the courts. Did sanctuary city policy lead to San Francisco murder? It\u2019s a situation that\u2019s been in the spotlight with this month\u2019s shooting in San Francisco. Critics of the city argue that officials there erred when they didn\u2019t let Homeland Security know they were releasing suspect Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said San Francisco should have listened to the Department of Homeland Security and made a mistake when it didn\u2019t send Lopez-Sanchez packing. \u201cI have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on. \u2026 If it were a first-time traffic citation, if it were something minor, a misdemeanor, that\u2019s entirely different,\u201d she said. \u201cThis man had already been deported five times. And he should have been deported at the request of the federal government.\u201d San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said his city has a good reason for their approach. \u201cBecause of what has not been reconciled on the federal level,\u201d he says, \u201clocal governments and state governments are devising new laws.\u201d The number of ICE detainers state and local enforcement authorities declined to honor last year. \u201cThis required ICE to expend additional resources attempting to locate, apprehend and remove criminal aliens who were released into the community, rather than transferred directly into custody,\u201d ICE said in its report on last year\u2019s deportation statistics. But when it comes to immigration detainers, there\u2019s a long history of distrust between local and federal agencies, says Ruben Rumbaut, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Irvine. \u201cThe majority of people that were put in ICE detainers were in the end deported out of the country for reasons that have nothing to do with crime,\u201d Rumbaut said. \u201cIt\u2019s become very controversial.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sara Sidner contributed to this report.",

She blamed the \u201cbarrage of attacks that are largely fomented by and coming from the right\u201d for fueling a perception that trust is an area of vulnerability for her. Clinton displayed little hesitation about attacking Republicans herself, saying that she  is \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in Donald Trump for his comments about immigrants and in the Republican Party for not condemning his remarks more quickly. She then pivoted to skewering the entire GOP field for their immigration stance, saying, \u201cThey\u2019re on a spectrum of hostility, which I think is really regrettable in a nation of immigrants like ours.\u201d The interview foreshadowed the Clinton that will hit the campaign trail in the coming months as election season heats up. She was occasionally defensive, especially when pressed on whether she has any responsibility for the public\u2019s mistrust in her. But she had no problem with going on the offense against her Republican challengers. Clinton took direct aim at GOP rival Jeb Bush. Hillary Clinton on Immigration and the GOP race RELATED: Sanders snags key endorsement in NH \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does,\u201d she said. The Bush campaign rebuffed Clinton\u2019s criticism and instead accused her of flip-flopping on immigration. \u201cHillary Clinton will say anything to get elected and her numerous flip-flops on immigration prove it,\u201d said Emily Benavides, a Bush campaign spokeswoman, in a statement. \u201cAs he outlined in his book on this issue, Gov. Bush believes in a conservative legislative solution to fix our broken immigration system that includes earned legal status for those currently in the country after they pay fines and taxes, learn English and commit no substantial crimes while securing our border,\u201d she said. Clinton also blamed the city of San Francisco for mishandling the case of an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times before killing a woman there \u2013 in a sanctuary city where local law enforcement do not enforce federal immigration laws. Hillary Clinton on how 33,000 emails got deleted RELATED: Clinton campaign corrals media \u201cThe city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported,\u201d she said. \u201cI have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on.\u201d The full interview aired Tuesday on \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d and will re-air at 8 p.m. on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d Pressed on why the public has a hard time trusting her, Clinton maintained she faced \u201cthe same kind of onslaught\u201d in her two New York Senate campaigns and her confirmation as secretary of state, and said Republicans have sought to turn controversies like her use of a private email address and the Clinton Foundation\u2019s actions against her. And that, Clinton said, is why national polls and swing-state surveys have found that a majority of voters say they don\u2019t see her as honest and trustworthy. A Quinnipiac University Swing State poll found that by margins of 8 to 14 percentage points voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania are skeptical of Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness. In Florida, 51% of voters hold the negative view of Clinton, compared to 43% who feel she is trustworthy. In Ohio, 53% of voters find Clinton not trustworthy, compared to 40% who do. And in Pennsylvania, 54% of voters don\u2019t find her honest, while 40% do. \u201cI think it\u2019s understandable that when questions are raised, people maybe are thinking about them and wondering about them,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut I have every confidence that during the course of this campaign, people are going to know who will fight for them, who will be there when they need them, and that\u2019s the kind of person I am and that\u2019s what I will do, not only in a campaign but as president,\u201d she said. Asked whether she played a role in the sentiment reflected in polls that she\u2019s not trustworthy, Clinton said: \u201cThis has been a theme that has been used against me and my husband for many, many years. And at the end of the day, I think voters sort it all out.\u201d She similarly dismissed questions about her use of a personal email address on a private server while serving as secretary of state. Clinton said she turned over all the emails \u2013 including some which show her using a secured fax machine, or asking for iced tea during meetings \u2013 that had anything to do with public business, and that she broke no laws in sticking with one device because she\u2019s not technically savvy. \u201cThis is being blown up with no basis in law or in fact. That\u2019s fine, I get it \u2013 this is being, in effect, used by the Republicans in the Congress. OK,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut I want people to understand what the truth is, and the truth is, everything I did was permitted and I went above and beyond what was expected.\u201d If elected president, Clinton said she doesn\u2019t have any plans to push for the closure of the Clinton Foundation \u2013 which has faced criticism for accepting foreign contributions during her tenure as America\u2019s top diplomat. \u201cI have no plans to say or do anything about the Clinton foundation other than to say I am proud of it and I think for the good of the world, its work should continue,\u201d she said. Hillary Clinton on which woman should be on the 10 dollar bill The interview spanned a broad range of topics \u2013 among them a discussion of adding a woman to the $10 bill. Clinton declined to select a favorite woman for the honor, but suggested a woman should instead go on a $20. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that as a compromise you would basically have two people on the same bill. One would be a woman. That sounds pretty second class to me,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo I think a woman should have her own bill.\u201d Nor would she pick which Saturday Night Live actress, Amy Poehler or Kate McKinnon, plays the best Hillary Clinton. \u201cAmy\u2019s a friend of mine and Kate\u2019s doing a great job. You\u2019re not going to get me to pick one or the other,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019m the best Hillary Clinton.\u201d Top 8 takeaways from Clinton\u2019s first big interview CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Illegal immigration was not the debate that 2016 Republicans wanted to have right now as they begin an already tough battle to regain the White House. Perhaps no issue has bedeviled Republicans in recent election cycles more than illegal immigration. GOP candidates have been snared, over and over again, by the difficulty of appealing to conservative GOP primary voters who dominate the primary process while not alienating Latino voters, whose influence has grown in battleground states with each presidential cycle. This week, as the controversy raged on about the anti-immigrant comments of Donald Trump, his fellow GOP contenders found themselves seared by the damage that he was inflicting on the Republican brand. When Trump first made the inflammatory assertion in his June announcement speech that some illegal immigrants from Mexico are criminals and \u201crapists,\u201d many of his rivals were slow to respond. But as the fallout has continued, more are speaking out \u2013 trying to reinforce that Trump\u2019s views are not representative of the image of the Republican Party. READ: Donald Trump digs in on immigration Some, like Jeb Bush, have sharply criticized Trump\u2019s remarks, while others like Marco Rubio \u2013 who has taken flak from conservatives for helping usher an immigration reform bill through the Senate \u2013 have seemed unwilling to engage beyond paper statements.  And all of them will be tested on the issue before a national audience during the upcoming debates that will weed out the weaker contenders from the field. By infuriating many Latino voters, who have pointed to a number of studies showing that crime is actually lower among illegal immigrants than the broader population, the debate has brought unwelcome comparisons to recent struggles by Republicans to talk about immigration in a way that broadens their appeal among minority voters. It revived talk, for example, of Mitt Romney\u2019s suggestion during the 2012 Republican primary that he was in favor of \u201cself-deportation\u201d for millions of illegal immigrants \u2013 a statement that made it extremely difficult for him to draw large numbers of Latinos to support his campaign when it mattered later in the general election. RELATED: GOPers run from Trump on immigration stance President George W. Bush\u2019s strong performance among Latino voters \u2013 he notched 44% of the Latino vote in 2004 compared to Romney\u2019s 27% in 2012, according to national exit polls \u2013 seems like a distant memory to many Republicans now, despite a focus on building goodwill among minority voters by Republican National Committee operatives. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from 44% to 27% among Hispanic voters, for a reason. You\u2019ll never convince me that it hasn\u2019t been about the way that we\u2019ve handled this issue,\u201d South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a telephone interview with CNN on Tuesday. \u201cMitt Romney showed a lot of political courage by saying that (his comment about) \u2018self-deportation\u2019 was a mistake, and now here we have Donald Trump casting 11 million people in a very derogatory manner. That\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Graham, who is also seeking the GOP presidential nomination. \u201cThere are some within the 11 million that are bad people, but I cannot tell you how harmful it is to reinforce a narrative that Republicans basically have very little respect for people.\u201d The Latino vote was a key factor in President Obama\u2019s two victories, but by 2014 Republicans seemed to be making some limited gains. A survey by the Pew Research Center shortly before the 2014 elections showed that registered Latino voters were less supportive of the Democratic Party then in recent years. In the October 2014 Pew survey, Democrats still held a commanding edge among Latinos, but 27% of Hispanic voters said they leaned toward the Republican Party, which was up from 22% in 2012. READ: Trump calls out Rubio for being \u201cweak\u201d on immigration, praises Cruz Many Republican strategists have watched with alarm as Trump has sucked up all the oxygen in the presidential race on the issue, essentially doubling down on his comments by the day \u2013 even as huge national corporations abandon their ties to his business organization. The danger for other Republican candidates in being painted as anti-immigrant as a result of Trump\u2019s comments was evident Tuesday in Iowa when Hillary Clinton argued that the GOP candidates all basically hold the same position on illegal immigration and vowed that she would lead the way forward on a path to citizenship. All of the GOP candidates, she told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar in her first national television interview this election season, are \u201cin the same general area on immigration. They don\u2019t want to provide a path to citizenship.  They range across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward immigrants.\u201d Graham took issue with her comments, noting that he has long supported a path to citizenship. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk about comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Clinton said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk about all of the good, law-abiding, productive members of the immigrant community that I personally know, that I\u2019ve met over the course of my life, that I would like to see have a path to citizenship.\u201d READ: Trump\u2019s immigration comments hurting GOP, Romney says A number of Republican strategists said Tuesday that the candidates have an opportunity to stand out in a crowded field by forcefully taking on Trump, and moving the debate toward the policy realm. They noted for example that candidates should debate the effect of sanctuary cities like San Francisco and whether law enforcement is properly tracking illegal immigrants with prior felony convictions in the U.S., like the undocumented immigrant accused of shooting San Francisco woman Kate Steinle on San Francisco\u2019s Pier 14 last week. \u201cThis is a discussion that we know is going to happen at some point anyway,\u201d said Lanhee J. Chen, Romney\u2019s former policy director and a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution. \u201cWhether they engage in it sooner or later \u2013 I think for the 2016 candidates what they ought to be thinking about, quite frankly, is what they are going to say substantively and what their policies are going to be.\u201d \u201cThe Trump stuff is silly and it\u2019s just Trump being Trump,\u201d Chen said. \u201cBut if they are able to engage on the substance, it could be good for the Republican Party, particularly if the place where we end up is perceived as being more reasonable than in the past.\u201d The debate over whether city and federal officials could have done more to prevent Steinle\u2019s murder in San Francisco is likely to keep the illegal immigration issue at the forefront in the coming weeks \u2013 and it is likely to come up when the presidential debates begin in August. Trump has seized on the circumstance surrounding Steinle\u2019s murder as justification for his comments that some Mexican immigrants are criminals and rapists.  The suspect in Steinle\u2019s death, undocumented immigrant Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, has a felony record and was deported to Mexico five times. Trump: San Francisco killing shows perils of illegal immigration Keying off that point, Trump released a new statement on Monday: \u201cWhat can be simpler or more accurately stated? The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a five time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didn\u2019t want him in Mexico.\u201d Trump argued that the Steinle case was \u201cmerely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States.\u201d Hillary Clinton weighed in on the matter during her interview with CNN on Tuesday. Clinton, who attended Trump\u2019s 2005 wedding, said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the real estate magnate\u2019s comments. She went on to say that that Steinle\u2019s murder pointed to the problems with the current immigration system. In March, Lopez-Sanchez was placed in the custody of San Francisco police, who wanted him on an outstanding drug warrant, after he completed a federal prison sentence. The U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement says it requested notification before Lopez-Sanchez was released. Clinton told CNN\u2019s Keilar on Tuesday that city officials should have listened to the guidance of the Department of Homeland security, \u201cwhich as I understand it, urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s a case where we\u2019ve deported, we\u2019ve deported, we\u2019ve deported.  He ends back up in our country and I think the city made a mistake,\u201d Clinton said in the interview. \u201cThe city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported. So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans are trying to broaden their appeal to Latinos Donald Trump's immigration comments could hurt that effort Republicans seeking to broaden the party\u2019s appeal to Latino voters have a challenge: Donald Trump. The bombastic businessman, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination, is leaving many Republicans worried about the fallout from his comments that immigrants from Latin America are \u201ckillers\u201d and \u201crapists.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s comments are hurtful for the cause of Republicans who want to reach out not just to Latinos but across many different ethnic barriers,\u201d said Ben Domenech, founder of The Federalist, a conservative opinion website, who co-authored a 2012 guide for Republicans on Hispanic outreach. \u201cThe problem with those comments is made worse by the fact that people will continue to confuse Trump with a Republican, which he is not, as opposed to thinking of him as an entertainer, which he is.\u201d Since losing the 2012 presidential election, Republicans have emphasized efforts to bring Latino voters into the fold. As a whole, the rapidly-growing group supported President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney 71% to 27%, according to the Pew Research Center. The Republican National Committee pledged to spend $10 million on minority outreach after the election and made some in-roads during last year\u2019s mid-term races 2014, Pew found. READ MORE: Inside the battle for Latino voters Trump, who is polling near the top of Republican presidential contenders, has already lost partnerships with companies including NBC and Macy\u2019s after his comments stirred a public uproar. Earlier this week, RNC chairman Reince Priebus, who initiated the party\u2019s multi-million outreach program called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cnot helpful,\u201d according to The Washington Post. Conservative groups unaffiliated with the official party that coordinate Latino outreach efforts are speaking out against Trump\u2019s characterization of immigrants. \u201cHe\u2019s just wrong on policy. Flat-out. It\u2019s unkind and it mischaracterizes the contributions of the entire immigrant community,\u201d said Daniel Garza, executive director of the Libre Initiative. \u201cThey\u2019ve brought wealth to America and ingenuity and innovation. The fact that Donald Trump is wrong both on sentiment and policy has allowed the Latino left to pile on. And there\u2019s something valid about what they\u2019re saying, that this is wrong in both content, style and policy.\u201d Despite the outcry, Trump has refused to back down or walk back his remarks. \u201cIf you look at the statistics of people coming, you look at the statistics on rape, on crime, on everything coming in illegally into this country it\u2019s mind-boggling!\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon in an interview Wednesday. \u201cSomebody\u2019s doing the raping, Don!

Marco Rubio said last week that candidates \u201cwill be held accountable by the voters for what they say.\u201d \u201cI can tell you what I believe, particularly about Mexican-Americans: they are a community that has contributed greatly to this country, they work extremely hard, they\u2019ve been very productive citizens of our country, and I think that\u2019s true of many ethnic groups in this country,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton was keenly aware of how long she\u2019d gone as a presidential candidate without sitting down for a nationally televised interview. \u201cNinety days on Sunday,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar on Tuesday in the first of what will be a series of national interviews. As Bernie Sanders rises in the polls among liberals and Republicans continue to make Clinton the subject of a barrage of attacks, her answers offered some insight into the Democratic frontrunner\u2019s thinking at this stage of the campaign. Here are eight of Clinton\u2019s key statements \u2013 and why they matter for 2016: Three decades in the limelight have meant both Bill and Hillary Clinton have weathered intense scrutiny and criticism. Clinton acknowledged that polls show a majority of Americans don\u2019t view her as honest and trustworthy \u2013 but true to her long-standing posture declined to take any responsibility for the sentiment. The latest round of public incredulity focuses on her use of a private email address while serving as secretary of state, and her family foundation\u2019s acceptance of foreign contributions during that tenure. Clinton sees those as the latest in a long line of unfair attacks from Republicans, rather than legitimate lines of inquiry. And she claims she\u2019s not sweating the \u201ctrust\u201d problem. \u201cAt the end of the day, I think voters sort it all out,\u201d Clinton said. It was a direct assault on the entire Republican presidential field \u2013 and Jeb Bush, in particular. Clinton used a question about Donald Trump\u2019s controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants to hammer her GOP opponents, saying that they don\u2019t support providing undocumented immigrants with pathways to gaining U.S. citizenship. By painting Bush, Trump and the rest of the Republican field with the same brush, Clinton hopes to hurt the entire party in a general election with Latino voters. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in those comments and I feel very bad and very disappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not responding immediately and saying, \u2018Enough, stop it,\u2019\u201d Clinton said. Bush \u2013 and other Republicans \u2013 eventually criticized Trump\u2019s comments, but only after several days had passed. Clinton still senses some danger on the issue of illegal immigration, criticizing San Francisco for failing to deport a man who\u2019d been sent back to Mexico five times before \u2013 and has admitted killing a woman after returning again. The man was released from police custody in April after drug charges were dropped, and he wasn\u2019t deported because San Francisco is a \u201csanctuary city\u201d for undocumented immigrants, despite the Department of Homeland Security weighing in. She\u2019s said she supports going further than President Barack Obama has on undocumented immigrants \u2013 but only for those who obey the law. \u201cI have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on,\u201d she said. In other words: I\u2019m not going to talk about Bernie Sanders. Recent polls show Sanders climbing closer to Clinton in New Hampshire and Iowa, two key early voting states. But Clinton isn\u2019t yet ready to directly engage Sanders, training her fire instead on Republicans. That\u2019s in part because her campaign wants to see whether Sanders has staying power, and in part because by attacking him, she risks elevating his already growing stature. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Clinton is trying to atone for the sins of her 2008 campaign among Iowa Democratic caucus voters by taking the process seriously. It\u2019s why she was in Iowa City \u2013 in the heart of eastern Iowa, which went heavily for Barack Obama in the 2008 caucuses. Clinton has shown she\u2019s able to learn from her mistakes: Those who followed her 2008 Iowa campaign say they see a looser, more comfortable candidate; and she\u2019s ejected many of the most divisive figures from that previous bid. Now, she\u2019s touting having signed up a volunteer to work the caucus process for her in all of Iowa\u2019s more than 1,600 precincts. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get people committed, and then they will bring more people through,\u201d Clinton said. Throughout her nascent campaign, Clinton has been criticized for rarely taking questions from the press. That criticism was thrust to the forefront again over the Fourth of July holiday when photos of reporters being held back by a moving rope line at a parade were published. Instead, Clinton said she\u2019s preferred small group events that have allowed her to reconnect with average Americans after more than six years out of domestic politics. She\u2019s also been a tireless fundraiser, attending house party after house party to raise $45 million in the campaign\u2019s first three months. Still, Clinton said she\u2019s ready to shift gears: The CNN interview, she said, was the first of what will be a number of sit-downs with national outlets. A tense exchange about Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email address on a private server while at the State Department turned light, when Clinton cracked jokes and once again sought to send the message: Nothing to see here, let\u2019s move along. \u201cNow, I didn\u2019t have to turn over anything,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI chose to turn over 55,000 pages because I wanted to go above and beyond what was expected of me because I knew the vast majority of everything that was official already was in the State Department system.\u201d Then, she added: \u201cNow I think it\u2019s kind of fun. People get to see a real-time, behind-the-scenes look at what I was emailing about and what I was communicating about.\u201d Keilar highlighted the emails that showed Clinton messaging now-top aide John Podesta about wearing socks to bed, and an exchange depicting an epic struggle by Clinton to operate a fax machine. On the latter, Clinton couldn\u2019t help but offer a defense. \u201cYes, a secure fax machine, which is harder to work than the regular,\u201d she said. Asked by Keilar which \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actress best satirizes her on the NBC program, Clinton demurred, but offered praise for both Amy Poehler, who impersonated her in 2008, and Kate McKinnon, who has done the job so far in this campaign cycle. \u201cAmy\u2019s a friend of mine and Kate\u2019s doing a great job. You\u2019re not going to get me to pick one or the other,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019m the best Hillary Clinton, to be honest.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The former New York governor, who didn't even register 1% of support in the latest CNN/ORC poll, is looking to raise his profile by attacking Trump's controversial remarks about undocumented immigrants. Most Republican presidential candidates have either dismissed Trump as a distraction or avoided getting tangled in a verbal sparring match with the bombastic billionaire. George Pataki might have found a way to get noticed in the crowded GOP field of presidential candidates: attack the highest-profile hopeful. The former New York governor, who didn\u2019t even register 1% of support in the latest CNN/ORC poll, is looking to raise his profile by attacking Trump\u2019s controversial remarks about undocumented immigrants. \u201cWe need a President that all Americans can respect, not a celebrity who uses words like freedom and liberty like they are a punchline in a reality show,\u201d Pataki said Friday in a statement that announced his petition that urges Americans to \u201cStand up to Trump.\u201d The petition comes after Pataki has spent the last two days seizing on Trump\u2019s comments about Mexican immigrants, whom the real estate mogul and now-GOP candidate has called everything from \u201crapists\u201d to \u201ckillers.\u201d Since announcing his interest in the presidential race, GOP strategists have barely given Pataki\u2019s campaign a cursory look \u2013 considering his campaign among the longest of longshot bids \u2013 and a son-in-law\u2019s stroke caused Pataki to temporarily suspend his campaign in its infancy. His Trump stunt is now giving his campaign a much-needed jolt of media attention after he launched his campaign just over a month ago, but has seen little to no national news coverage since. Until now. George Pataki's political career It\u2019s certainly giving Pataki an opportunity to not only grab onto the coattails of a presidential candidate who is surging in the polls, but it\u2019s also giving Pataki a chance to distinguish himself from the rest of the field. Most Republican presidential candidates have either dismissed Trump as a distraction or avoided getting tangled in a verbal sparring match with the bombastic billionaire. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose wife is Mexican, has simply said that Trump is \u201cwrong,\u201d while Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul chuckled that \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s been saying, but uh, he apparently is drawing a lot of attention.\u201d And Sen. Ted Cruz, whose father is Cuban, has instead defended Trump as \u201cbrash\u201d and someone who \u201cspeaks the truth\u201d and praised him for drawing attention to illegal immigration. Pataki has done the exact opposite: blasting Trump and calling on his fellow White House hopefuls to do the same. \u201cHere we are in 2015 and a leading candidate for the GOP nomination for President is calling Mexicans criminals, rapists and drug dealers. This is unacceptable,\u201d Pataki said Wednesday in an open letter to the rest of the Republican field. Pataki\u2019s efforts were joined on Friday by Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American who called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201coffensive and inaccurate\u201d as well as \u201cdivisive.\u201d \u201cOur next President needs to be someone who brings Americans together \u2013 not someone who continues to divide,\u201d Rubio said in a statement. \u201cOur broken immigration system is something that needs to be solved, and comments like this move us further from \u2013 not closer to \u2013 a solution. We need leaders who offer serious solutions to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system.\u201d But beyond drawing a response from other candidates, Pataki\u2019s efforts give him a chance to insert himself into the constant coverage of Trump and the fallout from his remarks, snagging interviews on CNN and with other national news outlets that will help improve his name identification. He even got some help from Trump on that front, with the Twitter-savvy businessman who frequently uses the social media platform to lob attacks at his detractors sticking to his usual script. Fact checking Donald Trump's immigration comments \u201cGovernor Pataki was a terrible governor of NY, one of the worst \u2013 would\u2019ve been swamped if he ran again!\u201d Trump said. \u201cGovernor Pataki couldn\u2019t be elected dog catcher if he ran again \u2013 so he didn\u2019t!\u201d The move could also win Pataki some favor among the GOP establishment where strategists and party elites are keenly aware of the need to draw Latinos in, rather than turn them away, heading into the 2016 election. Hot off heavy media coverage of the remarks and his campaign announcement last month, Trump surged to second place in the nationwide CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday. He is also ranked second in recent polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire. But Trump is also highly disliked among many GOP voters, with more than half in several key polls saying they have an unfavorable opinion of the New York mogul.",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush and Donald Trump continue to lead the GOP primary in a national CNN/ORC poll Hillary Clinton leads the Democrats Clinton also leads all GOP candidates in head-to-head general election match-ups With nearly all of the expected 2016 presidential candidates formally in the race, a new CNN/ORC national poll finds two recent entrants to the GOP field on the rise, while Hillary Clinton maintains her position atop the Democratic field, though holding a slightly slimmer lead. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and businessman Donald Trump top the list of GOP presidential contenders following their back-to-back campaign launches in mid-June, and are the only two Republican candidates holding double-digit support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. For his part, Trump specifically responded to the poll results Wednesday afternoon saying the numbers are \u201crepresentative of the response we are receiving from all over the country.\u201d \u201cI am committed to addressing the issues our country is facing and am confident my business mindset and common sense solutions are resonating with the American people,\u201d Trump said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. \u201cPoliticians are all talk and no action and the American public is ready for a leader with a proven track record of success.\u201d READ: The complete CNN/ORC poll here Clinton, though, continues to lead all GOP candidates in head-to-head general election match-ups. Bush stands at 19%, up from 13% in May \u2013 and his best showing in CNN/ORC polling since December. Trump follows at 12%, up from 3% before his announcement. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (8%), neurosurgeon Ben Carson (7%) and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (7%) round out the top five. Notably absent from this top five \u2013 though statistically speaking not far behind \u2013 are Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (6%, down from 14% in May) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (6%, down slightly from 10%). Both had been top five candidates in each of the last two CNN/ORC polls, and Walker had been in the top five since February. The poll, conducted just before New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie formally launched his campaign with a rally in Livingston, New Jersey, on Tuesday, also finds that Christie begins his push for the presidency with just 3% support. The findings suggest Bush is making progress toward being seen as the frontrunner in a field that has long lacked a clear leader. He holds a significant lead over the second-place candidate Trump, is seen as the candidate who could best handle illegal immigration and social issues, and runs about even with Trump and well ahead of the other candidates when Republicans are asked which candidate can best handle the economy. But there are sticking points for Bush. He fares slightly worse across all three issues tested when only registered voters are considered. Registered voters tend to be more conservative and older than Republicans as a whole, and are more apt to actually vote when the primaries come around. Looking at how each candidate fares among those subgroups, conservatives split their support between Bush and Trump, 12% back each. Likewise, among voters age 50 or older, 14% support Bush and 14% back Trump. By contrast, among Republicans under age 50, Bush is the only candidate in double-digits with 23%, Trump has just 9% support. And moderate or liberal Republicans back Bush over Trump 27% to 10%. Trump\u2019s competitiveness among those older and more conservative Republicans also helps explain Walker\u2019s and Rubio\u2019s declines. In April, 16% of Republicans age 50 or older backed Rubio, 14% Walker. Now, Rubio has just 6% among this group and Walker has 7%. Trump grew from 2% in May to 14% now. Among conservatives in May, Rubio led the field with 15%, Walker was just behind at 14%. Bush had 11%, about the same as in the current poll. Now, Walker has fallen to 8%, and Rubio is down five points to 10%. And Trump has grown from 2% to 12%. Rubio also lost ground among moderate or liberal Republicans, just 1% back Rubio in the new poll, down from 11%. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton continues to hold all the cards. Nationally, she leads all other candidates by more than 40 points, with 57% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents behind her, 16% backing Vice President Joe Biden, 14% Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 2% Jim Webb and 1% or less for former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. The poll holds better news for Biden than it does for Sanders, who has made gains against Clinton in recent polling in Iowa and New Hampshire. But Biden actually tops the list as national Democrats\u2019 second-choice candidate, 35% say he\u2019s their second pick, compared with 14% who say Sanders is. While both trail Clinton by wide margins on all four candidate attributes tested, Biden tops Sanders on three of them: as the strongest leader in the field, having the best chance to win, and representing the values of Democrats \u201clike yourself.\u201d The two are even in second behind Clinton as the candidate who cares the most about people like you. The only glimmer of Sanders\u2019 early state appeal in this poll comes when Democrats are asked which of the Democratic candidates best represents the values of Democrats like yourself. On that question, among liberal Democrats, Sanders runs about even with Clinton, with 38% saying Clinton best reflects their values and 35% saying Sanders does. Among moderate Democrats, however, Clinton holds a broad edge, 52% say she best represents their values while just 10% say Sanders does. Looking ahead to the general election, Clinton continues to hold significant leads over Bush (54% Clinton to 41% Bush) and Christie (56% Clinton to 37% Christie). She has also opened up wide leads over Rubio (56% Clinton to 39% Rubio) and Walker (57% Clinton to 38% Walker), as those two have slipped among independents. Clinton\u2019s clearest advantage, however, is over Donald Trump, 59% say they would vote for Clinton if the 2016 match-up were between her and Trump, 34% say they would back Trump. The economy, health care and terrorism remain dominant issues in Americans\u2019 minds as the 2016 election gets closer, with 88% calling the economy an extremely or very important issue, 83% rating health care that important and 81% calling terrorism a top issue. Foreign policy follows, with 71% calling it deeply important, and about 6-in-10 each call illegal immigration (62%) and race relations (61%) important issues. Same-sex marriage rounds out the list with just 41% of Americans saying it\u2019s extremely or very important issue in their 2016 presidential vote. Overall, the recent Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage and health care have not significantly increased either issue\u2019s salience among the general public. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, however, 45% now call same-sex marriage an extremely or very important issue, up from 34% in February, and 82% consider health care an important issue to their vote, up from 75% in February. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone June 26-28, among a random national sample of 1,017 adults. The margin of sampling error for results among the full sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points. It is 4.5 points for results among the 490 Democrats and Democratic- leaning independents and 5 points for results among the 407 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.

            "article_content": "Liberals on the Supreme Court pulled off the ultimate feat this term: shifting the bench to the left, often without even needing to pick up a pen. With major rulings on civil rights cases, including decisions to back same-sex marriage nationwide and uphold Obamacare, the Roberts court offered liberals more than they had dared hope when the term opened last October. And in some cases, it was conservatives like Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy who delivered the biggest victories to the White House by writing the landmark opinions that upheld the health care law and articulated a constitutional right to marriage for same-sex couples. In the process, they infuriated Republican leaders and activists and helped cement civil rights and health care achievements into President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. The term, which will have political implications that will reverberate into next year\u2019s presidential election and for years beyond, ended on Monday with justices making clear their divisions on key cases in strongly worded opinions from the bench. The loquacious Justice Antonin Scalia accused his colleagues of dispensing \u201cjiggerypokery\u201d and \u201cgoobledygook.\u201d Roberts himself blasted the same-sex marriage ruling by reading his dissent from the bench \u2013an unusual move for any justice, and something the Chief has never done. Then, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrapped the term on Monday by accusing conservative counterparts of leaving prisoners exposed to death penalty injections she described as \u201cthe chemical equivalent of being burned at the stake.\u201d Although strongly worded dissents are not unusual on the Court, and the justices frequently insist they get on well personally, the last few days of the term included multiple illustrations of the sharp differences of judicial interpretation. For example, after Justice Stephen Breyer said Monday that the death penalty was now \u201chighly likely\u201d to be unconstitutional, Scalia, in his final swipe of the term, complained his rivals on the bench appeared to be prioritizing personal political views over a faithful interpretation of the Constitution. READ: Supreme Court backs use of lethal injection drug \u201cIt is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much,\u201d Scalia said, throwing Breyer\u2019s words back to him from another case. But when the tough talking is forgotten, the term, which also included scores of cases that do not get widespread media attention, will likely be most remembered for three major rulings \u2013 the rejection of a new challenge that would have gutted Obamacare over four words, the same-sex marriage decision and an unexpected reprieve for a key aspect of a federal housing discrimination law. GOP split on SCOTUS same-sex marriage ruling All three rulings delighted the Obama White House, and helped fuel a feeling last week that a sudden cascade of change was remaking political and social conventions on race, health care and civil rights. But any expectations from those unfamiliar with the full scope of the Court\u2019s work that Roberts, after a decade on the bench, would shift his jurisprudence would be misguided. \u201cI do think overall this is a conservative court,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center and a CNN contributor. But she added that on civil rights and equality issues, the Court this term had indeed delivered some progressive rulings. In some cases, the Court\u2019s apparent progressive turn was a product simply of the cases that were before the justices. While Kennedy joined the liberals on same-sex marriage and a case broadening the scope of a federal housing discrimination law, that does not mean he would line up alongside them on an abortion restrictions or an affirmative action case, both of which could be before the Court next term. And any sense that Kennedy, appointed by Ronald Reagan, is on a long lurch to the left can easily be debunked by looking at the consequences of his vote in 2010 on the Citizens United case, which unleashed a torrent of campaign cash and has been vigorously criticized by Obama. Still, in his passionate majority decision on Friday, Kennedy did reach the culmination of an increasingly progressive personal evolution over 20 years in one area of the law \u2014 gay marriage. \u201cAs some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cThey ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right,\u201d he said in his 5-4 majority opinion. Sam Erman, a University of Southern California law school professor who once clerked for Kennedy, said that the Justice\u2019s swing vote in the same-sex marriage case was consistent with his rulings over time. \u201cCertainly, on issues of same-sex intimacy and commitment, he has seen the Constitution as protecting those spheres. I don\u2019t think many people were terribly surprised,\u201d said Erman. While liberals outside the Court saw much to celebrate in the term, conservatives were dismayed by Roberts\u2019 decision to \u2013 for the second time \u2013 vote in favor of Obamacare. Despite the 6-3 ruling,  the chief justice was quickly accused by conservative critics of selling out. But in fact, many see his vote as being  consistent with his jurisprudence developed over a decade on the Court, which debunks the notion the politics of a man who worked in the Reagan White House have slipped to the left. In the health care case, his vote was a classic example of a justice examining what Congress actually meant when it wrote a law. READ: How the GOP won on same-sex marriage But the very next day, Roberts shifted to his more traditional allies \u2013 and the losing side of the same sex marriage case, arguing that the five justices on the other side had short circuited what should be a democratic political process in the states of approving same sex marriage. Such an approach appears to be in line with his stated aim during his Senate confirmation hearings of behaving like an umpire calling balls and strikes and being reluctant to trample over lawmakers. \u201cChief Justice Roberts seems to be in many cases taking a cautious approach deferential to the legislature,\u201d said Chris Edelson, a Constitutional Law scholar at American University. \u201cOn health care and in his dissent on the marriage case, Roberts was reluctant to disturb decisions by elected officials.\u201d This term was not a complete victory for progressives. On the last day of the term, the Court ruled in favor of a controversial death penalty drug over the dissent of the liberals. And Scalia issued an opinion striking a blow toward the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to regulate harmful emissions from power plants through the Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, there\u2019s plenty for the White House to worry about in the next term, which begins in October. A challenge to the President\u2019s executive action to reform immigration laws, which conservatives have branded a massive overreach, could reach the Court\u2019s docket next year. The affirmative action case is already worrying progressives as Kennedy\u2019s vote might be an unknown.  The Court could also decide to consider an abortion case that could get to the heart of exactly how far a state can go to limit the procedure at a time when more and more states are passing strict laws. And the next term will unfold in the heat of the quickening campaign for the 2016 election \u2013 meaning that its rulings will take on even more of a political hue \u2013 whether justices like it or not. And with several retirements of aging justices likely possibly looming in the next president\u2019s term, the future ideological direction of the Roberts bench will be right at the center of the political debate going into the fall campaign in 2016. By the fall of 2016, the high court\u2019s \u201cprogressive spring\u201d could be a distant memory.",

            "article_content": "Some Republicans are turning to a religious freedom fight in wake of gay marriage ruling Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was burned by business when he took up that fight The Supreme Court\u2019s decision Friday to legalize same-sex marriage everywhere offered the GOP a way out of a debate that national polls show has turned into a loser for their candidates. But some Republican presidential contenders are ready for another cultural and civil rights battle \u2014 this time over religious liberty. On Sunday, several 2016 hopefuls sought to court evangelical Christians who make up much of the base Republicans must win over to advance out of the primary election, signaling that they\u2019re willing to deal with the accusations of discrimination that states like Indiana have faced in order to protect religious rights. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee channeled Martin Luther King, Jr. calling for non-violent resistance to the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cMay I ask, are we going to now discriminate against people of conscience, people of faith, who disagree with this ruling?\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure that every governor and every attorney general should just say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s the law of the land\u2019 because there\u2019s no enabling legislation.\u201d GOP hopefuls denounce marriage equality ruling RELATED: How the GOP won on same-sex marriage Texas Sen. Ted Cruz went even further in the wake of the ruling, telling an Iowa crowd that \u201cthe last 24 hours at the United States Supreme Court were among the darkest hours of our nation.\u201d Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wrote for Time Magazine that he will \u201cresist any intrusion of government into the religious sphere\u201d \u2014 and that means ending marriage benefits like tax breaks and getting government out of the institution altogether. \u201cSince government has been involved in marriage, they have done what they always do \u2014 taxed it, regulated it, and now redefined it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is hard to argue that government\u2019s involvement in marriage has made it better, a fact also not surprising to those who believe government does little right.\u201d And Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal predicted the fight over religious liberty would persist through the 2016 election. \u201cHere\u2019s where the next fight\u2019s going: I think the left is now going to go after our First Amendment rights,\u201d Jindal said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cI think it is wrong for the federal government to force Christian individuals, businesses, pastors, churches to participate in wedding ceremonies that violate our sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stand up and fight for religious liberty. That\u2019s where this fight is going. The left wants to silence us, Hillary Clinton wants to silence us, we\u2019re not going away.\u201d The issue thrust Indiana into the national spotlight \u2013 and ended any hope Gov. Mike Pence had for a dark-horse presidential campaign \u2013 three months ago when the Republican-dominated Legislature there passed a \u201creligious freedom\u201d law that critics said would have allowed businesses to turn away gay customers. It was Pence\u2019s struggles to explain the move, capped by a widely panned interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d that led Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to order changes to a similar bill in his state and led others, including Georgia, to drop their legislative pushes for \u201creligious freedom\u201d measures altogether. Pence\u2019s debacle also attracted the attention of some presidential candidates, who tried to to both rally to the cause but not risk alienating any powerful \u2013 think business \u2013 interests. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Pence, in \u201cfixing\u201d the law had done \u201cthe right thing.\u201d Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Christian photographers shouldn\u2019t be punished for refusing to shoot a same-sex wedding. S.E. Cupp tears up over same-sex marriage ruling And former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said at the time he stands for \u201creligious liberty and real tolerance.\u201d The issue \u2013 similar to immigration \u2013 is a conundrum for Republicans. Their primary electorate opposes same-sex marriage, while national polls show the general public is much more supportive of allowing gay and lesbian couples to wed. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling has evoked fears that religious rights are poised to be trampled if a liberal president succeeds President Barack Obama and appoints more Supreme Court justices. Cruz has even called for a constitutional amendment judicial elections for Supreme Court justices in the wake of the Court ruling. \u201cI am proposing an amendment to the Constitution to subject #SCOTUS justices to periodic judicial retention elections #BelieveAgain,\u201d he tweeted on Saturday. I am proposing an amendment to the Constitution to subject #SCOTUS justices to periodic judicial retention elections #BelieveAgain Some GOP contenders weren\u2019t eager to start a new fight over religious liberty on Sunday, though. \u201cI think we need to take a deep breath,\u201d Ohio Gov. John Kasich said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cLook, I believe in traditional marriage, but the Supreme Court has ruled, and it\u2019s the law of the land, and we\u2019ll abide by it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think everybody needs to take a deep breath to see how this evolves.\u201d South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Republicans should \u201cfight for the religious liberties of every American.\u201d But he used much less stark language than other contenders, saying the ruling was a \u201ctransformational moment.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of upset people who believe in traditional marriage. They\u2019re disappointed, they\u2019re down right now,\u201d he said. Graham said he would, as president, protect the tax-exempt status of religious institutions that refuse to participate in same-sex weddings. \u201cIf you\u2019re a gay person or a gay couple, if I\u2019m president of the United States, you will be able to participate in commerce and be a full member of society, consistent with the religious beliefs of others who have rights also,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Democrats like Hillary Clinton, who only years ago said she opposed same-sex marriage, have celebrated the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. It\u2019s provided a perfect opportunity to demonstrate a stark partisan difference on an issue where broad public opinion favors the Democrats. A CNN/ORC poll from April showed 57% of those surveyed felt businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples, compared to 41% who said they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons.",

The law, which is still in place, issues a minimum 10-year sentence for anyone who pulls a gun while committing a crime, 20 years for pulling the trigger during a crime and 25 years to life for injuring or killing someone by firing a gun. \u201cAnd we advertised it in Spanish, Creole and English to make sure that people knew that if they\u2019re going to commit gun crimes, that they were going to pay a heavy price,\u201d he said in the town hall, adding that they saw a \u201cdramatic reductions in gun violence.\u201d According to a 2013 report by the nonpartisan research arm of the Connecticut General Assembly, which looked into the law using FBI crime reporting statistics, gun violence in Florida indeed went down in the years after the law was enacted in 1999 \u2013 but it also went down across the entire country. Separately, an Orlando Sentinel report found that only a small percentage of those charged with gun crime in Orange County from 2003 to 2007 actually received the mandatory sentence. Bush argued that none of the gun control proposals by the Obama administration would have stopped recent mass shootings. Asked by reporters afterwards if he could specify which proposals he was talking about, he repeated, \u201call the ones.\u201d \u201cEvery one of them. There\u2019s not been a single thing that he\u2019s proposed recently that would have changed the course of any of these tragic cases,\u201d he said. Jeb Bush slow jams on the 'Tonight Show' Following the Newtown elementary school shooting in 2012, the Obama administration, with the help of a small number of Republicans, pushed for legislation that would have applied background checks to all private sales or transfers, but the measure failed to advance in the Senate two years ago. While Bush said Florida requires background checks for gun purchases, he told reporters that the state does not have checks for the kinds of private transactions included in the Congressional push two years ago. He said he doesn\u2019t think \u201cwe need to be politicizing this issue,\u201d and in the town hall, he emphasized focusing on mental health issues as a way to address the problem. \u201cI\u2019d also say going forward that these cases \u2013 that the race system in Charleston or these cases of people who are just mentally deranged \u2013 we as a society better figure out how we identify these folks long before they feel compelled to take up a gun and kill innocent people,\u201d he said. In his first stop to Nevada as an official candidate, having announced his presidential campaign earlier this month, the town hall in Henderson was largely a friendly event for Bush. At one point, a voter stood up and told him he\u2019d been a Democrat for 50 years but last month switched to become a registered Republican. Bush approached the voter and gave him a hug. While he faced no confrontational questions at the event, a small group of pro-immigration protesters with signs waited for Bush outside, standing near reporters who were anticipating a small press conference. Bush\u2019s campaign then moved reporters inside where the candidate answered questions. Bush pledged to return to the early caucus state \u201ca lot,\u201d not only for the Republican nominating contest, but because Nevada is a swing state in the general election. He acknowledged that the Republican nominee won\u2019t be able to win Democratic strongholds like New York and California next November, but he thinks Republicans can expand the map to win Nevada, Florida, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Michigan. A Manchin-Toomey comeback? \u201cI\u2019m going to do this to win,\u201d he said to applause during the town hall. \u201cAnd I want your support.\u201d That will require campaigning in places where Republicans don\u2019t traditionally go, he said, and appealing to groups like Latino voters, repeating a message he often gives.  This time, however, he tried using a gambling term to get across his message. \u201cIf we don\u2019t try to broaden out the map, we\u2019re going to have to win with an inside straight, to use a Vegas term. Inside straight flush or whatever. It\u2019s just not going to happen. I\u2019m not a big gambler so I don\u2019t know any gambling \u2026 Does that sound stupid when you say that?\u201d he asked, to laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ll teach me about that later.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Obama briefly basked in Obamacare win on Thursday The President has had a week of positive news in the wake of victories on trade and health care June is legacy month for President Barack Obama. After the Supreme Court, for a second time, refused to gut the Affordable Care Act and a deal with Republicans revived his trade agenda, Obama is two-thirds of the way to three big wins that will help define his place in history. Next up is the prospect of a nuclear deal with Iran, as U.S. negotiators head to Europe to try to clinch a final agreement that would represent at striking, if partial, break with more than 30 years of visceral hostility between Washington and Tehran. For sure, one good week does not change the prevailing dynamic of bitterness and polarization in Washington. Each of the three big legacy items is deeply contentious, has ripped new political divides and could be overturned by a future GOP president. RELATED: 2016 GOP hopefuls say ballot box only way to repeal Obamacare Republicans will run for the White House in 2016 against Obamacare, and many foreign policy watchers, including in the President\u2019s own Democratic Party, are deeply skeptical he will secure a \u201cgood\u201d deal with the Islamic Republic. Conservatives also remain convinced that the President has embarked on a series of unconstitutional power grabs with executive actions on the environment and immigration reform. But a week that will end with another seminal Obama address on race at the funeral of a pastor gunned down in the Charleston massacre may have revealed fresh insight into Obama\u2019s often elusive political character. As he appeared at the White House following the Supreme Court\u2019s dramatic decision on Thursday, Obama appeared to sense a circle closing and vindication for his first presidential campaign in 2008 that set out to forge transformational change. He said Obamacare meant that people no longer had to worry about going bankrupt when they got sick, or losing health care when they swapped jobs, and was an example of the power of community when people work together. Supreme Court saves Obamacare, gives Obama massive win \u201cThat\u2019s when America soars, when we look out for one another and we take care of each other, when we root for one another\u2019s success, when we strive to do better and to be better than the generation that came before us and try to build something better for generations to come,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we do what we do. That\u2019s the whole point of public service,\u201d he said, gesturing to Vice President Joe Biden who was standing beside him. It wasn\u2019t just the Obamacare judgment that suggested the President is becoming more and more liberated from the political constraints that have made his five-and-a-half years in the White House a long and often painful slog. A deal to secure the fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements this week was the product of a rare agreement with Republican leaders Sen. Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, who have spent years thwarting Obama\u2019s agenda. And there was more than a suggestion in the White House\u2019s praise for those two foes that there is some relief in the West Wing that Obama no longer needs to appease fellow Democrats who two weeks ago dealt the President a stunning repudiation by refusing to back his trade push. Obama just seems looser in himself as well. RELATED: Obama heading to Charleston to deliver eulogy His readiness to drop the \u2018N-word\u2019 into a podcast interview that touched on race that went viral this week \u2013 and the way he swatted down a heckler at the White House with the words \u201cyou\u2019re in my house,\u201d suggested a late-term president more willing to speak his mind, come what may, after years on a rhetorical tightrope. For a White House that has spent years and massive reserves of political capital fighting repeated Republican attempts to kill Obamacare, Thursday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling came as a huge relief. There was a beaming smile on the face of Biden, still grieving after the death of his son Beau from brain cancer, as he appeared with Obama in the White House Rose Garden. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to rank happy days,\u201d White House communications director Jen Psaki told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday. \u201cI would say that this is certainly one where we\u2019re just elated for what this means for the American people.\u201d The Court decision means the fight over Obamacare now becomes a political one. With Obama\u2019s veto pen at the ready, any long-shot Republican effort to overturn the law is certain to fail. The law will now be at the center of the 2016 presidential election campaign and the GOP\u2019s last chance to prevent it being embedded in the fabric of American life will require an all out effort to keep Hillary Clinton, or another Democrat, out of the White House. It\u2019s just a coincidence that the clutch of big issues are coinciding at this point in the Obama presidency \u2013 and there are still plenty of things that could go wrong. Obama admitted Thursday even in his hour of triumph that the Affordable Care Act needed to be improved, and there is no guarantee of a nuclear deal with Iran. Still, even the pursuit of an agreement and the President\u2019s big wins on Obamacare and trade this week are a sign of his continuing \u2013 and somewhat surprising \u2013 capacity to drive the political debate even as his second term begins to wind down. Defying the lame duck label that was quickly applied by pundits after the Republicans added control of the Senate to their stewardship of the House of Representatives last year, Obama remains the most important Democrat in Washington. That\u2019s despite the increasing momentum of the 2016 campaign to replace him and historic echoes that indicate that second-term presidents often begin to ebb power quickly in the back end of their mandate. The action packed week in politics is not over yet. On Friday, Obama will travel to Charleston for the latest episode of an increasingly public dialogue on race, which opened with his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, re-emerged in his 2008 campaign after the controversy of Rev. Jeremiah Wright and has simmered throughout his mandate as the first black president. His eulogy to Pastor Clementa Pinckney could mark his most personal address yet to a primarily African-American audience, which sees him as a hero but has sometimes been disappointed that he has not been more outspoken on racial issues. And another moving of the political tectonic plates could come as soon as Friday, when the Supreme Court could hand down another opinion with huge implications \u2013 on whether states can ban same-sex marriage or must recognize such unions that are deemed legal in other states. Obama, in common with other leading Washington politicians, has at time struggled to keep pace with a swift change in public attitudes in favor of gay rights. But a ruling by the Court that partially or in full supports the legality of same-sex marriage will have liberals believing that hopes for fundamental social change first raised by his 2008 campaign are close to becoming reality.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson shared his desire to secure the borders and to implement a guest worker program before a group of Latino leaders on Wednesday. The retired brain surgeon spoke for about 15 minutes at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) annual conference, the nation\u2019s largest gathering of Latino policy-makers. Carson was the only Republican leader to accept the invitation to speak at the Las Vegas event. \u201cThe next president of the United States will be elected by the Latino community,\u201d said Arturo Vargas, the group\u2019s executive director. RELATED: Ben Carson says gay rights aren\u2019t the same as civil rights \u201cWe are excited to have Dr. Ben Carson join us as one of the leading candidates for the White House in 2016 and look forward to hearing him engage the nation\u2019s largest gathering of Latino policy-makers on the issues most important to the Latino community today,\u201d Vargas said. Carson said the U.S. is an attractive destination for people hoping to improve their lives, but security should still be a priority. \u201cAs a compassionate nation we should ask what can we do to help people in nations that feel they don\u2019t have an opportunity in their nation,\u201d he said. Implementing a guest worker program for the 11 million undocumented immigrants should be our next step to immigration before encouraging them to apply for full citizenship, he said, and sealing the border is more of a security plan than an immigration plan. \u201cWe need to be looking at ways that we can share the wealth and still maintain our borders and integrity,\u201d Carson said. Immigration has been a tricky issue for many GOP candidates to navigate. Already, Jeb Bush has been put on the defensive by conservatives who think his pro-reform stance is too lenient. In 2012, eventual nominee Mitt Romney ran hard to the right on the issue in the primary \u2013 calling for immigrants here illegally to \u201cself-deport\u201d \u2013 but lost the general election badly, receiving a far lower percentage of Hispanic voters than his predecessors George W. Bush and John McCain.",

            "article_content": "This dusty town just past a series of international checkpoints is home to few Republican voters but to many Republican fears. The party\u2019s conservative base is deeply distrustful of the White House\u2019s will to secure the border with Mexico, worrying about the influx of undocumented immigrants who they associate with crime and poverty. So, Republican presidential hopefuls are making trips here, not to win over locals in this deep-blue region of an otherwise red state. Instead, they\u2019re coming here to bolster their credentials with early-state voters hungry to see candidates pledge to clamp down on illegal immigration. Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, was here last week. Ted Cruz, a Texas senator who is also seeking the GOP nomination, was in town the week before, when he received a briefing at a U.S. Border Patrol outpost and said stemming the tide of illegal crossings relies on \u201cboots on the ground\u201d first and foremost. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made the trip earlier this year. READ: Bush takes on immigration \u2013 but at hecklers\u2019 request Nothing serves as a better backdrop for their stump speeches than the border towns here in the Rio Grande Valley. The tough talk increasingly features harsh words on securing the border to the exclusion of any discussion about what to do with the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country. \u201cThis issue deserves presidential leadership,\u201d said Cruz, standing in the parking lot of a Buick dealership across the street from the Border Patrol outpost. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s missing, and if I\u2019m elected president, that\u2019s what I hope to provide.\u201d Cruz and his fellow Republicans might not want to address how they would deal with the undocumented immigrants already in the country, but they are eager to emphasize just how fearlessly they would block illegal border crossings, thwart the drug trade and protect American families from any intruders with any ties to Islamic extremists. The approach is no longer \u201cborder first\u201d but \u201cborder only.\u201d When Walker came here in March \u2013 as he was struggling to articulate a consistent immigration policy \u2013 he declined to spell out his vision of a long-term solution to the nation\u2019s immigration challenges after the border was secure. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to tackle these other issues first,\u201d Walker, who is expected to run in 2016, told reporters the next day. That tracks with sentiment in the GOP. After a child migrant crisis gripped this town last year, 53% of Republicans nationwide told the Pew Research Center in September that stricter law enforcement alone should be the immigration priority rather than also creating a path to citizenship. Moments from Marco Rubio's career The candidates seem familiar with the numbers. Sen. Marco Rubio, once a loud-and-proud advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, has retreated to the politically safer ground of putting the border first. Chris Christie, who is expected to declare his candidacy this summer, has frequently avoided sharing his thoughts on national immigration policy as governor. Instead, he tends to espouse the need for better border control beyond all else. Yet many Latino Republicans are worried that prioritizing the border over broader immigration reform will alienate members of the crucial Latino voting group. Cruz drew about 100 donors to the fundraiser he held at a museum here while in town, but some of his supporters in this heavily Hispanic part of his home state said they openly disagreed with him on immigration. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of being tough on the border. It\u2019s about having solutions for the border,\u201d said Ruben Villarreal, who was one of the region\u2019s few Republican elected officials when he served as mayor of Rio Grande City. Quick photo-ops at the border, Villarreal said, amount to \u201cpeople kicking the tires on the car and thinking they know how to fix the engine.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re doing border visits only, that might help the base \u2013 but that won\u2019t help in the general\u201d election, warned Artemio Muniz, a Texas GOP strategist helping raise money for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. READ: Obama on immigration delay: \u2018Obviously, I\u2019m frustrated\u2019 Bush is one of the few expected Republican candidates to detail an immigration position beyond border security \u2013 a stance likely to be a major liability for him in the primaries. Muniz said Cruz\u2019s attention solely on the border was too single-minded. \u201cIf that\u2019s your only approach to the issue, then as a candidate I don\u2019t think you\u2019re showing a good grasp of the entire situation,\u201d he said. Some local leaders have also criticized Cruz for not visibly tending to the border, saying he has not made enough trips. (His most recent trip was his fourth since being elected.) Asked if his immigration plan is too narrow, Cruz emphasized to reporters that he also supports efforts to combat the overstaying of visas, streamline legal immigration and install an E-verify system. At the fundraiser, several attendees said Cruz didn\u2019t touch on immigration or border issues at all, which they said surprised them. The event was unusual enough to draw George Rice, who pulled his Ford pickup truck into the parking lot outside the Cruz fundraiser and stayed there out of pure curiosity. A moderate Republican, Rice said he finds Cruz\u2019s position on border security too extreme and too dominant in the GOP debate. But he is among the locals encouraged that candidates are at least beginning to show up \u2013 even if briefly. A county that gave 70% of its vote to Obama in 2012 might not even have expected to host a GOP fundraiser in the first place. \u201cDemocrats ignored us because, \u2018Oh, the valley\u2019s safe \u2013 it\u2019s blue,\u2019 and Republicans ignored us because, \u2018Well, it\u2019s the valley \u2013 we don\u2019t have a chance,\u2019\u201d Rice recalled. Yet some in the area knock the visits as still too infrequent, and more style than substance. \u201cI don\u2019t think they come enough, to be quite honest,\u201d said Jon Valdivida as cars honked down Main Street, where awnings alternate between \u201cjoyeria\u201d and \u201cjeweler.\u201d \u201cThey come and parade around and leave.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Victory for both parties in 2016 could hinge on mobilizing Latino voters \u2013 and the battle for their support is already fierce. The epicenter is here in the American southwest, where the Libre Initiative, a conservative group, is spending millions on outreach to Latino voters, an effort that has sparked a backlash from Democrats worried about Libre\u2019s potential. In anticipation of the upcoming election cycle, Libre is undertaking one of the most ambitious and expensive Latino outreach programs by any conservative organization yet. It will have a $14 million operating budget in 2015, according to a source with knowledge of the group\u2019s fiances who requested anonymity to speak freely. Libre now has field staff in ten states, with plans to expand further in 2016. Most of Libre\u2019s funding comes from a network of conservative donors organized by billionaire businessmen Charles and David Koch. RELATED: Christie changes immigration stace, pulls support for pathway Since Libre\u2019s inception four years ago, the group has built a presence in states with high Latino populations by providing classes and free social services. Appeals court blocks immigration action In Nevada, Libre sponsored a program to help people receive driver\u2019s licenses. In Florida, they partnered with H&R Block for tax preparation. Later this year, Libre plans to launch an education initiative that will pay for GED courses. The effort aims to build goodwill within the Latino community, while allowing Libre to collect data that will be instrumental in coordinating political ad campaigns and voter targeting efforts next year. Libre also supports granting immigrants living in the country illegally a pathway to citizenship, a position that, while controversial on the right, allows them a gateway to increasing Latino support. The group does not, however, approve of President Barack Obama\u2019s use of executive orders to implement immigration policy\u2013a tactic currently tied up in federal courts\u2013which separates them from Latino outreach groups on the left. RELATED: Silver State looks to play in 2016 election \u201cThe Libre Initiative exists primarily to advance the principles of economic freedom to the Latino community,\u201d Libre Executive Director Daniel Garza, a former aide to George W. Bush and the son of migrant workers from Mexico, told CNN. \u201cIt is about driving a narrative, a conversation within the Latino community. If we\u2019re not helping to drive that agenda, somebody else is, and it\u2019s usually the left.\u201d Clinton doubles down on immigration Last week, Libre\u2019s non-profit armed hosted a conference for about 100 Hispanic business leaders from seven states in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as part of the group\u2019s multi-million dollar effort to promote conservative ideas within the Latino community and, they hope, convince them to vote for Republicans in 2016. Set inside the ballrooms of the Crowne Plaza hotel just off the intersection of one highway that streches coast-to-coast across the United States and another that slopes southward to the Mexico border, business leaders sat through presentations and panels on energy, over-regulation and trade. Panels included titles such as \u201cRegulations Stranglehold on Economic Prosperity\u201d  led by Libre operatives and talks about how to increase energy production in the state. Politics made a brief appearances when New Mexico Republican Lt. Gov. John Sanchez spoke on the power of the Latino vote. \u201cNo president will be elected ever again unless they have the right message when it comes to how do they attract Hispanic voters,\u201d Sanchez said. RELATED: 4 open questions about Clinton\u2019s new immigration push Indeed, in key battleground states, securing the Latino vote has been incredibly important in recent election cycles. In 2012, Obama received 71 percent of the vote. But in the 2014 mid-term elections, when the electorate is often more conservative than during presidential years, the GOP made gains within the community in states like Colorado, Texas and Florida. Libre operated relatively quietly until last year\u2019s mid-term election, when the group\u2019s advocacy arm\u2014called the Libre Initiative\u2014ran paid political ads in English and Spanish in close races around the country. Libre\u2019s campaign helped remove Pete Gallego in Texas, Joe Garcia in Florida and Ron Barber in Arizona\u2013all Democrats. Marco Rubio on immigration, economics, same-sex marriage \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a wake-up call,\u201d said Angela Kelley, an immigration reform advocate who works with liberal groups on Latino engagement. \u201cTheir message is intentionally fuzzy, but yet it\u2019s delivered with flawlessly competent clarity. That\u2019s a pretty brilliant combination. Those who disagree with Libre and the Koch brothers are really going to need to muscle up.\u201d RELATED: Clinton calls for \u2018path to full and equal citizenship\u2019 Now, a massive coalition of liberal groups is planning to strike back. Representatives from several organizations on the left met in the Washington office of the Latino Victory Project in early May to discuss a plan for how to counter Libre\u2019s efforts. Attendees included represenatives from labor unions, American Bridge, Mi Familia Vota, Media Matters and People For The American Way, according to attendees. Initial plans have been made to sound an alarm against Libre by highlighting their ties to the Koch donor network and relay a message that Libre supports policies liberals say are against Latino interests. They also plan to release a report about Koch industries that digs into the company\u2019s record on workplace safety and the environment, Latino Victory Project President Cristobal Alex told CNN. \u201cWhile I admire the rapid growth of this organization, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s for disingenuous purposes,\u201d Alex said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to begin having some very serious conversations with our allies to counter what Libre is doing. No one has really pushed back. So far they\u2019ve had free reign.\u201d RELATED: Will diversity help the GOP in 2016? Earlier this month, BuzzFeed News revealed that the Democratic National Committee had put together an internal presentation warning about Libre\u2019s strength that called on Democrats to increase voter engagement with Latinos. Jeb Bush challenged on immigration. \u201cIt has changed our calculus,\u201d Alex told CNN. \u201cThose on the left are starting to see, because Latinos can change their mind about who to vote for, they\u2019re going to start to pay attention to that and really investing in the Latino community.\u201d Groups on the left also point to the fact that the same donors who support Libre\u2014which is vocally supportive of comprehensive immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship\u2013also help bankroll Republican congressional and presidential campaigns that oppose it. RELATED: Second round for Arizona\u2019s sheriff\u2019s case against Obama \u201cLibre\u2019s Achilles heel is exposure,\u201d said John Loredo, the former Democratic Minority Leader in the Arizona state House. \u201cThey align themselves with people who are openly anti-Latino. Exposing them, however it may happen, that\u2019s a killer for Libre.\u201d Efforts against Libre are already underway. Last week \u2014 on the same day of the business conference in Albuquerque \u2014 a liberal research organization called the Bridge Project released a 48-page research document that outlined Libre\u2019s priorities and some of their funding sources. The group released the paper online, along with a Spanish-language video attacking Libre. Representatives from liberal groups The Latino Victory Project, Open Society Foundation and Mi Familia Vota plan to hold a roundtable discussion with reporters to outline their plans to counter Libre. Next Monday, People for the American Way plans to host a briefing with activists to discuss their Latino outreach plans and ways to counter Libre. \u201cThe irony here is that the Latino left had criticized the conservative movement for years that they were not doing outreach to the Latino community,\u201d Garza told CNN. \u201cNow that the conservative movement is doing outreach and engaging in the Latino community on a national scale, they\u2019re criticizing us for that too. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d",

            "article_content": "His father won in 1988. His brother placed second in 2000. Now, Jeb Bush\u2019s road to the White House may depend on whether he breaks the tie in the fickle New Hampshire primary. On his second day as a declared candidate, Bush arrived Tuesday to a critical state that could either propel him beyond the cluttered Republican presidential field or extend the party\u2019s nominating fight into a messy, uncertain battle. He was greeted by polite applause inside the historic Opera House here, holding forth with voters at a town hall meeting for more than an hour. But in New Hampshire, considering a small batch of protestors were waiting for him outside, polite is often as good as it gets, at least at this early stage of a raucous campaign. RELATED: In New Hampshire, Jeb seeks to shake shadow of family name \u201cThis is my first day. I\u2019m a rookie at this,\u201d Bush said, a smile of humility spreading across his face. \u201cI want your vote.\u201d Jeb Bush's life As he seeks to navigate a chaotic and crowded Republican race, the path for Bush must be a patient one, working to steadily overcome any skepticism about an American political dynasty and the still-lingering questions about his conservative record. \u201cI want to be your sixth choice,\u201d Bush said at one point, leading a burst of laughter at his own expense. \u201cI\u2019m working my way up to No. 1.\u201d The statement, though, is far closer to true than Bush would have ever hoped \u2013 or imagined \u2013 when he first started weighing his presidential candidacy. The pack of Republican rivals, along with voters, don\u2019t view him as a candidate with the frontrunner\u2019s shine of his brother or father. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule him out based on his last name,\u201d said Don Russell of Windham, who came to see Bush, summing up the sentiment coursing through a Republican electorate that has been reordered by the tea party since the last time a Bush was on the ballot. Russell and others interviewed here on Tuesday made clear they were far from sold on Bush\u2019s candidacy. He has until February to make his case to voters in New Hampshire, the state his advisers believe he stands the best chance of the four early-voting states to make his mark. RELATED: Will Jeb\u2019s Latino roots translate for Republicans? A day after rallying supporters in Miami at his formal announcement, where he delivered a speech that even many Democrats privately praised, it became clear that his challenge starts now. More than a dozen protesters lined the street outside his town meeting. They waved signs with an array of slurs, including: \u201cRead my lips, no new Bushes.\u201d Leah Wolczko of Manchester, who was standing among the critics, said she recoiled at the prospect of sending another Bush to the White House. She offered a litany of reasons, from bank bailouts to runaway spending to government overreach. \u201cBushes don\u2019t have a track record as conservatives,\u201d said Wolczko, who is leaning toward supporting Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. \u201cThey make government larger.\u201d The electorate in New Hampshire, with its fierce libertarian and independent streak, is notoriously challenging terrain for mainstream Republican candidates. But advisers to Bush concede there is no strategy that does not include a full-blown, aggressive campaign effort in New Hampshire. Photos: Political families \u201cAs you come to expect,\u201d Bush said at the opening of his town meeting, \u201cthe first stop for a candidate \u2013 not a potential one anymore, a real candidate \u2013 is New Hampshire.\u201d Here in Derry, he took question after question on fixing the economy. He renewed his call to simplify the tax code, reduce tax rates, cut government spending and implement entitlement reform. But he sought to include a disarming air of self-deprecation in many of his answers. \u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short as a speaker,\u201d one voter said. RELATED: Bush takes on immigration \u2013 but at hecklers\u2019 request \u201cI\u2019ll get better \u2013 I promise,\u201d he said. But Bush drew a sharp contrast with his 2016 opponents who serve in the Senate, saying he gained executive skills on the job \u201cthrough trial and error\u201d and didn\u2019t \u201chide behind the collectiveness of the legislative body.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t file an amendment and can call that success,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI actually did things as governor.\u201d While he is escalating his differences with his Republican opponents, Bush acknowledged in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity here Tuesday that it\u2019s a \u201clittle awkward\u201d to compete against his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and friend, Sen. Marco Rubio. \u201cBut that\u2019s just the way it is,\u201d Bush said, still praising Rubio as a \u201cgreat guy.\u201d He added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me a bit.\u201d The exchanges at the town hall meeting \u2013 the staple of any New Hampshire campaign \u2013 seemed to suit Bush. The reception was far from adoring, but he had no angry confrontations with voters, particularly on an issue that is one of his biggest vulnerabilities. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the guy who asks the immigration question every time,\u201d Bush said at one point. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d Bush, who often talks about the strength of his Catholic faith, paused momentarily when asked about Pope Francis\u2019 declaration that climate change and global warming were moral issues. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don\u2019t get economic policy from my bishops, from my cardinals or from my pope,\u201d Bush said. He added that religion should be \u201cabout making us better as people and less about things that end up getting into the political realm.\u201d Photos: George W. Bush's life, legacy While Bush headed to Iowa following his stop in New Hampshire, his advisers have yet to determine how aggressively to compete in the first-in-the-nation caucuses that come just before the primary. Social conservatives have dominated the Iowa Republican landscape in recent election cycles, leaving his path there even more complex. RELATED: Bush launches 2016 bid Powered by a muscular fundraising operation and the power of his political network, Bush will almost certainly make inroads as he intensifies his campaign. But several voters said they believe he may have a hard time convincing everyone he\u2019s his own man. \u201cPeople have these ingrained thoughts of somebody and no matter what happens, they\u2019ll always have them,\u201d said Don Wicks of Derry, a retiree who used to work in flooring sales. \u201cI think he can change enough (minds) to get by, even to win.\u201d But Hillary Clinton, he added, has the same problem. \u201cIf they\u2019re both the candidates,\u201d he said, \u201cthey cancel each other out in that aspect.\u201d CNN\u2019s Cassie Spodak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "He switched languages 27 minutes into his announcement speech. \u201cAy\u00fadennos en tener una campa\u00f1a que les da la bienvenida\u2013Help us to have a campaign that welcomes you,\u201d Jeb Bush said to a crowd of supporters Monday.  \u201cWork with us for the values we share and for a great future that is ours to build for our children.\u201d For a man who started learning Spanish as a teenager, married a Mexican woman, lived three years in Venezuela and was the governor of Florida for eight years, switching languages wasn\u2019t that difficult \u2026 it was expected by the roughly 3,000 supporters, many of them Hispanics, who gathered at the Miami-Dade College\u2019s Kendall campus to hear him say he\u2019s running for president. The 62-year-old Republican has been married for more than four decades to Columba, who was born and raised in Mexico. It all started when, as a teenager, he spent several months in her country of birth. At the age of 17, Jeb Bush taught English in a small village outside the Mexican city of Leon (Guanajuato state), Mexico as part of a student exchange program. It was during the same trip that he met Columba Garnica de Gallo, the woman who would become his wife. They speak Spanish to one another and she speaks Spanish to their children at home.  In 1996 he converted to her religion: Catholicism. Speaking at the Universidad Metropolitana de Puerto Rico in late April, Bush said can relate to immigrants. \u201cTrust me,\u201d he said.  \u201cI know the power of the immigrant experience because I live it each and every day. I know the immigrant experience because I married a beautiful girl from Mexico. My children are bicultural and bilingual.\u201d At a spring public event in Des Moines, Iowa; Jeb Bush, gave his listeners a glimpse into how he has embraced Hispanic culture. The Republican presidential candidate was talking about labeling of imported produce, but his answer gave people attending the Iowa Agricultural Summit on March 7 a good idea about where he stands when it comes to food. \u201cWhen I go to Publix [supermarket] in Coral Gables, which I\u2019ll do tomorrow morning, after church, to go prepare for a Sunday fun day in my house,\u201d Bush said, \u201cI\u2019ll probably make a really good guacamole, and I want to know where that avocado is from. I want to know where the onions are from and the cilantro.\u201d In college, Bush earned a B.A. in Latin American Studies from the University of Texas.  After college, he spent three years in Venezuela working for the Texas Commerce Bank, where he significantly improved his Spanish and gained knowledge of the culture. He\u2019s lived in Florida since 1980, a state that has the third largest population of Hispanics in the United States after California and Texas. SEE WHICH STATES HAVE THE LARGEST LATINO POPULATIONS While serving two terms as governor in the Sunshine State, Jeb Bush never had a problem communicating with voters and Hispanic media in Spanish, a skill that helped him connect with constituencies. More recently, Jeb Bush recorded an ad in Spanish endorsing former Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colorado) in his successful bid to the U.S. Senate. More than 25 million Latinos are currently eligible to vote in the United States and their role will be crucial in the 2016 presidential election.  For the 2012 presidential election, 17 percent of all Hispanic eligible voters lived in battleground states like Colorado, Florida, Iowa and Nevada, according to the Pew Research Center. While Jeb\u2019s brother George W. Bush had made inroads with Hispanic voters and cut into the Democratic advantage with them, Barack Obama drew them back toward Democrats. He won more than 70 percent of Hispanic voters in 2012. A winning Republican will likely have to bring more Hispanics back to the GOP. Last month, Bush\u2019s Political Action Committee Right to Rise published a YouTube video on the occasion of Fifth of May, a day in which Mexicans celebrate a victory over the French army. \u201cHere in the U.S., Cinco de Mayo has become a day where we celebrate our ties with Mexico and the great contributions of the Mexican-American community in the U.S.  In my case, this relationship is very profound. My wife Columba was born in Mexico, my family has always had strong ties with Mexico and I have great respect and affection for our neighboring country,\u201d Bush said in the video. In fact, Bush is the only non-Hispanic in the crowded field of GOP candidates aiming for the White House with a wide support among the Hispanic electorate. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a 44 year-old Floridian, was born in Miami to Cuban immigrants.  He frequently takes advantage of his fluent command of Spanish while campaigning. Ted Cruz, another junior senator, was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father who raised him in Texas. He\u2019s said in the past his Spanish is \u201clousy\u201d and has alienated some Latino voters for his hard stance on immigration. Rubio has previously supported a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers. Bush has not. But he has shown a more moderate side than most other Republican candidates on how to approach the United States immigration problems. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, Bush said he favors \u201ca strategic approach,\u201d meaning he would favor giving visas for highly-skilled foreigners. He also called immigration a \u201cgateway issue\u201d and stopped short of criticizing fellow Republicans for calling for mass deportations and saying no to legislation to address the issue of what to do with the eleven million undocumented immigrants already in the United States. \u201cIf you keep being against things, particularly something that has\u2026 we have emotional connectivity as immigration is for a lot of emerging voting groups, you\u2019re not going to even make your case,\u201d Bush told Tapper. But Matt A. Barreto, co-founder of polling and research firm Latino Decisions, and professor of political science and Chicano studies at UCLA, says it would be a mistake for Jeb Bush to take the Latino vote for granted. \u201cLatino voters have proven more than willing to reject even actual Latinos as candidates when their policy positions are in contrast to the community preferences.  Bush\u2019s marriage and linguistic skills, while symbolically important, would founder if his issue positions are in contrast to the average Latino voter,\u201d Barreto said. Barreto says, when you look at the record, Jeb Bush has been \u201call over the map\u201d on the issue of immigration. \u201cWhen he was not a candidate he was much stronger on immigration reform.  On his book he said that he would never support a path towards citizenship, which it\u2019s a step too far.  Later he came out on a Sunday morning show softening his position, but saying he doesn\u2019t support amnesty.  He\u2019s going to have to clarify his position if he truly wants to attract the Latino vote,\u201d Barreto said. Bush didn\u2019t intend to speak about immigration Monday, but he was forced by hecklers to briefly depart from his prepared remarks to address the issue. \u201cThe next president will pass meaningful immigration reform so that will be resolved \u2013 not by executive order,\u201d the former Florida governor said. A description of Jeb Bush\u2019s three children by his father as \u201cthe little brown ones\u201d proved an embarrassment in 1988 when then-Vice President George H.W. Bush was  running for president. Jeb\u2019s His sons, have followed in their father\u2019s footsteps and may prove invaluable to their father\u2019s bid to the White House.  Jeb Bush Junior, 31, has been called \u201cambassador to millennials,\u201d helping his father raise fund for the GOP.  His brother George P., 39, the eldest sibling, was elected Texas land commissioner and spoke at the Republican National Convention, introducing George W. Bush in 2000 . In April, Bush turned around a potentially embarrassing incident with the help of his son Jeb.  The New York Times had just unearthed a 2009 voter registration form on which he had listed his ethnicity as \u201cHispanic.\u201d \u201cMy mistake! Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fooled anyone!\u201d Bush tweeted the following morning. He was responding to his son, Jeb Bush, Jr., who tweeted out a link to the New York Times post and said \u201cLOL \u2013 come on dad, think you checked the wrong box #HonoraryLatino.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Jeb Bush's announcement speech was briefly interrupted by immigration protestors Bush isn't a clear front-runner as he enters the presidential race He faces challenges surrounding his family's legacy and his own positions Jeb Bush, a scion of the most recognizable family in Republican politics who fashioned an image as a sober-minded conservative truth-teller while governor of Florida, is running for president. Bush made his formal announcement Monday afternoon here in his adopted hometown during an appearance at Miami Dade College. His candidacy comes after a week-long European tour and months of intensive behind-the-scenes political maneuvering that erased long-standing doubts about his White House ambitions. Arguing that the country is on \u201ca very bad course,\u201d Bush told supporters in Miami that the nation had a decision to make. \u201cThe question for me is what am I going to do about it,\u201d he said Monday afternoon. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve decided: I\u2019m a candidate for president of the United States of America.\u201d Bush, standing calmly in front of a podium without a blazer, was at one point interrupted by protestors wearing yellow shirts with letters that read, \u201cLegal Status Is Not Enough,\u201d who calling for immigration reform. Departing from his prepared remarks, Bush shot back that as president, he would pass \u201cmeaningful immigration reform\u201d rather than solving the problem via an executive order. RELATED: Bush takes on immigration \u2013 but at hecklers\u2019 request Bush enters a crowded field of candidates, becoming the 11th GOP contender to jump in the race. In his homestate, his most threatening competitor is Sen. Marco Rubio: The two are currently competing for money in the Sunshine State and support from high-profile figures here. During his event, Bush showed off how he had already secured endorsements from key Florida Republicans. Members of the Florida state cabinet sat near the front and were recognized before Bush\u2019s speech. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Agricultural Commissioner, Adam Putnam and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater and former Florida Sens. Mel Martinez and George LeMieux all were in attendance. Without mentioning Rubio by name, Bush emphasized in his speech that voters should support a candidate with executive experience \u2013 a governor, not a senator \u2013 in 2016. \u200b\u201dAs our whole nation has learned since 2008, executive experience is another term for preparation, and there is no substitute for that,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe are not going to clean up the mess in Washington by electing the people who either helped create it or have proven incapable of fixing it.\u201d Monday\u2019s launch sets John Ellis Bush, 62, the second son of former President George H.W. Bush and younger brother of former President George W. Bush, on a potentially historic course that would confirm his family\u2019s standing as America\u2019s preeminent political dynasty, rivaled only by the Kennedys in their fame and cross-generational power. But it\u2019s clear Bush\u2019s campaign sees his famous family can be both a blessing and a curse. Looking on as Jeb Bush jumps into the race Monday was matriarch Barbara Bush, the former first lady and already mother of one former president, as well as a slew of other siblings, his children and more extended family. Absent? The two former presidents, who Bush only mentioned once obliquely in his speech. RELATED: Who\u2019s left? 2016 field takes shape \u201cIf Jeb wins, we have the most successful dynastic line in American political history, bar none,\u201d said historian Rick Perlstein, author of multiple books tracing the history of the Republican Party. \u201cI don\u2019t think you see this level of accomplishment across the generations with the Kennedys. You have a senator in Prescott Bush, and the son becomes president, then the grandson is also president, and now you throw in a former governor who might be a president.\u201d Bush hinted Monday that he knew he would have to win the nomination himself this primary season \u2013 rather then run solely on his lineage. \u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s turn. It\u2019s everybody\u2019s test. And it\u2019s wide open, exactly how a contest for president should be,\u201d Bush said Monday. But for all his name recognition, Bush isn\u2019t entering the race as a clear front-runner. A national CNN/ORC Poll released earlier this month found him virtually tied at the top of the field with Sen. Marco Rubio, a fellow Floridian. Behind them, 10% of those polled said they planned to support Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. When matched against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Bush trails 51% to 43%. Bush has suffered a few stumbles in the months leading up to Monday\u2019s announcement, most notably when he struggled to answer questions about his brother\u2019s invasion of Iraq, a line of questioning many Republicans said he should have anticipated. And he\u2019s gone out of his way to avoid declaring himself a presidential contender \u2013 until now \u2013 so he could keep raising money for the Right to Rise super PAC backing his candidacy. With his brother\u2019s presidency still deeply polarizing in the mind of the electorate, and foreign policy once again rising as a top public concern, his campaign will test the nation\u2019s appetite for another Republican named Bush. The late-May CNN/ORC Poll found that 56% of respondents said his connection to two former presidents would make them less likely to support his campaign. Should Clinton capture the Democratic nomination, a 2016 campaign between Bush and Clinton would undoubtedly be clouded by questions about legacy, nepotism and the vitality of a political system seemingly dominated by a pair of powerful families with close ties to wealthy elites in Washington and on Wall Street. Those anxieties would unfold against the backdrop of an America confronting dramatic shifts in demographics, economic behaviors and generational tastes, challenging the maxim that presidential campaigns are about the future rather than the past. Before that dynamic comes to pass, the pragmatic Bush must first overcome the more pressing challenge of securing the GOP nomination, a steep hill to climb for a self-styled reformer who has called for an ever-more-conservative Republican Party to temper its rhetoric, change its thinking and expand its appeal to nontraditional voters. In pre-campaign visits to the early nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Bush promised to run a \u201cjoyful\u201d campaign that capitalizes on optimism rather than fear. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would be a good candidate or a bad one, but I kinda know how a Republican could win, whether it\u2019s me or somebody else, and it has to be much more uplifting, much more positive,\u201d Bush said at a December event for business leaders hosted by the Wall Street Journal. The Republican nominee, Bush said at the time, must be willing to \u201close the primary to win the general without violating your principles.\u201d In fact, he strikes that optimistic tone in one of several YouTube videos his campaign released on the cusp of his launch. \u201cWe led, we reformed, we got results. That\u2019s what\u2019s missing from Washington. The D.C. crowd talks about what\u2019s wrong with America; I see what\u2019s right,\u201d he said in the latest released video, entitled \u201cThe Greatest Century.\u201d Bush proclaimed Monday \u201cthe greatest time ever to be alive in this world.\u201d For a cerebral policy maven who has rankled conservatives with his full-throated support for comprehensive immigration reform, the education standards known as Common Core and \u201crevenue enhancement\u201d in pursuit of a federal budget deal, it was an early and defining statement that will be challenged by the bruising gantlet of Republican caucuses and primaries that select the party\u2019s nominee. Already tagged with the dreaded \u201cmoderate\u201d label by some conservatives and fending off questions about his brother, Bush opens the campaign with even less good will among Republican voters than Mitt Romney had at the outset of the 2012 race, polls show. Even with a steady base of support, Romney \u2014 a business-friendly candidate like Bush who was the leading choice of the Republican establishment \u2014 confronted skeptical primary voters by dodging questions, contorting his arguments and staking out controversial positions on immigration and abortion rights to appease the party\u2019s restive grass-roots base, only to see his past statements spook him throughout his ill-fated general election bid. Bush will try to avoid a similar fate against a field of younger candidate that includes several uncompromising conservatives who entered politics in the polarizing heyday of the tea party movement. \u201cMost candidates have enough challenges answering voters\u2019 questions based on their own records, let alone the records of two presidents who share their name,\u201d said Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist, a conservative web magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair, but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d But when offered a chance to address some of the major decisions made by his brother during his presidency, Bush waffled. While traveling this spring to raise support for his forthcoming campaign, Bush struggled to address basic questions about George W. Bush\u2019s policy legacy, particularly the war in Iraq. In May, when asked by Fox News if he would have invaded Iraq \u201cknowing what we know now,\u201d Bush said he \u201cwould have.\u201d He later said he misheard the question. But when Fox gave him another opportunity to address the question, he declined to provide an answer:  \u201cI don\u2019t know what that decision would have been \u2013 that\u2019s a hypothetical.\u201d \u201cBut the simple fact was, look, mistakes were made, as they always are in life. This is not a \u2013 foreign policy,\u201d Bush added. \u201cSo we need to learn from the past to make sure we\u2019re strong and secure going forward.\u201d In a preview of the GOP primary battle to come, Bush\u2019s Republican competitors quickly pounced on him for not answering the question. The backlash prompted Bush to tackle the question again. \u201cKnowing what we know now, \u2026 I would not have engaged,\u201d Bush said on May 16. \u201cI would not have gone into Iraq.\u201d \u201cJeb can argue he had a more conservative record as governor, but that just may not count much with an electorate that remembers his father for a tax hike and his brother for two wars,\u201d Domenech said. \u201cJeb will have to battle those ghosts in order to get the nomination. He\u2019ll also have to navigate a field with multiple candidates who have every incentive to turn him into a creature of the past and brand themselves as the way of the future, to attack him as a Common Core-pushing technocrat, as soft on gay marriage, or as a lover of amnesty.\u201d Bush advisers predict he will actually benefit from dim expectations over time. They argue that Bush\u2019s record as governor \u2014 he called himself a \u201chead-banging conservative\u201d when he first sought the office unsuccessfully in 1994 \u2014 is actually more right-leaning on social issues, taxes, education reform and gun rights than many voters realize. Democrats hope to highlight that resume, and have already begun reminding  the public of Bush\u2019s controversial involvement in the legal battle over Terri Schiavo, in which the then-governor used the power of the state to keep the brain-damaged woman alive on a feeding tube over the wishes of her husband. Bush\u2019s efforts in the case not only infuriated Democrats who saw the governor as a social crusader, they rankled small-government conservatives who chafed at government intervention in a private family matter. With a crowded roster of candidates, Bush may not need to win over most Republican primary voters, and only a slice of wary conservatives, to secure the nomination. The successful Republican campaigns of Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008, both favorites of the GOP establishment, relied on consolidating a plurality of moderate voters, and allowing the rest of the field to cannibalize the conservative vote in primary and caucus states. \u201cThe battle to see who can attain the greatest degree of purity on the right can result in a fractured fight that splits that support across so many candidates,\u201d said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, who advised Romney\u2019s two campaigns in 2008 and 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Nascar race where five or six cars bunched up against the wall spin out, allowing one car to slingshot past them right at the turn towards the checkered flag.\u201d Bush, though, will face a thornier path than Romney, who had no viable GOP opponent in the race to win over centrist, business-friendly Republicans. In the 2016 campaign, there are multiple GOP contenders \u2014 like Rubio, Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry \u2014 who are, for now, palatable to mainline Republicans. But Bush has been busy tapping his family\u2019s network of wealthy donors since he began his behind-the-scenes campaign last winter, giving him an edge over his foes in the struggle for support among Republican power brokers in Washington and New York. And since 1964, no Republican has won the party\u2019s nomination without the blessing of the party establishment. Moving quickly last December in what his aides called a \u201cshock and awe\u201d campaign to lock in support from donors, Bush boxed out other establishment-friendly hopefuls like Christie and Rubio from padding their early war chests and boosting their standing with the media. No GOP candidate has raised more money than Bush \u2014 much of it going to an allied super PAC \u2014 precious funds that will be spent on staff, advertising and establishing a state-of-the-art campaign. Genial but sometimes given to fits of impatience \u2014 \u201cHe doesn\u2019t suffer fools well,\u201d one supporter recently confided to CNN \u2014 it remains a pressing question whether Bush, who last ran for office as Florida governor 13 years ago, is temperamentally suited to the staccato-burst combat of today\u2019s fast-moving campaign life. Unlike fresher-faced rivals like Walker, Rubio, Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Bush has never won an election, let alone a primary, in a polarized social media age that prizes pitched rhetoric over thoughtful discourse. But in a rush of behind-the-scenes work that began late last year as he inched closer to a campaign, Bush and top advisers Sally Bradshaw and Mike Murphy undertook the process of shoring up his weak flanks, hiring a brigade of younger political operatives and consulting with digital and data experts in Silicon Valley to build the kind of tech-savvy operation that helped President Barack Obama win two national elections. They recruited an Iowa-based GOP operative fixated with voter targeting, David Kochel, who helped Romney to an impressive near-win in the 2012 Iowa caucuses, and a communications director, Tim Miller, respected for his relationships with a younger generation of political reporters, many of whom were still in middle school when Bush last won an election. Kochel was expected to serve as campaign manager, but in a last-minute staff shake-up just days before Bush\u2019s presidential announcement, the campaign-in-waiting announced that instead, Kochel would remain as an adviser and focus on early voting states. Instead, the operation tapped a 39-year-old Danny Diaz, who has worked on the past three Republican presidential efforts. The eleventh hour reshuffling exposed conflicts in Bush\u2019s early operation that pitted old advisers who have been with Bush since his days as governor with new strategists and staff. As his campaign launch date neared, it also appeared that his super PAC would not reach it\u2019s early fundraising goals. Bush wrote off the criticism when asked about changing his campaign apparatus so close to the announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s June, for crying out loud, so we\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Bush said. Supporters say his willingness to analyze his own faults, process criticism and calmly reason his way through political complexities signals Bush\u2019s readiness for the Oval Office. \u201cJeb\u2019s never been surrounded by \u2018yes people,\u2019\u201d said Ana Navarro, an informal adviser to Bush from Florida. \u201cNot even in his private life. His friends and advisers have no qualms about disagreeing with him and telling him so. He doesn\u2019t shut down debate. He\u2019ll listen. Doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll change his mind. But he\u2019ll listen and take it in.\u201d CNN\u2019s Theodore Schleifer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "No more warm-ups: Hillary Clinton is now off and running, really running, for president. The Democratic frontrunner in the 2016 race on Saturday exited what her campaign has billed as a preseason mode of sorts \u2013 small, subdued roundtable meetings with voters, plus three dozen or so fundraisers \u2013 by packing 5,500 people onto Roosevelt Island, the narrow strip in the East River, in the shadows of Manhattan and next to the workshops of Queens. RELATED: Clinton strikes populist tone to make case for 2016 campaign \u201cI may not be the youngest candidate in this race,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will be the youngest woman president in the history of the United States.\u201d It was an effort to portray herself as a candidate for the future, rather than the past. But it was also an acknowledgment that Clinton has quite a past \u2013 a long history in politics that shapes America\u2019s perceptions of her second campaign for president. In the two months since she entered the race, much about Clinton\u2019s campaign and the lay of the political landscape has already come into view. Hillary Clinton: Need a nation with 'no ceilings' Here are eight things we\u2019ve learned since Clinton launched her campaign in April: And if she baits Republicans into a fight in the process, even better. Clinton has staked out positions as far left as she possibly can on issues like gay rights, voting rights, criminal sentencing, equal pay for women and immigration. These are all issues that could put the Republican primary electorate at odds with general election voters. It\u2019s an effort to piece back together the groups that handed President Barack Obama two terms in the White House \u2013 specifically minorities, young people and women. RELATED: Read the full transcript of Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech Consider: The same candidate who said eight years ago that she believes marriage is between a man and a woman is now including gay couples in campaign advertisements and hammering Republicans for failing to support anti-discrimination laws based on sexual orientation. Those lines drew perhaps the most applause of all Saturday. Economic issues, of course, don\u2019t muster the same kind of across-the-board support from Democrats and independents. So many liberals\u2019 eyes will be on Clinton\u2019s policy rollouts, which will come once per week from now through August. No doubt, Clinton and her campaign are taking the primary process seriously. They\u2019re organizing heavily in the first four states to vote. They\u2019re raising money and courting Democrats like they have a serious fight on their hands. They\u2019re working through the full checklist to avoid a repeat of 2008. But her rhetoric, while taking into account the leftward drift of her own party and the country\u2019s rapidly-changing demographics, is designed with a showdown with Republicans in mind \u2013 and she\u2019s showing no signs she\u2019ll bend to liberal complaints along the way. Bill Clinton on Hillary: 'I trust her with my life' Trade was the first test. She\u2019s ducked the issue for weeks. And the day after House Democrats halted a Democratic president\u2019s free trade agenda, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was nowhere to be found in Clinton\u2019s remarks Saturday. She mentioned increasing the minimum wage, but didn\u2019t pin a number on it \u2013 nothing like the $15 an hour that fast food workers are seeking. She hit hedge fund managers, but offered nothing like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s calls for big banks to be broken into pieces. If she hadn\u2019t pointed out her proximity to the United Nations headquarters in New York, someone new to politics might not have known that Clinton served as Obama\u2019s secretary of state for four years. Clinton\u2019s speech, and her entire campaign, are focused on economic inequality and social justice. She talks more about global warming threatening the United States than terrorists endangering the country. It\u2019s a stark contrast with Republicans, who see Obama\u2019s relatively slow-moving drift into combat with ISIS in the Middle East as a sign of weakness and Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state as one ripe for attack. Several polls have shown that more than half of Americans say they don\u2019t trust Clinton. It stands out in a raft of bad polling data for the Democratic frontrunner in recent weeks. And it\u2019s likely the result of the weight of several problems that haven\u2019t gone away \u2013 particularly her use of a private email while at the State Department and her family foundation\u2019s acceptance of foreign contributions. Dorothy Rodham is the best antidote Clinton has. RELATED: In kicking off campaign, Hillary to emphasize more Rodham, less Clinton Her mother\u2019s hard luck early in life \u2013 she was abandoned and went to work as a housemaid at age 14 \u2013 and the lessons she taught Clinton were featured in two big sections of Saturday\u2019s speech, as Clinton sought to convey the message that she understands Americans\u2019 struggles to climb the economic ladder. She said she once asked her mother what kept her going, and her mother\u2019s response was \u201ckindness from someone who believed she mattered.\u201d \u201cA first-grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share. The woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done \u2013 that was a bargain she leapt to accept,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd because some people believed in her, she believed in me.\u201d The 67-year-old Clinton is in her third decade in the national limelight. Nearly everyone in America knows who she is, and most already have opinions. So it\u2019s no surprise Clinton\u2019s campaign prefers to focus on the future, rather than the past. But Clinton herself was citing the Beatles hit \u201cYesterday\u201d as she attacked Republicans on Saturday. More importantly: She embraced three Democratic presidents. Two were no surprise: Bill Clinton is her husband, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the party\u2019s boldest president, is the namesake of the park where she held her rally. The third was President Barack Obama, who she served as secretary of state. She brought both up while discussing what she called America\u2019s \u201cbasic bargain\u201d of economic justice. \u201cWhen President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash,\u201d she said. Bill Clinton and Chelsea Clinton made their first appearances on the campaign trail Saturday, but the famous former president and first daughter didn\u2019t walk out with Hillary Clinton, and they didn\u2019t seize any of the spotlight. Otherwise, they might undermine a central theme Clinton wants to underscore: It\u2019s about you \u2013 not me. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight That doesn\u2019t mean the popular former president won\u2019t be on the campaign trail at all. Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri said Friday night that \u201cwe don\u2019t have a timetable for him,\u201d but that the campaign is \u201cgoing to be leaning on him for fundraising. We are going to be leaning on him for retail campaigning.\u201d RELATED: Hillary Clinton unleashes attack on Wall Street Campaign manager Robby Mook said the former president has offered advice on running the effort. \u201cHe is a really helpful big picture sounding board,\u201d Mook said, \u201clifting us up and thinking big.\u201d The Clinton Foundation, a global charity helmed by the family and which, by most accounts, does important work, has come under withering criticism after reports revealed that it accepted gifts from foreign countries and leaders while Clinton was serving as secretary of state. The reports raised questions \u2013 unsubstantiated, Clinton\u2019s allies say \u2013 of quid-pro-quos that feed into perceptions that the Clintons operates under different rules than everyone else. Bill Clinton has said he might cut many of his ties with the foundation if Hillary Clinton is elected president. And Hillary Clinton has defended the foundation\u2019s work. But an important chapter of one Clinton\u2019s post-presidency could now be a net negative for another Clinton\u2019s campaign. Hillary Clinton's team That\u2019s right: An avowed socialist who comes from Vermont and speaks with a heavy New York accent is Clinton\u2019s biggest threat. Several recent polls show him climbing as primary support for Clinton tops out around 60 or 65%. In a Wisconsin straw poll, Sanders nearly caught Clinton. RELATED: Hillary Clinton channels Roosevels in first campaign rally Sanders has been drawing surprisingly large crowds at his events in Iowa and New Hampshire in recent weeks. But strategists in both states say it\u2019s far too soon to tell whether those crowds are anything more than anecdotal evidence that he\u2019s a curiosity \u2013 a person voters want to check out but won\u2019t ultimately support. Also in the race are Rhode Island\u2019s Lincoln Chafee, who is hitting Clinton for supporting the 2003 war in Iraq just as Obama did in the 2008 primary, and Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who might have the most political talent of her challengers but hasn\u2019t gained traction yet. That, O\u2019Malley aides believe, will change as he shows up in bars and barns across Iowa and New Hampshire with his guitar, loitering as long as the people there want to chat with him and fielding as many questions as reporters will throw his way.",

            "article_content": "He'll make his announcement in Miami In CNN/ORC poll, Bush is at 13% Jeb Bush will officially announce he is running for president on June 15, formalizing his high profile campaign that has been ramping up all year amid a growing 2016 Republican field seeking the nomination. The former Florida governor, who until now has toured the country as a prospective presidential candidate will drop all pretense and launch his campaign at the Miami Dade College Kendall Campus. Since making his presidential intentions clear at the end of 2014, Bush has been seen as the top prospect to win his party\u2019s nomination and has spent the last months before his campaign launch raking in cash from the GOP establishment\u2019s top donors. However, he has yet to breakthrough as his party\u2019s frontrunner, as many have seen his Miami neighbor Sen. Marco Rubio rising in the polls. Bush teased the official announcement on Twitter on Thursday morning with a \u201cComing soon\u2026\u201d tweet that linked to a \u201cjebannouncement.com\u201d where he supporters were prompted to sign up to get a chance to register to attend the event. The website is funded by \u201cJeb 2016, Inc.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s ready,\u201d a Bush aide told CNN. Rudy Giuliani on Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton The location at Miami Dade College is no surprise for a candidate who has made education one of his central policy goals throughout his career and leading into his presidential run. The college is the largest in the state of Florida. In Florida, Bush marks his territory The campaign is also launching from Bush\u2019s home city, roots he\u2019ll be counting on as he competes with his fellow Floridian, Rubio, for the title of favorite son in the state\u2019s GOP primary. And lately, it\u2019s looked like Rubio will be Bush\u2019s top competition. Rubio claimed the top spot in the latest CNN/ORC poll released this week that puts Rubio at 14%. Bush came in second with a virtual tie at 13% and the rest of the pack close behind as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, also seen as a top prospect, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee both snagged 10% in the poll. Bush fights lonely battle defending Common Core The growing field has made it difficult for any candidate \u2013 not just Bush \u2013 to runaway with the lead. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry will become the tenth declared candidate on the Republican side Thursday, and this week Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal scheduled plans to announce a presidential bid June 24. Bush also faces an uphill climb to a first primary win in the early states, particularly in Iowa, where the state\u2019s heavily conservative Republican caucus-goers are questioning Bush\u2019s conservative credentials. That\u2019s because Bush\u2019s positions on a couple of key issues haven\u2019t sat well with his party\u2019s conservative base. Bush stands alone among the 2016 field with his support of the Common Core educational standards that have come to be a key litmus test among conservatives. Bush knocks brother George on spending And the former Florida governor, who is fluent in Spanish and whose wife is Mexican, also voiced support for immigration reform that includes giving illegal immigrants a path to legal status \u2013 still a tough sell for many Republicans. Bush\u2019s ties to the Latino community though would play well in the general election, where Latinos will be a key voting block to win over in forging a path to victory.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama's job approval numbers are sinking, according to a new CNN/ORC poll Overall, 47% say things in the country are going well, 52% that they're going badly President Barack Obama\u2019s job approval numbers are sinking as American attitudes about the nation\u2019s progress have taken a turn for the worse, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. A majority of the public once again say things in the U.S. are going pretty badly and disapproval of Obama\u2019s job performance has climbed back above 50% as well. In fact, former President George W. Bush is more popular than Obama. READ: The complete CNN/ORC poll According to the poll, 52% of adults had a favorable impression of George W. Bush, 43% unfavorable. When Bush left office in 2009, only about one-third of Americans said they had a positive opinion of him. This new poll presents a notable shift as Bush\u2019s overall favorability has remained well below 50% for much of his time as a presidential alum. Overall, 47% say things in the country are going well, 52% that they\u2019re going badly. That\u2019s a reversal from March, when 53% said things were going well, the highest share to say so during Obama\u2019s presidency. The shift comes across partisan and demographic lines, with no one group\u2019s opinions driving the overall change. Bush approval rating higher than Obama Obama\u2019s approval rating has suffered a similar blow. While it\u2019s dropped since April, going from a near-even 48% approve to 47% disapprove split to a negative-tilting 52% disapprove to 45% approve, the rising disapproval ratings come across party lines, from both men and women, from whites and non-whites. How are things going in U.S. today? And what\u2019s on Americans\u2019 minds? The economy continues to be the public\u2019s top issue, with 22% choosing it as the most important out of the eight that were tested. Fewer consider it the top issue now than did so last fall, however, when 30% called it the top problem, and it\u2019s well off the mark from its dominant position as the top issue throughout the last few election cycles. RELATED: Americans warm to George W. Bush Yet no other single issue has grabbed the spotlight as the economy has faded. Education ranks second, 17% call that their top concern, followed by terrorism at 13%, health care at 12% and the federal budget deficit at 10%. Fewer still call illegal immigration (8%), the situation in Iraq and Syria (7%) or energy and environmental policies (6%) the most important issue facing the U.S. Some of that dispersion is due to differing issue priorities by party. Democrats split their issue priorities broadly, 19% say the economy, 18% each name health care and education, and about 1-in-8 each cite terrorism (12%) and energy and environmental policies (11%). For Republicans, a different set of issues rises to the top, 20% name the economy, 17% terrorism, 12% each the federal budget deficit and the situation in Iraq and Syria and 10% each health care and illegal immigration. Just 8% of Republicans call education the top priority. There\u2019s also an age divide on issue priorities. Younger adults are least apt to consider the economy the top problem. Just 16% of those under age 35 say the economy is the most pressing issue, about twice as many (33%) cite education. Among those age 65 or older, however, terrorism and the economy are about equal as top threats, 21% say it\u2019s terrorism, 20% the economy. For those between ages 35 and 64, however, the economy remains tops. One glimmer of positivity remains in the poll despite the overall turn toward pessimism. RELATED: Are post-9/11 politics shifting? Compared with a year ago, more now say the nation\u2019s economy is recovering or already recovered. Half (50%) say so in the new poll, up from 43% last year at this time. Still, nearly one-quarter (23%) feel the economy is still in a downturn and getting worse. Despite the public\u2019s focus on the economy, it may not be the issue driving down Obama\u2019s approval ratings. While the public\u2019s assessment of his handling of the economy is about the same as it was in February, he\u2019s lost ground on his handling of ISIS (down 8 points since February). Obama: Fighting poverty can't fall prey to cynicism Obama\u2019s best mark on issues comes for his handling of race relations: 50% say they approve, 47% disapprove, while he tallies his worst marks on issues where his partisans are most apt to disapprove. For example, his 63% disapproval rating on handling ISIS includes disapproval from 34% of Democrats, and on government surveillance of U.S. citizens, 67% disapprove overall including 44% of Democrats. Asked to rate their feelings about living former presidents, Americans pick Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush as the most popular of the bunch, with 64% holding a favorable view of each. Jimmy Carter notches a 56% favorability rating and George W. Bush cracks majority favorability with 52%. That\u2019s his most positive rating since April 2005. His father\u2019s favorability ratings have also climbed in the last year, from 58% last June to 64% now. Clinton and Carter have held steady since last year. Americans view the sitting president less positively than all of his predecessors. The public is split 49% favorable to 49% unfavorable on Obama, a bit worse than his 52% favorable to 46% unfavorable mark in March, but similar to other reads on his favorability in CNN/ORC polling throughout the last year. The President\u2019s party continues to be more positively viewed than the GOP, according to the poll. Overall, 47% have a positive impression of the Democrats, 41% of the Republicans. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone May 29-31 among a random national sample of 1,025 adults.",

            "article_content": "Lindsey Graham hopes to run for president on his foreign policy credentials. Graham trails the GOP pack badly, polling at just 1% in some surveys. Lindsey Graham is running for president because, he says, \u201cthe world is falling apart.\u201d And if Americans are looking for a commander-in-chief, the South Carolina senator believes he\u2019s it. Graham, who told CNN last month he\u2019s been \u201cmore right than wrong on foreign policy,\u201d announced his presidential bid in his hometown of Central, South Carolina, on Monday. He hopes that his track record on foreign affairs will give him the advantage in a wide-open primary fight. \u201cI want to be President to defeat the enemies trying to kill us, not just penalize them or criticize them or contain them, but defeat them,\u201d he said at his kickoff event. The timing could not be better for Graham, a national security hawk announcing his candidacy on the day a key provision of the Patriot Act expired in large part because of Sen. Rand Paul, another Republican running for president. He becomes the 9th Republican to enter the field. Related: What happens now that Patriot Act provisions have expired? Paul and Graham are foils in their party and represent an internal struggle for the soul of the GOP. But Graham still barely registers in the polls. A Quinnipiac University survey out last week gave him 1%, and he did just 1% better than that in an April CNN/ORC nationwide poll. Graham: Want to join ISIS? I'm calling a drone RELATED: Lindsey Graham retires from Air Force ahead of likely 2016 bid He\u2019s banking his long-shot bid on his deep well of experience and long history of speaking out on global threats, experience that he believes is both unmatched and invaluable in a race where foreign policy is certain to take center stage. Of all the nearly two dozen Republicans running or contemplating a run, most are governors with relatively little experience in foreign affairs or young senators with a much shorter track record. And Graham\u2019s hoping that expertise, peppered with jokes delivered in an easy Southern drawl, will be enough to help him overcome conservative skeptics wary of his willingness to work with Democrats and his moderate position on immigration reform. A close friend of John McCain \u2013 who often jokes that Graham is his \u201cillegitimate son\u201d \u2013 the South Carolinian is no stranger to presidential politics, having campaigned for the Arizona Republican during both of his presidential runs. He\u2019s likely to have the favor returned; three of Graham\u2019s top campaign staffers are veterans of McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, and he\u2019s been talking up Graham\u2019s prospects for months. But for all of McCain\u2019s chatter, Graham has yet to break out in the pack. His advisers acknowledge their first and most urgent task is to introduce the candidate to voters. Graham campaign takes shots at Paul's foreign policy Where Graham needs no catching up on is foreign policy, which he and advisers are banking on as the top issue in the race. \u201cThere is no one in this race who was the length of experience and the record working on these issues, who has been a more stalwart advocate for a strong national defense, than Lindsey Graham,\u201d said Jon Seaton, who\u2019s slated to be Graham\u2019s national political adviser, told CNN. Graham emerged as one of the Senate\u2019s leading foreign policy hawks and has the resume to back it up. He spent more than six years as an active-duty Air Force lawyer and will retire next month from the Air Force Reserve after more than 30 years of service. He currently chairs three military, foreign policy and terrorism-related Senate subcommittees, has served on three others in the past, and has sponsored dozens of bills on foreign policy. Graham has also, by his own count, traveled to two dozen countries on official business and met with the leaders of many of them. Graham was one of the first senators to call for boots on the ground to fight ISIS and is an outspoken defender of government surveillance programs currently under scrutiny. He\u2019s a loud and persistent critic of what he sees as the Obama administration\u2019s weakness globally, which he charges has invited foreign threats, like Russia and ISIS, to take advantage. He supported the troop surge in Iraq, has called for sending military aide to help Ukraine stave off the Russian annexation of Crimea and has been sharply critical of the Iran nuclear deal, though he\u2019s worked to pass a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for a final deal. 2016 GOPers' foreign policy credentials But he\u2019s already got competition in the foreign policy space. Graham\u2019s advisers nearly universally (and without prompting) mention Sen. Marco Rubio in discussions of their candidate\u2019s foreign policy chops. It\u2019s an unspoken acknowledgment that in the absence of a stronger alternative, the Florida Republican, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has made strides establishing himself as the most credible Republican candidate on foreign policy. But they expect that to change once Graham jumps in. And Graham\u2019s already hinted that Rubio is on his mind. He\u2019s taken shots at the senator as inexperienced in the past, telling The Weekly Standard last fall that his experience working with Rubio on immigration reform told him all he needed to know about the Floridian. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy, but after doing immigration with him \u2013 we don\u2019t need another young guy not quite ready,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe\u2019s no Obama by any means, but he\u2019s so afraid of the right, and I\u2019ve let that go.\u201d Former Sen. Rick Santorum, who served on the Armed Services committee during his time in Congress and ran a program at a think tank focused on the threat of radical Islam, is also angling to run on claims of strong foreign policy credentials. Santorum declared his presidential candidacy last week. Graham\u2019s foreign policy experience may stand on its own. But his moderate positions on climate change and immigration reform will need some explaining in a GOP primary fight. As a member of the so-called \u201cGang of 8\u201d that pushed an ultimately unsuccessful immigration reform bill through the Senate in 2013, Graham will have to answer for his support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Unlike Rubio, who\u2019s shifted on the issue, Graham never backed down from the bill, and in fact, he\u2019s gone further, supporting access to Social Security benefits for undocumented immigrants in the past. He\u2019s also spoken out on climate change, calling for \u201csoul-searching\u201d within the GOP on the issue. \u201cCan you say that climate change is a scientifically sound phenomenon, but can you reject the idea you have to destroy the economy to solve the problem is sort of where I\u2019ll be taking this debate,\u201d Graham promised during a speech this past March. Sen. Graham: AQAP most lethal terror group in region They\u2019re positions that could trouble him in Iowa, with its deeply conservative GOP primary electorate and its sizable farming population. He could even struggle in his home state of South Carolina \u2013 an early primary state \u2013 against candidates with a similar profile, and polling has shown him in third place there. His advisers acknowledge he\u2019ll need to finish in the top three or four in Iowa and New Hampshire to have a rationale for staying in the race when his hometown face-off comes around. But they point to his improbable 2014 re-election win, where he easily defeated six conservative primary challengers, as evidence his campaigning abilities will help him bring skeptical conservatives around. Graham is well aware of the challenge; in fact, it may be a selling point for him to run. He said in a recent interview with Yahoo News that he thinks it\u2019s important to always challenge himself to be better. \u201cFor me to go to the next level, I\u2019ve got to even go further out of my comfort zone. I\u2019m going to be in a widely attended primary process if I run, and in many ways I\u2019ll be the odd guy out on certain issues,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI just gotta stand my ground and take what comes my way,\u201d he said.",

Jeb Bush's tale of two cities: Washington and Tallahassee 2016ers set to court Joni Ernst at Roast and Ride Updates on Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and African-American outreach, a Jeb Bush strategy debate, the impact of Nevada on Florida, plus the role of a new Iowa political fixture \u2013 those stories were in the spotlight as we circled the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table on Sunday. As Clinton strives to hold the Obama coalition largely intact, there are some grumblings about a staff hire that could create a \u201cCousin Pookie\u201d problem. Don\u2019t get the reference? It\u2019s worth a quick search engine foray if you have a minute. But in short, as CNN\u2019s Nia-Malika Henderson reminded us, it was the approach Team Obama credits with driving up African-American turnout in 2008 and 2012. Now, Team Clinton is a tad on the defensive over a staff hire that to some Obama veterans seems a little too old-school. Clinton and 'Cousin Pookie' \u201cThe Clinton campaign named LaDavia Drane to coordinate their African-American outreach,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cAnd she was a former executive director of the CBC (Congressional Black Caucus). I got some calls from grass-roots activists, the ones who really were helpful in getting Obama to turn out the black vote, and their question was, how does someone with CBC ties actually turn out the Cousin Pookie vote, right?\u201d \u201cThe Clinton campaign says they have a new strategy, which is part CBC, but partly grass-roots strategy as well, to motivate Cousin Pookie.  And they also say that Drane has ties to Ohio, which of course will be very important in the general election. A large black vote there that will be crucial for Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\u201d Clinton\u2019s emails from that now-infamous private server are being made public under court order. Some already have been released, and there is a schedule in place for the next round. It could take a while to fully play out, and Lisa Lerer of The Associated Press reported that having no control over the schedule irritates some in the Clinton campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s bad news for the Clinton campaign, which now is going to face this slow drip of email news that comes out,\u201d said Lerer.  \u201cJust about every month, there will be a spate of stories.\u201d \u201c(Republicans) are salivating at the prospect of these things coming out. We\u2019ll have to see what happens in the next few months.\u201d Ed O\u2019Keefe of The Washington Post spends most of his time these days following Jeb Bush on the campaign trail. Yes, Ed is officially covering Jeb even as Jeb insists he isn\u2019t yet officially a candidate. And at times, O\u2019Keefe reports, the Florida governor seems to be violating or at least questioning his own advice to voters when it comes to processing the family name and history. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about this is over the last three weeks, since he stumbled on Iraq, he\u2019s been telling reporters, don\u2019t compare me to 1988, when my dad ran, don\u2019t compare me to 2000, when my brother ran,\u201d said O\u2019Keefe. \u201cFocus on right now.\u201d \u201cHis argument is, as a conservative governor, he got a lot of things done, worked with Democrats, shrunk the size of government, and the economy grew. Here in Washington, Obama\u2019s been bucking Democrats, the economy is in a mess and his poll numbers are down.\u201d Joni Ernst is a United States senator and a rising GOP star about to dip her toe into 2016 presidential politics. Remember Ernst? Maybe you recall her response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address. Maybe you remember that 2014 primary ad that added hog castration to the campaign lexicon. Now, Jeff Zeleny of CNN tells us her coming \u201cRoast and Ride\u201d political event \u2013 yes, she rides a motorcycle \u2013 is catching the attention of the Republicans who would be president (and there are a lot of them). \u201cShe is going to play a central role in the Iowa nominating process for the next six months,\u201d said Zeleny. \u201cShe probably won\u2019t endorse, but all the candidates will be seeking her endorsement, wanting to stand at her side. So keep an eye on Joni Ernst and her Roast and Ride next weekend in Iowa.\u201d Marco Rubio campaigned in Las Vegas the other day and promised folks in Nevada they would be seeing lot of him. Rubio's Nevada strategy Smart campaigns have a Plan A and a Plan B, and it\u2019s increasingly clear Nevada is a critical piece of both for the Florida senator. Plan A: Get at least one win in the first three states (Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina) and then win Nevada as the exclamation point before heading home to the giant Florida GOP primary. Plan B: Win Nevada after going 0-3 to open the race so that Rubio survives to compete in his home state primary. Team Rubio is pretty confident these days that it has good odds of working off Plan A. But key allies also know nothing is certain in this muddled, crowded Republican race. One thing, though, is fairly certain: Rubio would have a hard time raising new money \u2013 and convincing voters and donors he is viable \u2013 if he were asking for votes in Florida without a win in one of those early states. \u201cIf we are 0-4, the money dries up and we\u2019re out before Florida,\u201d a Rubio insider said this past week during a conversation about the calendar. And the political writers\u2019 dream of a Rubio showdown in Florida with his former mentor, Jeb Bush, goes away. Now, Rubio allies say Bush may have the same issue \u2013 where is he going to win in the early states, they ask? But, worrying about their own house, it is clear Nevada is emerging as a firewall. Rubio lived there briefly as a child and was a Mormon before choosing to be Catholic. And while the politics of immigration are tricky, his team hopes his Cuban heritage and Spanish skills help.",

            "article_content": "Months after President Barack Obama announced sweeping immigration actions, new doubts are emerging as to when \u2013 if ever \u2013 the measures will take effect. The Obama administration said on Wednesday it will not ask the United States Supreme Court to intervene in a legal fight over the rules and allow them move forward, opting instead to wait for a lower court to decide on whether the controversial executive actions can take effect. If that court rules in Obama\u2019s favor, the millions of undocumented immigrants who could benefit from the program would be able to start applying for delayed deportation by this summer. But if it decides the injunction can stand, it could be years before Obama\u2019s immigration actions are realized. To the frustration of Obama and his allies, the rules, which include broad deportation protections and new work permit guidelines, have been stalled since February in a court battle initiated by Republican governors. By the White House\u2019s estimate, nearly 5 million undocumented immigrants who would have been eligible for the expanded deferral program are left in the lurch. Federal court rules against Obama immigration orders RELATED: Federal appeals court sides with Texas against Obama on immigration On the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website, where potential applicants can check their eligibility for delayed deportation, a disclosure blares in red lettering: \u201cDue to a federal court order, (the agency) will not begin accepting requests \u2026 on February 18 as originally planned.\u201d No new start date for the program is offered. With only a year-and-a-half left in his presidency, Obama is facing a ticking clock on enacting what many of his aides and supporters had hoped would form a major part of his domestic legacy. With legislative immigration reform all but inconceivable heading into a presidential election, new doubts are being raised as to whether Obama\u2019s actions will be in place by the time he leaves office in January 2017. The administration said on Wednesday it wasn\u2019t asking the Supreme Court to reverse a decision by a federal appeals panel that on Tuesday refused to lift a hold on the immigration actions. RELATED: Christie changes immigration stance, pulls support for pathway \u201cThe Department of Justice is committed to taking steps that will resolve the immigration litigation as quickly as possible in order to bring greater accountability to our immigration system by prioritizing deporting the worst offenders, not people who have long ties to the United States and who are raising American children,\u201d said Patrick Rodenbush, a Justice Department spokesman. \u201cThe department believes the best way to achieve this goal is to focus on the ongoing appeal on the merits of the preliminary injunction itself.\u201d A senior administration official said that even if the Supreme Court had ruled in Obama\u2019s favor \u2013 allowing the immigration actions to go forward \u2013 there would still be a level of uncertainty among immigrant applicants as to the standing of the program. Since oral arguments are expected on the original injunction in July, this time by a different panel of the same Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the injunction could have been put back into place if that panel decides to uphold it. Ultimately, the official said, the timing of a Supreme Court decision would have roughly aligned with a ruling from the Fifth Circuit, making it more logical to focus the attention of administration lawyers on the Fifth Circuit argument. The administration has not ruled out going to the Supreme Court if the injunction is upheld by the Fifth Circuit after the July arguments. Even if the courts do rule in Obama\u2019s favor, his immigration actions aren\u2019t likely to take effect for months \u2013 if not years. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University Law School professor, said even as the injunction on Obama\u2019s immigration actions remains in place, the real test will come when the merits of the actual lawsuit from the Republican governors are heard in court. RELATED: Jeb Bush stands firm on immigration, Common Core in Fox News \u201cThat could be a few years down the road, after a trial,\u201d he said. That delay, according to some legal experts, shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise to the White House. \u201cThe administration had to anticipate that this was a possibility,\u201d said Adam Cox, a law professor at New York University who signed a letter alongside nine other legal experts in November arguing Obama\u2019s immigration moves were within the President\u2019s legal authority. Clinton doubles down on immigration \u201cIf you look around, this is a recurring pattern with any major policy disagreement\u2014it gets translated into high stakes litigation,\u201d he said. That was the case with Obama\u2019s health law, which he signed in 2010. The Supreme Court is currently considering a challenge that, if successful, would strip Obamacare of federal subsidies \u2013 a central facet of the measure. But unlike the immigration actions, Obamacare has mostly gone into effect already, and even Republicans admit a legal victory in their case could be difficult politically if it means stripping Americans of affordable health care. A success against the immigration moves wouldn\u2019t carry that weight. Among the actions Obama announced in November was an expansion of a program first announced in 2012, which allowed certain young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States by their parents to remain in the country without fear of deportation. Last year\u2019s actions extended that protection to a wider swath of immigrants, including the parents of American citizens or lawful residents. The White House took pains to demonstrate the legal underpinnings of the new rules, including distributing the letter from Cox and other law professors stating the actions \u201care exercises of prosecutorial discretion that are consistent with governing law.\u201d RELATED: Clinton calls for \u2018path to full and equal citizenship\u2019 Obama, delivering an address to the nation from the White House East Room, said his actions \u201care not only lawful, they\u2019re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century.\u201d Those assurances, however, did little to prevent what many saw as an inevitable challenge to the legality of a major policy change that Congress wasn\u2019t able to approve. \u201cI think the current developments are an indication of how far a group of politicians is willing to go to settle a score with the President, even if it means losses in revenue and denying relief to millions of families in their very own states,\u201d said Clarissa Mart\u00ednez-De-Castro, the deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza, the Hispanic advocacy group. \u201cThe legal process will have to follow its course, just like many misguided anti-immigrant measures already have,\u201d she said. 5th Circuit is wrong on immigration. @POTUS followed precedent, took steps for families when GOP House wouldn't. Must continue the fight. -H Hillary Clinton, who is pursuing the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, has said she would go even farther than the President on immigration reform, though it\u2019s unclear quite how.

            "article_content": "Jitters about Jeb Bush in Iowa Is Perry the next Santorum? Clinton's parade performance Jitters about Jeb, some praise for Rick Perry, the meaning of Hillary Clinton\u2019s holiday weekend parade march and some coming Democratic competition filled our Sunday trip around the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table. Plus, a take from conversations with a couple dozen younger voters that was both interesting and a bit depressing. 1. Hillary\u2019s hometown parade & a test of 2016 style Memorial Day parades are a popular place to find politicians this holiday weekend, whether one is running for sheriff or president. Count Hillary Clinton among those marching, and it is both a familiar stroll for her and perhaps a glimpse at her style as she moves past early events that have been carefully scripted. Hillary Clinton campaign heats up? Maggie Haberman of The New York Times reminded us that Secretary Clinton \u2013 formerly Senator Clinton \u2013 has walked in her local New York parade before and gotten a great reception. Perhaps there\u2019s a tad more scrutiny this time because she is back in the running for president \u2013 and because she is about to enter a somewhat new phase of the 2016 effort \u2013 including the big official rollout rally. \u201cThere has not been a sense of great energy around her candidacy so far,\u201d said Haberman. \u201cSo that is one thing to keep an eye on.\u201d \u201cSo far, she\u2019s keeping these events small.  They\u2019re doing it for a reason, but you lose something when you do it that way and they need to really kind of galvanize and mobilize people.\u201d 2.  The summer of Bernie? So far, the Clinton strategy is pretty obvious: lay out her positions in a way that both protects her standing as the prohibitive Democratic front-runner and, when possible, exposes GOP divisions. Can she stick to what at times seems to be already a general election approach? Stay tuned. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny notes that the Democratic field is about to become bigger, at least officially, when Bernie Sanders launches his campaign on Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have a big rally, probably reminiscent of Howard Dean\u2019s big entry into the race in \u201903-\u201804,\u201d said Zeleny. \u201cThe question is, will this be the summer of Bernie? Will he be able to rally things? He\u2019s already getting a lot of online support and a lot of interest from that side.\u201d Zeleny adds that he will be watching Sanders and O\u2019Malley, who will launch later in the week, to see how much \u201cspace they occupy\u201d in the Democratic 2016 presidential field. 3. Jitters about Jeb, even as he says the ship has been righted It\u2019s a bit off when the candidates get into self-analysis, but there was Jeb Bush this past week saying all is well and the ship is righted. He felt compelled to make that statement after a stretch in which he seemed to have a hard time talking about the Iraq War and his brother\u2019s judgment in launching it. So is his self-assessment shared by other Republicans? Not so fast, reports Robert Costa of The Washington Post. \u201cWhen I was in Iowa and New Hampshire this past week, I sat down with a lot of Republican officials and donors in those states and I said, you know, really just give me a sense of what\u2019s on your mind behind the scenes,\u201d said Costa. \u201cAnd the topic almost all of them brought up was angst about Jeb Bush, angst about his candidacy.  They\u2019re anxious that he\u2019s not getting momentum, that he doesn\u2019t have energy in any way in this primary. They\u2019re not sure how he\u2019s going to get it.\u201d 4. Is Rick Perry the new Rick Santorum? Rick Perry torpedoed his 2012 run for the presidency. The trademark moment was, of course, when he couldn\u2019t \u2013 in a debate \u2013 name three Cabinet agencies he would eliminate if elected. This time, as he explores another run, the former Texas governor is but a blip in most polls. But Julie Pace of The Associated Press, just back from some time on the ground in Iowa, says Perry is getting some favorable reviews from activists as he works the state and seeks political redemption. And, Pace says, he has a model for his 2016 plan: the rise of former Senator Rick Santorum from 1% or 2% in early polls to victory on caucus night. \u201cHe is spending a ton of time in Iowa,\u201d said Pace.  \u201cHe\u2019s doing all of the big campaign forums.  He went to the Eagle Scout dedication of a local activist.  He\u2019s just doing the things that people in Iowa want to see candidates do.\u201d 5. Some Sanders buzz, plus a lot of disillusionment among younger voters I spent a good deal of time last week talking to younger voters, and possible voters. As always, these conversations were refreshing \u2013 the energy is inspiring and I was involved in several interesting conversations about big 2016 campaign issues. But some of it was a tad depressing. Losing the youth vote At a Boston dinner for the remarkable community service organization City Year, I was approached by a handful of young people who wanted me to know how eager they were to help Sen. Sanders in his Democratic bid. Many others said they were unimpressed with the candidates so far. Many expressed views consistent with what we see in public opinion polling: Many young people lean conservative or libertarian on issues such as taxes and regulation and NSA surveillance, but see the Republican Party as trapped in a time warp when it comes to issues such as immigration, climate change and same-sex marriage. My casual, and unscientific, focus groups included my older children. My son, Noah, graduated from Boston College on Monday. We drove back to Washington on Wednesday, with all his stuff, plus 18-year old Hannah King and \u201calmost four\u201d Jonah King. We don\u2019t talk politics much because they have always viewed it as dad\u2019s job \u2013 and boring. But for a chunk of our drive we did, and they had thoughtful observations about the big issues and about many of the candidates in the 2016 race. But \u2013 this is the tad depressing part \u2013 like many of those at the City Year dinner, they voiced the opinion that nothing gets done on the big and hard stuff anyway, so why waste their time worrying about the campaign? Whether you were happy with the results or not, the enthusiasm of younger voters in the Obama campaigns was good for our politics. There is a huge opportunity \u2013 and a huge potential campaign talent pool \u2013 available to the 2016 contenders. But most of the young people I talked to were skeptical about politics, if not outright disillusioned. All of the candidates, regardless of party, need to do a better job convincing these voters \u2013 and possible voters \u2013 that they are listening, and that it does matter.",

            "article_content": "After Mitt Romney lost the presidential race in 2012, his advisers readily admitted that one of their biggest mistakes was failing to define him before the Democrats did. Jeb Bush took notice. In town halls and intimate events across the country, the former Florida governor and likely 2016 presidential candidate is seeking to mold a narrative for himself \u2013 not as the son born with a silver spoon, but as a man who charted his own course by marrying a woman from Mexico, starting his own business and building a life in South Florida. It\u2019s a distinct life, he argues, that lets him appeal to nontraditional Republican voters in the general election. Speaking in New Hampshire on Thursday, Bush revealed some thinking into his likely campaign strategy, telling voters how he plans to avoid the pitfalls of previous Republican nominees who\u2019ve been forced to tack to the right during the primaries or failed to rise above attacks from opponents. \u201cMitt Romney was a successful, loving, caring, generous man\u2013and he never showed it,\u201d Bush said at an event in Salem. \u201cThe simple fact is: You\u2019re going to get attacked. You have to show who you are first.\u201d Likability is key, he added. \u201cYou can\u2019t just skip over that,\u201d he said, wading into the thinking process that voters go through about presidential candidates. READ: Jeb Bush knocks brother George on spending \u201cDoes he care about me? Do you like him? Does he have a sense of humor? Does he understand the fight I\u2019m in? There\u2019s some really basic questions you have to get to first before you get to the five-point plan to help people out.\u201d But trying to strike a balance between being too passive and showing enough fire in the belly, Bush insisted that forceful responses to attacks are still required. \u201cYou got to pop \u2018em,\u201d he said, slamming his fist into his hand. \u201cYou got to push back, and then get back to the message that matters.\u201d As Bush prepares for what\u2019s shaping to be a bloody and crowded Republican primary contest, he has largely tried to keep his focus on November 2016, looking straight past the intraparty contest by painting himself as a unifier. In fact, he was given multiple opportunities this week to criticize Sen. Rand Paul, a GOP presidential contender, for launching a filibuster over domestic surveillance programs that Bush staunchly defends. But he largely held back. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about Sen. Paul,\u201d he said, arguing that opponents of the Patriot Act are \u201cnot as relevant\u201d to the debate as the issues themselves. Bush was pressed last week at a town hall in Reno, Nevada, on how he would bridge the libertarian and establishment wings of the Republican Party, a division that\u2019s especially seen drama in the early caucus state. Taking a pragmatic approach, Bush argued that Republicans need to push past their differences and focus on winning. \u201cMy focus will be on not turning back and getting into a food fight with people that might not agree with me completely,\u201d he said. \u201cPut on your big boy pants and take it, you know, when someone doesn\u2019t agree with you.\u201d And it\u2019s no secret that a lot of conservative voters don\u2019t agree with him. His support for comprehensive immigration reform or the Common Core education standards has riled conservatives to the point that it comes up at nearly every event. \u201cHis Common Core stance is kind of a deal-breaker for a lot of people \u2014 and I mean a lot of people,\u201d said John Potucek, a state representative from New Hampshire who attended Bush\u2019s event in Concord Thursday morning. Still, he stressed he\u2019s still open to voting for Bush. The former governor isn\u2019t backing down from his position, trying instead to re-educate people on the controversial testing standards. Nor is he easing his view in favor of expanded legal immigration and a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants already in the country that meet certain criteria. READ: Jeb Bush blames Iraq unrest on Obama While those positions are bound to bring fury during the primaries, Bush is banking on his ability to explain his reasoning and his experience\u2014especially on education\u2014as governor. Bush is also motivated by the math. \u201cYou got to get to 50 - or pretty close to it - to win. And to get to 50 you have to add, not subtract,\u201d he said in Portsmouth, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone. \u201cAnd so you can\u2019t start subtracting in a primary, and then you always have to keep your eye on the fact that while you\u2019re doing that you can\u2019t be subtracting for the general.\u201d Outside of the party, he believes winning requires reaching out to people who don\u2019t traditionally vote for Republicans. \u201cGo campaign outside your comfort zone, campaign outside of the choir,\u201d he said Wednesday. Bipartisanship is no outlier when it comes to campaign messaging. Paul has been showcasing his partnerships with congressional Democrats to propose legislation on issues involving criminal justice reform and civil liberties. Chris Christie touts his ability to work with the Democratic-legislature in the reliably blue state of New Jersey. For his part, Bush points to his two terms as governor in a large swing state and looks to past Republican presidents as examples\u2014but not to his father or his brother. \u201cThink of Reagan,\u201d he said Wednesday in Bedford, New Hampshire. \u201cHe was a kind man and a person that didn\u2019t do victory dances on his adversaries; he embraced them.\u201d Richard Nixon, he also said, set an example of relationship-building with his efforts to unfreeze ties with China in 1972. \u201cIt was transformative,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI think we should be striving for Nixon-to-China moments across the board.\u201d Bush won applause from the roundtable in New Hampshire that his first phone calls as president would be to the Republican and Democratic leadership of both parties. \u201cBoth parties,\u201d he said, when asked who he would call first. \u201cYou can\u2019t jam big things down peoples\u2019 throats in Washington because of the rules and because of our history, we\u2019re just not designed that way.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that he was responding to a question from Renee Plummer, a New Hampshire activist who hosted the roundtable event and advocates for more bipartisanship in Congress. \u201cI was thrilled with that,\u201d she told reporters after the event, referring to his answer. \u201cYou got me at \u2018working together.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "Likely presidential hopeful Chris Christie said that he has changed his position on a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, becoming the latest Republican to recast their stance on one of the thorniest issues they\u2019ll face during the 2016 election. The New Jersey governor said Monday that he does not support possible citizenship for the immigrants, calling it an \u201cextreme way to go.\u201d In 2010, the newly-elected Republican encouraged leaders in Washington to secure the border but also to \u201cput forward a common sense path to citizenship for people.\u201d Since then, he has often avoided discussing the issue entirely. In an interview with Megyn Kelly of Fox News, Christie changed his tune. \u201cI think I\u2019ve learned over time about this issue and done a lot more work on it,\u201d he said. \u201cBack in 2010, I was in my first couple months as governor. I\u2019ve now learned some of the ramifications for all these things.\u201d Christie explained that he still believed the country needed to deal with the current immigration problem, but that Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposed path to citizenship amounted to \u201cpandering\u201d and was \u201cnot based upon an educated study of the issue.\u201d Clinton doubles down on immigration If elected president, Christie said, he would immediately roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order shielding some immigrants from deportation. Christie did not say what precisely his plan would be to address the 11 million undocumented immigrants estimated to currently live in the United States. Yet he has also not launched his presidential campaign, which he is expected to do in the coming months. Many of Christie\u2019s rivals for the Republican nomination have struggled to articulate what they would do with the current immigrants already here. GOP leaders, facing an increasingly diverse electorate, have encouraged the party to adopt a more accomodating tone on issues important to Latino voters, but the Republican base is deeply skeptical of any presidential aspirants who embrace what is derided as \u201camnesty.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida once pushed for a possible pathway to citizenship as part of a comprehensive immigration bill, but he now has distanced himself from his own legislation. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has said that his view on the issue had changed, but he has still reportedly told some potential supporters that he could support citizenship. Christie\u2019s candid admission comes as he focuses his imperiled presidential ambitions on New Hampshire, which tends to elevate more moderate GOP candidates.",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush has his eyes on Nevada \u2013 a state that is aiming to become a bigger player in presidential politics. Bush\u2019s attention \u2013 and that of the growing Republican field \u2013 could result in more competition here after much of the 2008 and 2012 presidential field ignored the state, despite its fourth-in-the-nation nominating status. Bush, who hopes to appeal to Nevada\u2019s ever-growing Hispanic voting bloc, visited the state for the second time since March on Wednesday, just days after hiring well-regarded strategists to run his Nevada operation. His visit is among stops made by a throng of other White House hopefuls who are hoping to seize momentum in a state dominated by Mitt Romney and Ron Paul in the past two contests. Jeb Bush flip-flops on Iraq war opinion RELATED: Student confronts Jeb Bush on ISIS Nevada didn\u2019t become an early-voting state until 2008, so the past two cycles have also been experimental \u2013 and Republicans here will tell you the caucuses didn\u2019t go so well. \u201cConfusing\u201d and \u201ccomplicated\u201d are two words thrown around to describe the process. The state party is now pushing for a primary instead in 2016. Thanks to support from the state\u2019s Mormon population, Romney won more than 50% of the caucus vote in 2008 and 2012, while Paul struck a chord with the state\u2019s more libertarian faction and won over a slate of delegates. But with Romney off the ticket this cycle, Nevada\u2019s caucuses are wide open, and White House hopefuls are making the Silver State a more significant part of their calculation. Bush made Nevada his first early-state stop this year when he road-tested his stump speech in March, before going on to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the big four in February. It\u2019s hugely important,\u201d Bush told local reporters after he held a town hall in Reno on Wednesday morning. During the event, Bush told the crowd of about 150 people that he \u201chad a blast\u201d campaigning for his father in Nevada during the general elections. But he was quickly corrected on his pronunciation of the state. Like many out-of-staters, Bush pronounced the state\u2019s name \u201cNev-AH-da\u201d at the top of his speech. \u201cNev-AD-a,\u201d members of the audience shouted out. \u201cNev-AD-a,\u201d he repeated back. \u201cWell, got that out of the way. Thank you.\u201d Chris Christie: U.S. should not have invaded Iraq RELATED: Iraq haunts Jeb Bush in 2016 Further signaling his interest, Bush hired two well-regarded Republican operatives: Ryan Erwin, a top adviser to Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, who won re-election last year in a swing district, and a strategist from Erwin\u2019s firm, Scott Scheid. The ground game in Nevada is certainly no cakewalk. While voters are largely concentrated in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, a sizable portion of Republican caucus-goers live in the rural areas of the sparsely populated state that covers 110,000 square miles. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how the candidates play that strategy,\u201d said David Damore, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u201cIf you advertise in Vegas, you\u2019re getting three-fourths of the voters, but the most Republican parts of the state are the hardest to reach.\u201d For Bush, Nevada also provides a bit of a blank slate. The state\u2019s presidential preference vote wasn\u2019t in play during the campaigns of his father and brother, so there\u2019s no significant primary history for Bush to compete with or live up to \u2013 unlike in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. (Since Nevada is a swing state, however, his father and brother both competed here during the general elections.) Also of note, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval is, like Bush, a big backer of Common Core and can provide Bush with cover as he treads through strong sentiments against the controversial testing standards. Sandoval endorsed then-Gov. Rick Perry early on in the last cycle, but it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll choose a candidate this time around, given that he could run to replace retiring Sen. Harry Reid on Capitol Hill. Jeb Bush on Iraq: 'I would have and so would have Hillary' RELATED: Bush tries to move past Iraq questions The Nevada governor\u2019s support will nonetheless be courted. Answering questions about whether Bush is considering Sandoval as a potential running mate, Bush told reporters Wednesday that he\u2019s a \u201cbig fan\u201d of the governor. \u201cI enjoy our friendship,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cIt\u2019s way premature for someone who is considering running to be talking about that.\u201d And with the sixth-most populous Hispanic electorate in the country, Nevada gives Bush further incentive to showcase his ties to the Hispanic community. Bush and his wife, who\u2019s from Mexico, lived in Venezuela when they were younger and now live in South Florida. Bush is fluent in Spanish and stands by his unpopular push for a path to legal status for undocumented workers. While Bush meets resistance over his immigration proposal from Republican primary voters in other early-voting states, Damore expects \u201che\u2019ll get a pass\u201d in Nevada because the issue is less of a fiery topic in the state, where more than one-quarter of the population is Hispanic. \u201cImmigration is not an animating issue here like taxes or the scope of government,\u201d Damore said. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who\u2019s also angling to compete for Hispanic voters, lived in Las Vegas when he was younger and recently brought on Nevada Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison as his state chairman. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has said he still has family in Southern Nevada, where his father worked as a bartender at the Sam\u2019s Town Hotel and his mother worked as a housekeeper at the Imperial Palace hotel. \u201cWe have great affection for Nevada,\u201d Rubio told the Las Vegas Review-Journal when he visited the state in February during his book tour. \u201cWe look forward to coming back many times.\u201d Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, however, has been perhaps the most organized on the ground in Nevada, with an infrastructure that he in part inherited from his father\u2019s presidential campaigns. While Romney snagged a majority of the vote in the 2012 caucuses, Paul ultimately won more delegates, and they protested loudly at the Republican National Convention later that year. It\u2019s because of that situation that the state GOP chairman is now pushing for Nevada to hold a primary instead of a caucus. \u201cIt was a total disaster the way it was handled. It was an embarrassment for the state,\u201d Nevada GOP Chairman Michael McDonald told the Washington Examiner. A primary, however, could potentially dilute the pro-Paul activists who are still organized at the caucus level and attract a broader pool of voters \u2013 a setback for Paul but a potential benefit for candidates like Bush. Jeb Bush's life But Team Rand doesn\u2019t see it as a problem. \u201cRand can and will compete in whatever selection process chosen by the people of Nevada,\u201d said Doug Stafford, a top Paul adviser. At the Bush town hall, one woman asked the former governor how he plans to unite the divided party in Nevada. Bush said Republicans aren\u2019t always going to agree with one another but that they need to focus on winning. \u201cWe need to get back to \u2018How do you get to 50?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus will be on not turning back and getting into a food fight with people that might not agree with me completely \u2014 put on your big boy pants and take it.\u201d Other White House hopefuls have visited the state in part to court support from Republican megadonor and casino titan Sheldon Adelson, who supported Newt Gingrich and who\u2019s known for his staunch support of Israel. Last month, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Perry flocked to the Republican Jewish Coalition\u2019s spring meeting in Vegas. In addition to his town hall in Reno on Wednesday, Bush headlined the Clark County Republican Party\u2019s Lincoln Day dinner at the Orleans Hotel in Las Vegas. Ben Carson was also in town on Wednesday night to headline a dinner that raises money for Opportunity Village, a nonprofit that helps people with intellectual disabilities. \u201cThis time, I think we\u2019re going to be hugely competitive,\u201d said Aaron Sims, who\u2019s running for mayor of Carson City. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot more of the percentage of the vote being divided among these candidates.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The campaign whiz kids that led Barack Obama to two improbable presidential victories are having mixed results translating their groundbreaking tactics overseas. In Thursday\u2019s UK elections, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, who worked with Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, came out on top. But that meant David Axelrod, once Obama\u2019s senior political guru and in the UK elections an adviser to Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband, faced a stunning defeat. Cameron\u2019s weighty choices to shape U.S.-UK relations Axelrod is not the only former Obama campaign strategist to have fallen short in contests abroad, despite peddling Obama-esque messages of hope and change and using many of the same organizational strategies that drove the American candidate to his unexpected White House win. Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s re-election delivered a rebuke to Obama\u2019s former national field director, Jeremy Bird, who was advising a group working to unseat the prime minister. And Democratic pollster Mark Mellman consulted for the Israeli centrist Yesh Atid party only to see its representation in the Legislature cut nearly in half. Strategists from both parties often dabble in international elections during their off year as a way to make an extra buck and fill the time between elections. Scotland's political brawl: Nicola Sturgeon vs. Jim Murphy Those who have worked on races abroad said that while the task and message may remain the same worldwide \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re always going to focus on the future, on change, on hope,\u201d said Democratic strategist James Carville \u2013 the circumstances vary widely from country to country, making it difficult to use a one-size-fits-all approach to electioneering. \u201cYou talk about 50 shades of gray? There\u2019s 100 shades of democracy,\u201d Carville said. \u201cPolitical parties mean \u2013 in different parts of the world \u2013 they mean very different things.\u201d Carville should know; he said he\u2019s consulted in 22 different countries, and that they all came with unique challenges. First, there\u2019s the language barrier. Then, as Democratic strategist Tad Devine \u2013 another American strategist who has consulted abroad \u2013 noted, there are cultural differences. \u201cYou will never understand as much about their country as they do,\u201d Devine said. \u201cSometimes, the differences are cultural \u2013 different words sometimes mean different things.\u201d There are also practical constraints that can make it impossible to implement many of the tried-and-true data techniques in other countries. Some nations have restrictive privacy laws that make it impossible for campaigns to acquire all the information they\u2019d need to target voters precisely. And most nations\u2019 politics aren\u2019t as flush with cash, putting some of the more expensive techniques out of reach. Labour leader Ed Miliband holds seat Bird reportedly implemented many of the same organizational and data tactics in Israel that he used during Obama\u2019s re-election campaign, but ultimately fell short. He did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication of this piece. Paul Begala, another Democratic strategist, who advised Israeli Labor leader Isaac Herzog, pointed to the condensed time frame for elections there as partly to blame. \u201cThe short duration of campaigns in countries like Israel and the UK limits how much data you can compile, as well as the number of times you can contact voters,\u201d he said. Elections run about three months in Israel and six weeks in the UK. Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and longtime Labour Party adviser, agreed. \u201cThe data techniques are greatly overrated in their effectiveness outside of the U.S.,\u201d he said. But in the UK election, the issue for the Labour Party wasn\u2019t a failure of data or technology, Greenberg argued \u2013 it was the politics of division used by Conservatives. \u201cThe Conservatives did well in running as an anti-immigration, anti-Europe and anti-Scots party,\u201d he said. That strategy, Greenberg contended, might provide Republicans in the United States with a blueprint for a similar showing in 2016. \u201cThe Republican Party is an anti-immigration party,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may look at how, in the end, the Conservatives were able to grow their vote by polarizing around the anti-Scottish sentiment in the UK.\u201d UK election shock: David Cameron defies polls Greenberg defended Axelrod\u2019s performance, arguing that his role \u2013 \u201cmostly to refine the message, to focus on that core issue of what\u2019s facing working people\u201d was actually \u201cpretty effective.\u201d He pointed out that Miliband\u2019s popularity improved by the end of the election. Highs and lows of the U.K. election But his comments for Messina, who has been tapped to run a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC, were much harsher. \u201cMy problem with Messina is crossing the line and working for the conservatives who run an anti-immigration campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you go and work for progressives in the states, and go and work for a conservative party in Britain.\u201d Greenberg\u2019s comments hinted at the tension between Messina and Axelrod that lent the UK election a more personal tone for the two ex-allies. He pointedly declined to comment when asked if that tension had contributed to Axelrod\u2019s decision to work on the race. But for all the difficulties \u2013 and all the losses \u2013 foreign elections maintain an allure for powerhouse strategists from both major American parties. Carville said he doesn\u2019t consult overseas much anymore but that when he did, he did so because \u201cit\u2019s fun.\u201d \u201cYou never go anywhere that you don\u2019t come back with something,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully a check \u2013 but you come back with some knowledge too.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush said he would have done the same as his brother in deciding to go to war in Iraq if he had been president at the time. His comments, in an interview with Fox News set to air on Monday night, come in the wake of Bush\u2019s private statement that he relies on his brother, former President George W. Bush, as an adviser on some Middle East affairs. \u201cI would have [authorized the invasion], and so would have Hillary Clinton, just to remind everybody. And so would almost everybody that was confronted with the intelligence they got,\u201d Bush said in the interview. RELATED: Jeb Bush says he doesn\u2019t feel like \u2018yesterday\u2019s news\u2019 Clinton\u2019s 2003 vote in support of a resolution to green-light the war in Iraq was a key part of the 2008 campaign, then then-Sen. Barack Obama hammered her hawkish stance. It could help Bush blur lines between the two when it comes to his brother\u2019s legacy. Bush said the United States should have focused more on security in Iraq, but said his brother agrees on that point. \u201cBy the way, guess who thinks that those mistakes took place as well? George W. Bush,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I mean, so just for the news flash to the world, if they\u2019re trying to find places where there\u2019s big space between me and my brother, this might not be one of those.\u201d In the same interview, Bush said he thinks he can sell the Republican base on his position on immigration \u2013 and he\u2019s hitting opponents who have changed their positions on the issue. \u201cI get a sense that a lot of people can be persuaded, to be honest with you,\u201d the former Florida governor told Megyn Kelly in a preview of his interview that aired Sunday. Bush has urged a respectful tone toward undocumented immigrants and has said it should be easier for those immigrants to gain legal status. That position is anathema to much of the party\u2019s conservative base, which opposes \u201camnesty\u201d in any form \u2013 particularly the executive actions President Barack Obama has taken to allow immigrants who were brought into the United States as children to stay, as well as the undocumented parents of U.S. citizen children. Bush said he would repeal Obama\u2019s unilateral actions. But the former Florida governor took a shot at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, though not by name, for changing his position on immigration. Walker once supported a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants, but has said he\u2019s changed his views \u2013 and even recently called for limits on legal immigration. \u201cDo you want people to just bend with the wind, to mirror people\u2019s sentiment, whoever\u2019s in front of you?\u201d Bush said. \u201c\u2018Oh yes, I used to be for that, but now I\u2019m for this\u2019 \u2013 is that the way we want to elect presidents?\u201d Bush\u2019s perspective differs from much of the GOP field: He lives in Miami, has a Mexican-born wife and has said his family speaks Spanish at home. His brother, former President George W. Bush, previously supported immigration reform efforts. Another Florida Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio, also supported efforts to ease immigrants\u2019 ability to attain legal status \u2013 though he\u2019s since backed off that position as Republicans have grown increasingly critical of Obama\u2019s handling of the issue. As Republicans shift to the right, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has run as far to the left as possible, saying undocumented immigrants should be allowed to become U.S. citizens and that she\u2019d try to go further than Obama in using her executive authority to aid immigrants. Though a politically challenging position for Bush in his likely GOP primary campaign, a moderate immigration position would serve him well in a general election campaign as Hispanic voters are the most rapidly growing voting bloc.",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush isn\u2019t backing off positions on immigration and Common Core \u2013 and says people should \u201cchill\u201d on the polls, which show those issues causing him problems among conservatives. The former Florida governor\u2019s support for overhauling U.S. immigration laws \u2013 including backing a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants \u2013 is thought to be among his biggest challenges in courting Republican presidential primary voters. In a Fox News interview with Megyn Kelly that aired Monday night, Bush said he still favors \u201callowing for a path to legalized status \u2013 not necessarily citizenship\u201d for those immigrants. RELATED: Jeb Bush says he would have authorized Iraq War While Bush said he would undo President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions to forestall deportation for \u201cDreamers,\u201d or young adults brought into the United States as children, and the undocumented parents of U.S. citizen children, his critique was of Obama\u2019s process of using executive power, not the policy moves. He said he\u2019d like to see those changes adopted by Congress. And he said he favors allowing undocumented young adults to qualify for in-state tuition at universities because \u201cthere\u2019s a point past which we\u2019re over the line.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019ve been here for an extended period of time, you have no nexus to the country of your parents, what are we supposed to do? Marginalize these people forever?\u201d Bush said. Bush has urged a respectful tone toward undocumented immigrants and has said it should be easier for those immigrants to gain legal status. That position is anathema to much of the party\u2019s conservative base, which opposes \u201camnesty\u201d in any form \u2013 particularly the Obama\u2019s executive actions. Jeb Bush's life But the former Florida governor took a shot at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, though not by name, for changing his position on immigration. Walker once supported a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants, but has said he\u2019s changed his views \u2013 and even recently called for limits on legal immigration. \u201cDo you want people to just bend with the wind, to mirror people\u2019s sentiment, whoever\u2019s in front of you?\u201d Bush said. \u201c\u2018Oh yes, I used to be for that, but now I\u2019m for this\u2019 \u2013 is that the way we want to elect presidents?\u201d Bush\u2019s perspective differs from much of the GOP field: He lives in Miami, has a Mexican-born wife and has said his family speaks Spanish at home. His brother, former President George W. Bush, previously supported immigration reform efforts. Another Florida Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio, also supported efforts to ease immigrants\u2019 ability to attain legal status \u2013 though he\u2019s since backed off that position as Republicans have grown increasingly critical of Obama\u2019s handling of the issue. As Republicans shift to the right, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has run as far to the left as possible, saying undocumented immigrants should be allowed to become U.S. citizens and that she\u2019d try to go further than Obama in using her executive authority to aid immigrants. Though a politically challenging position for Bush in his likely GOP primary campaign, a moderate immigration position would serve him well in a general election campaign as Hispanic voters are the most rapidly growing voting bloc. Bush also defended his education record, saying his support for Common Core is based on a need for higher educational standards \u2013 but those should be state-driven, with no influence from the federal government, he said. He also acknowledged critiques of specific questions on Common Core-related standardized tests. \u201cCommon Core means a lot of things to different people, so they could be right based on what\u2019s in front of them,\u201d Bush said. Bush also said he would have done the same as his brother in deciding to go to war in Iraq if he had been president at the time. His comments come in the wake of Bush\u2019s private statement that he relies on his brother, former President George W. Bush, as an adviser on some Middle East affairs. \u201cI would have [authorized the invasion], and so would have Hillary Clinton, just to remind everybody. And so would almost everybody that was confronted with the intelligence they got,\u201d Bush said in the interview. Clinton\u2019s 2003 vote in support of a resolution to green-light the war in Iraq was a key part of the 2008 campaign, with then-Sen. Barack Obama hammering her hawkish stance. It could help Bush blur lines between the two when it comes to his brother\u2019s legacy. Bush said the United States should have focused more on security in Iraq, but said his brother agrees on that point. \u201cBy the way, guess who thinks that those mistakes took place as well? George W. Bush,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I mean, so just for the news flash to the world, if they\u2019re trying to find places where there\u2019s big space between me and my brother, this might not be one of those.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton invites over some small-dollar donors Why water might become a 2016 campaign issue Lindsey Graham's favorite-son prospects in South Carolina A potential favorite son, two emerging 2016 issues, fund-raising quotas and a twist in the Republican Party\u2019s same-sex marriage debate \u2013 those stories filled our Sunday trip around the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table. What for now is largely a state issue \u2013 water shortages caused by drought in California and other Western states \u2013 could become a topic in the presidential race. NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep noted Colorado, a big presidential swing state, is among the jurisdictions debating what to do. And other states in that neighborhood, including Nevada and New Mexico, factor big in both the water debate and in presidential politics. \u201cThis is something that gets really political and gets to your ideas of how intrusive the government should be in your lives, how much the government should regulate you,\u201d said Inskeep. \u201cAnd it is a lot more tactile.  You can touch it in a way that you can\u2019t really touch climate change, necessarily.\u201d Want a special tour of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign headquarters? A little face time with the candidate? Well, do you have $2,700 and nine friends willing to match that number? CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny shared details of a planned Clinton campaign event to thank a select group of fund-raisers. \u201cAs an incentive \u2013 the enthusiasm apparently was not quite as high \u2013 she is going to be there to speak to them, as well, and they can have a look inside the Brooklyn headquarters,\u201d said Zeleny. \u201cSo on Thursday in New York City, the Clinton donors, the small ones, will be there.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina isn\u2019t given much of a prayer to win the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. But two things could magnify his impact: He has a second career as a military lawyer, which helps his debating skills, and his home state votes third in the nominating contest. CNN\u2019s Nia-Malika Henderson told us Graham isn\u2019t 100% in, but about as close to that as one can get. \u201cI believe John McCain has already endorsed him several times, probably on our air,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cHe might actually pick up some of that John McCain infrastructure, as well, in South Carolina.\u201d \u201cAnd there was a recent poll that showed Republican primary voters, something like 20%, felt like they were much more likely to vote for Lindsey Graham in that South Carolina primary when he gets in this thing.\u201d We talk often of conservative evangelicals and their big influence in presidential politics, particularly the GOP nominating contest. Religious left and 2016 Now, another faith-based group \u2013 this one on the left of the political spectrum \u2013 is looking to make sure poverty and income inequality get more attention. The organization Circle of Protection did persuade both President Obama and Mitt Romney to lay out their ideas back in 2012. Now, the group hopes to get a wider debate going, by asking every candidate, from both parties, to record a three-minute video outlining ideas to help the poor. Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast offered some reporting on the plans. \u201cThis time, they want to get involved in the primary,\u201d said Kucinich. \u201cAnd the benefit, they say, for the candidates is that they play this for their congregations, and they\u2019re very large and they\u2019re in swing states, they\u2019re in all the states.\u201d \u201cSo they haven\u2019t gotten any takers yet, but I would bet that they will as the cycle goes on.\u201d Whatever the Supreme Court decides, social conservatives active in the Republican Party are vowing to leave tough language opposing same-sex marriage in the GOP\u2019s 2016 platform. Portman and the GOP platform But a group of establishment GOP leaders wants to drop the language, believing it hurts the party with young people and some other voters. And CNN is told they hope Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio will take a lead role in reshaping the platform. Why Portman? Well, for starters the platform will be debated and adopted in his home state of Ohio. The Republican convention is in Cleveland. More significant, though, is the senator\u2019s personal journey on the issue. Portman switched to become a supporter of same-sex marriage in 2013. He said at the time he was swayed by his son, Will, who told his parents in 2011 that he is gay. Taking a lead role in such a platform battle would be a huge challenge for Portman, who is also up for re-election in 2016.",

            "article_content": "Spend a few days with Chris Christie in New Hampshire and you will see a man making up for lost time. The New Jersey governor, who so recently was celebrated as the future Republican standard-bearer, has watched his front-runner status slip as new faces enter the race for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. In New Hampshire, a state his aides consider to be crucial for his success, only 3 percent of Republican voters say they plan to support him, according to a recent WMUR Granite State poll. (The same survey found that just 5 percent had made a firm commitment, a fact Christie himself quickly reminds anyone who trots it out.) In 2014, Christie put down roots in New Hampshire for his future campaign, paying regular visits to the state. Christie aides face charges in scandal But until recently, political analysts and voters here have complained that Christie has been absent since the midterm elections in November. \u201cHe lost six months\u2019 time since last November to April. He was only here once during that period,\u201d Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire state party chairman, told CNN. \u201cThat was a mistake. Christie cannot afford to languish for the next three to six months.\u201d RELATED: 1 guilty plea, 2 indictments and \u2018liars\u2019 in Bridgegate scandal Which might be why, for two days this week, Christie embarked on a meet-and-greet tour of the Granite State, where he visited a drug treatment center in Manchester, fielded face-to-face questions with voters at a restaurant in Sunapee, selfie\u2019d his way through a breakfast diner in Amherst, delivered keynote addresses at party fundraiser in Keene and hosted a town hall-style gathering in Dover. The swing was his first public trip since Christie\u2019s former aides were indicted for their alleged involvement in a scheme to shut down lanes on a major bridge in New Jersey as an act of retribution against a local official who didn\u2019t endorse the governor\u2019s re-election in 2013. The fallout from the scandal has not helped Christie\u2019s image with Republican voters, even though investigators were unable to find evidence tying him to the scheme. Now, as the GOP primary seasons races forward, Christie is working fast to move on. \u201cI don\u2019t think you would find one administration, whether it\u2019s at the governor\u2019s level or at the presidential level, that hasn\u2019t made mistakes and had problems,\u201d Christie said in Manchester Friday morning when a reporter asked how primary voters might perceive his aides\u2019 involvement in the bridge scandal. \u201cWhat matters is how you respond to it.\u201d In New Hampshire, Christie stabs at Clinton and Bush Although support for him has softened here in the past year, his New Hampshire backers said they don\u2019t think the 2013 bridge fiasco will ultimately upend his chances. \u201cIt would have to be something bigger than shutting down a lane on a bridge. Come on,\u201d said Mary Grenier from Lempster. \u201cThey\u2019re always late for work in New York. It\u2019s a mess to begin with. So you have one less lane or two less lanes? Big deal!\u201d But, like others who spoke to CNN, Grenier stressed that Christie will need to spend more time in the state than he has over the past six months. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s here enough,\u201d she conceded. RELATED: In New Hampshire, Christie spells out entitlement reform plan In April, however, Christie picked up the pace with his first big multi-town visit of the year. After Christie\u2019s trip this week, he plans to pay two more visits this month, carrying on a busy travel schedule that is likely to carry on into primary season. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have me around,\u201d Christie promised a group of supporters that jammed into a restaurant in Sunapee to see him Thursday. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to ask me almost anything you want.\u201d And ask they did. Near the restaurant\u2019s bar, surrounded by wood-paneled walls lined with big game trophies, onlookers bombarded Christie with questions about immigration, student loan reform and whether he could survive a Republican primary without catering to right-wing ideological tastes. \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is a Republican who can be in the middle. The problem is, in order to win the primary, you\u2019ve got to be extreme,\u201d Art Bobruff, a man from Springfield, told Christie as he nursed a cocktail. Chris Christie: The 9 stages of a town hall meeting \u201cListen,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI think you just have to be who you are. If that\u2019s good enough to win the nomination, then it\u2019s good enough. I wouldn\u2019t want to be President without being able to be who I am.\u201d Bobruff shot him a skeptical look. \u201cBut you don\u2019t feel the need to appeal to the right in order to get the Republican nomination?\u201d Bobruff asked. \u201cI want to appeal to everybody, but I want to appeal to everybody on my terms,\u201d Christie said. Indeed, that does appear to the theme of Christie\u2019s presidential endeavor \u2013 his visits are branded as the \u201cTell It Like It Is\u201d tour. When asked about hot-button topics during his trip, Christie, at times, didn\u2019t sound like a typical Republican presidential candidate. \u201cI think global warming is real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s deniable,\u201d Christie said during the fundraiser Thursday in Keene. \u201cAnd I do think human activity contributes to it.\u201d When quizzed on immigration, Christie wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say he supported providing a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the United States illegally, but he expressed openness to reforms that would provide some sort of legal work status for them. He also made clear his opposition to building a border-wide fence atop Mexico, a campaign promise other candidates have adopted to please immigration hardliners in the past. RELATED: Anatomy of the Chris Christie town hall He also appeared to take a veiled shot at his potential competitors on the right, particularly Republican lawmakers like Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who fought a battle over Obamacare in 2013 that ended in a government shutdown. \u201cWe need leadership in Washington again that understands that closing down the government isn\u2019t the right thing to do,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re hired to govern, and you close down the government, it seems to me a de facto failure.\u201d It\u2019s that kind of real talk that Christie believes will make him stand out in the field, but as some here noted, may have consequences down the line. \u201cHe says what\u2019s on his mind, even if it\u2019s blunt,\u201d said Whitney Aldrich, a Republican from Walpole who watched him speak Thursday. \u201cBut it could get him into trouble.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama heads to Oregon on Friday to make a big sales pitch for his trade agenda, but his bigger problem is back in Washington. In an unusual twist it\u2019s not Republicans, but members of the President\u2019s own party who stand in the way of him getting a key part of his economic agenda through the GOP-led Congress. The debate over legislation to grant the administration so-called \u201cfast-track\u201d authority to approve trade deals without any amendments from Congress has propelled a massive lobbying campaign on both sides. Business groups and corporate coalitions pressing for the bill to boost U.S. exports are clashing with labor, environmental and consumer groups warning it will mean fewer American jobs and lower wages for workers. Congress is expected to debate the issue over the next few weeks. A major test comes Tuesday in the Senate with a vote on whether to begin debate on the fast-track bill, known formally as Trade Promotional Authority or TPA. The outcome is uncertain because Republicans who control the chamber need help from several Democrats to get the 60 votes they need to take up the bill and Democrats appear to be balking. \u201cWe need 15 or more Democratic votes,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the top vote counter for Senate Republicans.  \u201cWe\u2019re not unanimously, on our side, in support of it. So this is a priority of the President so that comes with an obligation for him to work on members of his own party to produce the votes.\u201d RELATED: Obama sells trade deal to House Democrats Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, who handles wrangling Democratic votes, thought Cornyn was inflating the number of Democratic votes Republicans would need, but predicted between three and six Republicans would vote no. While Republicans are typically pro-trade, some GOP senators, especially those up for re-election in states where jobs have moved overseas, may vote against it. One example is Sen. Richard Burr. A reliable Republican voter on most issues, Burr \u2013 up for re-election \u2013 has seen many textile jobs leave his state of North Carolina in recent years. He voted against fast-track authority when it was considered in committee. While many congressional Democrats vehemently oppose big trade bills as job killers, seven Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee voted for the measure. Most are from states with large shipping ports where international trade is a mainstay. Adding to the uncertainty over Tuesday\u2019s vote, Democratic leaders are insisting Republicans agree to package the fast-track bill with three other trade bills that include Trade Adjustment Assistance, which would help American workers displaced by international trade, as well as provisions dealing with the enforcement of trade deals. \u201cThe enforcement provisions that a lot of our colleagues feel is important because a lot of previous deals haven\u2019t been enforced.,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democratic leader.  \u201cI think there is a large feeling in our caucus that we want those four put together before we move forward.\u201d RELATED: Boehner says Obama needs Hillary Clinton on trade In fact, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee and a co-sponsor of the legislation, urged Democrats in a private caucus meeting Thursday not to take up his bill unless there is a deal with Republicans to do all four bills, according to a person familiar with the session. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hasn\u2019t decided how to package the bills. But Cornyn said doing all four \u201cwas not the deal\u201d and that Republicans \u2013 many of who don\u2019t like the enforcement provisions \u2013 had agreed only to pair together the fast-track bill and the displaced worker\u2019s bill. McConnell this week praised Obama\u2019s handling of the trade bill and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been almost an out-of-body experience, but we\u2019ve been working closely with the White House.\u201d In a floor speech Thursday, he explained the importance of passing the bill. \u201cThe United States is currently negotiating an agreement with a whole host of Pacific nations \u2013 not just Japan and Australia, but also countries like Canada and Chile \u2013 that would cement and enhance our role in the world\u2019s fastest-growing region,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThe so-called Trans-Pacific Partnership would lower unfair trade barriers to American-made goods and American produce sold in the Pacific. That would represent a huge win for American workers and American farmers, to say nothing of the far-reaching geopolitical implications for our country,\u201d he said. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, also credited the Obama. \u201cI\u2019m working my butt off to help the President,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, the President happens to be right on it.\u201d But the President is getting hammered on the left. RELATED: Japan\u2019s Abe pushes trade deal in speech Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate, urged the President to ditch his Friday visit to a Nike plant in Oregon. \u201cNike epitomizes why disastrous unfettered free-trade policies during the past four decades have failed American workers, eroded our manufacturing base and increased income and wealth inequality in this country,\u201d Sanders said in a letter to Obama he sent on Wednesday. And in an appeal to supporters, Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, urged them to sign a petition opposing fast track. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that all trade agreements are bad. They\u2019re not. When done right, trade can help American workers, communities, and our economy,\u201d Franken wrote. \u201cBut we need to take the time to make sure trade agreements are, in fact, done right. Not fast.\u201d The larger hurdle for passing trade promotion authority is getting it through the House of Representatives. House Speaker John Boehner has repeatedly said he\u2019ll need Democratic votes. Every time the issue comes up, he attempts to shift the onus on the President for securing those votes. \u201cThe President needs to step up his game,\u201d Boehner said in a message last week. House Republican aides note that the vast majority of House members weren\u2019t serving in Congress the last time a major trade deal was negotiated so getting rank-and-file up to speed has been a major focus. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who authored the deal with Hatch and Wyden, mounted a major education campaign over the last few months. Now that the bill is facing a vote likely in June the effort has moved to House GOP leadership level to round up votes. There are a group of House conservatives who are opposing the trade deal because they are reluctant to give the President any additional authority. But the bill\u2019s proponents argue this concern is misplaced because the TPA bill actually gives Congress a greater say in the final trade deal once the administration finalizes it. A new criticism arose recently from some on the right who worry the trade legislation could serve as a back door for illegal immigration \u2013 something both Republican leadership aides and outside conservative groups lobbying for the deal say is flat-out wrong. But even if Boehner is able to run up a big number of House Republicans in support of the TPA bill, it\u2019s not enough to get it over the finish line without a significant bloc of House Democrats. The number of Democrats publicly backing the bill is less than 20, short of what is thought to be enough to pass the measure. \u201cThe votes are not there,\u201d Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a strong critic of the legislation, told CNN.  DeLauro maintained there was \u201coverwhelming opposition\u201d by House Democrats, who she said have been pushing back for months at the Administration\u2019s efforts. The House Republican Whip, Steve Scalise, also conceded last week there is still work to be done to prep for a floor vote. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has the power to help the President, hasn\u2019t taken an official position on the trade promotion bill, and when asked how she\u2019ll vote repeats her mantra that she is trying to get on \u201ca path to yes.\u201d But Pelosi continues to highlight the problems she has with the bill \u2013 concerns about food safety, the lack of any provision addressing currency manipulation and access for U.S. automakers to foreign markets. \u201cI don\u2019t think the enough of our issues have been resolved for us to be having a big movement of votes toward the bill,\u201d Pelosi said in her press conference last week on Capitol Hill. In recent weeks the Obama administration, which even Democrats admit has not had the best outreach program to Hill lawmakers, has made a full-court press. High-ranking officials and Cabinet secretaries are targeting the small but significant undecided Democrats on the issue. \u201cAre they going to try to strong arm people \u2013 you bet,\u201d DeLauro told CNN. But she said one factor hurting the administration\u2019s efforts to get fellow Democrats on board was not including them as key parts of the emerging deal were being negotiated. \u201cThere has been almost no consultation with the Congress \u2013 almost none,\u201d she said. Even supporters of the deal admit that the fact that the timeline has slipped for a vote on the Hill has shown that many underestimated the fierce battle over the issue, and the willingness of so many in the President\u2019s own party to deny him a key accomplishment. Obama met last week with a group of moderate pro-business Democrats known as the \u201cNew Democratic Coalition.\u201d In a session last month with the Congressional Black Caucus, the President also made a pitch on trade, according to Democratic sources familiar with the meeting, but it\u2019s unclear he got many commitments. The debate will only intensify in the next few weeks as the House and Senate debate the issue. Hundreds of labor members are expected to descend on Capitol Hill next week and labor groups are cranking up  television, radio, and digital ads in both targeted House districts and states of those Senate Democrats who could prove to be critical swing votes. A broader anti-trade coalition is also running TV ads across the country. On the other side of the issue, the U.S. Chamber, and other pro-business groups are running a highly organized campaign to back their supporters and argue to constituents that the deal will have tangible economic benefits.",

            "article_content": "A central theme of Carly Fiorina\u2019s nascent campaign for the Republican presidential nomination is that she is uniquely positioned to neutralize the historic potential of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 bid. But first, she has to introduce herself to voters, who in large part don\u2019t know who she is. On the day she announced her candidacy, Fiorina sat for two interviews with ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in New York. Then she hopped on a phone for a mid-morning press call with 65 journalists. After lunch, she was off to Yahoo News\u2019 studio for a live sit-down with anchor Katie Couric, followed by a question-and-answer session using the live-streaming app Periscope. That evening, she joined Megyn Kelly on Fox News. The next day was no different: Fiorina navigated eight interviews, including Glenn Beck\u2019s radio show, CNN and \u201cThe Late Show with Seth Meyers.\u201d Seven more interviews were scheduled Wednesday, followed by five press availabilities over the weekend in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. READ: Carly Fiorina: Clinton \u2018pandering\u2019 on immigration Fiorina\u2019s exhaustive schedule is emblematic of candidates who enter the race without a lick of national name ID.  For a candidate whose name barely registers in CNN/ORC polls conducted regularly since November, Fiorina \u2014 and upstart candidates like her \u2013 must rely on the media\u2019s megaphone to get her name heard. Even better-known contenders like Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida, did a media blitz after announcing their presidential bids. \u201cCandidates with lower name identification must jump at virtually every opportunity to garner media coverage,\u201d said Republican political consultant Ellen Carmichael, who managed press outreach for Herman Cain\u2019s presidential campaign in 2011, a candidate who started out virtually unknown. \u201cFor some, this means creating their own news by saying things the media deems controversial. For others, it means answering every media inquiry and agreeing to every interview that comes your way. More established candidates, however, have the luxury of passing on requests.\u201d That\u2019s one luxury that Clinton is enjoying. Since her presidential campaign announcement on April 12, Clinton has not held a formal press conference. While on the campaign trail, she has responded \u2014 reluctantly at times \u2013 to roughly eight questions from journalists. Even that count is a charitable one, given that some responses have been little more than short exclamations, such as, \u201cI\u2019m having a great time, can\u2019t look forward any more than I am,\u201d which she said in response to a question about her strategy in Iowa. When a reporter in New Hampshire asked about her next stop on the campaign trail, she merely said, \u201cOh, onward.\u201d Clinton has been so reclusive in the first weeks of her candidacy that the New York Times started publishing questions their reporters would have asked her that day on the campaign trail if they had had the chance. READ: Carly Fiorina\u2019s HP record clouds her campaign launch At this early stage in the race, Clinton doesn\u2019t need to rely on the media to reach her core supporters. She has a Twitter feed with 3.47 million followers and a new Facebook page that has grown to 800,000 online supporters since her announcement in April. This week her campaign launched a web series called, \u201cThe Briefing,\u201d which it intends to use to combat what they consider unfriendly media coverage. It would be hard to see how any other candidate could take such a brazen go-it-alone approach. Of course, Clinton\u2019s absence from media interviews does not come without consequence. Her lone official challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders, announced his candidacy last week and quickly booked a round of interviews, which led the liberal magazine Mother Jones to post the jabbing headline, \u201cBernie Sanders Has Already Taken More Press Questions Than Hillary Clinton.\u201d This is one of the few instances in which die-hard liberal Sanders and conservative Fiorina are in the same boat: The CNN/ORC poll in April found that just 5% of Democratic voters would consider supporting Sanders, compared to 69% for Clinton. As the campaign progresses, Clinton will become more available for press questions, Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson told CNN. But as the frontrunner 19 months until the general election, her campaign strategists know that journalists will still continue to cover her regardless of whether she answers questions. Her lesser-known opponents\u2014on both sides of the aisle\u2014don\u2019t have that benefit.",

            "article_content": "How much do you have to spend on a domain name if you decide to run for President? About $100,000. At least that\u2019s what Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s campaign spent just over a week before he launched his presidential campaign in early April and directed supporters to RandPaul.com. Until late March, that domain name billed itself as an \u201cunofficial fan site\u201d for the Kentucky Republican, calling him \u201cfearless and resolute\u201d on the home page. But it\u2019s clear the owners of that site were trying to cash in on Paul\u2019s presidential aspirations \u2013 and they did. Campaign finance records reveal Paul\u2019s Senate re-election campaign spent $100,890 on a \u201cdomain purchase,\u201d making the purchase through Escrow.com, an online escrow service that facilitates domain name purchases. And as late as October 2014, the site was being auctioned off online with a starting $125,000 price tag, according to a story in The Hill. Political domain names have become hot commodities and campaigns-in-waiting work swiftly to snatch up as many domain names associated with their candidate as possible. But not all campaigns have been as successful as Paul\u2019s in winning back the prized domain name \u2013 which can help potential supporters quickly find more information (the kind campaigns want people to know) about a presidential candidate. Carly Fiorina, who announced her candidacy this week, failed to recoup CarlyFiorina.org, which is host to an anti-Fiorina effort pointing out the number of people laid off at Hewlett-Packard while Fiorina was CEO. And Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has dealt with his fair share of trolling: the owner of TedCruz.com urges visitors to \u201cSUPPORT PRESIDENT OBAMA. IMMIGRATION REFORM NOW!\u201d Cruz is staunchly opposed to Obama\u2019s immigration reform policies. The owner of another Cruz domain name, \u201cTedCruz2016.com,\u201d had another goal in mind. That domain owner, reportedly a Ted Cruz fan, just wanted to meet Cruz in person, but ultimately relented and redirected traffic to Cruz\u2019s official campaign site. The news of Paul\u2019s domain purchase was first reported by National Journal.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton is inviting \u2013 and practically baiting \u2013 Republican presidential contenders into a battle over immigration. In her first Nevada campaign event on Tuesday afternoon, the Democratic front-runner accused the entire GOP field of seeking to relegate immigrants to \u201csecond-class status.\u201d She promised to go further than President Barack Obama, whose unilateral moves to keep more undocumented immigrants in the United States have infuriated conservatives. \u201cI\u2019m ready to have this discussion with anyone, anywhere, anytime,\u201d she said. Who are the richest 2016 presidential candidates? Clinton camp on defense about trustworthiness Issuing her strongest call yet for \u201ca path to full and equal citizenship,\u201d Clinton hit her GOP opponents, House and Senate leaders and every other target she could find for stymying previous pushes for a comprehensive overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws. \u201cThis is where I differ with everybody on the Republican side,\u201d she said. \u201cMake no mistake, not a single Republican candidate, announced or potential, is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. When they talk about legal status, that is code for second class status.\u201d The signal Clinton\u2019s Las Vegas event sent was direct and simple: She\u2019s willing to go all-in on pushing immigration reform, banking on it being a huge winner for Democrats in 2016. And she\u2019s fine with moving as far to the left as she needs in order to lure Republicans into attacking her for it. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll underscored the potential payoff of Clinton\u2019s strategy. She leads former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Miami resident whose family speaks Spanish at home, 66% to 28% among Latinos, and leads Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is of Cuban heritage and once pushed for immigration reform in Congress, 63% to 32% among Latinos. Clinton and her campaign aides hope her bet will be bolstered by the fact Hispanics have been one of the fastest growing voting blocs nationwide for years. In 2008, according to Pew, 19.5% of all eligible voters were Hispanic. That number shot up to 23.7% in 2012 and is expected to grow even more by 2016. In Nevada, a critical early presidential primary state, Hispanics make up 30% of the population. Republican presidential candidates have all hammered Obama\u2019s executive actions that Clinton said she supports. They cited new Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2019s support for those actions as a key reason many opposed her nomination. And though Bush released a video celebrating Cinco de Mayo on Tuesday, Clinton\u2019s campaign believes even candidates who can speak eloquently on issues important to Latinos will be torn between the demands of their much-more-conservative primary electorate and general election voters on the issue of undocumented immigrants\u2019 status. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Latinos favored Clinton by a 2-to-1 margin in her 2008 Democratic primary battle against Obama. But many had grown sour with Clinton over her failure to wade into issues tied to immigration in her re-entry to the political scene, saying they wanted to see her take the kinds of stronger stands she announced Tuesday. For the first time, Clinton laid out reform proposals. Among them: Allow the parents of \u201cDreamers,\u201d or undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children, to stay in the country just like their children can under Obama\u2019s 2012 executive action. The undocumented parents of children who are already U.S. citizens gained that right under Obama\u2019s follow-up 2014 action. She also said reunifying splintered families should be a core goal of immigration policy. If Congress won\u2019t act, she pledged \u201cas President I would do everything possible under the law to go even further\u201d than Obama has gone already to expand undocumented immigrants\u2019 rights. Clinton said she wants to see a streamlined process for undocumented immigrants to make their case to avoid deportation. \u201cWe should put in place a simple, straightforward and accessible way for parents of Dreamers and others with a history of service and contributions to their community to make their case and to be eligible for the same deferred action as their children,\u201d she said. Dreamers were among Clinton\u2019s biggest critics during her recent book tour and 2014 midterm blitz. Now, though, she\u2019s sitting down with many of them. At her Tuesday evening event, Clinton sat with several students who benefited from Obama\u2019s 2012 move to forestall deportation for Dreamers \u2013 including one girl who said she aspired to go to Yale University and become a doctor. \u201cWe are in a global competition and I intend for us to win it. And I\u2019m not about to let anybody who can make a contribution to our economy and our society get thrown away,\u201d Clinton said. She heaped praise on Rancho High School, which hosted the event, for using federal Title I money to fund Advanced Placement exams for its students \u2013 admittedly \u201carcane,\u201d she said, but important to helping poorer students like Dreamers whose parents, due to their legal status, can\u2019t land high-paying jobs. Cristina Jimenez, a managing director for United We Dream, the pro-immigration group that organized protests against Clinton in recent years out of frustration that she hadn\u2019t taken a stronger stand, was struck by Clinton\u2019s comments. \u201cIt sounds like we may actually have a substantive debate on immigration reform and executive action this year,\u201d she said after the event. \u201cFull and equal citizenship for our communities, the protection of the existing executive actions on immigration and a commitment to expand that relief were good to hear.\u201d Rep. Dina Titus, a Las Vegas Democrat whose district includes Rancho High School, predicted that \u201cthis election will be very important to making [immigration reform] a priority. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard any of the potential Republican making this a priority, just the opposite,\u201d Titus said. \u201cAnd she will make it that and I think you will see it happen sooner rather than later.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said on Tuesday that Hillary Clinton was \u201cpandering\u201d in her plan to go further than President Barack Obama on immigration policy. Fiorina, a Republican businesswoman who has emerged as one of the harshest critics of Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, said she first wants to see a more secure border. Fiorina also said she would also support a \u201cpath to legal status\u201d for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States \u2013 but only after the legal immigration system was fixed. Carson and Fiorina jump into 2016 race RELATED: Clinton calls for \u2018path to full and equal citizenship\u2019 \u201cThe people who worked hard to earn citizenship the right way are totally committed to this country,\u201d Fiorina told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett immediately after Clinton spoke extensively about her own immigration platform in Las Vegas. \u201cI think it isn\u2019t fair to say to people who\u2019ve worked hard to earn the privilege of citizenship that \u2018Never mind. Never mind that you played by the rules. People who didn\u2019t get to have the same privileges that you do\u2019.\u201d Fiorina, the only female candidate in the Republican field, also swatted away the notion that her general election argument would center only on her common gender with Clinton, though she acknowledged that would neutralize one potential Clinton attack. Carly Fiorina's political career Instead, she pointed to her tenure as chief executive at Hewlett-Packard, saying that experience distinguished her from the \u201cprofessional political class.\u201d But her record there is not all rosy. Fiorina was eventually forced out as CEO, and she oversaw 30,000 job losses as head of the tech giant. \u201cThe only way you succeed as a technology company is by leading, not by lagging,\u201d Fiorina said, striking back at unflattering media coverage of her ouster and pointing to less covered parts of her accomplishments. And, she added, she took no pleasure in any of those firings. \u201cThe worst thing a CEO can do is to have to say to someone, \u2018You don\u2019t have a job,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone had to manage through tough times. And I think that\u2019s honestly what distinguishes leadership.\u201d She also weighed in on the attack in Garland, Texas, this week at an event showcasing controversial cartoons of Mohammed. \u201cIt clearly was provocative, just like white supremacists demonstrating is provocative,\u201d Fiorina said. She offered praise for how Obama characterized the gathering that provoked the violence. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that the President came out and called this what it is, which is an attempted act of terror,\u201d Fiorina said.",

            "article_content": "In what will be her most comprehensive comments on immigration reform as a presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton will use a roundtable on Tuesday in Nevada to argue that the only \u201ctrue solution\u201d for reform is \u201cnothing less than a full and equal path to citizenship.\u201d Clinton will cast immigration reform as a family issue, an aide said Tuesday, and will focus on the need to find a legislative fix, strengthen the United States border and bring \u201cmillions of hard-working people out of the shadows and into the formal economy so they can pay taxes and contribute to our nation\u2019s prosperity.\u201d Pushing reform, however, is as much a political bet as it is policy for the newly-minted presidential candidate who has already made the issue part of her \u201cfour fights\u201d core. A number of Clinton\u2019s campaign aides feel immigration will be a wedge issue in the 2016 general election and are encouraged by the fact that Clinton has performed better than most Democrats \u2013 including President Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 with Hispanic voters. Clinton will say Tuesday \u201cthat we cannot settle for proposals that provide hard-working people with merely a second-class status,\u201d the aide said, noting a subtle knock against Republican hopefuls \u2013 like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2013 who have backed legalization efforts but not full citizenship. The appearance will be Clinton\u2019s opening salvo on immigration, not her detailed policy rollout, the aide added. That won\u2019t come until late summer or early fall. Immigration has been a highly motivating issue for Latino voters in the past and Clinton\u2019s campaign will look to keep that up by highlighting where Clinton differs with Republicans on the issue. \u201cWhoever the Republican nominee is, they will have to go through the primary,\u201d said one Clinton aide. \u201cAnd at best, they will have to support second class status for immigrants in order to get through that primary, which is a position that will be untenable in a general election.\u201d Hispanics have been one of the fastest growing voting blocs nationwide for years. In 2008, according to Pew, 19.5% of all eligible voters were Hispanic. That number shot up to 23.7% in 2012 and is expected to grow even more by 2016. Nevada is 30% Hispanic, according to Census data, making it the first early state in the nomination process with a significant Latino population. \u201cImmigration is one of the most important and motivating issues for Latinos,\u201d said Jorge Neri, Clinton\u2019s organizing director in Nevada and a veteran of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign in the state. \u201cLatinos are more likely to go out into the streets to fight for immigration. It mobilizes people.\u201d Despite performing well with Hispanic voters, immigration is a sensitive issue for Clinton and one that she has continually missteped on since 2008. Providing driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants led to one of the biggest gaffes of her failed 2008 campaign when, at a primary debate, she took both sides of the issue in the span of a few minutes. Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign looked to clean up that issue early, telling reporters last month that Clinton \u201csupports state policies to provide driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants.\u201d After her 2008 gaffe, Clinton responded by forcefully calling for immigration reform, pledging to enact a pathway to legalization \u2013 not citizenship \u2013 in her first 100 days of office. But after losing in 2008 and spending four years separated from domestic politics as secretary of state, Clinton was confronted by an array of new immigration issues on her 2014 book tour and midterm election blitz. At the Iowa Steak Fry, activists confronted her about undocumented immigrants brought to the United States by their parents. At an event in Maryland, waves of protestors heckled and taunted the former secretary of state. And at a fundraiser for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, protestors chanted \u201cundocumented, unafraid\u201d at she spoke. She didn\u2019t impress the activists with her answers, either. Laura Martin, communications director for Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, said activists were disappointed when Clinton told an undocumented immigrant in Iowa that the way to help on the issue was to \u201celect more Democrats.\u201d RELATED: In Iowa, DREAMers confront Clinton \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to know what they have to do to keep their family together and they want to hear you have a real concrete plan.\u201d Clinton also told CNN in 2014 that the growing number of unaccompanied minors on the border from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala \u201cshould be sent back\u201d and \u201creunited with their families.\u201d That dismayed Cristina Jimenez, managing director for United We Dream, the pro-immigration group that organized many of the protests against Clinton, who felt the former secretary of state tried to \u201cplay it very safe\u201d on immigration in 2014. \u201cI think that raised very serious concerns for our community,\u201d Jimenez said about Clinton\u2019s CNN answer, \u201cwhich was one of the reasons that we prioritized wanting to know where she was really on these issues.\u201d After Obama issued a long-delayed executive action to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system in November 2014, Clinton offered his plan a firm backing and is expected to do the same Tuesday. But going into the 2016 election, activists like Jimenez want to hear much more. \u201cIt is just not enough to say you support immigration reform,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cIf you want to send a message to the Latino and the immigrant community it is not enough to just say you support immigration reform.\u201d She added: \u201cHow is she going to be different from the other presidential hopefuls out there like Jeb Bush, Sen. Rubio and others?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Welcome to the Republican rainbow coalition. With Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina officially joining the GOP presidential race Monday, the Republican field includes two Latinos, an African-American and a woman. And depending on Bobby Jindal\u2019s next move, an Indian-American \u2013 a term he\u2019s not fond of \u2013 could also be in the mix. 2016 is shaping up to be a year of historic diversity for Republicans, setting the party apart from the all white line-up that\u2019s emerging on the Democratic side. That distinction is important for Republicans as some in the party try to make inroads with minorities. But the biggest question is whether a diverse slate of candidates will actually help the GOP overcome its demographic problem, which has contributed to losses at the presidential level in two successive elections. \u201cWith more diversity, comes diverse attention and with diverse attention comes diverse voters,\u201d said Ron Bonjean, a GOP strategist.  \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change the world, but it\u2019s helpful. It\u2019s a chip away strategy, every percentage counts. It\u2019s not a planned out strategy, but it\u2019s one that Republicans should take advantage of.\u201d READ: Does Carly Fiorina have foreign policy cred? If the overwhelmingly white crowd that gathered here for Carson\u2019s announcement at Detroit\u2019s Music Hall for the Performing Arts is any guide, the GOP hasn\u2019t yet landed on a quick fix. His audience in this majority black city included few of the African-Americans who have championed his story for decades. With his candidacy, Carson is sacrificing some of his ties to the black community for a different crowd that is often just discovering him. Rather than expanding the party to new African-American voters, Carson attracted black voters who know his story and have voted for the GOP in the past. \u201cHe is what I call the example of the American dream fulfilled,\u201d said Tony Davison, a 33-year-old African-American who voted for Obama in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cHe came from nothing and became something.\u201d The diverse roster of candidates is the most visible acknowledgment that the GOP needs to broaden their tent beyond the coalition of older, white voters, who haven\u2019t been able to deliver a national election since 2004, and only then by a slim margin. The candidates \u2014 Carson and Fiorina along with Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz  of Texas \u2014 are all betting to varying degrees that being demographically different will make their candidacies that much more attractive. Rubio and Cruz all tout their Cuban roots, even as they criticize policies like health care and immigration reform that have strong support among many Latinos. Even Jeb Bush, whose wife is Latina, claims status as an \u201chonorary Latino.\u201d For her part, Fiorina has said her campaign would essentially neutralize any advantage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy might have with women. Though she called for an \u201cend to identity politics,\u201d in her announcement speech, many of her best lines are about Clinton and how she would match up against the former first lady. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton had to face me on the debate stage, at the very least she would have a hitch in her swing,\u201d she said at a conservative gathering in February. READ: Age and money among top Google queries on Carson, Fiorina In 2012, the gender gap was larger than ever with Republicans winning men by 8 points and Democrats winning women by 12 points. Democrats also pushed their advantage among African-Americans and Latinos to record highs, as both groups showed up in historic margins. Peeling off a share of those voters will be crucial to the GOP\u2019s chances in 2016 \u2013 and a primary contest is a good start. Carson is well-known among African-Americans \u2014 he has a high school named after him and an exhibition at the local black history museum. But his criticisms of President Barack Obama \u2014 he once called him a \u201cpsychopath\u201d \u2014 have dampened some of that support, his aides acknowledge. The retired neurosurgeon, whose up-from-nowhere biography will be central to his candidacy, rejected the idea that blacks won\u2019t support him. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m finding as I travel around. I think that\u2019s what the liberal establishment would like to happen. They want to paint that narrative,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN. \u201cWhen I talk in black neighborhoods and the things that I talk about \u2013 self-empowerment, and personal responsibility, family and a relationship with God \u2013 those are seen as good things.\u201d Emphasizing conservative values hasn\u2019t been a winning national strategy for Republicans recently as the public\u2019s mood on issues like gay marriage has changed. And it\u2019s not clear that Carson can change the dynamics even with his compelling biography and hero status among some African-Americans. But his story and approach, which includes his assessments of what ails inner city neighborhoods, could change some of the conversations within the GOP. \u201cDr. Carson is a voice and an influencer inside the Republican party. They can\u2019t ignore him. He has something that is so special they need him to build their coalitions,\u201d said Armstrong Williams, a top Carson aide. \u201cIf you go to Dr. Carson\u2019s speeches, if you go to his book signings, you can always find 20 to 30% African Americans in that audience.\u201d Bakari Sellers, a Democratic state lawmaker in South Carolina who has endorsed Hillary Clinton, called Carson an \u201cAmerican hero\u201d but said Carson\u2019s policies don\u2019t line-up with many African-Americans. Still, he warned that Democrats will have to do more than re-assembling Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 coalition if they want to succeed in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that can be done overnight, it\u2019s going to take some work and attention,\u201d he said. \u201cClinton has started to do that already when she touched the hearts of all people who care about the fact that young men of color are dying and getting incarcerated.\u201d",

            "article_content": "British leaders battling to be the next Prime Minister got a rough ride from skeptical voters Thursday in their final televised clash ahead of the May 7 election, but no one appeared to break open a tight race that could deliver a chaotic political aftermath. Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron was repeatedly accused of lying and deceiving voters, reflecting the extreme distrust many Britons harbor towards their politicians ahead of the highly anticipated election. But the Conservative leader delivered one of his strongest performances of the campaign so far. A snap Guardian/ICM poll by found 44% of viewers thought Cameron won and 38% believed Labour leader Ed Miliband performed best in the town-hall style meeting. RELATED: Why Americans should care about the UK election But it was Miliband who made the most striking news, categorically ruling out a coalition deal with the surging Scottish National Party, a promise that could condemn him to leading an unstable minority government in the months to come. Cameron went first in the event in the nationally televised debate in the northern industrial city in Leeds, and was greeted by extreme skepticism over the performance of his five-year government with the Liberal Democrats. \u201cI think you are deceiving the British public,\u201d one man in the audience said to Cameron\u2019s face as he fielded tough questions on welfare, tax policy and waves of immigration from the European Union. \u201cYou need a prime minister who is prepared to get change in Europe,\u201d Cameron said, defending his pledge to hold a referendum on continued British membership of the economic bloc by 2017. He pledged to hike funding for the state-run health care service and said only his Conservatives could deliver the economy that would ease the cost of living crisis afflicting the middle class. Cameron waved around a letter left by a senior financial official in the last Labour government warning his incoming Conservative replacement in 2010 that \u201cthere\u2019s no money left.\u201d Miliband later countered that it was Cameron\u2019s \u201cregular prop\u201d but it did serve to illustrate the best Conservative argument, that the Labour Party shouldn\u2019t be trusted with the economy again. After promising to \u201clet it rip\u201d earlier this week, Cameron turned in an animated performance, to counter claims that he does not understand the economic pain still suffered by everyday Britons. The fact that each leader appeared individually before the audience in the bear-pit setting of a television studio surprisingly appeared to intensify the exchanges, and deprived candidates of their usual trick of offering the scripted soundbites of a formal debate. Miliband was repeatedly pressed on whether he would enter a coalition government with the SNP, which polls suggest could almost wipe out Labour in its heartlands in Scotland. \u201cIf the price of a Labour government is a coalition or a deal with the SNP \u2013 not going to happen,\u201d Miliband said, in the most high-stakes moment of the 90-minute BBC show. The Labour leader underlined he would \u201crather not have a Labour government,\u201d than a tie up with the SNP, which could revive Scottish dreams of independence and prompt the nationalist party to push for another independence referendum. Miliband appeared to take a stand that it will be very difficult to take back \u2013 but he did not rule out a more informal arrangement with the SNP, that could see the parties team up on individual pieces of legislation The Labour leader appeared less assured than in previous appearances of a campaign in which he is trying to counter Conservative claims he is not tough enough to serve as a national leader. But he made a plea for trust. \u201cI want to be the first prime minister to under promise and over deliver, not over promise and under deliver,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cI am not the guy who makes easy promises.\u201d He also averted what could have been an embarrassing incident when he tripped on a step as he exited the stage. He was able to recover his balance, but his near stumble will likely delight the headline writers in the Conservative press. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg endured a flurry of criticism for his decision back in 2010 to throw his centrist party into a coalition with the Conservatives. But he argued he had really had no choice because Britain was at the time wobbling badly and could have become the \u201cnext domino to fall\u201d in the economic crisis. And he ridiculed claims by Cameron and Miliband that they still had a solid chance to win a majority in next week\u2019s election. \u201cThey need to go and lay down in the darkened room\u201d if they believed that, he said.",

            "article_content": "\u201cBucket.\u201d Swap the \u201cB\u201d for a \u201cF\u201d and say that word out loud and you\u2019ll understand what President Barack Obama really thinks about Republican accusations he burst out of Constitutional constraints and has gone rogue in the twilight of his presidency. Obama used a riotous annual address to the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner on Saturday to pay back political foes and rebuke journalists who erred by writing him off after the Democratic mid-term election debacle last year. It was a performance which will delight his fans, but may cement a critique among opponents that Obama is much happier dishing out shots than taking them \u2013 but the caustic tone of the speech fits right in with Washington\u2019s bitterly partisan political culture. Obama, whose cutting sarcasm has introduced an edgier tone to the annual gala, lampooned attacks against him that have dogged his presidency, rebuffing claims he was arrogant, aloof and on his way out. His zingers didn\u2019t flinch from taking on the most delicate of topics, including race \u2013 and in a prolonged riff he enjoyed himself at the expense of candidates already lining up to take a shot at succeeding him in 2016. In a centerpiece joke being played over and over on news shows, Obama said he had drawn up a \u201cbucket list\u201d of things he wanted to get done before he leaves the White House in January 2017. White House Correspondents' Dinner red carpet photos \u201cTake executive action on immigration? Bucket. New climate regulations? Bucket. It\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Obama said, picking up on criticism of his executive actions, which Republicans say have gone far beyond his legal authority. It was a classic case of a president using the annual gathering of journalists, celebrities and top Washington officials to say the kind of things he would never get away with in the more formal setting of the White House. His \u201cbucket\u201d joke was rooted on a foundation of truth \u2013 the president knows that with no more elections left to run and his legacy solidifying, he\u2019s no longer playing the daily political game. It\u2019s the historians who will keep the score from now on, so he seems to think that Republican attacks are just water off a duck\u2019s back. In his most daring gag, Obama seized upon the perception that though his mood is supernaturally calm and he rarely loses his temper, there is a raging resentment boiling away inside him over the indignities he must suffer to be president. \u201cI am mellow sort of guy, that\u2019s why I invited Luther, my anger translator to join me here tonight,\u201d Obama said, introducing Comedy Central star Keegan-Michael Key. \u201cHold on to your lily white butts,\u201d Key roared from behind the president\u2019s right ear, his staring eyes almost popping out of his head, in a joke exposing the extreme delicacy with which the first African American president has sometimes approached discussions  of race during his administration. 'Nerd Prom': 8 memorable moments Obama also could not resist the temptation of ridiculing the forming 2016 presidential field and the journalists who are covering it. He jabbed fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton for her multi-million dollar speaking fees and her listening tour in her black Scooby van, saying it proved times were still tough for some Americans. \u201cI have one friend, just a few weeks ago, she was making millions of dollars a year, and now she\u2019s living out of a van in Iowa,\u201d Obama joked. He slammed one possible longshot Democratic rival for Clinton, former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley, as someone who could go \u201ccompletely unrecognized at a Martin O\u2019Malley campaign event.\u201d One of the top Republicans, Ted Cruz, also took a pounding with Obama\u2019s cutting observation that \u201cGalileo believed the world revolved around the sun. Ted Cruz believes the world revolves around Ted Cruz.\u201d Obama has often shown up to the annual dinner with his presidency mired in political crises. But with his approval ratings on the up and with the economy improving, West Wing staffers think their boss is on a roll and he wasn\u2019t shy showing it last night. Obama seemed particularly comfortable in his role as president, and relished taking on controversies still rocking his administration: in a joke already making waves in the Middle East, he even included a quip about the parlous state of US-Israeli relations. \u201cI look so old, John Boehner\u2019s already invited Netanyahu to speak at my funeral,\u201d said Obama and then bemoaned how hard he had to work, with a sideswipe at conservative critics who have cast doubt on his Christian faith and who say he is a closet Muslim. \u201cBeing president is never easy. I still have to fix the broken immigration system. Issue veto threats. Negotiate with Iran. All while finding time to pray five times a day.\u201d READ: Obama\u2019s best lines from WHCD White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinners often offer a reflection of a president\u2019s character. President George W. Bush used the event to indulge in self mockery, taking the sting out of attacks by critics who mocked his frequent difficulty in expressing himself clearly in public. Obama leans more to the sarcastic end of the comedic spectrum. But aides say he picks who to mock carefully and only hits those who can fire back. Two of his favorite targets returned in last night\u2019s speech: Joe Biden, who he jabbed for a shoulder massage the Vice President gave the wife of Defense Secretary Ashton Carter on camera, and John McCain, who he quipped was an angry old man the president could use to keep fence jumpers off the White House lawn. The Bush administration did not escape his sharp tongue either. \u201cDick Cheney said I was the worst president of his lifetime, which is interesting because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime,\u201d Obama said, referring to claims the former vice president was the real political power center in the Oval Office between 2001 and 2009. Aides said that there were many more jokes left on the cutting room floor on Saturday because they were deemed too edgy even for Obama\u2019s no-holds-barred brand of humor. That left some guests wondering how far the president will push the line next year, at his final WHCA dinner, when he will likely feel even less constrained by convention and political niceties than he was on Saturday night.",

            "article_content": "What to expect if Bernie Sanders takes the presidential plunge Biden's and Kasich's \"wait and see\" 2016 strategies GOP recruiting Senate candidates for 2016 in Nevada and Colorado A new entry and a waiting game on the Democratic side, a go-slow approach from a leading Republican, and the big stakes of 2016 filled our Sunday morning trip around the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table. 1. Here\u2019s \u2026 Bernie! Hillary Clinton is about to get her first official challenger. Here comes Bernie Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont could make an announcement within days, reports CNN\u2019s Nia-Malika Henderson, adding a populist voice to a Democratic race that starts with Clinton as the overwhelming favorite. Sanders has been exploring a run for months, and was a hit this weekend at a big South Carolina Democratic event. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can necessarily challenge Hillary Clinton in terms of donors and in terms of organization,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cBut in terms of bringing the heat, bringing the fire, bringing that populist rhetoric, he\u2019ll be interesting to see, and how he moves Hillary Clinton\u2019s own rhetoric as well.\u201d 2. For Biden, watch, wait and \u2026 Few think Vice President Joe Biden is willing to risk a third losing bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. But his official word is that he is still looking at the race, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis of The New York Times reports that this \u201cwait and see\u201d approach is likely to continue for a bit. \u201cThere is a strain of thinking that if Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is truly to implode at some point, that Democrats are going to need someone who can jump in quickly, raise a lot of money and have a lot of experience and launch a campaign,\u201d said Davis. \u201cAnd Joe Biden would not mind being the person they talk about as that person. So, and as long as we are talking about that, we are still talking about Joe Biden, and that\u2019s just the way he likes it.\u201d 3. Kasich also thinks waiting is best Ohio Gov. John Kasich is more visible of late, and makes no secret of the fact that he thinks he is the most qualified among the potential Republican 2016 presidential prospects. But he isn\u2019t in a rush to make a formal declaration of candidacy. Some see this as hesitation. But Robert Costa of The Washington Post detailed a conversation with the Ohio governor in which Kasich made the case that he need not rush. \u201cHe\u2019s not formally moving toward it right now,\u201d said Costa. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he feels a rush, because in this age of super PACs, it\u2019s more about building donor relationships, building relationships in the early states, then maybe getting in when you have a little momentum.\u201d 4. Listen to the candidates \u2013 and be reminded of the high stakes Personalities often trump policy in political coverage, especially in the early days of a campaign. But the old line \u201celections have consequences\u201d gets repeated a lot because it just happens to be true. NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep says the prospect of big changes was obvious as he did some recent homework about the 2016 race. \u201cJeb Bush was asked this past week about President Obama\u2019a executive actions on immigration, and he said on a conservative radio talk show, \u2018Yes, of course I would reverse them,\u2019\u201d said Inskeep. \u201cSo suddenly you are talking about millions of people who are on a path to be legalized for a while, now potentially on a path not to be legalized, depending on who wins an election.\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean they would go through with it. I think we all can recall President Obama\u2019s promise to close Guantanamo right away if he could just replace President Bush. But it certainly would color the campaign and the tenor of the campaign \u2013 the huge changes that could lie in store depending on who wins.\u201d 5. Remember Sharron Angle? The GOP establishment sure does! Goal No.1 for Republicans in 2016 is taking back the White House. But preserving their new Senate majority runs a close second \u2013 and that will be no easy task, because so many of the competitive races are in states that tend to lean blue in presidential years. GOP's 2016 Senate strategy So the GOP establishment is putting a priority on candidate recruitment and hoping to build on its 2014 successes, which you might recall included an aggressive effort to discourage or defeat tea party candidates viewed as too risky by the establishment. So in Nevada, where Democrat Harry Reid is retiring, there is an intensifying effort to get Republican Rep. Joe Heck to declare his Senate candidacy. And in Colorado, the establishment favorite is Rep. Mike Coffman, who opened a lot of eyes with his 2014 race in a competitive swing district against a top-tier Democratic opponent. Those two states \u2013 and those two seats \u2013 have special significance in the 2016 maneuvering: Reid and Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet won narrow 2010 victories in what was for the most part a big GOP year. Ask the establishment why, and you will get a ton of finger-pointing at the tea party candidates who emerged as the GOP nominees \u2013 Sharron Angle in Nevada and Ken Buck in Colorado.",

They ripped her use of a personal email server, her family foundation\u2019s acceptance of foreign gifts and her tenure as secretary of state. Hillary Clinton won\u2019t be in New Hampshire for two more days, but she was the star of the show on Saturday as Republican presidential aspirants capped the state GOP\u2019s two-day summit that attracted nearly the entire field to Nashua. \u201cWhen Hillary Clinton travels, there\u2019s going to need to be two planes: One for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage,\u201d Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said. He delivered the strongest assault on Clinton, hitting her over her handling of the deteriorating situation in Libya\u2014and particularly the 2012 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi. \u201cI think her dereliction of duty, her not doing her job, should forever preclude her from holding high office,\u201d Paul said. But others got in on the action as well. Hillary Clinton's rebranding campaign a success? RELATED: GOP presidential hopefuls woo party faithful in New Hampshire Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said he suspects Clinton\u2019s shopping habits have left her out of touch. \u201cI doubt the presumptive nominee for the other party has ever been to Kohl\u2019s before,\u201d he said. Clinton arrives in New Hampshire on Monday for a stop at a business in Keene. She\u2019ll then visit a community college in Concord on Tuesday. But for the weekend, the political world\u2019s eyes were on the Republicans in Nashua. Here are eight of the two-day summit\u2019s highlights: The Clinton designated hitter: Former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina\u2019s speech was entirely devoid of substance, but she managed to catch attention with her allusion to former President Bill Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Rebuking a Dallas businesswoman\u2019s Facebook comment that women\u2019s hormones mean only men should be elected President, Fiorina sarcastically quipped: \u201cNot that we have seen a man\u2019s judgment clouded by hormones, including in the Oval Office.\u201d Paul: Clinton did not do her job properly at State Dept. Biggest policy difference: Paul took on his own party, too, over Libya. He said the United States should never have waded into the conflict there in the first place and that his rival Republican White House hopefuls \u201cwould have done the same thing, just 10 times over.\u201d Others largely backed up Paul\u2019s claim\u2014with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, in particular, advocating a more muscular role in the Middle East. RELATED: GOP candidates talk entitlement reform Strongest tug at the heartstrings: Most candidates stuck with a tried-and-true mix of attacks on Obama and Clinton, and calls for a freer economy and stronger foreign policy. But Florida Sen. Marco Rubio managed to weave it all into a compelling narrative: His Cuban immigrant parents pursued the American dream, and he\u2019s trying to save it for his daughters. Rubio, playing the role of change agent, posited 2016 as a \u201creferendum on our national identity,\u201d saying that his children and their generation would be \u201cthe first to inherit a diminished country from their parents.\u201d A moment of self-awareness: Trying to assuage primary voters who worry about a dynastic Clinton vs. Bush general election, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush noted the massive field of primary contenders and said, \u201cI don\u2019t see any coronation coming my way, trust me.\u201d 2016 GOPers' foreign policy credentials \u201cI mean, come on,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cWhat are you seeing that I\u2019m not seeing?\u201d The field\u2019s egghead: Bush was the most comfortable riffing on policy issues\u2014even those where he\u2019s at cross currents with conservative primary voters. On education, he distanced himself from Common Core standards by saying what students learn should be left to the states, and same-sex marriage, where he underscored his support for \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d but said he holds no animosity for those who disagree. He also managed to turn his eight years as a conservative Florida governor into an advantage over Cruz, Paul and Rubio, three first-term senators. RELATED: Jeb seeks to shake shadow of family name \u201cAccomplishment matters. Leadership matters,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWho sits behind the big desk as it relates to the presidency is different than perhaps United States senator or another job.\u201d Best stage presence: It was a charm offensive from Graham, whose South Carolina drawl and quick wit\u2014which don\u2019t quite match his intense focus on more forcefully tackling threats in the Middle East\u2014were on full display when an audience member asked him a question about why the sorts of bargains that Republican President Ronald Reagan and Democratic House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill struck are no longer possible. Campaigns we can believe in \u201cYou know what\u2019s missing in Washington? Drinking,\u201d Graham answered. \u201cThey had a drink. All we do is throw things at each other.\u201d If you prefer fire and brimstone, though, there\u2019s no competing with Cruz, who unleashed an assault on Obama over immigration, national security and his attorney general nominee, Loretta Lynch. \u201cIf only the terrorists attacked a golf course,\u201d Cruz said, taking a long pause, \u201cthat might actually get the White House\u2019s attention.\u201d Most forgettable speaker: It\u2019s not that Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was bad. His personal story of lessons from his working-class father is compelling. He brought red meat and he showed some policy chops, especially on education. But nothing about Jindal stood out\u2014he wasn\u2019t the best at anything in particular, and fit into a sleepy portion of a Saturday afternoon schedule. Antagonizing the audience: Real estate mogul Donald Trump managed to both insult the audience and win their applause when he said he\u2019s considering running for president because, basically, politicians are dumb and businessmen are not, so he feels like he needs to do it\u2014even though he\u2019s not particularly interested. \u201cI\u2019m not having a great time,\u201d he said. \u201cI can think of other things, many other things, where I can have a good time.\u201d",

Bush\u2019s re-election bid in 1992 and supported President George W. Bush\u2019s biggest primary challenger, John McCain, in 2000. In a two-day swing through the state featuring stops in Concord, Manchester and Nashua, the younger Bush sought to reverse his family\u2019s fortunes. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to show my heart, show who I am, tell my story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little different than the story of my brother and my dad. This may come as a shock to you, but you have brothers and sisters so you may appreciate this: We\u2019re not all alike. We make our own mistakes in life, we\u2019re on our own life\u2019s journey.\u201d RELATED: GOP presidential hopefuls woo party faithful in NH Thursday night in Concord, Bush joked that he is not running \u201cto try to break the tie between the Adams family and the Bush family\u201d\u2014the only two in American history to produce father-and-son presidents. He was self-effacing when asked about a match-up with Hillary Clinton, which would mean one of their two last names had been on primary or general election ballots in seven of the last eight presidential elections. Closer look at Rubio, Bush friendship \u201cI have enough self-awareness to know that that is an oddity,\u201d Bush said. He also tried to disarm his skeptics. Asked at the New Hampshire GOP\u2019s summit\u2014the event that drew the entire Republican field into the state for Friday and Saturday\u2014about the prospects of a dynastic Clinton vs. Bush election, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t see any coronation coming my way, trust me.\u201d \u201cI mean, come on,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat are you seeing that I\u2019m not seeing?\u201d Bush hasn\u2019t officially entered the presidential race yet. But his Right to Rise political action committee has hired three key staffers in New Hampshire. Rich Killion, a Concord-based strategist who worked on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 campaign and has guided scores of local races, will lead Bush\u2019s efforts in the state. Rob Varsalone, who was George W. Bush\u2019s top in-state aide in the 2004 election and is close to Sen. Kelly Ayotte, and Nate Lamb, who was Scott Brown\u2019s field director in his unsuccessful Senate race last year, are also on board. At the New Hampshire GOP summit, Bush sought to strike a forward-looking tone. \u201cWe will not win if we just complain about how bad things are,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe also have to offer a compelling alternative so that more and more and more people join our cause.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention any GOP foes by name, but\u2014through the cloak of an assault on President Barack Obama\u2014took a veiled shot at the three freshman Republican senators who have entered the race so far: Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio, Texas\u2019s Ted Cruz and Kentucky\u2019s Rand Paul. Bush said that \u201caccomplishment matters\u201d and, suggesting that his time as Florida governor is better preparation than Congress, added: \u201cThe big desk is different than perhaps United States senator or another job.\u201d Jeb: Brother's foreign policy not particularly relevant Bush didn\u2019t throw much red meat to hardline conservatives, standing by his controversial stand in favor of immigration reform during his stops in New Hampshire, downplaying the importance of same-sex marriage and defending his calls for higher education standards, even as he said the federal government shouldn\u2019t push Common Core on states. But his biggest selling point was the eight years he spent as Florida\u2019s top executive, saying his record is an \u201cI\u2019m-not-kidding conservative one.\u201d The summit\u2019s attendees\u2014particularly those who remembered the Bush family\u2019s first two presidents\u2014said it wasn\u2019t his policies that concerned them, less than one year away from the state\u2019s primary. \u201cThe Bush family has been terrific, but I think we need a change,\u201d said Jim McHugh, a 63-year-old consulting business owner from Portsmouth. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not fair to him, simply because his dad and his brother were president, but I think I would like to see someone new,\u201d said Donna Slack, a 66-year-old Greenland retiree. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t have anything against him personally. I think he did a wonderful job in Florida,\u201d she added. Bush earned strong reviews, though, from University of New Hampshire students\u2014both of whom were in their early teenage years when Bush\u2019s brother was president, and who weren\u2019t alive when his father left office. John Corbett, a 19-year-old sophomore, said Bush\u2019s summit comments sold him. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely personable, compared to some other candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cSome crowds I\u2019ve seen him speak at are not exactly his type of conservatives, but I think he really knows how to adapt to every situation.\u201d Michael Raccio, 21, another UNH student, said Bush \u201creally impressed me,\u201d but he\u2019ll probably back a more conservative contender, like Cruz, because Bush \u201cdidn\u2019t address illegal immigration, and he has a shaky record on that.\u201d \u201cI was looking for him to address why he was in favor of giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants in addition to giving driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants, and he never mentioned a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m still left with a couple questions.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Marco Rubio cast himself as the forward-looking candidate to lead the nation toward a new American century when he announced his presidential bid Monday, framing the election as a \u201cgenerational choice\u201d for Americans. \u201cGrounded by the lessons of our history, but inspired by the promise of our future, I announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America,\u201d Rubio told supporters at Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower. The 43-year-old freshman senator is the youngest contender in a rapidly-growing race for the presidency, and his speech Monday signaled he\u2019ll aim to turn his youth and relative inexperience into a central calling card of his campaign. That offers him a clear and immediate point of contrast with two of the top contenders in the race, both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who became the first Democratic candidate with her launch on Sunday, and likely GOP contender Jeb Bush. Rubio wasted no time in taking a swipe at Clinton. \u201cJust yesterday, a leader from yesterday,\u201d he said, as the crowd erupted in boos, \u201cbegan a campaign for President by promising to take us back to yesterday. But yesterday is over, and we are never going back.\u201d Rubio\u2019s candidacy will also lean heavily on his personal story as the son of Cuban immigrants. In his speech, he told the story of his parents\u2019 struggles and said that today, the American Dream seems unattainable for many because \u201ctoo many of our leaders and their ideas are stuck in the twentieth century.\u201d Rubio's 2016 message: Restore the American dream READ: Can Rubio, Bush both compete for Latino vote? \u201cMy candidacy might seem improbable to some watching from abroad,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIn many countries, the highest office in the land is reserved for the rich and powerful. But I live in an exceptional country, I live in an exceptional country, where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power and privilege.\u201d Marco Rubio explained in under 90 seconds SEE: How Marco Rubio stands in the polls But while Rubio has all the makings of a winning presidential candidate \u2014 youth, a compelling personal narrative and deep roots in a crucial swing state \u2014 he\u2019s still missing one thing: Support. The senator consistently polls in the middle of the GOP primary pack, trailing fellow Floridian Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and even more conservative alternatives like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Supporters dismissed concerns about his middling polling position and relatively thin resume after hearing him speak. Alfredo Ortega, the chief of staff for the city of Doral, Florida, said he believed because Rubio is a \u201cphenomenal politician\u201d he could overcome many of the hurdles he currently faces. \u201cI totally believe now is the right time,\u201d Ortega told CNN at the event. \u201cIf he waits for another term it might be too late for him. So I\u2019m positive he\u2019s going to turn the polls around and he\u2019s going to become president.\u201d Ortega, a Venezuelan-American who came to America just 11 years ago, said he saw Rubio\u2019s ability to win support from both the \u201cAnglo and Hispanic worlds\u201d as one of his major assets. And he was so impressed with Rubio\u2019s speech, he said, he\u2019ll be calling to sign up to volunteer for the campaign soon. And it\u2019s that eloquence, said Florida GOP strategist Rick Wilson, that will help Rubio overcome the \u201cstatic\u201d in the field right now, as he jockeys for an advantage over already-announced candidates like Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. \u201cMarco Rubio has a certain fluency, and ability to connect with voters, and this will be one of the first times a wider audience has seen it. When people who haven\u2019t seen Marco speak finally see Marco speak, they stand back and say, \u2018Whoa \u2014 what have I been missing?\u2019\u201d said Wilson. His first test as an official candidate alongside other announced and prospective candidates will come this weekend, when he joins nearly the entire GOP field at the the Republican Leadership Summit. Prior to that, he\u2019ll stop in New York City for fundraisers on Thursday, and will spent Tuesday and Wednesday back in Washington focused on Senate business. Rubio now faces the challenge of maintaining establishment interest while growing his appeal among conservatives. The right remains wary of Rubio for partnering with Democrats on an ultimately failed immigration reform bill after riding into office on the 2010 tea party wave. But in the middle is just where Rubio wants to be. He\u2019s hoping to carve out a path in the crowded GOP field as the candidate who\u2019s not too far right to lack credibility nationally, and yet not too squishy on conservative priorities like guns and same-sex marriage to lose the GOP base. Rubio has eschewed the bomb-throwing of conservatives like Cruz and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, and the head-spinning vacillations of some of the party\u2019s more establishment-minded candidates in favor of what supporters see as a candid pragmatism. His career in politics \u2014 which began with a stint as West Miami city commissioner and found him ascending to House speaker before his surprise U.S. Senate win in 2010 \u2014 has been centered on that pragmatism, supporters say. He was the first in the 2016 field to declare, without reservations, that parents \u201cabsolutely\u201d should vaccinate their children. On same-sex marriage, he said if the Supreme Court rules it\u2019s constitutionally protected, \u201cwe have to abide\u201d by that ruling. He repeatedly asserted that it was impossible to defund President Obama\u2019s immigration executive order by shutting down the Department of Homeland Security. That strategy means he may not win any of the early nominating states that typically winnow down the field, but the senator and his advisers are banking on top-three finishes that keep him in the game until the flaws in the rest of the field are apparent and voters are looking for another option. But it doesn\u2019t come without risks. One of Rubio\u2019s biggest obstacles to the nomination remains a persistent skepticism among conservatives who believe he sold out by taking a lead role in negotiating the 2013 immigration reform bill, which died in the House after Rubio helped secure its passage in the Senate. In doing so, he plummeted from Tea Party darling and GOP rising star to freshman has-been in a matter of months, facing hecklers at town hall meetings and declining approval ratings in his home state. Still, he\u2019s made light of the controversy, joking at a February event that he\u2019s the rare elected official to be heckled \u201cby both sides of the immigration debate.\u201d And the gambit won him enduring respect among many establishment Republicans, who admire his willingness to compromise and cut deals. Where Rubio has seized the spotlight, however, he\u2019s made it count. Rubio led the charge earlier this year against the Obama administration\u2019s move to thaw relations with Cuba, appearing on nearly every major news network to slam the policy shift as shortsighted and scheduling hearings as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Western Hemisphere Subcommittee on the issue. The potential advantages for Rubio in the Cuba issue were varied. It allowed Rubio to introduce himself to an entirely new audience of Americans, as the historic policy shift drew front-page headlines nationwide. It gave him an opportunity to emphasize his compelling personal narrative as the son of Cuban immigrants who left the country due to many of the same hardships imposed by the Castro regime that Cubans continue to experience today. And it was yet another chance for Rubio to stake a claim as the GOP\u2019s strongest candidate on foreign policy, which Republicans believe will become a defining issue in the primary and general elections. While Rubio hopes to wind his way down the middle of the GOP, he and his advisers believe foreign policy will be his calling card in the 2016 election: The issue that piques voters\u2019 interest keeps them coming back. The freshman senator has been working since his early days in office to build the experience to make that case. He\u2019s taken 12 trips abroad since 2010 and co-sponsored more than a dozen bills on issues ranging from Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine to humanitarian crises in Haiti. He is a frequent and prominent critic of Obama\u2019s plan to tackle ISIS, and has slammed the Iran deal as insufficient to prevent the nation from gaining nuclear weapons. Rubio has weekly briefings on foreign policy issues with leading advisers in the party, and aides say he\u2019s a voracious reader of policy papers and international news. But first, he\u2019ll have to maneuver his way through the rocky and complicated primary terrain, and his launch puts him on a certain collision course with another Florida politician: former Gov. Jeb Bush. Bush holds a slight lead over the field in early polling and remains the preferred pick for most of the GOP\u2019s establishment wing, and has already locked up a sizable chunk of the party\u2019s big donors, despite being still weeks away from announcing. With Florida moving to a winner-take-all primary system, the Sunshine State showdown on March 15 could prove to be a pivotal contest for both candidates, and Bush\u2019s team is reportedly already strategizing to lock up the state\u2019s primary vote. But Rubio\u2019s already shown that Bush will be less of an obstacle than many initially expected, as he\u2019s managed to post strong fundraising totals despite competing with Bush for hometown dollars. Before Rubio makes it to Florida, however, he\u2019ll have to stay in the game for the party\u2019s early nominating contests. Though he\u2019s not yet the clear pick for voters in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, he\u2019s hired a top-notch team of strategists to steer him through the primaries there. Those include Todd Harris, a Rubio campaign strategist, who advised Jeb Bush in the early 2000s before helping drive Rubio to an upset Senate victory in 2010; Terry Sullivan, who\u2019s running Rubio\u2019s PAC and previously ran former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint\u2019s campaign; and Jim Merrill, Mitt Romney\u2019s New Hampshire guru, who\u2019s serving in the same role for Rubio. Moments from Marco Rubio's career",

            "article_content": "A pack of 2016 Republicans made their pitch for president Friday before the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual meeting in Nashville, blasting the Obama administration for what they described as an erosion of freedom while punctuating their remarks with sharp enthusiasm for Second Amendment rights. The contenders also used the principles behind gun rights to fire off criticism of President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of national security, further signaling the influential role that foreign policy is expected to have in the presidential election. More than 70,000 people descended upon Music City to attend the convention, but tickets to see the candidates speak in a five-hour long forum was limited to about 5,000 people. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was the only declared candidate on stage Friday. Other potential contenders included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. 1. Candidates show off gun credentials As tradition at the annual NRA gathering, the speakers tried to establish their own longstanding history with guns in different ways. Santorum held up his concealed carry card before the audience and boasted that his wife requested ammunition for an upcoming birthday. Walker talked about bow-hunting, while Huckabee perused the firearm vendor hall and later listed on stage the guns he grew up with, including his first BB gun at the age of five. \u201cI still have the same gun in mint condition,\u201d he said. Perry screened a video showing off his shooting skills (the same video was also shown at the 2013 NRA convention). The former governor also crowed about the gun manufacturers he recruited to Texas from other states. For Bush, the NRA meeting was a chance to tout his record, including his A+ rating from the NRA, before a conservative crowd that\u2019s largely skeptical of him due to his more moderate positions on immigration and Common Core. Bush proclaimed to the audience that he\u2019s \u201cbeen with you in trenches\u201d as an \u201cNRA life member since 1986.\u201d He also listed the gun rights measures he enacted or maintained as former governor, and defended the stand your ground laws in Florida that became a hot topic following the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Race and America's gun culture \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to choose between being attacked or going to jail,\u201d he said. Fiorina, who joined the forum via video, admitted her husband was the gun owner in her family, but argued that just because she\u2019s not a \u201chunter or a skeet shooter,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a supporter of Second Amendment rights. 2. Freedom in the crosshairs A common theme among nearly all the speeches was assailing Democrats and Obama for what many critics see as repeated attacks against personal freedom. Multiple speakers brought up the religious freedom debate that exploded after Indiana passed \u2014 then later changed \u2014 a law that opponents saw as discriminatory against gay and lesbian couples. \u201cIf these large forces can conspire to crush the First Amendment, it won\u2019t be long before they come after the Second Amendment,\u201d Jindal said, intertwining religious rights with gun rights. The speakers also tried to weave in what they consider Obama\u2019s violation of presidential powers via executive action on issues like immigration. Bush said the Constitution is not like a \u201cbreakfast buffet, while Perry said it\u2019s not like a \u201ccafeteria plan.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t get to just pick and choose the amendments you like and discard the ones that don\u2019t agree with your political agenda,\u201d Perry said. Santorum said he\u2019s worried about rights being slowly chipped away. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to have this happen on my watch.\u201d 3. Foreign policy a big topic The gun control debate has largely shifted from the national level to the state level since a gun control package failed to advance in the Senate following the December 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. And with foreign policy so predominant in politics at the moment, the contenders largely trained their fire on the Obama administration for what they consider his weak actions defending the homeland from overseas threats. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you focus more on keeping weapons out of the hands of Islamic terrorists and less on keeping weapons out of the hands of law-abiding Americans?\u201d Bush said, speaking rhetorically to the president. Bush also argued that the best form of national defense \u201cis a nation of free men and free women exercising their Second Amendment rights,\u201d adding that the \u201cthe Second Amendment is the original Homeland Security Act.\u201d Graham, who said he\u2019s retiring from the Air Force this year, issued a blistering critique of the president\u2019s foreign policy record. \u201cThe next president of the United States needs not only be able to defend the Second Amendment but defend this nation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next time you vote, make sure you\u2019re voting for somebody that knows what the hell they\u2019re doing when it comes to being commander in chief.\u201d Mac Rojo, a former Marine and retired police officer from Holbrook, Arizona, said he was impressed with Cruz, Graham and Huckabee at the event but was also surprised at how well Bush came across, he said. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if they could be the next entire Cabinet,\u201d he said, referring to all the Republicans who spoke. 4. Marco Rubio previews his announcement Rubio delivered a strong performance that came just a few days before he\u2019s set to make a major announcement on his political future. \u201cIn just three days in Miami I will announce whether I will run for president, re-election to the Senate or commissioner of the National Football League,\u201d he joked. \u201cThe NFL commissioner is probably a little too powerful for me.\u201d His remarks at the NRA touched on a broad set of issues but mostly focused on national security, a theme Rubio will likely embrace in his potential White House campaign. \u201cAnyone who seeks the presidency must recognize that in this century, there is no such thing as a remote problem. Our economy is increasingly global, and our people are increasingly bound to the affairs of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cA threat a hemisphere away such as ISIS can become a threat down the street almost overnight.\u201d 5. Ben Carson plays defense Carson has rocketed to GOP fame in the past two years, but he raised questions among some conservatives about his stance on guns after saying on Glenn Beck\u2019s show in 2013 that people who live in large cities should avoid having semi-automatic weapons. He has attempted to clarify the statement many time since then, saying he doesn\u2019t want those kinds of weapons to fall in the hands of the wrong people. \u201cJust for the record, let me make it extremely clear that I am extremely pro-Second Amendment and there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cAnd I would never, never allow for anybody to tamper with that right because it is so important.\u201d Carson, who grew up in Detroit, also detailed a personal history with guns unlike the others. He talked about drug dealers in his neighborhood and seeing \u201cpeople lying on the ground with bullet holes.\u201d Later as a surgeon, he operated on people with gunshot wounds to their heads. \u201cAll of that was horrible,\u201d he said. But, getting back to his support for gun rights, he went on to argue that it wasn\u2019t \u201cnearly as horrible as having a population that is defenseless against a group of tyrants who have arms.\u201d 6. Clinton as the top foe Just hours before the forum began Friday, news broke that Clinton would be announcing her presidential bid on Sunday, and the NRA event kicked off with a skewering of the former secretary of state by the NRA\u2019s fiery Wayne LaPierre. Along with hitting her policies, LaPierre listed a number of scandals associated with Clinton, saying she \u201chas more \u2018-gates\u2019 than a south Texas cattle ranch.\u201d While most of the contenders left it up to LaPierre to blast Clinton, Cruz and Jindal were happy to take on the likely Democratic frontrunner. \u201cThis weekend Hillary Clinton is announcing for president,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you, if Hillary Clinton is going to join with Barack Obama and the gun grabbers and come after our guns then what I say is come and take it For his part, Jindal brought up Clinton\u2019s use of the term \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d when she was first lady to describe critics of her husband. \u201cNow she was wrong about that conspiracy part. But you know what, she really wasn\u2019t wrong about that vast part. This is a pretty vast group,\u201d he said.  We\u2019re going to show her exactly how vast we are next year.\u201d",

            "article_content": "They\u2019re both Spanish-speaking Republicans from Florida. And they both want to be president. There\u2019s a battle brewing between Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush over who is best-positioned to help the GOP make inroads with Latino voters, a crucial voting bloc for the party if it hopes to win the White House in 2016. Rubio will make his case on Monday when he formally announces his presidential campaign. He\u2019ll speak from Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower, where Cuban exiles who fled Fidel Castro\u2019s regime stood in line for processing, and introduce himself as the son of Cuban immigrants whose candidacy is the embodiment of the American Dream. READ: Rubio\u2019s presidential challenge But Bush \u2013 an immigration reform advocate who is married to a Mexican woman and took some ribbing for accidentally identifying as Hispanic on a voter registration form \u2013 isn\u2019t likely to cede much ground when he launches his anticipated 2016 campaign in the coming months. Rubio\u2019s campaign is already making Florida politics a little awkward. The senator is a longtime Bush protege and his bid is leaving activists and donors feeling divided over which camp to join. The looming push for the Latino vote could add another layer of complexity \u2013 and personal animosity \u2013 that might split allegiances of Republicans in this crucial swing state. \u201cMany of the older Cubans were with Jeb early on but for many of those exiles, Marco is the fulfillment of the American dream,\u201d said Nelson Diaz, the chairman of the Miami-Dade County Republican party. \u201cThey will be torn between Jeb, who they adore, and Marco, who is almost like their grandchild.\u201d The outcome of the Bush-Rubio tangle will be critical for Republicans as they look to reverse the party\u2019s declining fortunes among Latino voters, a growing demographic group that made up a record 10% of the electorate in 2012 and backed President Barack Obama over Mitt Romney 71% to 27%. A matchup of a Cuban senator against a white former governor from one of the nation\u2019s most prominent political families wouldn\u2019t normally be much of a contest. Why politicians try to speak Spanish But the trappings of Rubio\u2019s speech suggest that the senator intends to compete aggressively for the Latino vote despite Bush\u2019s longstanding record of success with the Latino community. But Bush has some demographic advantages. Less than 5% of Hispanics are Cuban, and Florida remains their epicenter. But outside of Florida, Mexicans dominate \u2014 roughly 75% of Latinos have roots in Mexico. Bush\u2019s wife, Columba, is among them. \u201cThe difference with Bush is he has access to the Mexican American experience, which is really different than the Cuban experience,\u201d said Matt Barreto, who has extensively polled Latino voters and teaches at UCLA.  \u201cRubio\u2019s biography is not unlike other immigrants, but Cubans had advantages that other immigrants don\u2019t. His experiences don\u2019t have the same resonance.\u201d READ: How does Marco Rubio stand in the polls? An October 2014 survey by Barreto\u2019s firm, Latino Decisions, found a national cross-section of Latinos splitting their support between Rubio, Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. (Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who outpaced Obama among Latinos in 2008, was not included in the poll). The Bush family has successfully courted Latino voters in Florida and Texas, and in swing states across the country. George W. Bush grabbed over 40% of Latino votes in 2004. And in his 1998 race for Florida governor, Jeb Bush walloped his Democratic opponent, getting 61% of the Latino vote on the strength of Cubans. He approached that mark in 2002 when he won re-election. Bush, who hasn\u2019t announced a run, is expected to make his appeal to Latino voters a central part of his electability argument. In speeches, he often lapses into Spanish. \u201cIf Bill Clinton is the first black president, I\u2019m definitely the first Cuban at least \u2014 or Latino \u2014 governor of the state Florida,\u201d he boasted at gathering of the Hispanic Leadership fund in 2012. (Florida\u2019s first Latino governor was Bob Martinez.) And, at 62, Bush is almost two decades older than Rubio. That\u2019s a potential edge for Rubio since eligible Latino voters are younger than black and white eligible voters \u2014 nearly a third are between 18 and 29.  A candidate who can namedrop Jay-Z on the Senate floor like Rubio did during a drone filibuster, and is comfortable on social media and chatting it up on the Daily Show,  will likely resonate better with millennials than Bush, who can come across as a standard issue politician. \u201cYouth attracts youth,\u201d Diaz said. Florida comes relatively late in the primary calendar, and before that, Rubio and Bush will compete in states with few Latino voters, where comprehensive reform is a nonstarter among conservatives. And even in early caucus states like Colorado and Nevada, Latino Republicans won\u2019t likely be decisive \u2013 though laying a groundwork for the general election will be crucial for the GOP. \u201cAbout a quarter of Hispanics lean toward the Republican Party. Democrats have a large advantage and it\u2019s gotten bigger in the last years,\u201d said Mark Hugo Lopez, of the Pew Research Center. \u201cIn Nevada, the population is largely Democratic-leaning and in Colorado, it\u2019s similar. In Florida, you can get biggest clustering (of Latinos) in a primary.\u201d In Florida, Bush and Rubio will battle over 471,000 Latinos who are registered Republicans. In the fall general election, the Republican and Democratic nominees will vie for 1.7 million Latino voters in Florida, and millions more in the heavily Latino swing states that will decide the election. With Bush, Rubio, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has been described as \u201cpost-Hispanic,\u201d all in the race, Latino voters will see a level of visibility and outreach from Republicans not seen in previous primaries. But the trick will be navigating immigration reform, which is considered a gateway issue among many Latinos. Both Bush and Rubio have staked out moderate positions on immigration reform, with Cruz emerging as a hardliner. Ultimately, for the GOP, having a presidential field that includes two Latinos and a \u201cLatino by association\u201d gives them a better chance at fixing their perception problems about Latino voters and closing the gap with Democrats that has cost them two national elections. \u201cTed Cruz will do well among voters of Cuban background who are not supportive of immigration reform, which is a small group,\u201d said Bob Quasis, president of the national Latino group Caf\u00e9 Con Leche Republicans. \u201cI would slightly favor Jeb Bush, but Marco Rubio is a strong contender too. We have great prospects for winning the Latino vote.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican candidates see it as a no-brainer to slam Obama over Iran, ISIS and Russia GOP candidates believe voters are insecure and want a clearer vision than Obama's nuanced version of the world They must overcome Hillary Clinton's credentials as a former secretary of state, senator and first lady Republicans are reaching for a trusted trump card in their quest to take back the White House \u2013 blasting Democrats as feckless on foreign policy. But the GOP\u2019s strategy carries significant risks, not least because its candidates, though bristling with hawkish rhetoric, are notably short of hands-on foreign policy experience. Still, the party\u2019s presidential candidates see it as a no-brainer to slam the Obama era as a time when America has snubbed its friends to talk to foes such as Iran, staged Middle East retreats that spawned ISIS and other unsavory foes and emboldened adversaries such as Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin by ignoring red lines. It\u2019s an especially attractive strategy because the economy \u2013 often the top issue in presidential campaigns \u2013 is healing, and the likely Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, can be painted as the heir of what the GOP considers President Barack Obama\u2019s disastrous foreign policy. READ: You can trust me on foreign policy, Rand Paul says \u201cWhen the economy is less of an issue and there\u2019s a lack of stability in the world, then security becomes a huge issue,\u201d said Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor who served as Mitt Romney\u2019s transition chief during the latter stages of his 2012 campaign. \u201cWe find ourselves in a situation with an imperfect but improving economy, but a lot of conflict in the world.\u201d For decades, Republicans torched Democrats in presidential elections as weak on national security. But the Iraq debacle robbed the GOP of that trick, and Obama turned the tables in 2008 and 2012. Now the GOP wants its big stick back. However, to get it back, the party will have to rely on candidates that don\u2019t come close to having the national security credentials of Clinton, a former secretary of state, senator and first lady. Of the dozen-odd Republican politicians making signs of running, only a few senators can credibly claim in-depth work on foreign policy issues, and even they haven\u2019t made executive decisions on par with what the presidency involves. And after an election in 2008 when voters were willing to choose the candidate with considerably less foreign policy experience \u2013 Obama over Arizona senator and former POW John McCain \u2013 Americans may come to a different conclusion in 2016 if they are discontented enough with the current state of international affairs. Candidates such as Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Jeb Bush and Rick Perry believe a bewildering brew of instability, extremism and challenges to U.S. power from the Middle East to post-Soviet Europe means voters are insecure and want a clearer vision than Obama\u2019s nuanced version of the world \u2013 and that they can provide that, regardless of their resumes. Potential 2016 presidential candidates In the conservative foreign policy establishment, which is fuming over Obama\u2019s deal-making with Iran and Cuba and his estrangement with Israel, people think that bold leadership skills may be more important than the breadth of a candidate\u2019s foreign policy experience. \u201cWhat they are going to say is that Obama was weak and vacillating and inconsistent dealing with problems,\u201d said Lawrence Korb, a national security expert who worked for Republican President Ronald Reagan and now is with the progressive Center for American Progress. Polls validate the GOP\u2019s view that there\u2019s an opening on foreign policy even if it\u2019s not clear whether the nation is ready to trust Republicans with the nation\u2019s safety again. Americans seem spooked by ISIS and worried the nation could get sucked into another Middle Eastern war. A Fox News survey last month showed 55% of registered voters nationwide disapprove of Obama\u2019s handling of foreign policy. A Pew Forum poll in August 2014 indicated nearly the same number of Americans believes that he is \u201cnot tough enough.\u201d Disapproval rockets among registered Republicans, with 82% disagreeing with Obama\u2019s handling of foreign policy in the Fox poll. So it\u2019s no wonder the GOP is getting hawkish. \u201cThe Middle East is on fire \u2026 God help us all,\u201d said Lindsey Graham, South Carolina senator and potential GOP candidate last month. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another potential candidate, complained in February that \u201cwith grandiosity\u201d the administration announces resets, then disengages. And if you follow the money in Republican politics, it often leads to foreign policy. A new super PAC, the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, is spending $1 million to air ads in early primary states accusing Kentucky\u2019s Paul of being as \u201csoft\u201d on Iran nuclear talks as Obama. John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is also raising money for his own pair of political groups, which he\u2019ll use to defend hawkish GOP incumbents in House and Senate races and nudge GOP candidates to the right on foreign policy. But there\u2019s an inherent complication in the GOP\u2019s national security push that Democrats will exploit. The GOP has a strong incentive to nominate an outsider to run a change campaign against unpopular, gridlocked Washington. Candidates from the gubernatorial ranks \u2013 Bush, Perry and Scott Walker of Wisconsin \u2013 seem to fit the bill. READ: President Obama takes on Scott Walker But governors carry a built-in liability: no foreign policy experience. And running a campaign focusing on global chaos with a national security neophyte could be a big risk. To mitigate against that, Perry, Walker and Bush tout experience with their state\u2019s national guard units, which shouldered heavy burdens in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. When asked for details on his foreign policy background, Walker\u2019s Our American Revival PAC cited daily briefings with national security experts advising his prospective presidential campaign, including former Missouri Sen. Jim Talent; Walker\u2019s appearances at troop deployments and military funerals; and FBI briefings on security threats to Wisconsin. Perry is one of only two candidates in the field who has served in the military. He also emphasized his deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to staunch illegal immigration across the southern border as evidence of his national security capabilities. Bush, of course, must deal with his brother George W. Bush\u2019s unpopular foreign policy legacy, though that hasn\u2019t kept him from staking out positions that seem closer to the neoconservative powerbase in the party than the realist school of his father, George H.W. Bush. Despite a long list of Republican foreign policy advisers, Bush has a relatively slim resume on foreign policy beyond his international business endeavors and his studies in Mexico one summer. Conscious of their exposure, governors make strenuous attempts to get up to speed on foreign policy. But sometimes things go wrong. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal upset Britain this year by claiming it harbored Muslim \u201cno go\u201d zones. Romney\u2019s campaign trip abroad in 2012 was a disaster. Meanwhile, Walker\u2019s recent claim, when asked how he would handle ISIS, that if he could take on \u201c100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the globe\u201d drew ridicule. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was mocked when he reportedly said that Putin would not push him around \u201cgiven who I am.\u201d The governors\u2019 lack of foreign and military experience potentially creates an opening in the Republican field for someone to claim the national security mantle. This opening seems to be part of what\u2019s informing Graham\u2019s exploration, as he has long made national security a central part of his political platform. Indeed, the GOP\u2019s crop of would-be presidents in the Senate, who have long paper trails if not necessarily applied experience on foreign policy, are happy to point out the perils of picking a governor. \u201cThe most important obligation of the federal government is our national security, and I think that is something that is very difficult to acquire experience or in-depth knowledge (of) when you are governor. You just don\u2019t deal with those issues,\u201d Rubio told WHO-TV in Iowa in February. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight \u201cYou can obviously be briefed by experts, you can take some trips abroad, but I think this election has the potential to really be geared towards national security issues. I feel very comfortable in my knowledge and my experience on those issues.\u201d Democrats beg to differ with Rubio\u2019s assessment of his own expertise. In a fiery exchange in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently, Secretary of State John Kerry slapped him down over his claim that the administration kept Sunni allies in the dark over Iran nuclear negotiations. \u201cThat is flat wrong,\u201d Kerry said. But keynote speeches and committee assignments do not an expert make. James Carafano, a foreign policy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that because many of the candidates\u2019 resumes are so thin, they need to tread carefully. \u201cThe goal on defense and foreign policy is not to lose votes,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want somebody that\u2019s going to be competent, someone they can trust.\u201d Some Republicans believe that neither Obama nor the GOP candidates are offering a comprehensive choice on foreign policy. Virginia\u2019s former Gov. Jim Gilmore, an erstwhile Army counterintelligence officer in Europe who has also chaired a commission on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, is thinking of making a long-shot presidential run, reasoning that there\u2019s no Republican with the requisite foreign policy and executive experience in the field. Gilmore wants a return to \u201cconservative internationalism,\u201d which he said would shy away from ventures like Bush\u2019s pre-emptive invasion of Iraq but reverse what he sees as Obama\u2019s retreats and isolationism. \u201cWe have to have a third way,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cAll the foreign policy discussion in the U.S. is centered around the two extremes. The neocons on one side that want to be militarily engaged very quickly and every often. Then you have the neo-isolationists on the other side (who want to) pull back and not intervene.\u201d While the Republicans haven\u2019t yet laid out detailed policies, one thing they all agree on is that Clinton is not qualified to run American foreign policy. READ: Has Rand Paul missed his moment? \u201cThe fact that Hillary [Clinton] is the all-but-likely Democratic nominee makes foreign policy even more important,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary under George W. Bush, \u201cbecause of her poor record as secretary of state \u2013 in particular in presiding over the challenges in the Middle East, which is falling apart.\u201d Paul has long argued Clinton was negligent over the death of U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens in Benghazi and charged that \u201cHillary\u2019s war\u201d in the North African country has made America less safe. At the same Conservative Political Action Conference where Paul spoke, another potential GOP candidate, Carly Fiorina, said: \u201cMrs. Clinton, name an accomplishment.\u201d But Clinton does hold at least one significant advantage over the GOP field: direct experience. She will play up her visits to 112 nations and the nearly 1 million miles she traveled as secretary of state, while touting her role in the killing of Osama bin Laden, management of treacherous relations with Pakistan and stewardship of America\u2019s changing role with a rising Asia. She also carved out a reputation as a critic of the Bush administration\u2019s management of the Iraq war on the Senate Armed Services Committee and took a proactive role hosting foreign leaders and giving speeches as first lady between 1993 and 2001. And whoever wins in 2016 may soon find that the sound and fury of the campaign trail has little bearing on what they actually do \u2013 after all, George W. Bush promised not to be a global cop in 2000 before the 9/11 attacks turned his approach upside down. \u201cWhat the world may look like the day you walk into office may be very different from what it looks like now,\u201d said Carafano.",

            "article_content": "Harry Reid detonated his Senate retirement bombshell in the same tough way he ran the chamber \u2013 spending months calculating his options behind closed doors before acting in a sudden bolt of understated drama. The top Senate Democrat rocked Washington on Friday with a YouTube announcement that he would not run for re-election, vacating a power base he used to confound Republicans and shepherd the centerpieces of President Barack Obama\u2019s liberal political legacy into law. Reid, a former amateur boxer and Capitol Hill policeman from the fly speck town of Searchlight, Nevada, will leave a substantial and controversial legacy of his own. Owing to a fabled American journey from his family\u2019s spartan rock miner\u2019s cabin to the summit of Washington power, Reid enjoys huge credibility among liberals and deep loyalty among Senate Democrats. Indisputably one of the towering political figures of his era, Reid\u2019s soft spoken style only hints at the steel of a leader known for unflinching toughness and dedication to his state and progressive causes. Yet Reid is often blamed for deepening an era of political polarization with irascible rhetoric about Republicans and the use of controversial Senate procedures that left traditionalists worried the consensus that once made the chamber special has vanished forever. Reid, 75, made his announcement after a period of reflection partly enforced by his recovery from an exercise mishap which left him with deep bruising to his face and an eye injury requiring him to wear dark glasses that added an inscrutable air to his imposing image. A private man, Reid works long hours and late nights, and is famed for staying in a Georgetown hotel when he is in Washington, and recently relocated his permanent base from his boyhood hometown to Las Vegas. But despite his public reticence, Reid is a \u201cunique\u201d political figure, at least according to Obama, who called into a Nevada radio show featuring the senator on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s got that curmudgeonly charm that is hard to replace,\u201d Obama said on KNPR Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a great run.\u201d But Republicans are trying to tarnish the still-unfinished Reid legacy, and styled his departure from the Senate in late 2016 as an admission of an exhausted political brand. READ: Reid endorses Schumer to replace him \u201cOn the verge of losing his own election and after losing the majority, Senator Harry Reid has decided to hang up his rusty spurs,\u201d said Ward Baker, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cHis retirement signals that there is no hope for the Democrats to regain control of the Senate.\u201d It\u2019s too early to chart the impact of Reid\u2019s exit on Democrats in 2016, but loyalists are in no doubt where he stands in history. \u201cHe will be remembered as one of the greatest, if not the greatest Majority Leader of many of our lifetimes,\u201d said Josh Orton, who worked on Reid\u2019s communications team in the middle of the last decade. \u201cHe had an amazing bulls\u2013t detector. He could always recognize who was doing something for selfish reasons, and who was doing something purely for the right reasons.\u201d Reid will be remembered for passing the centerpieces of Obama\u2019s legacy \u2013 the Affordable Care Act and a huge 2009 stimulus bill against blanket Republican opposition. \u201cHow in the world did Obama and Reid get to where they are?\u201d Reid asked on KNPR, marveling at the unusual backgrounds of two men who both engineered an unlikely political rise. \u201cNever in the history of the country have we produced more for a president and somebody that has led his party than we have done together.\u201d Reid piloted Obamacare through the Senate using a highly controversial budget maneuver known as reconciliation to bypass a Republican filibuster, and told the GOP to \u201cstop crying\u201d about it. Obama\u2019s former political guru David Axelrod tweeted on Friday that Reid was \u201ccanny, committed and tough as nails.\u201d READ: Harry Reid\u2019s retirement sets Nevada up as 2016 battleground Earlier, in the darkest hours of the Great Recession, Reid ushered through a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus plan through the Senate despite insurmountable rows with most Republicans who said it was too expensive and racked up too much debt. The president often seemed amused at Reid\u2019s understated demeanor but learned to respect his political skills and the uncompromising character of a man who survived several close re-election scares over his six Senate terms. \u201cThis is one tough guy. Harry used to be a boxer,\u201d Obama said at an Nevada fundraiser in 2010 \u201cHe\u2019ll say, \u2018you know, I wasn\u2019t the most talented guy \u2026. but I could take a punch.\u2019\u201d There's something about Harry \u201cHe would outlast the other guys (and) he\u2019s taken his lumps.\u201d Harry Reid does not flaunt his power or strut. Reporters have to strain to decipher his soft spoken news conferences, and he quietly creeps about the Capitol, radiating hidden malice with a thin smile and the mournful stoop-shouldered gait of a lawyer in a Charles Dickens novel. But he has often been the last line of defense for Democrats. He has been a staunch defender of social programs and, reflecting wishes of the large Hispanic community back home, is an enthusiast for immigration reform. Reid also waged fierce partisan warfare over Iraq with President George W. Bush and mobilized to thwart the Republican\u2019s bid to reform social security \u2013 which he saw as the start of an assault on welfare state programs that are an article of faith for liberals. But he also worked quickly with Bush in late 2008 when the financial crisis raged and Congress had to swiftly pass controversial legislation that ultimately saved the financial system from collapse. Friday\u2019s announcement unleashed a toss-up battle for Reid\u2019s seat in Nevada and wider speculation about how his departure would affect his party\u2019s hopes of recapturing the chamber in 2016. Reid said in his video that he did not want to soak up party resources that could be used to help other Democrats win back the chamber. And he issued a clear hint that, freed from the obligations of seeking re-election, he would thwart the Republican majority\u2019s hopes of framing a solid record of governing to put before voters next year. \u201cMy friend, Senator McConnell, don\u2019t be too elated. I am going to be here for 22 months. I am going to be doing the same thing I have done since I first came to the Senate,\u201d Reid said. Mitch McConnell, the new GOP Majority leader and Reid have become the terrible twins of dysfunction in the gridlocked Senate, both using arcane procedure to slow and throttle the promise of each other\u2019s rule. The years of combat have taken a toll on their personal relationship but McConnell responded to Reid\u2019s announcement on Friday by offering the hard won respect of a longtime foe. \u201cUnderestimated often, his distinctive grit and determined focus nevertheless saw him through many challenges. They continue to make him a formidable opponent today,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. Republicans reviled Reid during his eight years in control of the Senate, refusing to consider amendments and abrogating normal process on the Senate floor. In 2013, Reid, after a long and angry standoff with the GOP, overturned years of Senate tradition by adopting the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to eliminate the use of the filibuster on most executive and judicial nominees. In the minority since January, Reid has already begun to play hardball with the new Republican leadership as he seeks to block GOP efforts to overturn Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, causing a new logjam. Reid was among the first Democrats to privately urge Obama to run for president, presciently arguing the charismatic rookie senator from Illinois could electrify grassroots Democrats. But he also sparked controversy after it emerged in the campaign book \u201cGame Change\u201d that he had also privately described Obama as a black candidate who could win because of his \u201clight skinned\u201d appearance and lack of a \u201cNegro dialect.\u201d Reid later apologized. It was not the first time \u2013 or the last \u2013 that Reid\u2019s sharp tongue got him into trouble. He reserved particular disdain for Bush. \u201cThe man\u2019s father is a wonderful human being,\u201d Reid said, but referring to the 43rd president, added: \u201cI think this guy is a loser.\u201d In 2007, Reid outraged among Republicans after he criticized Bush\u2019s last-ditch troop build-up strategy in Iraq. \u201cThis war is lost and the surge is not accomplishing anything,\u201d Reid said. Jim Manley, who worked for years as Reid\u2019s spokesman, said that his former boss never shirked from a fight. \u201cHe might be soft spoken but unlike some politicians, he likes the idea of mixing things up,\u201d said Manley. \u201cThere\u2019s a method to the madness.\u201d",

            "article_content": "There aren\u2019t many Republicans who believe Lindsey Graham\u2019s mercurial presidential campaign-to-be will actually result in Lindsey Graham becoming president. But the South Carolina senator\u2019s mere presence in the 2016 race could throw a curveball into the nominating process, forcing his soon-to-be GOP rivals to consider how a Graham candidacy would scramble Republican allegiances in a vital early nominating state. South Carolina votes fourth in the lineup of leadoff states, after Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. But Palmetto State Republicans cherish their role as the first southern primary. And for six straight contested primaries beginning with Ronald Reagan\u2019s win there in 1980, the state winnowed the early field and correctly picked the eventual nominee, always the preferred choice of the GOP establishment. But the state\u2019s reputation took a hit in 2012, when Newt Gingrich, backed by the state\u2019s restive conservative wing, throttled Mitt Romney, the ultimate nominee, in what was essentially a mano-a-mano showdown between the two candidates. In 2016, South Carolina Republicans are anxious to recover their We-Pick-Presidents reputation. But the state\u2019s GOP primary is becoming decidedly more complicated for outside contenders: Graham has grown more serious about the race over the last two weeks, according to Republicans who have spoken with him recently. READ: New Senate is just like old Senate Last Friday afternoon, Graham convened a meeting of his high command at his Columbia political office and left them with the clear message that he is no longer just testing-the-waters, but preparing for a full-blown campaign. The foreign policy hawk has hinted at his intentions publicly, too, hiring a pair of national political operatives and delivering what was billed as a \u201cmajor\u201d foreign policy speech this week at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \u201cLindsey is serious,\u201d said Trey Walker, who steered John McCain\u2019s two primary campaigns in South Carolina and attended the Graham meeting in Columbia. \u201cHe was adamant that he is serious. He thinks he has a role to play in Iowa and a role to play in New Hampshire. He was giddy about how well received he was in New Hampshire. He believes very passionately that he has the unique ability to bring national security issues into this race unlike any other candidate, that there is a void he can fill that is unique to his experience on his issue.\u201d If Graham runs, few Republicans say he would have the same kind of \u201cfavorite son\u201d impact that Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin had in his own state during the 1992 presidential race. At the time, other Democrats bypassed the Iowa caucuses instead of competing with a surefire winner who was deeply popular with the Democratic base. \u201cIt definitely doesn\u2019t hurt being from South Carolina, but just because you are a sitting senator, that shouldn\u2019t be an automatic berth to win a primary, especially when you are talking about representing our party at the highest office,\u201d said Glenn McCall, one of South Carolina\u2019s three members on the Republican National Committee. \u201cFrom my conversations with grassroots folks, he will have to compete like everyone else in the race. Lindsey has his followers, but he can\u2019t rest on those laurels. It will be wide open.\u201d Sen. Graham on Obama's ISIS plan: fatally flawed Graham is little more than a blip in national Republican polls, and most media organizations have not even bothered to put his name on surveys. But in his own state, Graham has a muscular political network built up over 23 years in politics, and they are remaining loyal to their man. Republican staffers and donors who might normally be inclined to back establishment-friendly hopefuls like Jeb Bush or Scott Walker or Chris Christie are assisting Graham as he builds a campaign. READ: Graham apologizes for Pelosi \u2018surgeries\u2019 comment Graham, too, has the potential to crowd the establishment side of the GOP contest, splitting moderate voters and opening the door once again to an insurgent on the right. Political professionals who depend on South Carolina\u2019s national relevance every four years worry  about the scenario further diminishing the state\u2019s trusted voice in the process, but a newer generation of devoted tea party conservatives are more enthusiastic about the idea. \u201cIf Lindsey runs, the big winner in this is Rand Paul,\u201d said South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, who is sympathetic to Paul but stressed his admiration for Graham and Rick Perry, who he endorsed in 2012. \u201cThere is 46% of the Republican primary electorate that can\u2019t stand Lindsey. If they are looking at the race, they aren\u2019t going for Lindsey or Jeb or Christie. They are going to be for Rand.\u201d That Graham lacks any kind of field-clearing power in his home state speaks not only to the slapdash feel of his darkhorse candidacy \u2014 his announcement this year that he was forming a \u201ctesting the waters\u201d committee surprised even his friends \u2014 but also to his complicated political standing back home. Graham is a known figure in Washington thanks to his frequent Sunday show appearances and passionate support for a strong national defense and immigration reform, both of which have led him to clash with the Obama administration as well as conservatives in his own party. Those two issues alone seem to be animating his potential campaign. But his political career in South Carolina has been subject to less national scrutiny. At home, Graham is a masterful retail politician, well-connected, bursting with energy and frequently on the phone with his advisers in Columbia gathering intelligence about the latest goings-on (he does not use e-mail). With his re-election to a third Senate term last year, Graham has gone from living in the shadows of South Carolina political giants like Strom Thurmond and Fritz Hollings to becoming one of them, among the most capable politicians the state has ever produced. And like Thurmond, who ran for president in 1948 and Hollings, who sought the White House in 1984, Graham now has designs on the Oval Office. READ: Hat trick: Jeb Bush to travel to South Carolina But unlike his former Senate colleague Jim DeMint, Graham did not climb from the state house to the U.S. House to the Senate because of ideology or any rapport with the state\u2019s conservative Republican electorate. Instead, he has scraped and battled with conservatives for years, making enemies on the right. He\u2019s made up for his shortcomings with the Republican base by relying on his instincts, grit, a disarming sense of humor and a ferocious work ethic. Growing up, Graham\u2019s parents managed The Sanitary Cafe, a small-town pool hall and liquor store in Pickens County, once the heart of South Carolina mill country. His parents died when he was 21, and Graham raised his younger sister, Darline, on his own. Graham, 59, never married, making him one of the Senate\u2019s only bachelors. McCain: No one better than Graham for the country Like his close friend John McCain, Graham has two feet planted firmly in the GOP establishment, arguing for a bigger tent Republican Party and fiercely defending the military and intelligence communities on hot-button issues like surveillance. Though reliably conservative on social issues and gun rights, his votes have frequently put him at odds with South Carolina\u2019s conservative and libertarian wings. In one memorable 2009 town hall in Greenville, Graham clashed with rowdy libertarians over his vote to confirm Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. \u201cI\u2019m not going to leave the Republican Party,\u201d Graham said when one activist asked him why he isn\u2019t a Democrat. \u201cI\u2019m going to grow it. We\u2019re not going to be the party of angry white guys.\u201d His comments were met with a salvo of boos and shouts of \u201cRon Paul!\u201d \u201cI love this party,\u201d Graham fired back. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be let it be hijacked by Ron Paul.\u201d Conservatives were eager to knock off Graham when he was up for re-election in 2014. He was vulnerable throughout the campaign, with approval ratings among Republicans that rarely creeped over 50%, dangerous territory for an incumbent. But conservatives failed to recruit a viable candidate to challenge him, a testament to Graham\u2019s fundraising ability \u2014 he raised $13 million for his campaign, a huge sum for a state with affordable media markets \u2014 and his loyal and powerful personal network of business leaders, elected officials and political operatives. READ: Lindsey Graham headed to Iowa As a result, brand name conservatives in the state like Mulvaney, Rep. Trey Gowdy and Rep. Jeff Duncan all declined to challenge him for pragmatic reasons. Graham ended up thumping his closest primary challenger by 40 points. Despite a winning streak that goes back to his first state house race in 1992, Graham does not have the kind of profile or conservative goodwill to roadblock other Republican presidential candidates from campaigning in the state. Almost 56 percent of Republican voters in the state do not want him to run for president, according to a poll from Winthrop University this month. But the same political network that saved Graham in his 2014 primary could impede the ability of other Republican presidential candidate to build a top-shelf campaign in South Carolina. Though they might otherwise be tempted to support Jeb Bush, the leading establishment choice in the GOP field, major South Carolina Republican donors like David Wilkins and Eddie Floyd are sticking with Graham out of loyalty. So is Graham\u2019s political consulting firm, Richard Quinn and Associates, which worked for McCain\u2019s 2000 and 2008 campaigns in the state. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t focused on the infrastructure Lindsey takes,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cPolitics is a business in South Carolina. You have three or four really good consultants and pollsters. And in each county and town there is a leading activist. Lindsey will tie a lot of those people up. The Quinns can\u2019t work for Christie or Bush or any of those people. Lindsey knows all of the best operators in every single county and he is going to try to get every one of those people.\u201d READ: Graham rebukes Paul on vaccines Then there\u2019s the scenario that no one is talking about: What if Graham actually wins at home? Graham\u2019s sharp wit, his ease with voters and the media, and his blunt talk seem \u201ccustom-built\u201d for the living rooms and town halls of New Hampshire, said one Graham confidante who isn\u2019t authorized to talk about the campaign. A strong showing by the dark horse in the nation\u2019s first primary could electrify Republicans in the next big contest, right on Graham\u2019s home turf. \u201cThe pride of the people of South Carolina would swell,\u201d the source said, perhaps in a fit of wishful thinking. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Look at what the homeboy is doing! You\u2019d have people who hate Lindsey\u2019s guts go vote for him.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz's decision to jump-start the 2016 election season is an implicit admission of the challenges he faces Cruz will fight a bevy of other candidates for the votes of the Christian right Ted Cruz is back in his favorite place: the spotlight. As the first candidate to quit the charade of \u201cexploring\u201d a presidential run and actually jumping in, the Texas Republican senator presented an image Monday of decisiveness and vision \u2013 all before an auditorium of mostly supportive young evangelicals. Now comes the hard part. Cruz must make inroads with wide swaths of the GOP if he hopes to break through as a top-tier candidate. He doesn\u2019t have many friends in the party establishment thanks to his hard-line tactics on issues like Obamacare. And he\u2019s facing steep competition for the conservative vote from the likes of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Even evangelicals, Cruz\u2019s target audience during his launch speech at Liberty University, aren\u2019t firmly in his column. The firebrand\u2019s decision to jump-start the 2016 election season now is an implicit admission of the daunting challenges he will face in a crowded GOP field where multiple Republicans will vie for the same social and evangelical support base. \u201cTed is clearly a player,\u201d said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a Christian public policy ministry. \u201cBut the competition this cycle is very steep.\u201d READ: Could Ted Cruz pull a Barack Obama? By choosing Liberty University in Virginia, which was founded by fundamentalist preacher Jerry Falwell, to roll out his long shot campaign, Cruz made clear he won\u2019t cede the Christian right to another candidate. \u201cFrom the dawn of this country, at every stage, America has enjoyed God\u2019s providential blessing,\u201d said Cruz, roaming the stage with a microphone like a megachurch preacher on a Sunday morning. \u201cOver and over again, when we faced impossible odds, the American people rose to the challenge. You know, compared to that, repealing Obamacare and abolishing the IRS ain\u2019t all that tough.\u201d Liberty offered Cruz a ready-made crowd: young evangelicals in a vast auditorium who had little choice but to pack the stands, because the announcement came during their compulsory weekly convocation. This is exactly the kind of coalition of youthful Christian idealists Cruz must win over and get to work in early voting states if his presidential hopes are to catch fire. But Cruz won\u2019t have this political territory all to himself. Several students sat in the audience within view of the cameras wearing red T-shirts emblazoned with \u201cRand,\u201d referring to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is also likely to make a play for young conservatives. Meanwhile, Walker, with his governing record and history of facing down a recall and trade unions, seems to have eclipsed Cruz in the minds of many conservatives who are desperate to take back the White House. \u201cWhen the grass roots look at a guy like Scott Walker \u2013 he can not only bridge the divide, we believe, in the Republican Party, but he might be the one who can bridge the divide like he did in Wisconsin,\u201d said Jennifer Stefano, a Pennsylvania tea party activist. \u201cThat\u2019s what I think is dominating Ted Cruz \u2013 he has not made as many headlines as in 2013, as when he tried to stop and defund Obamacare.\u201d Cruz must also face off against Paul, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Dr. Ben Carson to win evangelicals \u2013 a tough task. \u201cIt\u2019s a crowded field to begin with and it\u2019s almost as if, within the Republican contest, there are some early sub-primaries: Who is going to be the establishment candidate? Who is going to be the social conservative candidate?\u201d said David Yepsen, who was for years the dean of Iowa caucus reporters from his perch at the Des Moines Register. READ: Cruz to lose Goldman Sachs health benefits Meanwhile, a CNN/ORC International Poll last week put Cruz as the choice of 4% of likely Republican voters. So if he seems unlikely to win, why would Cruz get in \u2013 and so early? Paradoxically, the size of the task facing Cruz and the tempered expectations for his bid may also mean that the risks that often weigh against a presidential candidacy \u2013 the potential damage to a political career that can be caused by a poorly run campaign \u2013  may not apply. Perkins said he had been assured by Cruz personally that he believes he can create a path to the nomination \u2013 and ultimately the presidency \u2013 despite the fact that he would be taking aim at the White House with the almost unanimous disapproval of the Republican establishment. Announcing now could give Cruz more time to test messages beyond those tailored for evangelicals. He used his speech Monday to also slam Common Core education standards and immigration reform, areas where establishment GOP favorite Jeb Bush is perceived to be vulnerable. He also joined the hawkish Republican barrage on foreign policy, slamming President Barack Obama over his row with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his record on Iran and combating \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d But should he fall short in his 2016 bid, a successful campaign that positions Cruz as the leader of the evangelical right would certainly boost his political brand and position him for a future presidential run. And at only age 44, there\u2019s plenty of time for that. His Texas Senate seat, meanwhile, seems to be his as long as he wants it. He doesn\u2019t have to run for re-election until 2018, so a presidential bid wouldn\u2019t get in the way of the day job. So in a sense, Cruz may not have that much to lose. Another reason to get in early is Iowa. The state is going to be crucial for Cruz\u2019s hopes because it is the most fertile early voting territory for his chosen campaign path. A win in the first-in-the-nation caucus could crown Cruz as the undisputed champion of the social and evangelical conservative wing of the party. But he is going to be facing proven Iowa campaigners. Huckabee won the state in 2008 and Santorum won a recount over the eventual GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, in 2012. Both have substantial networks of support and, crucially, know many caucus voters personally in a state where the personal touch counts for everything. \u201cI think Cruz has generated some excitement in Iowa, and he is a new face,\u201d said Yepsen. \u201cBut it is going to be a while before he closes the sale with a lot of activists.\u201d An added bonus for Cruz getting in now: The early bird gets the best coverage. In a matter of weeks, Republican presidential announcements from the massive GOP field will draw little more than a shrug, so getting out ahead of expected announcements from Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio could be a good idea. When Democrat Hillary Clinton makes her official plunge into the 2016 race, any Republican candidate may struggle to dominate media coverage for several weeks. Monday also happened to be the fifth anniversary of the day Obamacare was signed into law. Because Cruz has spent endless hours trying to overturn it \u2013 winning the appreciation of conservative activists in the process \u2013 Monday was a good moment to highlight the point. Then there is money. Cruz, unlike some other potential Republican candidates, may have to work extra hard to raise the campaign funds he needs to mount a viable campaign. His early announcement gives him time for a post-announcement spurt before the next quarterly fundraising figures close at the end of the month, and a full three months to put up an impressive number in the next quarter.",

            "article_content": "Governing is much tougher than it looks, even for a master of the Senate like Mitch McConnell. Claiming the majority he had long craved in the mid-term elections, the wily GOP leader promised to turn the polarized, gridlocked Senate back into a chamber in which both sides get a say and pass meaningful legislation. McConnell\u2019s vow was not just altruistic. With a tough slate of Senate races looming in 2016 and Republicans desperate to take back the White House, he has a strong incentive to show the GOP can govern. But two months into the Republican majority, the new Senate looks an awful lot like the old Senate. The chamber can\u2019t even come together to pass a bill tackling the scourge of sex trafficking \u2013 which has wide bipartisan support \u2013 because it has become derailed in a partisan fight over abortion. The result is that President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Loretta Lynch, is being held up. If things were not bad enough, Lynch\u2019s confirmation process has degenerated into an ugly row over race. \u201cIf we cannot approve a bill to deal with human trafficking, then what will we be able to deal with?\u201d Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said this week. \u201cWe have to get past the tendency to score partisan political points that has affected too many bills on both sides of the aisle.\u201d The new Senate is not yet breaking its bad productivity streak. The only high profile legislation sent to Obama\u2019s desk was a bill authorizing the Keystone XL Pipeline, which the president swiftly vetoed. READ: Eric Holder: Attorney General for life? McConnell delays Attorney General vote The Republican establishment in the House and Senate has spent much of its time having to quell a bid by grassroots conservatives to defund the Department of Homeland Security as a way to punish what they see as Obama\u2019s \u201cexecutive amnesty\u201d in reshaping immigration laws. The GOP-led Senate and House are also at odds over exactly what to include in the biggest piece of looming business the party majorities will face \u2013 a budget bill. This is all welcome news for Obama, who was dealt a humiliating defeat in November\u2019s mid-terms but is not facing much pressure from Congress at all. He\u2019s using the political vacuum as a respite from the misery lame-duck presidents usually expect in their twilight years. The raging Republican civil war, meanwhile, is making McConnell\u2019s task in managing his restive conference almost as difficult as the one John Boehner has slogged through in recent years. And Boehner, unlike McConnell, does not have to deal with at least three Republicans \u2013 Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham \u2013 who are flirting with running for president, and who may have personal, rather than party motivations at stake. \u201cThe election changed majority control \u2013 it didn\u2019t change the sharp differences between the two parties,\u201d said Steven Smith, a specialist in Congress at Washington University, St. Louis. \u201cIt didn\u2019t change McConnell\u2019s relationship with his own colleagues.\u201d READ: Democrats refuse to take back charges of racism over Lynch nom Still, McConnell\u2019s defenders say that he has managed to make at least peripheral changes to Senate life. He has allowed more amendments to legislation than was typically allowed under the former Democratic majority rule of Harry Reid, letting lawmakers feel their voices are heard. In the DHS battle, McConnell honored his vow not to allow a government shutdown, though that promise will be tested in government funding and debt ceiling fights later this year. And even in the best of times, nothing moves in the Senate at anything other than glacial pace. So McConnell\u2019s quest to restore \u201cregular order\u201d might be the political equivalent of turning around an oil tanker. Prospects look reasonable that by using a budget device known as \u201creconciliation,\u201d which can bypass the Senate filibuster, the GOP will be able to move some legislation through Congress and evade Democratic obstruction. But many Republicans believe that Democrats, by suddenly objecting to the abortion provision after it sailed through committee, are simply looking for a way to jam up the Senate in the belief Republicans will get the blame for the futility. Their current strategy is, in effect, a 2016 strategy. With the chamber\u2019s filibuster rules, which require a 60 vote majority on most significant legislation, the current Republican high water mark of 54 seats is not sufficient to dictate terms to the opposition party. Already, with an apparent eye on 2016, senior Democrats are making the case that Republicans simply can\u2019t get things done. \u201cRepublicans have came in saying they would know how to govern, and what a mess they\u2019ve made of it,\u201d said veteran Democratic Sen Chuck Schumer of New York.  \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a good time or good luck on the pipeline bill, where they got bollocksed up on climate change. They\u2019ve held us for four weeks on funding Homeland Security. And now even a simple trafficking bill they can\u2019t get done.\u201d He added: \u201cHello, our Republican friends, you\u2019re in the majority. They still think they\u2019re in the minority and they\u2019re putting their own poison pills in their own bill.\u201d READ: Congress fails to do its homework (again) The shenanigans have some veteran observers of the Senate already beginning to downgrade expectations for the next few years. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the quick cement is rapidly drying on how the new Senate is going to operate,\u201d said Ron Bonjean, a former top Republican strategist in the Senate and the House. Bonjean predicted a return to the grueling \u201ctrench warfare\u201d which has made the Senate one of the most trying places to be in Washington. \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t want to move anything. They are finding reasons not to join Republicans in moving legislation because that will help the majority succeed politically,\u201d said Bonjean. The row over the trafficking bill is a bad omen for those who want to see a return to comity in the Senate. An attempt at a compromise failed on Thursday so the controversy will rumble on at least until next week. And the clash has become much more than a dispute over an obscure bill. It\u2019s a test case of how the Senate will be run for the next two years, being waved by two veteran experts of gridlock and procedure, McConnell and Reid who have seen their relationship deteriorate badly in recent years. McConnell is refusing to bring up Lynch\u2019s nomination, which has the support of a number of Republicans as well as Democrats, until the trafficking bill passes. But in the end, some conservatives believe, the Democrats will have little option to climb down, because the White House badly wants Lynch to get confirmed to succeed Eric Holder. But by then, it may be too late to stop ill feelings over the nomination from poisoning whatever goodwill is left in the Senate, setting a bad precedent for the rest of the year. For example, Sen. John McCain on Thursday furiously condemned another Senate veteran, Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, after he accused Republicans of treating Lynch, who is African American, like civil rights icon Rosa Parks by moving her \u201cto the back of the bus.\u201d McConnell doesn\u2019t just have problems with Democrats though. He increasingly is struggling to keep his own caucus in line, especially among lawmakers who have ridden the Tea Party wave and are challenging the Republican establishment in the Senate. In one eye-opening example, Republican freshman Sen. Tom Cotton bypassed Senate leadership by getting together a letter signed by 46 other GOP senators to warn Iran directly that Congress could torpedo a nuclear deal between world powers, including Washington, and the Islamic Republic. Grass roots conservatives are also furious that Boehner and McConnell combined to derail a bid by conservatives to withhold funding for the DHS in protest at Obama\u2019s unilateral effort to save millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. \u201cThey organized a surrender. it was the surrender brigade,\u201d said Ken Cuccinelli, President of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee devoted to sending candidates supported by the grassroots to the Senate. McConnell \u201cmisled Kentucky voters. He said he was going to stand up to Obama\u2019s liberal agenda. He said he was going to use the power of the purse. he said he was going to repeal Obamacare root and branch.\u201d Cuccinelli, the former Attorney General of Virginia, predicted that the action of the Senate Republican establishment would not be accepted by Republican activists and could fuel primary campaigns against sitting senators up for re-election, including McCain, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, and North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr. So under simultaneous attack from the right and the left, and with the president ready with his veto, McConnell is going to have to negotiate an increasingly narrow path before he can send his troops into the field in the 2016 election and argue that, unlike Democrats, the GOP actually got something done.

            "article_content": "At the time in his tenure when most presidents fret over their waning clout, Barack Obama is redefining the concept of the lame duck. His administration has been energized by his aggressive use of executive power. Some of the most hard-won achievements of his early years in office are beginning to pay off. And his political luck seems to be turning. With a term and a half behind him, Obama\u2019s prospects are brighter than they have been for years. \u201cWe are on offense,\u201d said a White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, noting with satisfaction that predictions that the new Republican majority would grab the initiative and quickly make the White House a peripheral player did not pan out. Though Republicans paint Obama\u2019s glass as half full, and argued that the administration is overstating its record, that hasn\u2019t rattled the man in the Oval Office. The new sense of serenity in the White House solidified this week with figures showing that more than 16 million people have now signed up for health plans under Obamacare, the president\u2019s top domestic achievement. Read: Obamacare numbers grow That news came on the heels of booming jobs growth numbers and a tangible feeling that after years of slow recovery, things are looking up economically. The unemployment rate, at 5.5%, is at its lowest point since May 2008, before the Great Recession. And the U.S. economy is in much better shape than most of its rivals in the developed world. Also looking up, as a result, are Obama\u2019s approval ratings, which at a few points shy of 50% aren\u2019t exactly glowing but are not bad for a seventh-year president in the politically polarized capital of a divided nation. As recently as September, Obama was at risk of falling below the 40% level. Obamacare at the Supreme Court in less than three minutes There\u2019s a lightness in Obama\u2019s eyes and cocky defiance in his step in contrast to his slumped shouldered, hang-dog irritability of 2013, when the promise of his thumping re-election win the year before evaporated. Second-term presidents often reach for legacy wins abroad, and Obama is no exception. He has defied Republicans and pushed forward on negotiations with longtime enemies Iran and Cuba, making good on a promise of outreach first made in a presidential debate way back in 2007. Top administration officials now make the case that far from slipping into the ignominy of being a lame duck, Obama is actually dictating the political game, taking advantage of the GOP\u2019s teething problems with their new majority. \u201cEvery time you pick up a newspaper or turn on the television, what you see is the Republicans are divided,\u201d said the White House aide. \u201cWe are the only ones that are doing anything proactive.\u201d Read: Obama, Netanyahu spat seeps into Israeli election The White House believes that its initiatives on community college funding, the president\u2019s moves to regulate the Internet and actions to reshape the immigration system are delivering a political dividend, reasoning that many Americans are happy to see gridlock broken and the president taking action, a factor that might be partly reflected in Obama\u2019s better poll numbers. Republicans see it differently, of course. They believe Obama has engaged in executive overreach, taking steps unilaterally since he doesn\u2019t have sufficient support from the legislature. And they depict many of his actions as small-bore moves taken because they have successfully stymied so many other parts of his agenda. Obama aides, though,think the GOP is the party with the weak hand. They believe that it\u2019s Republicans who have been the repeated losers in a host of recent battles: The showdown over funding for the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 which ultimately saw it being fully funded despite Republicans\u2019 efforts to block funds for the implementation of Obama\u2019s immigration actions \u2013 the siding of GOP lawmakers with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Iran diplomacy and the current delay in confirming Attorney General-designate Loretta Lynch. Obama, meanwhile, more relaxed than ever. He\u2019s speaking about race more freely than any time since he became president, notably in his speech on the 50th anniversary of the Selma civil rights marches earlier this month. And the White House counts a climate accord with China and a visit to India earlier this year as big wins for its strategy of rebalancing foreign policy towards Asia. The GOP, for its part, is learning what the White House found out years ago \u2013 that winning the Senate last year, and with it control of both chambers of Congress, brings its own problems. GOP leaders have struggled to corral a restive coalition, as lawmakers who campaigned on the platform of repealing Obamacare and opposing the president\u2019s moves on immigration have clashed with leaders keen to show they can govern responsibly ahead of 2016 elections. Obama has few such problems. \u201cHe is completely unencumbered by politics, he will never have to run again,\u201d said a former aide, who worked for Obama for years, but spoke on background so as not to be seen as speaking for the current White House. \u201cHe does not have to worry about squishy members of Congress.\u201d Republicans, however, respond that bullish White House assessments of its dominance are mere spin. They say that the administration is spending more time engaging in \u201clocker-room talk\u201d with reporters than pushing a serious governing program. As Obama plots moves on his own, GOP legislators are demanding a say on a possible nuclear deal with Iran that could scuttle the diplomacy while Republicans countrywide are challenging the president\u2019s order to suspend the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. And major Obama legacy-building initiatives that require the input of Congress are going nowhere slowly, in some cases because of opposition from within his own party, including on an effort to win authority to negotiate a massive Pacific trade pact and a bid to enshrine operations against ISIS in law. \u201cMaybe they should spend less time trash-talking and more time tending their own garden: Their party in Congress is currently filibustering a bill that would help prevent children from being sold into sex slavery \u2013 and the President won\u2019t lift a finger. Think about that for a minute,\u201d said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The bill, which would protect victims of sex trafficking, has ground to a halt in the Senate as Democrats accuse Republicans of having slipped in an anti-abortion measure. White House aides are framing the dispute as another example of the GOP\u2019s inability to perform the most basic of governing tasks and get widely bipartisan anti-trafficking legislation passed. McConnell says he won\u2019t bring up Lynch\u2019s nomination until the sex-trafficking row is resolved. And Stewart had further criticism of the White House: \u201cAs to their agenda, again, their own party is foiling the administration\u2019s efforts on things like trade agreements and war authority.\u201d GOP leaders and some presidential scholars also warn that some of Obama\u2019s muscular political moves are not only vulnerable to be overturned by a future Republican president \u2013 they may be bending the Constitution and against the law. But aides say Obama has identified a volley of new executive moves for government agencies to keep the momentum rolling for months to come. \u201cIt is incredibly important to have agenda items like that. Then you are not a lame duck,\u201d said the former aide, though he added : \u201cI don\u2019t know how many more arrows like that are left in the quiver.\u201d Still, whether it\u2019s fooling around with a selfie stick in a Buzzfeed video or rebuking Netanyahu from the Oval Office, there is new energy and purpose to Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cI won both of them,\u201d a snarky Obama told GOP lawmakers in his State of the Union address, referring to his two presidential election victories. The implicit message: Despite the GOP\u2019s capture of Congress on his watch, he believes he also has a mandate to push forward his vision of change. Second term presidencies are not typically about aspiration. They\u2019re a grim struggle for relevance as the power of an administration inevitably fizzles. But historian David Pietrusza argued that Obama is achieving something new by reshaping the notion of the lame duck presidency itself. \u201c(Obama) is not doing anything in terms of legislation, or very little,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has ratcheted up everything in terms of the regulatory executive order agenda.\u201d Obama could argue that he is piecing together the most activist second term since the concept of the lame duck was enshrined by the 1951 enactment of the 22nd Amendment, which limited presidents to two terms. Of the five lame duck presidents, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan were aging and out of political gas by their seventh years. Bill Clinton was bursting with energy but mired in his impeachment drama. George W. Bush\u2019s administration was drained by long years of war and had no domestic agenda to speak of in its sleepy final years. \u201cWe are not having the 2007 that George W. Bush had, or the 1999 that Bill Clinton had,\u201d said the White House official.",

            "article_content": "Scott Walker brought his Midwestern swagger to New Hampshire on Saturday, leading a crowd of activists to cheers as he sought to draw a contrast to his top-tier rival in the unofficial GOP presidential race, Jeb Bush. The Wisconsin governor, amid charges from critics that he\u2019s a flip-flopper, also acknowledged that he had changed positions on immigration reform but argued that he\u2019s remained consistent in everything else. Walker was met with great fanfare at his only open event during his two-day stop to the first-in-the-nation primary state. Activists gathered at Concord High School for a training event that was hosted by the New Hampshire GOP and headlined by Walker\u2019s appearance. READ: Jeb Bush makes 2016 debut in New Hampshire The contrasts made against Bush were subtle, but Walker emphasized his modest roots as the son of a preacher and reiterated his penchant for shopping at Kohl\u2019s while armed with coupons. \u201cI actually stopped by Kohl\u2019s and bought this sweater in the rack where it\u2019s 70% off,\u201d he said, pointing to the sweater he was wearing. \u201cAnd we paid one dollar for it with our Kohl\u2019s Cash \u2026 so, living the high life.\u201d Walker has used his humble beginnings and department store bona fides in Iowa, as well, a strategy aimed to cement the fact that he didn\u2019t grow up with \u201cfame and fortune,\u201d as he frequently says. He also put on a cap handed to him by an audience member with the logo for Gun Owners of New Hampshire. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a first-rate record on the Second Amendment; we hope you\u2019ll wear the hat often and keep up the good work,\u201d the man said. Walker wore it for the rest of his time on stage. (While he may have donned the cap-and-sweater look Saturday afternoon, he was set to sport a tux later that night for his speaking appearance at the Gridiron Club\u2019s annual white-tie dinner in Washington, D.C., where President Barack Obama was also scheduled to speak.) Answering a question from another audience member, Walker also laid down his staunch opposition to Common Core, a set of testing standards that Bush defended as usual during his visit to New Hampshire on Friday. Walker also stood against re-authorizing the No Child Left Behind Act, another topic on which the two Republicans disagree. Those comments came after Walker argued, in an interview with Tampa Bay Times on Friday, that Bush would represent a step towards the past, rather than the future. \u201cWe had Bob Dole, John McCain, Mitt Romney. If it\u2019s just whoever\u2019s next up, that hasn\u2019t worked so well for the Republican party in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cJeb\u2019s a good man. You\u2019re not going to hear me speak ill will of Jeb \u2026 I just think voters are going to look at this and say, \u2018If we\u2019re running against Hillary Clinton, we\u2019ll need a name from the future \u2013 not a name from the past \u2013  to win.\u2019 \u201c In his remarks Saturday, Walker also hit the President over foreign policy and took a shot at Hillary Clinton for giving \u201cRussia a reset button.\u201d On domestic policy, he laid out his small-government vision for a system in which success is measured by \u201chow many people are no longer dependent on the government.\u201d Asked by reporters Saturday to respond to flip-flopping accusations by his critics, Walker said the \u201cthe only major issue out there was immigration.\u201d Indeed Walker reversed his stance earlier this month when he acknowledged that he\u2019s no longer in favor of legislation that would let undocumented immigrants remain in the United States. He said Saturday that his change in tune reflected the will of the public. \u201cThis is one where we listened to the people all across the country, particularly border governors who saw how this President messed that up and that\u2019s an issue where I think people want leaders who are willing to listen to the people on that,\u201d he said. Any other accusations of flip-flopping, he added, \u201care just ridiculous.\u201d Critics have argued that Walker has been taking a tougher line against abortion in an effort to woo conservatives during the primaries. The governor recently expressed support for a 20-week abortion ban, after first declining to state his position during his re-election bid in the fall that. And critics point to an ad by his campaign in which Walker said he supports legislation that leaves \u201cthe final decision to a woman and her doctor.\u201d Walker said Saturday he\u2019s remained steady in his views on abortion. \u201cI\u2019m pro-life. My position is consistent on that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking an ad out there that talked about what the law did in the state which was endorsed by Wisconsin Right to Life, so it\u2019s a pro-life law.\u201d He also defended his support for the federal ethanol mandate that helps Iowa farmers, despite opposing it in Wisconsin in the past. Walker\u2019s more private itinerary included meetings with New Hampshire business and political leaders, including former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, who resides in New Hampshire and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate seat in the state last year.",

            "article_content": "By most accounts, Jeb Bush\u2019s first visit to Iowa last weekend was a success. He spent two days making the case to Republican voters that he is best positioned  to be the party\u2019s next presidential nominee, deftly answering questions about his commitment to conservative principles. But before he even set foot in the state, the former Florida governor faced an embarrassing setback: a well-known Republican privately rejected an offer to co-chair Bush\u2019s Iowa campaign. Related: Jeb Bush makes his first foray into Iowa Chad Airhart instead chose to back Scott Walker in the 2016 GOP Iowa caucuses, a notable \u201cget\u201d for the Wisconsin governor and an early example of the political arms race between the Republican candidates to land high profile endorsements. Airhart, in an interview with CNN this week, acknowledged that he was offered a senior position in the Bush operation. \u201cI was happy to be offered a leadership position on Bush\u2019s team here in Iowa,\u201d Airhart said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, after going through the thoughtful, deliberative process he wasn\u2019t the candidate or person I wanted to support in Iowa, Scott Walker was and I am happy to now be playing a role on his team.\u201d While Airhart would not talk about what the Bush team exactly offered him, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN it was to be a co-chair of Bush\u2019s Iowa operation. Tim Miller, a Bush spokesman, countered and said no offers have been extended to anyone to join the governor\u2019s Right to Rise political action committee \u2013 the legal vehicle Bush is using now to explore a presidential bid. \u201cThere is no campaign and nobody has been offered leadership positions in the PAC at this stage,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe were pleased by the positive response in Iowa last week to Gov. Bush\u2019s message of economic opportunity and we\u2019re going to focus our efforts on advancing that.\u201d Related: Walker leads in early Iowa poll The importance of political endorsements is often overstated \u2013 nothing more than a person agreeing that his or her name be added to a list of supporters. But in Iowa, endorsements can matter, not necessarily for the showcasing of a person\u2019s support but rather the political network and connections the endorser brings to the table. Airhart, the Dallas County Recorder, has significant experience in Iowa presidential politics. He worked for the re-election of President George W. Bush in 2004, Mitt Romney in 2007 and backed Romney in 2012 after his first choice, Tim Pawlenty, dropped out of the race. Airhart currently serves as chairman of the Iowa Republican County Officials Association. \u201cChad has a large network with friends in the tea party, social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, and establishment types,\u201d said an Iowa GOP insider, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he, himself, is in discussions with a handful of potential presidential candidates. \u201cAnd Chad is very influential in Dallas County, which is a key county if you want to win the Iowa caucuses.\u201d Airhart said his ultimate decision to back Walker stretched back to when the Wisconsin governor first won the governorship in 2010, followed by his subsequent victory in the 2012 recall election. And then Airhart saw Walker headline a Polk County GOP dinner in May 2013. \u201cAfter watching him here in Iowa, he was on my radar,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know if he was going to be returning to Iowa or not.\u201d Walker did return in January for the Iowa Freedom Summit, after winning re-election in 2014. During that visit, the Wisconsin governor invited a small group of Republicans, including Airhart, to a private meeting to discuss his record. \u201cI was fortunate enough for him to phone me a while later and we visited some more in detail on a number of issues,\u201d Airhart said. \u201cSo I left that call saying. \u2018Okay, here is somebody at the top of my list.\u2019\u201d At the same time, Airhart said he was contacted by the Bush team and eventually he had a telephone conversation with the former Florida governor. \u201cGov. Bush called me and we spoke on the phone for some time, as well,\u201d Airhart said. \u201cAt the conclusion of both of those calls, I went through this deliberate process and thinking about the both of them and at the end of the day I decided should Gov. Walker decide he wants to be a candidate he is who I want to support.\u201d Airhart said when he told the Bush team of his decision it was amicable. \u201cThey just wished me luck and said they\u2019d see me on the other side,\u201d he said. The organization that Walker created to help finance his own presidential exploratory effort \u2013 Our American Revival \u2013 announced on March 5 that Airhart and Marshall County Treasurer Jarrett Heil had joined his leadership team. Two days later, Bush, Walker and several other potential GOP presidential candidates appeared at the Iowa Ag Summit to answer questions about immigration, trade, ethanol and other issues of import to the agriculture industry. A February Quinnipiac University Poll showed that Walker is leading in Iowa with 25%, while Bush received 10% in that survey. Still, the Iowa caucuses are still 11 months away, and it is unclear who will be the frontrunner heading into the February contest. And if Walker doesn\u2019t win, Airhart said he would work to help the Republican nominee win the general election. \u201cWhen it is all said and done with, we are going to have a nominee and my style of politics is we all come together and we support that person,\u201d Airhart said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it accomplishes anything for any Republicans to be tearing down other Republicans or saying anything bad about them.\u201d Potential 2016 presidential candidates",

            "article_content": "Sen. Robert Menendez might be a senior Democrat but he\u2019s no friend of the White House. In fact, he\u2019s emerged as one of the most troublesome obstacles to President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy-building effort to end decades of U.S. estrangement with Cuba and Iran. He\u2019s also poked the administration on its troubled relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he shares a hawkish outlook towards Tehran. But the senior senator from New Jersey, 61, is now in the news for a different reason, after CNN first reported Friday that the Justice Department is preparing to bring criminal charges against him. People briefed on the case say prosecutors plan to allege that Menendez used his Senate office to push the business interests of a Democratic donor and friend in exchange for gifts. The charges, which are expected to be formally laid within weeks, threaten to seriously imperil Menendez\u2019s political prospects at a time when his influence in Washington has rarely been greater. Menendez is currently the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, after serving briefly as chairman when his predecessor John Kerry left to become Secretary of State and before Democrats lost the Senate majority last year. But his position in the minority belies his influence. Menendez has joined Republicans to threaten Obama\u2019s top-second term foreign policy priority, a nuclear deal with Iran. He is currently crucial to the administration, despite his distance from the White House, as some Democrats are likely to take his lead as they consider how to respond in the event an agreement is reached. READ: FBI agents search office of Florida doctor known as Sen. Menendez\u2019s donor Politically, Menendez, who fashioned his rise to the powerful post at Foreign Relations slowly, deliberately and largely out of the public spotlight, might be the antithesis of Obama, who appeared almost from nowhere and rocketed to the pinnacle of U.S. politics. But he is respected on Capitol Hill for making it to the top after years of striving, serving as mayor of his home town and in the New Jersey state assembly before winning election to the House of Representatives in 1992. He masterminded the Senate Democratic election campaign in 2010 in which the party clung onto the chamber despite stiff political headwinds that erased the party\u2019s grip on the House. It is unclear whether the charges being prepared against Menendez will lead to political pressure that could throw his position on the Foreign Relations committee into question. He is not up for re-election until 2018. His spokeswoman, Tricia Enright, said that all of Menendez\u2019s actions were \u201cappropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that.\u201d LOOK: A slideshow of Menendez\u2019s career Lately, Menendez has taken to wearing his testy relations with the Obama administration as a badge of honor. \u201cI don\u2019t get calls from the White House,\u201d Menendez was quoted by the New York Times as telling reporters this week. He was also a strong supporter of Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress on Tuesday which was critical of the Iran nuclear deal. Menendez took a direct shot at the administration\u2019s fervent opposition to the event. \u201cI take issue with those who say the prime minister\u2019s visit to the United States is \u2018destructive to U.S.-Israel relations,\u2019\u201d Menendez said at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee annual conference, referring to comments by National Security Advisor Susan Rice. White House officials privately do not try to hide their disappointment with Menendez. Some have previously complained that his approach to  foreign policy is not distilled from the wide sweep of American global interests but is the product of domestic political motivations. Obama aides with long memories also have not forgotten that he was an early supporter of Hillary Clinton against Obama in their 2008 clash for the Democratic nomination. The Senator does, however, share the White House\u2019s enthusiasm for comprehensive immigration reform which has yet to make it through Congress. The place where Menendez grew up,  Union City, New Jersey, has the highest number of Cuban exiles in the United States outside Miami and the senator has been a frequent and reliable scourge of Fidel Castro and his successor as Cuban leader, Raul Castro. The son of Cuban immigrants, Menendez fiercely opposed the Obama administration\u2019s effort to engage Cuba, accusing the White House of handing its government an economic lifeline at a time when its support from Venezuela was drying up because of low oil prices. \u201cI think it stinks,\u201d said Menendez in a press conference in December of the deal. \u201cI think it\u2019s wrong. I am deeply disappointed in the president,\u201d he said, according to NJ.com. Last month, Menendez complained to CNN that the negotiations for the Cuba deal had been going on in secret, behind his back for 10 months, and said the administration had given up U.S. leverage but got nothing in return to enhance democracy or human rights. He also delivered a veiled threat that he would use his position on Capitol Hill to thwart Obama\u2019s Cuba initiative, saying it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d to get a U.S. ambassador to Cuba confirmed as the White House seeks to upgrade the diplomatic mission in Havana to full embassy status. Menendez has also infuriated the White House on Iran, joining with Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois in a bid to impose new sanctions on Tehran which he said would improve the administration\u2019s leverage in the talks. The White House has fought the measure because it says new sanctions at this delicate stage of the negotiations would bolster hardline opponents of the talks in Tehran and scupper hopes for a deal. But Menendez\u2019s influence was key this week, when he led a rearguard action to convince Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not to bring up a new sanctions bill before a deadline for a framework agreement between world powers and Iran on March 24. Still, there is no mistaking his distaste for Obama\u2019s Iran diplomacy. In January he accused the administration of getting its talking points on the proposed deal \u201cstraight out of Tehran.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush told an Iowa audience Friday night that he was glad to be back in the Hawkeye State, where he spent so many hours helping his father campaign for president. \u201cMost of that time, at least the beginning of it, was right here in Iowa. And it was a blast,\u201d he said while making his first 2016 trip to the state, which traditionally votes first in the presidential nominating process. The visit is aimed to garner public support for an all-but-certain campaign that Bush has been sculpting behind the scenes with help from a vast network of donors and top political operatives. He kicked off the weekend headlining a fundraiser Friday night for Rep. David Young, pitching a conservative record as the former two-term governor of Florida and, in true presidential fashion, dishing out affection for Iowa. \u201cI just love the state. I really had a good time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my dad won, which was a spectacular experience.\u201d His father, George H.W. Bush, won the Iowa caucuses in 1980 but failed to win the nomination and became Ronald Reagan\u2019s running mate. He then famously lost the Iowa caucuses in 1988 despite going on to win the nomination and the presidency. . \u201cI\u2019ve done it both ways,\u201d Bush continued, finishing his thought. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Iowa when my dad lost, and when my dad won. I like the winning part better, to be honest with you.\u201d Bush promised the crowd, which was gathered at an agriculture museum in Urbandale, that he intends to \u201ccome back with regularity.\u201d In his remarks he addressed national security threats, saying President Barack Obama is \u201cthe first president since World War II who does not believe that American power is a force for good,\u201d and took a shot at Hillary Clinton. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things we need to restore,\u201d he said, talking about foreign policy. \u201cThis President \u2013 and by the way his former secretary of state \u2013 have let us down in this regard.\u201d He\u2019ll further make his case to Iowans at an agriculture summit in Des Moines on Saturday, where he\u2019ll be joined by other potential contenders. Bush, who hasn\u2019t run for public office since 2002, also plans to make campaign-style stops at two other events in the state, giving him a chance to practice his retail politicking skills in a place where activists expect to be personally courted by White House hopefuls. He got started Friday night, working the room while taking selfies and greeting supporters, including a woman who said she was a 10th cousin to Bush, as a crush of reporters and cameras followed his every move. One man asked him to sign the book \u201c41\u201d that his brother, former President George W. Bush, wrote about their father, the 41st president. \u201cAnd now signed by possibly someday \u201945\u2019,\u201d the man said, as Bush autographed the book. The trip comes in the middle of a tour of early voting states for Bush. He traveled to Nevada on Monday and flies to New Hampshire and South Carolina next week, completing a two-week swing that hits the first four states in the presidential primary calendar. Asked by the swarm about his busy travel schedule, Bush said the \u201cone thing I miss is sleeping with my wife every night.\u201d \u201cIf I could fly home to Miami every night, that would be spectacular,\u201d he added as he tried to push his way through the crowd. In Iowa on Saturday, he joins about 10 potential presidential candidates in yet another cattle call for possible 2016 candidates, this time at an event focused on agricultural issues in the state. Other featured speakers include New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, READ: Poll: Scott Walker, Jeb Bush lead GOP field Sen. Marco Rubio withdrew his name from the list earlier this week, citing logistical concerns because of a family wedding, while Sen. Rand Paul will be in Kentucky lobbying his state party to approve a plan that will let him run for president and his Senate seat at the same time. Saturday\u2019s gathering is the second large assembly of Republican contenders in Iowa this year, but it\u2019s expected to be markedly different from the last one. That event, called the Freedom Summit, was hosted in January by Iowa Rep. Steve King and featured 10 hours of speeches that appealed to the party\u2019s socially conservative and activist base. At this event, each candidate will undergo a 20-minute Q&A with the event\u2019s host, Bruce Rastetter, an agribusiness entrepreneur and Republican donor. The idea is to get the candidates talking about agriculture-specific issues \u2014 water quality, wind energy, the Renewable Fuel Standard \u2014 rather than provide a forum to rehash stump speeches and standard talking points. \u201cThe goal is not to have a gotcha moment,\u201d said GOP strategist Nick Ryan, who came up with the idea for the forum. \u201cThe goal is to have thoughtful conversation.\u201d Rastetter, in a separate interview, said agriculture-minded voters carry political weight not just in Iowa but nationwide. \u201cLast I looked, every American eats every day, so all these issues are pretty important, and I think will stretch well beyond Iowa.\u201d Four years ago Rastetter publicly pushed for Christie to run for president, but he stressed Friday that he\u2019s not backing anyone at the moment \u2014 and made that clear beforehand to the contenders he\u2019ll question on Saturday. Is Jeb Bush too conservative for the GOP? \u201cI think today we\u2019re happy and excited that he\u2019s going to be here, but the field is much broader,\u201d he said, though he added that he thinks Christie \u201chas a viable opportunity.\u201d Christie first needs to overcome some alarming poll numbers that show he has the lowest favorability rating among potential presidential candidates in the state, according to a recent Quinnipiac survey of likely Iowa GOP caucus-goers. Bush also has a long way to go. According to the same poll, he came in with 10% support in a hypothetical GOP contest, well behind Walker at 25% and closer to Paul (13%), Huckabee (11%) and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson (11%). \u201cI don\u2019t think that they necessarily know who he is yet,\u201d said Ryan of Bush. Ryan worked for Santorum in 2012 but hasn\u2019t signed on with a contender this cycle. \u201cThat\u2019s up to him to overcome,\u201d Ryan added. \u201cBut he has a little less than a year to focus on doing that through a lot of time in the state, meeting people and doing a lot of events.\u201d The tone and dialogue on issues will also be different at this summit. While the January event saw a bevy of speeches attacking  Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, the audience at this event is more diverse, with many open to immigration reform given the agriculture industry\u2019s dependence on migrant workers. That could be a good sign for Bush, whose name was booed at the January event in part because of his more lenient stance on immigration. Political observers will also be watching to see what Christie says about the issue. He has largely refused to talk about it, saying he doesn\u2019t plan to discuss his stance until he\u2019s a candidate. Meanwhile Walker admitted recently that his \u201cview has changed\u201d on immigration, saying he no longer supports provisions that would allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States. READ: Jeb Bush aides used private domain for public business Walker was widely considered the breakout star at the last forum in Iowa, a wave of approval he\u2019s still riding more than a month afterward, thanks in part to his strategy of attacking the media after he made controversial comments. The Wisconsin governor, who first came onto the national political scene during his 2012 battle with public unions, received sky-high favorability ratings in the poll, with 57% saying they viewed him in a favorable light compared to 7% who didn\u2019t. Poll numbers this early rarely represent strong indicators of the final outcome of the nomination process, but they can provide a small window into the political climate at the time. Also up for discussion at the summit could be trade, in particular the President\u2019s efforts to normalize relations with Cuba and open up more trade opportunities, something farmers here are largely supportive of. Yet Bush has been loud and clear that he\u2019s not in favor of lifting the embargo. In another potential clash with Iowa Republicans, Bush has been a vocal advocate for Common Core, a set of testing standards reviled among conservatives, who view it as government overreach. Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa, said it\u2019s still possible for Bush to gather support from voters. \u201cHe may not be able to convince them,\u201d Hagle said. \u201cBut if he can at least blunt the anti-Bush enthusiasm, that helps and goes a long way.\u201d After the summit on Saturday, he attends two other events that will put him directly in contact with more Iowans, holding a private event at a local barbeque joint in Waukee and later participating in a meet and greet at a Pizza Ranch in Cedar Rapids. CNN\u2019s Steve Brusk contributed to this report.",

Scott Walker is planning an all-out blitz of South Carolina later this month as he sets the table for his likely presidential campaign, Republican sources familiar with the itinerary told CNN.

The two-day swing on March 19 and 20 will take Walker through almost every important media market in the state, a rare effort for candidates, who usually build their visits around one or two cities at a time. Walker will headline four \u201cgrassroots\u201d fundraisers for the South Carolina Republican Party in Columbia, Greenville, Rock Hill and Charleston. During his trip, Walker is also planning to meet with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, an ally from the Republican Governors Association, during his trip, sources said.

            "article_content": "Conservatives are trying to overcome their biggest challenge: themselves. As the Conservative Political Action Conference wrapped up its annual gathering here on Saturday, conservatives were determined to conquer their persistent divides and work together to help Republicans mount a credible push for the White House next year. After two presidential elections won by Democrats, recent CPAC meetings have often been more about airing grievances and wallowing in the legacy of Ronald Reagan than preparing activists for power. But CPAC leaders worked to keep the focus this year on the future and a new, more diverse generation of GOP leaders. \u201cWe need to go out and communicate a modern message to voters who weren\u2019t alive when Reagan was president,\u201d said American Conservative Union board member John Eddy. Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee, 43, added: \u201ca conservative candidate who ignores moderates is as misguided as a moderate candidate who ignores conservatives.\u201d But talking about unifying Republicans is easier than actually doing it. READ: 12 key moments of CPAC Just a few miles up the Potomac River from the CPAC gathering, Republicans on Capitol Hill were feeling their way through another meltdown over the weekend. Speaker John Boehner failed to corral conservatives behind a bill to keep the Department of Homeland Security running, forcing him to come up with a last minute alternative Friday night and renewing questions about his ability to maintain control of the House. But that didn\u2019t seem to matter much at CPAC, which was the usual riot of late night parties, Democrat-baiting, tough talk on foreign policy and off color jokes about Bill Clinton. \u201cThe kids are in charge!\u201d declared the American Conservative Union\u2019s energetic new leader Matt Schlapp at a four-day conference packed with \u201cboot camps\u201d and tutorials to train activists in the political ground game. There was even talk of emulating President Barack Obama. Conservatives once mocked Obama for being a community organizer but, chastened by his two electoral wins, there\u2019s now a certain admiration for his brand of precinct-by-precinct politics and record of uniting Democrats. Charlie Kirk, leader of Turning Point USA, a national conservative student movement, said Democrats, unlike Republicans, were able to unite behind common principles without \u201cinfighting.\u201d \u201cWe can learn from the left in that regard,\u201d he said. In the event\u2019s straw poll, which provides a snapshot of conservative opinion but is a poor predictor of presidents, Sen. Rand Paul pulled off his third win in a row in a fresh show of his organizational muscle and appeal to younger voters. He beat out Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker by four points. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush rounded out the top five. It was difficult to make firm conclusions about the poll because it disproportionately attracts students and young voters who may not reflect the eventual Republican electorate. WATCH: Republican one-liners from CPAC But though CPAC organizers were pre-occupied with building the infrastructure of the next election, most excitement surrounded the candidates, who seemed much more professional than some of their predecessors in 2012. The big questions going into CPAC were: Can Bush win over conservative critics? Is Walker ready for prime time? And can another candidate break into the conversation? Bush braved the lion\u2019s den and boos from conservatives who abhor his positions on Common Core education standards and immigration reform. His 8% total in the straw poll was not a surprise. But the consensus after his performance in a Q&A session on Friday indicated he might have helped himself a little. CPAC 2015: The sights \u201cHe was impressive. He came across and shared his conservatism really well,\u201d said Glenn McCall, a Republican National Committeeman from South Carolina who had previously been skeptical about Bush\u2019s appeal to grass roots conservatives. \u201cI think it is going to play well for him,\u201d McCall said. \u201cPeople are going to be excited in South Carolina after seeing him (at CPAC).\u201d Bush stood his ground on his differences with the movement, but offered his most explicit statement yet that he was a true conservative while governing Florida. READ: Republicans agree with \u2026 Elizabeth Warren? But he still has work to do. Talk show host Laura Ingraham voiced the fears of many CPACers when she complained Bush was so close to Hillary Clinton on surveillance, immigration and education that \u201cthey might was well run on the same ticket.\u201d Walker lived up to his billing as the hot new conservative hope. \u201cRun Scott Run,\u201d the crowd chanted as he reeled off his resume on hammering unions and slashing taxes. But he again showed a tendency to set off media brushfires a week after being caught up in a tussle over whether Obama and is a Christian and loves his country. When asked how he would handle ISIS, Walker said that if he can take on 100,000 protestors at home, he could \u201cdo the same across the globe\u201d in an answer which seemed to reveal his foreign policy inexperience. Rubio, who hurt his ties with conservatives by initially backing comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate, got a warm reception and so did Cruz. Paul sought to distance himself from isolationist sentiment among many in his libertarian base by promising a strong defense against the \u201cbarbaric cult\u201d of ISIS. Christie, meanwhile, played into a widespread feeling at CPAC, and foreshadowed an attack line against Bush, when he said that rich donors should not decide the Democratic nomination. The party\u2019s relatively minor potential contenders, like Carly Fiorina, Rick Santorum, John Bolton, and Rick Perry, also gave speeches which seem more likely to usefully shape the party\u2019s debate rather than drive it to the extreme. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, meanwhile, offered a tutorial in how to take down Clinton, who was universally condemned as a disastrous secretary of state who will seek a \u201cthird term for Obama.\u201d \u201cThe funny thing about Hillary Clinton, the more people that hear from her the less they like her,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cHillary never comes out in public these days. If there\u2019s not a private luxury jet and a quarter of a million dollar speaking fee, you can forget about it.\u201d But Democrats scoffed at the idea that conservatives were now turning to the kind of techniques pioneered by Obama. \u201cOf course they are trying to run their presidential campaigns with our message (#WeWonTwice), but their policies don\u2019t match and voters know that. And with 619 days until the election, anyone who hasn\u2019t figured that out already is going to,\u201d said DNC spokeswoman Holly Shulman.",

            "article_content": "The year\u2019s biggest conservative confab features thousands of activists, elected officials and party leaders gathering for the Conservative Political Action Conference. But while they\u2019re meeting at a convention center just outside of Washington, D.C., their minds \u2014\u00a0and rhetoric \u2014\u00a0are focused squarely on the White House and on attacking Hillary Clinton, the most likely Democratic nominee in 2016. Here\u2019s every critical thing they said about her Thursday: This year\u2019s CPAC marks the unofficial kickoff of the battle for the conservative vote among GOP presidential contenders. For some, like Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, the event will be a homecoming, a return to their most ardent and loyal supporters. READ: Conservatives party like it\u2019s 2016 For others, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, CPAC represents a lion\u2019s den, full of activists skeptical of his conservative chops and wary of his presidential aspirations. CPAC can put a potential contender on the map, as it did with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson last year, when the movement launched to draft him into the presidential race drew significant attention and he took third in the presidential straw poll. But it can also cripple a frontrunner, as it did when then-GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney called himself \u201cseverely conservative\u201d at the 2012 convention. What does CPAC look like? check out the video below: Here\u2019s what you need to know: 3 p.m. - Jeb Bush defended his positions on immigration \u2013 and made some breaks from hard-line conservatives \u2013 in front of a rowdy crowd Friday afternoon. The former Florida governor went all-in on his support for a giving undocumented immigrants a path to legal status, and for making in-state college tuition available for those immigrants. But he earned loud cheers from the crowd by saying he\u2019d favor closing the U.S.-Mexico border first, before enacting any other immigration reforms, and for saying tens of thousands of Central American immigrants who arrived in Texas last summer should have been deported. And he punted on a question about Congress\u2019 ongoing fight over funding the Department of Homeland Security and whether Republicans should stick with a measure that also defunds President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration actions \u2013 even at the risk of shutting the department down. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert on the ways of Washington,\u201d he said. Bush\u2019s comments came in a highly-anticipated question-and-answer session with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Some members of the crowd walked out early in Bush\u2019s appearance, and others interrupted him with jeers. But they were matched in volume by Bush\u2019s supporters. 2016 hopeful Jeb Bush booed at CPAC Hannity put Bush on defense for much of the 25-minute session, quizzing him on his stances on two issues that could hurt him with the GOP base: immigration and the Common Core education standards. Bush used the education questions to tout his role as one of the nation\u2019s leading conservative reformers, noting that Florida had launched the first statewide voucher program on his watch and offered a long list of choices that allow students and their parents to decide how to spend public education dollars. He also told the crowd that Republicans need to pivot from their opposition to Obama \u2013 who he called a \u201cfailed president\u201d \u2013 to a more positive agenda in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s good to oppose the bad things, but we need to start being for things,\u201d Bush said. The same, he said, goes for him \u2013 the candidate with a father and brother who were president. \u201cI have to show what\u2019s in my heart. I have to show that I care about people, about their future,\u201d Bush said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be about the past.\u201d \u2014 Eric Bradner, CNN In between the seemingly endless parade of 2016 hopefuls \u2013 Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson had plenty of red meat to offer to CPAC\u2019s conservative attendees, and advice to any potential Republican Candidates. \u201cCarry two things wherever you go in case you become president \u2013 your bible and your woman,\u201d The former A&E reality show was not shy in asserting his own unabashedly conservative beliefs. \u201cI am a god-loving, bible-believing, gun-toting, capitalist,\u201d Robertson declared to the crowd. Taking a decidedly spiritual tone, Robertson read mostly from religious texts and selected writing from George Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, imploring conservatives to hold onto America\u2019s religious roots. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m a little too religious for you, just listen to your founding fathers, the men that founded this country,\u201d Robertson said, \u201cthen decide if I\u2019m too religious for you.\u201d Robertson also lamented the decline of the American family, citing CDC data on rates of sexually transmitted diseases as evidence of the U.S.\u2019s moral decline. He also likened the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria to the rise of Hitler and Stalin before World War II, pointing to a lack of Christian values as a common strain in those two nations. \u201cI don\u2019t see a dime\u2019s worth of different in any of them,\u201d Robertson said. He closed with another nod to 2016. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have spiritual men making political decisions, you\u2019re going to lose this country,\u201d Robertson warned. \u2013 Johnny Verhovek, CNN 1:15 p.m. Former Sen. Rick Santorum pitched his foreign policy experience at CPAC on Friday as he laid out the radical Islamist threat the United States faces. \u201cCommander in chief is not an entry level position. And the oval office is no place for on the job training, not in times like this,\u201d said Santorum, who spent eight years on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Santorum had trouble building applause lines as a crowd of Sen. Rand Paul supporters filtered out of the room after Paul, a crowd favorite, left the stage. But the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm grew as Santorum shifted focus from economics and the need to \u201cstand for the little guy\u201d to the threat of radical Islam. Santorum laid out his vision for a hawkish foreign policy, calling for a robust military and the need for the United States military to deploy 10,000 \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to defeat ISIS. Jeremy Diamond, CNN 1 p.m. - Sen. Rand Paul while speaking to a friendly audience, stuck largely to his stump speech but also used his background as a physician to distinguish himself from the rest of the crowded field of potential presidential candidates. \u201cAs a doctor, I will take it and make it my mission to heal the nation, reverse the course of Obamacare, and repeal every last bit of it,\u201d he said, adding that Chief Justice John Robert\u2019s decision was the \u201cmistake of the century.\u201d The Kentucky Republican undoubtedly had the warmest reception from the young CPAC crowd, which has traditionally tilted in favor of the libertarian-leaning senator and previously his father, former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. The audience was the fullest yet in the massive ballroom, and chants of \u201cPresident Paul\u201d occasionally broke out. Paul ticked through his views on privacy and the Bill of Rights and rallied the crowd to its feet with a healthy dish of red meat, reiterating that it\u2019s time for Hillary Clinton to \u201cpermanently retire\u201d and calling for term limits for members of Congress. And while polls show momentum building towards a more aggressive U.S. response against ISIS, Paul tried to carefully walk the line of supporting a strong national defense while still holding onto his non-interventionist views. \u201cWithout question we must defend ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cI envision an America with a National Defense unparalleled, undefeatable, and unencumbered by nation building.\u201d 9:42 a.m. - Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry tried to leverage the experience that 14 years as a border-state governor gives him over the rest of the 2016 Republican presidential field during his Friday morning CPAC speech. Perry hit the issue of immigration hard, repeatedly touting his state\u2019s efforts \u2013 which included deploying the National Guard \u2013 to stop an influx of undocumented minors that were crossing the U.S.-Mexico border last summer. He recalled a conversation with President Barack Obama during the President\u2019s visit to Dallas last year. \u201cI said to him, Mr. President, if you don\u2019t secure this border, Texas will, and that\u2019s exactly what we did,\u201d he said. Asked about his plans for immigration reform, Perry offered no specifics, though. \u201cIf you do not secure the border first, you can\u2019t have a conversation about immigration reform, that\u2019s just a fact,\u201d he said. He also called for \u201caviation assets\u201d to monitor the border. Perry also slugged Obama \u2013 who was the sole focus of his speech and remarks in a subsequent question-and-answer session, unlike other Republicans who have hit Hillary Clinton or other party members \u2013 for his handling of foreign threats like ISIS. He said the United States must support Israel and be sure not to \u201cgrant Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions diplomatic cover.\u201d Perry touted tax cuts and regulatory reforms enacted in Texas as a national model, and said that there\u2019s \u201cnothing wrong with America that cannot be fixed with new leadership.\u201d Comparing Obama\u2019s leadership to wars, depressions and Jimmy Carter, Perry said: \u201cWe\u2019ve survived worse.\u201d CNN spent time with Perry in New Hampshire recently. He kissed babies, shook hands, and tried to convince voters that 2015 Perry is a far different potential candidate than the one who \u201cstepped in it\u201d four years ago. Watch that below and read on for more from CPAC: 8:40 a.m. - For Sen. Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton is \u201cyesterday.\u201d That may be why, during his Friday-morning speech at CPAC, the potential presidential contender laid out his vision for a \u201cnew American century.\u201d In a succinct address, the Florida senator said that while America\u2019s still exceptional, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t know it by listening to the President, who\u2019s described our nation as sometimes being arrogant or dictating terms to others.\u201d \u201cOur nation is on the decline,\u201d he added. \u201cThe good news is, we are one election away from triggering another American century.\u201d Rubio leaned heavily on his own personal story in his speech, referencing his family\u2019s immigration to America and his working-class upbringing. \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t owe me anything,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I have a debt to America.\u201d And in a question-and-answer session with Sean Hannity, Rubio again drew a juxtaposition between the problems of the past and the solutions of the future. \u201cWe\u2019re basically having the industrial revolution every five years \u2014 and our leaders are basically stuck in yesterday,\u201d he said. In a rapid-fire word-association segment, Rubio described Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential frontrunner, as \u201cyesterday,\u201d Bill Clinton as \u201creally yesterday,\u201d and Obama as \u201cfailed.\u201d But he was careful to keep controversy at arms length in the question-and-answer session, distancing himself from his role in passing the Senate immigration reform bill in 2013 that sparked heavy  backlash from conservatives. He called for tougher border control and restrictions on legal immigration before addressing those in the U.S. illegally. \u201cYou can\u2019t even begin to have a conversation about [immigrants in the U.S. illegally] until people believe, and know \u2026 that future illegal immigration will be controlled,\u201d he said. 6:25 p.m. - Gov. Bobby Jindal laid out his criticism of Common Core, slammed President Barack Obama on the fight against radical Islam and reemphasized the need for immigrants to assimilate in the United States. Jindal\u2019s one-liners may have been new to many in the crowd, but most of his speech was recycled from past appearances and resembled an address he delivered earlier this month at an American Principles Project event. Jindal also took the opportunity to knock Obama on remarks he made earlier this month at the National Prayer Breakfast. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my eye out for the medieval Christians,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go out and win the war against radical Islam.\u201d When taking questions, Jindal emphasized the time he\u2019s spent in the last year putting out policy papers through his policy organization, America Next, noting that he\u2019s staked out positions on everything from energy independence to alternatives to Obamacare and Common Core. 5:25 p.m. \u2013 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker offered a blistering critique of President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of the threat of \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d on Thursday \u2013 but little substance on how he\u2019d address the challenge himself. \u201cWe need a president, a leader, who will stand up and say, we will take the fight to them and not wait until they bring the fight to America\u2019s soil, to our children and our grandchildren,\u201d Walker said. Later, in a short opening speech, he added: \u201cWe need to show the world that in America, you have no better ally and no greater enemy. In America, we will stand up for what is right and stand against what is wrong.\u201d Asked by an audience member about how he\u2019d deal with the threat of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Walker responded that he gets FBI threat briefings from his adjutant general and that \u201cwithout divulging confidential information,\u201d he\u2019s been concerned about the group for years. But he didn\u2019t offer a specific answer to how he\u2019d take on the group, instead pivoting back to his experience in Wisconsin. \u201cIf I can take on 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,\u201d he said. It was a reference to Walker\u2019s fight against labor unions in Wisconsin, where his move to strip public employees\u2019 collective bargaining rights caused months of protests, forced him to survive a recall election, and turned him into a rock star on the right. Those fights were Walker\u2019s comfort zone. He touted Republican efforts in Wisconsin to block government dollars from going to Planned Parenthood, to require photo IDs to vote, and to reduce regulations. He also pointed to a new GOP push to enact union-busting right-to-work legislation there. In making his pitch, Walker showcased the no-compromise rhetoric that has made him a conservative favorite. \u201cWe won in Wisconsin a state that hasn\u2019t gone Republican for president since 1984. \u2026 We did it without compromising,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stood up and said what we were gonna do, and then we did it.\u201d - Eric Bradner, CNN 4:55 PM \u2013 After he joined the 2012 presidential race, a brash Rick Perry quickly laid down a marker when asked how he differed from George W. Bush, another Texan who made it to the White House. \u201cI went to Texas A&M,\u201d Perry told reporters as he strolled confidently through the Iowa State Fair in late summer 2011. \u201cHe went to Yale.\u201d Perry was drawing an unmistakable cultural contrast and making no secret about his frosty relationship with the Bush family. Today, with Perry and another Bush \u2014 Jeb \u2014 both looking at the presidency in 2016, the recently-departed Texas governor is this time staying away from direct attacks on the GOP\u2019s most famous family. Asked if the country has an appetite for a third Bush presidency, Perry passed on needling the former Florida governor. \u201cReally I think the country has an appetite to get the country back working,\u201d he told CNN as he walked through the crowded hallways of CPAC on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t think the country cares what state they\u2019re from.\u201d Asked again about his relationship with the Bushes, Perry again punted. \u201cI don\u2019t think the country cares about anything other than who is going to get this country back working again, and who is going to have a foreign policy that is cogent, where are allies know who is going to be there for them, and when people who aren\u2019t our friends cross red lines, there is a consequence,\u201d Perry responded.  \u201cThey could care less what state they\u2019re from.\u201d \u2013 Peter Hamby, CNN 4:40 p.m. - Shortly after Carly Fiorina wrapped her speech to CPAC, where she repeatedly attacked former secretary of state Hillary Clinton\u2019s record on foreign policy issues, a pro-Clinton rapid response political organization reminded reporters of a time when the former Hewlett-Packard executive spoke at the Clinton family\u2019s flagship organization. \u201c#TBT that time @CarlyFiorina spoke at the Clinton Global Initiative. #CPAC2015,\u201d the group Correct the Record tweeted on Thursday afternoon, a reference to the Throwback Thursday ritual of recalling times gone by on the social media outlet. The group also included a link to a press release including details of the May 2013 event, which was billed as an event gathering top CEOs and government officials on \u201cboosting the economy.\u201d \u201cI think on balance it\u2019s a positive thing, actually,\u201d Fiorina says of the foundation in 2013. She added in an interview with Jake Tapper that \u201cthe Clinton Global Initiative does a lot of good work around the world,\u201d but says that the group\u2019s corporate ties will likely cause HRC problems if she runs. When asked about the Clinton critique, a spokeswoman for Fiorina turned the query back on the former first lady. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple question: can they name a single accomplishment from her time as Secretary of State? They\u2019ve been asked many times. I have yet to see an answer,\u201d Sarah Isgur Flores said in an emailed statement. -Jedd Rosche and Dan Merica, CNN 2:15 p.m. - Sen. Ted Cruz is hoping his kind of conservatism could \u201cbring back the miracle that is America.\u201d \u201cAmerica is in jeopardy and we are met totday in a great battlefield. The men and women  who are gathered here today are gathered to fight for freedom in our country,\u201d Cruz told his CPAC audience Thursday. Cruz, who has often set himself up at odds with the Republican leadership in Congress, said voters will need to \u201cdifferentiate\u201d between true conservatives and, essentially, posers. No one will say \u201c\u2018I\u2019m a squishy moderate that stands for nothing,\u2019\u201d Cruz joked before quoting Scripture: \u201cYou shall know them by their fruits.\u201d \u201cDemand action, not talk,\u201d Cruz urged the audience of activists. \u201cIf a candidate tells you they oppose the debt and debt ceiling that are crushing our kids. Terrific. What if you stood up and fought against it.\u201d As he has in past speeches, Cruz rallied the crowd by painting a stark contrast between Washington and what \u201cthe people want\u201d and used it as an opportunity to take a shot at former former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom he said embodies Washington. Cruz\u2019s speech was also full of one-liners slamming Obama and his healthcare law and attacks against Democrats, some of whom plan to boycott Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress next week. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single Democrat here. It\u2019s almost like CPAC invited Benjamin Netanyahu to speak,\u201d Cruz joked. Cruz also likened himself to the car service app Uber: \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do more than anything else is bring a disruptive app to politics.\u201d And in a lighting round with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Cruz gave his top priorities for his first day in office if he were to be elected president, which included abolishing the IRS, repealing Obamacare and defending \u201cour constitutional rights.\u201d -Jeremy Diamond, CNN 1:45 p.m. \u2013 Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive who could be the only woman to enter the Republican race, took a series of shots at Hillary Clinton \u2013 who she challenged to \u201cplease name an accomplishment.\u201d \u201cLike Mrs. Clinton, I too have traveled the globe. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know that flying is an activity, not an accomplishment,\u201d she said. Fiorina lambasted Clinton\u2019s handling of the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya, and her \u201cconflict of interest\u201d when the Clinton Foundation reportedly accepted gifts from foreign governments during her tenure as President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state. \u201cShe tweets about women\u2019s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights. She tweets about equal pay for women but will not answer basic questions about her own offices\u2019 pay standards \u2013 and neither will our President,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cHillary may like hashtags. But she doesn\u2019t know what leadership means.\u201d Fiorina also name-dropped the woman many liberals hope will challenge Clinton in the Democratic primary: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She channeled Warren\u2019s populist appeal, saying she\u2019d diagnosed similar problems but had a dramatically different take on the solutions. \u201cElizabeth Warren is right: crony capitalism is alive and well,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cGovernment and government programs have grown so big, so powerful, so costly and so complex that only the big and the powerful can prosper. But Elizabeth Warren is dead wrong about how to end crony capitalism. You see, whether it is Dodd-Frank, Obamacare or net neutrality, all this government complexity means the big get bigger, the small disappear, and the powerless are trapped.\u201d \u2013 Eric Bradner, CNN Related: Fiorina\u2019s HP legacy looms over potential White House bid Related: Chances of Fiorina White House bid \u2018way over 50%\u201d 1:00 p.m. - Gov. Chris Christie sought to defend his brash style and counter narratives that he\u2019s being outrun by Jeb Bush, saying it\u2019s too early to make sweeping predictions. The New Jersey Republican sat on stage with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, where he dropped a round of anti-media digs \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m giving up the New York Times for Lent\u201d \u2014 to counter recent narratives about a slowed momentum for the potential Christie campaign. \u201cIs the election next week?\u201d he asked, when pressed on his low standing in 2016 polls. \u201cIf I decide to run for president, I\u2019m not worried what polls say 21 months before\u201d the election. Asked how he\u2019ll manage to outperform Bush, who\u2019s tapping into his family\u2019s vast network to collect a massive fundraising haul, Christie said \u201cif the elites in Washington who make backroom deals\u201d decide the nominee, then Bush would be the frontrunner. But, he argued, he\u2019ll  \u201cdo OK\u201d if that decision is left up to the people. He also said that Bush\u2019s previous proposal about repopulating Detroit with immigrants was \u201cmisrepresenting the priorities\u201d and said he would focus more on the people already living in the city. Christie, as he\u2019s been doing in early voting states lately, embraced his \u201cJersey guy\u201d persona, saying people like to hear a direct, blunt politician. \u201cSometimes people need to be told to sit down and shut up,\u201d he said, defending his outburst against a heckler in the fall. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough Related: Christie answers questions after rocky month Related: Christie shoots for new political winds with pension proposal 9:00 A.M.: Ben Carson took the stage earlier than scheduled, but still found a packed auditorium and enthusiastic audience for a relatively subdued speech that unfolded like a laundry list of his policy priorities. Carson urged listeners, \u201clet\u2019s not turn our backs on Israel,\u201d said Congress should offer an alternative to Obamacare before they repeal it, and defended conservatives\u2019 opposition to same-sex marriage. It was a departure from last year\u2019s speech, during which he railed with fiery rhetoric against the \u201cP.C. police.\u201d \u201cWe need to move in a very different direction,\u201d Carson said, calling for the nation to move away from big government programs. He also, during the question-and-answer portion of his appearance, said the government should have a \u201csafety net\u201d to support those in need, but should eliminate programs that cause \u201cdependency.\u201d And he said that home-schoolers, in his estimation, perform better than public school educated students. \u2013 Alexandra Jaffe, CNN Carson is one of the more interesting newcomers on the national political stage. An African American in a party desparate to make inroads with minorities, Carson is also a neurosurgeon without the burden of a political background. He has become a favorite in the conservative media. He\u2019s also the only potential 2016 candidate to have a movie made about his medical career. Cuba Gooding, Jr., played Carson. But as a fierce critic of Obamacare, Carson has also waded into controversy. He once compared the health care law to slavery and drawn parallels between the U.S. and Nazi Germany. CNN\u2019s Mark Preston made this short bio video with our digital video team earlier this year: Carson debated Wolf Blitzer about that Nazi Germany comment back in December: Meanwhile, out in the halls of the conference, some of the more interesting characters of the conservative movement had on their American flag pants: Carson suggests stripping the president of his golf game: Packed room listening to Ben Carson.

CNN\u2019s \u2018Inside Politics\u2019 host and chief national correspondent John King took to Facebook Thursday afternoon, answering your questions about CPAC and Republican hopefuls Scott Walker and Jeb Bush. King also fielded questions surrounding Hillary Clinton, the possibility of a third-party candidate and the debate about the United States\u2019 role abroad. Here are some of the highlights from the chat. You can see more of his answers on the CNN Politics Facebook page. Note: Spelling has been corrected from the original posts. David Williams: John, my top 3 most likely to win are Bush, Walker, and Paul. Which one of those three do you think would most likely win the straw poll? John King: Great question, David. The Paul family has a good track record at CPAC straw polls. I\u2019m interested this year to see if the Walker momentum of late carries over to this event. What an interesting range of GOP potential candidates \u2013 just in past couple hours Dr. Carson, Governor Christie and Ted Cruz, among others, very well received. Mark Leon House: Have you noticed that the 2016 conventions are identical to the 1936 conventions. With that being said, do you think Democrats will have the same advantage as they did in 1936 or do you think that Republicans will make gains on their 2014 midterm victories? John King: Wow Mark \u2013 I hadn\u2019t gone back that far! where conventions are held is less and less an issue in the TV age, I think, but there are obvious reasons the GOP chose Ohio \u2013 so hard to win without it \u2013 and the DEMS chose PA \u2013 some HRC family ties and fits with their \u201cmiddle class\u201d political focus \u2026.the presidential versus midterm analysis is one of the most fascinating questions in today\u2019s politics. President Obama won two convincing wins with presidential turnout - and it is impossible not to conclude the GOP\u2019s problems with non white voters are a big factor. Yet look at the ruby red midterm years \u2013 and the overall gains of the GOP at the House, Senate, Governors and state legislative level the past six years. Almost two Americas. Democrats are counting on 2016 to bring back the demographic edge. We shall see. Greg Chapin: Hi John- Former Secretary of State Clinton seems to be headed toward a coronation by Democrats. Even popular (if not populist) Democrat Elizabeth Warren is saying that she\u2019s not running. Given the disarray in the GOP - is it possible that Secretary Clinton WON\u2019T run? Is she almost OBLIGATED to at this point? What are the odds that Secretary Clinton DOESN\u2019T run - and what happens to the Democrat party if she DOESN\u201dT run - or worse yet- doesn\u2019t do well In Iowa, NH or SC? Thanks! John King: Hey Greg \u2014 she sure sounds like a candidate and is asking people to leave serious jobs elsewhere to join her operation. So it would be a slap to them and yes, at this point, a serious\u2026 John King: excuse me \u2013 hit enter too soon \u2014 would be a serious blow to the Democratic Party if she didn\u2019t run. but let\u2019s await her final decision in the next month or three. But assume she is running \u2013 and my business should treat her as a candidate \u2026 from exploring what she says about issues/her past record/the Foundation $$$$ activity and so on and so forth. Greg Chapin: Funny- happens to me all the time too. Thanks for your reply. Christopher Ryan: Ok some high heat - Will there be a serious third party challenge for the presidency ? With marijuana being legalized in four states and more to follow in the next couple years - which candidate is the pro-pot candidate? John King: Hi Christopher \u2013 the climate sure is there for a third party candidate. Just look at the unhappiness with both parties and DC disfunction. But who? Bloomberg studied it hard a few years back and decided against it. Americans Elect explored the idea more recently and didn\u2019t come up with a credible candidate. Libertarian views have grown in their appeal in many ways in recent years \u2013 but the party on the presidential ballot hasn\u2019t risen to what i think most would agree is the bar for a serious threat to win or significantly influence the race. The Kansas Senate race this past year will be looked at by anyone thinking of trying this at the presidential level. it is very very very very expensive - and i could have used a few more \u201cverys\u201d the great advantage of the two parties is the existing infrastructure/ballot access, etc. Eric Himmelheber: Who do you think would beat out, say Hilary, for President and best represent the Republican Party? Rand seems to be slamming her more than any other Republican candidate. John King: Hi Eric, Senator Paul I agree has been most frequent direct critic of Secretary Clinton for sometime. Given recent events - immigration debate, ISIS, etc - President Obama is again the more frequent target of GOP criticism. But Senator Cruz and Carly Florina took after HRC pretty aggressively at CPAC today. Who would be best? too early i think to answer that. Some argue Governor Bush because of Florida. Those who believe GOP turnout slumped because Senator McCain or Governor Romney were too moderate want a more consistent conservative. This will be part of the debate among and between the GOP contenders \u2013 issues/demography/electability \u2026 shapes up as a good race between a big group with a diverse mix of experience and background. Imbuwa Kalimukwa: Mr King, do you think Scott Walker is being honest when he says he doesn\u2019t know if Pres. Obama is a Christian? John King: Hello Imbuwa, the Governor says he has never spoken to the President about this and therefore he doesn\u2019t personally know. to him, this was more about the media asking questions he views as counterproductive or \u201cgotcha.\u201d David Futral: What would it take for Scott Walker to overcome Jeb Bush to win the Republican nomination? John King Hi David, Can Walker win WI in a presidential? Don\u2019t know but you can be certain his success there will be part of his electability pitch in the GOP primaries. What would it take to overcome Bush? Well you see his recent momentum in the polls. Bush wants to be the seasoned, tested guy and make the case he can win FL and do better with Latinos. Walker will argue country wants a next generation leader, and he will make the case in primaries he is more proven than bush on the conservative tests of recent years. they will have eight or 10 other competitors in the ring. It\u2019s a deep GOP field. Should be interesting. Rusure Boutthat: Any predictions on who the top two Republican candidates will be? John King not a clue, Rusure. A big interesting field of prospects. Bush has early $$ edge; Walker getting early conservative buzz. But at this point in \u201907 it looked like Rudy vs Hillary - remember? so it is fascinating early but a long way to go. Rusure Boutthat: One more question: How much of a role will foreign policy play vs. domestic issues in 2016? John King hard to say now what the ratio/balance will be. presidential elections are always shaped by the economic times, and leadership/trust questions. no question though the ISIS challenge, tensions in Israel-U.S. relations, Iran, Putin, China challenge and more will make foreign policy a big \u201916 issue. Jennifer Bond: Given how close the votes have been ranging from congressional positions, gubernatorial, and state/local races this last election cycle. Would you say the two defining things that would affect the Presidential race would be the President\u2019s/Democrats handling of ISIS, and voter turn out? John King: Great question, Jennifer. ISIS without a doubt will be a central 2016 question. turnout in the post-Obama years also a huge question. the state of the economy always shapes presidential years. Timothy Francis: How do freedom loving people defeat ISIS? John King Timothy you pose one of the defining questions of our time. And there is about to be a rich debate in the Congress over the authorization of force. A ton of political debate and disagreement about this. One striking thing to me is the way public opinion \u2013 in a country tired after long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - has shifted dramatically in favor of taking this as a very serious threat and wanting our leaders to take necessary steps to combat and counter ISIS. Cj Farris: Hi John, Let\u2019s just assume it is Clinton for the Democrats in 2016. What do you think her chances are on winning the traditional swing states? John King Hi CJ, well that is THE question isn\u2019t it. if you look at the last six presidential elections - Democrats have carried 18 states with a combined 240 electoral votes. this so-called \u201cblue wall\u201d if unchanged would leave the Democratic nominee just 30 EV shy of winning. Florida alone would do it. So Republicans have to change that \u201cwall\u201d and the math to win. Does HRC automatically get those 18 - of course not. But Republicans have some work to do to improve their presidential performance. History says after a two term president the other party almost always wins. Democrats think they have a demographic advantage. We will see in the not too distant future. Timothy Olubusoye: Why is no one saying anything about Paul Ryan he was considered a major contender hopeful after the unsuccessful run with Governor Romney in 2016? John King Hi Timothy, Chairman Ryan says he won\u2019t run for President in 2016 \u2013 so he is out of that group. But his Ways and Means Committee is central to questions of taxes and spending and other big economic challenges so he will be front and center in the big debates of the next two years and beyond. A big question is how long he decides he wants to stay in Washington. Not too long, he says. But we aren\u2019t sure exactly what that means yet.",

            "article_content": "British euro-skeptic firebrand Nigel Farage touted his \u201crevolution\u201d against political elites and warned against mass immigration as shared the spotlight with the Republican Party\u2019s top presidential hopefuls on Thursday. Farage, whose UK Independence Party is tipped to eat into the vote of Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives in the UK general election in May, also slammed the \u201ccowardly\u201d politics of multiculturalism before an appreciative audience of grass roots conservatives outside Washington. READ: Conservatives party like it\u2019s 2016 \u201cI am here today as the leader of an insurgent political force in the United Kingdom \u2013 a force that has taken on the political establishment and rocked them to the backs of their heels,\u201d Farage declared at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Farage drew parallels between his own populist message and that of the conservative base vote in the Republican Party. He said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cmeddle\u201d in American politics, but said the GOP needed to win back the blue collar voters that became known as \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d in the 1980s if it is to win the White House back in 2016. \u201cUKIP began to achieve success because the issues that we were talking about were the very issues that our political elite refused to discuss and the very issues that our so-called liberal media said should not be discussed in polite company,\u201d Farage said. Many of the conservatives in the audience view plans to reform the U.S. immigration system and to bring undocumented workers out of the shadows as akin to amnesty and applauded Farage\u2019s remarks. The UKIP leader complains that Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants, many from impoverished Eastern Europe, into his \u201csmall island\u201d nation. Farage was the last speaker of a long day at CPAC, but still drew a curious and healthy crowd, which had earlier cheered conservative hero Sarah Palin and heard speeches by possible GOP presidential candidates Chris Christie, Scott Walker and Bobby Jindal. Last year, in a backlash against the EU, UKIP caused a political earthquake and won elections to the European parliament in Britain, and some commentators have likened its impact on UK politics to that of the Tea Party in the United States. It is unclear how UKIP will perform in the UK general election on May 7, as some of its supporters were seen as casting protest votes last year and could return to the established Conservative and Labour parties when more is at stake. But Farage, who has cultivated a image as a blunt talker and is often pictured with a pint of beer in his hand, has persuaded several Conservative members of parliament to join his party already, and could be a spoiler for Cameron come election day.",

            "article_content": "Conservative Republicans, bullish on their prospects in 2016, are gathered at their vast annual conference to road test the long list of potential candidates promising to win them back the White House. Virtually every potential Republican hopeful is making their case at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a massive gathering on the banks of the Potomac River in Maryland. The three-day political jamboree is featuring high-profile appearances from Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, along with other candidates struggling to get into the top tier. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, seeking to shore up his support among conservative grass-roots activists, was one of the first powerful political figures to appear, and immediately rejected the idea that his 2016 prospects are already waning. \u201cIs the election next week? I am not worried about what polls say 21 months before we elect the President of the United States,\u201d Christie said, dismissing polls that show him well behind in key battleground states in the fight for the Republican nomination. Christie, who has been slowed by political troubles in New Jersey and Jeb Bush\u2019s quick consolidation of the establishment path to the Republican ticket, took a veiled shot at the former Florida governor. \u201cIf the elites in Washington, who do backroom deals, get to decide who runs, then he is definitely going to be a frontrunner,\u201d Christie said, in a question and answer session. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is already beloved among conservative activists, paced the stage like a preacher, and joked that the vast auditorium was so lacking in Democrats that it was as though Benjamin Netanyahu had been invited to speak, in a jab at the Obama administration over its opposition to the Israeli leader\u2019s speech in Congress next week on a proposed Iran nuclear deal. \u201cAmerica is in jeopardy and we are met today on a great battlefield,\u201d Cruz declared. \u201cWashington wants Obamacare but the people want liberty. Washington wants amnesty, but the people want the rule of law.\u201d With the end of the Obama era in sight, grass roots activists at CPAC are bullish. \u201cI think the way most of us are approaching this is, there is going to be a Republican president. It is just a question of who it is going to be,\u201d said Daniel Ruoss, chairman of the Florida Federation of Young Republicans. The gathering comes at a crucial moment for Republicans. Walker, the Wisconsin governor, is rocketing to the top of some polls but must show he can maintain the momentum after some recent stumbles.He was due to speak later on Thursday.  Bush could demonstrate his level of commitment to conservatives wary of him in his speech on Friday and Rubio and others will vie for an opportunity to break into the top tier. READ: Walker leads in early Iowa poll And the whole show will play out as conservatives in Congress press GOP leaders to stand firm and allow the Department of Homeland Security to run out of money on Friday unless President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration orders are repealed. CPAC is a riotous yearly festival of unfiltered right wing ideology and liberal bashing, featuring rock star conservative radio hosts and provocateurs, all paying homage to the memory of Ronald Reagan, the movement\u2019s hero. It was the place where the typically staid Mitch McConnell waved a musket over his head, Sarah Palin assailed the \u201cnanny state\u201d by guzzling on a Super Big Gulp soda and Dick Cheney told libertarian hecklers to \u201csit down and shut up\u201d after they branded him a war criminal. But this year\u2019s party atmosphere will hide a serious mission \u2013 finding a president and schooling young activists in the techniques of micro-targeting and grass roots activism that helped Obama win twice. Key conservative leaders believe that after a turbulent period of internal division, the movement is well positioned. \u201cConservatives that I talk to around the country, they are ready to win,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, chairman of CPAC host, the American Conservative Union. Watching Obama appoint hundreds of federal judges, two Supreme Court justices and dictate a foreign policy Republicans see as feckless has \u201csobered up conservatives,\u201d he said. READ: This state could give the GOP big headaches in 2016 But conversations with grass roots conservatives and talk radio monologues often come back, sooner or later, to a latent fear \u2013 that the GOP establishment, prioritizing electability over political purity, will foist a centrist candidate upon conservatives that they cannot embrace. Many conservatives had trouble backing John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 and are desperate to avoid a repeat. \u201cThere are certainly a lot of reasons to be optimistic as we look towards 2016,\u201d said Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group. But Holler warned many that Tea Party momentum must not be squandered by another establishment nominee. That\u2019s where Bush comes in. The former Florida governor has already said that he is willing to lose \u201cthe primary to win the general\u201d election, prompting some conservatives to suspect he is mulling a centrist 2016 campaign to woo moderate voters. He\u2019s already alienated some grass roots activists because of his support for Common Core education standards and immigration reform. Polls also show Bush has work to do with the primary electorate. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday showed Bush 15 points down to Walker among likely caucus goers in Iowa, a state where social and evangelical conservatives play a key role. Bush also has a family problem with conservatives. The movement never warmed to his father, George H.W. Bush, while his brother, George W. Bush, lost their support with his record on spending. While Jeb Bush has lined up big donor backing, laid out a hawkish foreign policy and effectively pushed Romney from launching another race, he has yet to make a true play for conservatives. There\u2019s no better place to do that than CPAC. \u201cI am going to be very curious to see how Jeb Bush performs,\u201d said Ned Ryun, founder of American Majority, a new conservative grass roots organization. \u201cHe has the potential to win some people over, but I do think there are going to be some skeptics in the crowd.\u201d Walker is a mirror image of Bush at CPAC. He already has the instinctive trust of conservatives after winning two gubernatorial elections in a Democratic leaning state and beating a recall. But he must show he is up to the scrutiny of being a top tier candidate and show his involvement in recent disputes over whether Obama is a Christian or loves his country does not mean he is prone to stumble into political sideshows. Walker said his speech will show he is both a new voice and a tested leader. \u201cPeople in American want a fresh face, they want big, bold ideas from outside Washington and they want someone who has got a proven track record,\u201d he told Greta Van Susteren on Fox News on Tuesday. Other candidates hope to spring a surprise, including Rubio, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Carly Fiorina. Perhaps CPAC will be the place where Chris Christie gets his wobbling pre-campaign back on track, or where former Texas Gov. Perry turns it around after his disastrous 2012 primary run. \u201cI  do think is somebody going to step up to the plate and insert themselves in the conversation, which has almost become a Walker-Bush conversation,\u201d said Ryun. The immediate impact of those efforts could register as soon as Saturday afternoon in the annual CPAC Straw Poll. Though it\u2019s more of a popularity contest than a true reflection of presidential viability, it does offer a quick snapshot of the sentiment of the conservative movement. Rand Paul is tipped to make it a hat trick of straw poll wins by flexing his organizational skills. But the last Republican to win the straw poll and reach the White House was George W. Bush in 2000 \u2013 so it\u2019s hardly a reliable predictor of the next president. CPAC also offers a chance for more marginal potential candidates to take a run in the spotlight. Former business executive Carly Fiorina, who wants to bring gender diversity to the Republican race, took the chance to slam Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton over reports that her family\u2019s foundation had infringed rules on foreign donations established when she was secretary of state. \u201cShe tweets about equal pay for women but won\u2019t answer basic questions about her own offices\u2019 pay standards\u2014and neither will our President. Hillary likes hashtags. But she doesn\u2019t know what leadership means,\u201d Fiorina told activists.",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s push to move past the battle over funding the Department of Homeland Security could put several fellow Republicans in a tough spot. McConnnell, a Kentucky Republican, could soon hold a vote on legislation that would keep the agency open without targeting President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration orders loathed by the GOP. (A separate vote would give Republicans a chance to go on record opposing the orders.) The move has infuriated House conservatives who are urging their Senate counterparts to stand firm. And it means that GOP senators up for re-election next year in Democratic-leaning states will have a decision to make: Risk a primary challenge and support McConnell\u2019s position or open themselves up to general election accusations that they shut down an agency vital to national security. Here\u2019s what six of the Republicans facing the toughest re-election races in 2016 are saying: Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-New Hampshire): She will back McConnell\u2019s plan to pass a \u201cclean\u201d DHS funding bill, arguing the battle can be fought in court. A federal judge in Texas has already temporarily blocked Obama\u2019s orders from taking effect. \u201cIn light of the court injunction \u2013 which prevents the administration from carrying out the president\u2019s executive action \u2013 I will support legislation that would fully fund homeland security operations for the rest of the fiscal year,\u201d Ayotte said in a statement. :I will also vote in favor of a separate measure that would defund the president\u2019s 2014 executive action, and I support further challenging his illegal actions through the court system.\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin): He\u2019s repeatedly pinned the blame on Democrats for failing to allow a House-passed bill that attacked Obama\u2019s immigration actions from moving forward. But he indicated he\u2019d back McConnell\u2019s plan. These are some tough times. It looks like we are going to start getting some progress from our Democratic colleagues here,\u201d he said. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Illinois): The typically-moderate Kirk has been among the strongest Republican backers of McConnell\u2019s move to separate DHS funding from the immigration issue. \u201cAs a governing party, we\u2019ve got to fund DHS and say to the House, \u2018Here\u2019s a straw so you can suck it up,\u201d he said Thursday. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): He said House Republicans need to understand the procedural differences between the two chambers. \u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect between what people want to do and what we can do, given the procedural situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very upset at what the president did and, you know, I totally get where the House is coming from on that. And the question is: How do we effectively stop him? \u2026 We have to get 60 votes, so we have to rely on six Democrats. And they don\u2019t have to deal with that [in the House].\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): Rubio\u2019s in an especially complicated spot, because he\u2019s also considering a run for the party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination \u2013 where conservative electorates in early-voting states like Iowa are already leery of his departure from orthodoxy on immigration reform. Early this month, Rubio appeared to have moved toward supporting a \u201cclean\u201d DHS bill, telling a Las Vegas crowd that \u201cwe can\u2019t let Homeland Security shut down.\u201d But this week, he backed off those remarks, saying in New Hampshire: \u201cI don\u2019t believe we should pass a clean DHS bill. It\u2019s very difficult to pass anything now because of the Democrats. They won\u2019t let us get to 60 votes.\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.): The former head of the hard-line Club for Growth said he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d by the Texas judge\u2019s ruling against Obama\u2019s immigration actions, and that he\u2019d support the \u201cclean\u201d DHS funding bill.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama called out Republicans in Congress for \u201cholding hostage\u201d funding for the Department of Homeland Security, while challenging Americans to change the political environment that has caused immigration reform to stall during a town hall meeting on Wednesday. The agency in charge of implementing immigration policy, among other duties, is scheduled to run out of funding Friday if the GOP-controlled Congress can\u2019t agree to a funding bill. READ: DHS impasse down to the wire in Congress Judge blocks Obama's order on immigration \u201cInstead of trying to hold hostage funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which is so important for our national security, fund that and let\u2019s get on with actually passing comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Obama said at the event, aired on Telemundo and MSNBC, and hosted by Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart, an anchor on both channels. The meeting was announced in the days following a ruling last week from a federal district court judge that temporarily blocked Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.The White House said it was a chance for the President to reach the Hispanic community, taking questions from online and members of the audience. During the event, the President called on voters to make immigration reform a successful social movement \u2013 and a key issue in the next presidential election. \u201cEvery major social movement, every bit of progress in this country, whether it\u2019s been the workers\u2019 rights movement or the civil rights movement or the women\u2019s rights movement, every single bit of that progress had required us to fight and to push and you make progress,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get everything right away, and then you push some more.\u201d The President also defended the legality of his executive action, but said that passing comprehensive reform in Congress should be the end goal. When asked about the failure of Congress to pass legislation he laid the blame squarely on the GOP. \u201cYou do a disservice when you suggest that no one was doing anything, then you don\u2019t know who was fighting for and against you,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe Democratic Party has been consistent. A few Republicans have supported it but let\u2019s be clear the reason why we don\u2019t have a bill is because [House Speaker] John Boehner wouldn\u2019t call a vote.\u201d Obama offered praise for 2016 Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush. \u201cI appreciate Mr. Bush being concerned about immigration reform,\u201d he said. \u201cI would suggest that what he do is talk to the speaker of the House and the members of his party.\u201d One question for Obama came from a young veteran, Eric Narvaez, who said he was medically discharged from the military after fighting in Afghanistan. \u201cI come back home and only to find out that I\u2019m fighting another war with my mother, tryin\u2019 to keep her here,\u201d he said. Obama told him he was confident the veteran\u2019s mother would qualify for the executive action program that the judge has blocked. The question illustrated the personal nature of the event, with many of the questions coming from people whose lives would be deeply affected by the executive actions Obama has championed. The White House has repeatedly said it has the authority to utilize \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d when deporting undocumented immigrants, focusing law enforcement efforts on those who represent a danger to society. When asked about Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who don\u2019t adhere to this policy, Obama said there would be consequences for those who don\u2019t follow orders. But the event also showed the complex nature of the issue and much of the President\u2019s time was spent explaining the limits of his own power. \u201cIn order for us to get absolute certainty that it\u2019s gonna be permanent and not just temporary, that it doesn\u2019t just last during my administration and then get reversed by the next president, is we\u2019ve gotta pass a bill,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt means that, for the next set of presidential candidates \u2026 when they start asking for votes, the first question should be, \u2018Do you really intend to deport 11 million people?\u2019\u201d Obama told the audience, when it comes to voting, staying home is not an option. \u201cEverybody here and everybody watching also has responsibilities, and one of those responsibilities is voting for people who advocate on behalf of the things that you care about,\u201d he said. Looking ahead to 2016 and beyond, he called on young people in the audience to look to the future. \u201cAt some point there\u2019s gonna be a President Rodriguez or there\u2019s gonna be a President Chin,\u201d Obama said drawing applause. \u201cThe country is a nation of immigrants and ultimately it will reflect who we are and its politics will reflect who we are. And that\u2019s not something to be afraid of.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is known as the deal-maker on Capitol Hill, but the current logjam over funding the Department of Homeland Security has everyone wondering if he can prevent a shutdown. Congress returns on Monday with just four days before the deadline to pass legislation to keep DHS open. A stalemate between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill over President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration has stalled a funding bill for the agency. Without any serious negotiations or talk of a compromise, it\u2019s likely DHS will run out of money at midnight on Friday and the blame game will begin. READ: Homeland Security Secretary Johnson makes funding plea Both sides agree Homeland Security shouldn\u2019t be interrupted, but the GOP-controlled House passed a measure that funded he agency but also blocked the administration\u2019s immigration policies \u2013 something Senate Democrats won\u2019t support. Johnson: WH will appeal TX immigration ruling Congressional Republicans are trying to keep the focus on a key group of six to eight Senate Democrats who criticized the President\u2019s move last November to approve policies to allow 5 million undocumented immigrants to avoid deportations. On Friday, the White House spokesman pointed the finger squarely at the GOP. \u201cThe President believes that the Congress, particularly Republicans in Congress, who now have the majority in both the House and the Senate, should fulfill their responsibility to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security doesn\u2019t shut down at the end of this month,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. Congress has faced showdowns before \u2013 on government funding, on raising the nation\u2019s debt limit. The difference now is that nobody is talking; there is no evidence of any back channel negotiations or efforts to float a compromise that might give each side some kind of face saving measure to avoid a shutdown. McConnell will try a fourth time to start debate on the House bill on Monday, but the vote is expected to fail. The Kentucky GOP leader, who has earned a reputation as a savvy legislator, hasn\u2019t signaled whether he has a new strategy up his sleeve. The spotlight this week will remain on McConnell, who vowed when Republicans took control in 2015 there would be no more government shutdowns. But he\u2019s kept mum on how he\u2019ll keep that promise. Last week, a Texas federal judge temporarily suspended the President\u2019s immigration actions, a development some thought could provide an escape hatch for Republicans. With the court stopping the program from moving forward some thought the GOP might be more willing to approve the DHS funding as the legal battle played out in the courts. Homeland Sec.: 'New phase' of terror threat But the court\u2019s decision appears to have hardened the posture of conservative Republicans, who argue the court backed up their view that the President\u2019s actions were unconstitutional. \u201cWhy in the world would we move from that position?\u201d Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan asked CNN in a phone interview. Jordan heads a new group of House conservatives called the \u201cHouse Freedom Caucus.\u201d The roughly 35 members of that group held a conference call during last week\u2019s recess and Jordan reported the group was united in \u201cstanding firm.\u201d Members on the right say they remain committed to wage the fight against the administration\u2019s immigration policies on this spending bill. Republican leaders convinced members late last year that a possible pre-Christmas fight that threatened a shutdown wasn\u2019t the way they wanted to start out a new Congress. Instead they approved a spending bill for all government agencies for a year, but only approved short term money for DHS. These conservatives are holding House Speaker John Boehner to his pledge to fight \u201ctooth and nail.\u201d Any signal of backing down by the speaker would certainly trigger a backlash from many in his conference, as well as grassroots activists. In an interview on Fox last Sunday, Boehner said he was willing to allow DHS funding to lapse, and repeatedly argued it was up to Senate Democrats to act. Some House Republicans have told CNN they aren\u2019t convinced the legal route will ultimately block the President\u2019s immigration actions so they are resolved to keep moving forward on the legislative track. After the political damage Republicans suffered after a 16-day government shutdown in 2013, Democrats feel confident they can force the GOP to ultimately approve a bill without the immigration provisions. A CNN poll released last week found that a majority of Americans \u2013 53% \u2013 would blame Republicans on Capitol Hill if DHS ran out of money. SEE ALSO: Poll shows blame for DHS shutdown would fall to GOP Still McConnell and Boehner are united in their strategy to try to place the blame on Senate Democrats. Despite that multiple Democratic aides say their members are expected to stand together and insist that the GOP relent and pass a clean funding bill. \u201cEach time that they do the same thing over and over again the caucus gets more united,\u201d one senior Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN. GOP Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois and Jeff Flake of Arizona have both said it\u2019s time to approve the DHS money and deal with the immigration debate separately, and there are a small number of moderate GOP members in the House that say they could vote for a clean bill. But few believe Republican leaders would completely fold and allow a vote on a clean bill. It\u2019s possible that the Senate could opt to punt the debate for a few weeks or months, and take up a short term spending bill that would keep the agency funded. Republican leaders could point to the Texas court\u2019s ruling as effectively blocking the same policies they are trying to prevent in the DHS bill. New members of Congress Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson criticized the idea of just passing a stopgap bill. \u201cBeing on a continuing resolution is like driving across country on five gallons of gas at a time. And you don\u2019t know when the next gas station is,\u201d he said Thursday on CNN. If the agency funding falls short at the end of the week the majority of  DHS\u2019 employees \u2013 screeners at airports, security agents at the nation\u2019s borders, disaster response teams and secret service agents \u2013 would still have to report to work, but they will not get paid on time. For now, Republicans aren\u2019t worried about the political fallout of a shutdown. Even though most GOP members admit the 2013 government closing was bad for the party they say voters didn\u2019t penalize them at the ballot box in the midterm election.  The party won control of the Senate and expanded its majority in the House. Conservatives see this battle as more than one about immigration. They want to set a marker down that they will not accept Obama\u2019s efforts to circumvent the authority of the legislative branch. \u201cIf the President can in fact get away with this kind of action \u2013 this executive amnesty action \u2013 which so many people have said violates the separation of powers, what\u2019s next? Will this summer will he raise the debt ceiling without a vote of Congress?\u201d Jordan asked.",

Rubio later joked: \u201cIf what they wanted was a discount of the book we could have worked it out.\u201d The senator was speaking at Miami Dade College as part of a multi-state tour to promote his book, \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d as he works to build a national profile in preparation for a potential presidential bid. POLL: Huckabee, Clinton lead the pack But the hecklers highlighted the fact that what\u2019s perhaps one of his greatest advantages is also part of what\u2019s standing in his way to the White House: His leadership in passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the Senate in 2013 that was dead on arrival in the House, countered by heavy conservative opposition. Rubio\u2019s role in that legislative fight was initially seen as a possible crowning achievement for the rising GOP star, but ultimately crippled him with conservatives who saw him as too willing to compromise with Democrats for a bad bill. The Florida Republican has indeed been heckled before by members of the other party, over his efforts with that bill. During a 2013 Tea Party summit in Florida, Rubio was met with cries of \u201cNo amnesty!\u201d from the conservative crowd. Friday night, he encountered the opposite. \u201cWhat about my parents?\u201d one protester cried, per the Post, prompting others to join in. Another swore, for which Rubio apologized to the crowd. The issue is sure to be a sticking point for him in the Republican presidential primary, if he runs. But Rubio has been working to position himself as a pragmatic conservative alternative to others in the field, and taking a hardline stance on immigration reform could undo those efforts. If he decides instead to run for re-election to the Senate, he\u2019s a heavy favorite in the primary. Florida\u2019s purple tint during an election year, however, guarantees he\u2019ll have a huge target on his back from Democrats eager to pick up a seat.",

            "article_content": "Bush balances brother's Iraq war legacy and his political hopes Slams Obama on everything from ISIS to Cuba Few specifics in speech Jeb Bush revealed his strategy for dealing with the polarizing foreign policy legacy of his brother: Make a quick declaration of independence then pivot to a searing attack on the failings abroad of President Barack Obama. \u201cI love my father and my brother. I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make,\u201d Bush said Wednesday in Chicago during the first major foreign policy speech of his prospective Republican presidential campaign. \u201cBut I am my own man.\u201d Jeb wants to step out of the Bush family shadow The appearance offered Bush a chance to show how he will balance a desire not to dismiss George W. Bush\u2019s presidency while insulating himself from Democratic attempts to paint him as a clone of the man who led the nation into a bloody, prolonged era of foreign wars. Bush did concede that the previous Bush administration made \u201ca mistake\u201d by not providing security for Iraqis in the wake of the U.S. invasion in 2003. But he also argued that his brother\u2019s surge strategy forged political stability in Iraq that Obama squandered in his eagerness to get American troops home. It\u2019s too early to tell whether Bush\u2019s appearance answered the key question facing his campaign: Can a third man with the name \u201cBush\u201d win the presidency in a nation exhausted by war and suspicious of dynasties? But his message seemed clearly tailored towards the activist base of the Republican Party, which likes its foreign policy hawkish, and has significant doubts about Bush on issues including immigration reform and education which could hamper his chances of winning the primary race. Democrats quickly tried to stamp out any progress Bush had made with the wider electorate which he would ask to entrust him with U.S. national security if he becomes the GOP nominee. \u201cToday, Jeb Bush made his first foray into explaining and attempting to recast his foreign policy,\u201d said DNC spokeswoman Holly Shulman. \u201cBut despite Jeb Bush\u2019s claim that he will be his \u2018own man\u2019, there is little evidence that Jeb Bush\u2019s foreign policy agenda is much different than his brother\u2019s.\u201d Potential 2016 presidential candidates She added: \u201cEmbracing decisions that made the world more dangerous, and then trying to shift the blame \u2013 that\u2019s the Jeb Bush Doctrine.\u201d Bush is not the first presidential candidate forced to differentiate himself from a powerful predecessor in a desire to strike out on his own. Vice President Al Gore famously declared he was his \u201cown man\u201d as he tried to shuffle out of the shadow of Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment shame in 2000. Obama jabbed Hillary Clinton in 2008 over her famous husband\u2019s intervention in the campaign, saying he could not sometimes tell who he was running against. She responded: \u201cI\u2019m here. He\u2019s not.\u201d Bush is a more cerebral, cautious character than his brother and his speech lacked the bristling rhetoric of George W. Bush which Democrats often decried as a symptom of cowboy diplomacy. But the hawkish global vision he laid out sat squarely in the muscular foreign policy that has dominated the Republican Party since his brother went on the offensive following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush made a case that Obama was being misled by Iran on nuclear talks, said the president had been too soft on Russia, sided with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the row over his address to Congress and condemned the administration\u2019s opening to Cuba. He said Obama\u2019s failure to do a deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq created a \u201cvoid\u201d exploited by extremists. \u201cThis administration talks, but the words fade,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThey draw red lines, and then erase them. With grandiosity they announce resets and then disengage. Hashtag campaigns replace actual diplomacy and engagement.\u201d Bush offered few surprises. This was exactly the kind of speech a prospective GOP presidential candidate would be expected to make 21 months before a general election. Bush made a case that Obama\u2019s politics had tipped the world into chaos, played to the GOP\u2019s base and avoided unveiling new policies that could get ripped to shreds in the long months on the campaign trail. Despite the inclusion on list of foreign policy advisors released by his camp of Republican gurus James Baker and George Schultz, Bush had little in common with the subtle internationalism of his father George H.W. Bush. \u201cThe great irony of the Obama presidency is this, someone who came to office, promising greater engagement with the world has left America less influential in the world,\u201d Bush said. \u201cEverywhere you look, you see the world slipping out of control,\u201d Bush said, blaming Obama for the rise of ISIS, the breakdown of Iraq and Syria, Iranian dominance of the Middle East and and Russia\u2019s belligerence. \u201cUnder this administration, we are inconsistent and indecisive. We have lost the trust and confidence of our friends. We definitely no longer inspire fear in our enemies,\u201d Bush said, in a speech delivered at such a breakneck pace that he at one point confused Iran and Iraq. This was clearly an act of political positioning rather than an attempt to chart a meaningful foreign policy strategy. \u201cWe policy wonks like wonkish speeches and politicians like political speeches,\u201d said Justin Logan, head of the foreign policy program at the Cato Institute. \u201cThere was nothing very surprising about the speech. I think there would be nothing very surprising about President Jeb Bush\u2019s foreign policy. This was a do no harm speech.\u201d Bush did little to deviate from Republican foreign policy orthodoxy. He said a strong economy was crucial to U.S. national security, advocated increased military spending, rebuilt alliances with NATO members and in Asia and an effort to reengage with traditional U.S. friends in the Middle East like Egypt. While he repeatedly criticized Obama, he did not say if he would use military force against Iran if nuclear diplomacy failed or make a decisive intervention into the debate about whether to deploy ground troops to Syria to help fight ISIS. He did however advocate arming Ukraine. It was the kind of speech that every single Republican running for president is likely to give during the campaign \u2013 with the possible exception of the more isolationist Rand Paul. The goal seemed to be to show Bush could be trusted with national security but was not extreme. And it likely did little to scare off other possible Republican candidates \u2013 especially someone like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is positioning himself as a foreign policy expert. \u201cNobody is going to be running for eight more years of Obama foreign and defense policy,\u201d said James Jay Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cEverybody is going to sound like they are not a neo-con and not an isolationist. This would check the box of what you would expect a responsible speech to sound like.\u201d Bush argued that he had come by his foreign policy views in a grounding in global affairs that started when he lived overseas with his wife Columba in Venezuela. As governor, he said, he led multiple trade missions to Latin America and had visited Israeli five times. He said he had \u201cforced\u201d himself to visit Asia four times a year to experience the region\u2019s explosive growth \u2013 and complained that people he met said Obama\u2019s Asia \u201cpivot\u201d policy was all talk and no action. He ended his speech with a message to Republican isolationists and Obama\u2019s foreign policy backers. \u201cAmerica does not have the luxury of withdrawing from the world,\u201d Bush said.  \u201cOur security, and our prosperity, and our values demand that we remain engaged and involved in \u2013 often distant places,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no reason to apologize for our leadership, or our interest in serving the cause of global security, global peace, and human freedom. Nothing and no one can replace strong American leadership.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Republicans in Congress would shoulder the blame for a shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security if they are unable to enact a new spending bill to keep the agency running, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. The survey finds 53% of Americans would blame the Republicans in Congress if the department must shut down, while 30% would blame President Barack Obama. Another 13% say both deserve the blame. If a spending bill is not passed by Feb. 28, the agency\u2019s funding will run out. READ: Poll shows most disapprove of Obama handling of ISIS A majority says a shutdown at DHS, even if it\u2019s just for a few days, would be a crisis or a major problem. Republicans are less likely to see a shutdown as a big problem, 46% say so compared with 66% among Democrats. Among all adults, slightly fewer see a DHS shutdown as a problem or crisis than said so in November when asked about a possible shutdown of the whole government, 55% now vs. 59% in that poll. As in November, this shutdown threat has more to do with immigration policy than with budgetary concerns. House Republicans have been sparring with their Senate counterparts over whether a bill to continue the agency\u2019s funding should also reverse Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, which shielded millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. The House has already passed a bill to fund DHS which includes a provision to undo Obama\u2019s actions, but Senate Democrats have blocked attempts to bring the bill to a vote and some Senate Republicans have spoken out against dealing with both issues in one bill. The impasse could threaten what little goodwill the new GOP-controlled Congress has gained with the public since their election last fall. The poll finds 21% approve of how Congress is handling its job, up from 13% before the election and the highest rating in CNN/ORC polling since January 2013. But the issue at the center of the standoff, immigration, divides the country. The poll finds a near even split on how the U.S. government should handle illegal immigration. Overall, 49% say U.S. government should focus more on developing a plan to allow those here illegally who have jobs to become legal residents, while the same share says the focus should instead be on developing a plan to stop the flow of illegal immigration and deport those already here. And Obama\u2019s steps to allow some immigrants in the U.S. illegally to stay haven\u2019t improved his approval ratings on the matter. Since the last shutdown threat, the public has soured on Obama\u2019s handling of illegal immigration, with 59% disapproving in the new poll, up from 53% in November. The survey, conducted February 12-15, included interviews with 1,027 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "David Axelrod, President Barack Obama\u2019s former top political adviser, said the President appears to be having \u201cthe time of his life right now\u201d as he\u2019s enjoying his new-found freedom without the political constraints of an impending election. \u201cHe\u2019s having the time of his life right now. I think he feels very much unrestrained in terms of speaking to all these issues,\u201d Axelrod said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Wednesday. READ: Keystone XL bill heads to Obama, veto expected Obama has indeed drawn notice for his newly relaxed and frank posture and comments, now that he\u2019s nearing the end of his presidency. During his State of the Union address, Obama tossed a couple of zingers at Republicans, the likes of which had been absent in previous years. Axelrod also defended comments in his book that Obama misrepresented his position on gay marriage for political expediency, which Obama attempted to refute in an interview with BuzzFeed this week. \u201cThis is not uncommon in history, great leaders often work in that way,\u201d Axelrod said, \u201cHe had a goal and he worked his way to that goal.\u201d Axelrod also offered advice for former secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her likely second run for president, based on his experience challenging her for the Democratic nomination as Obama\u2019s chief strategist in 2008. In 2007, he said, he saw her as \u201ca poor candidate because she was so cautious, shrouded in this veil of inevitability.\u201d \u201cOnce she lost the Iowa caucuses, she became a different candidate, much less guarded, much more willing to connect with people in a visceral way, much more revealing of herself, much more of an advocate,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the person she needs to be to win the election. And she needs to project a vision of where she wants to take the country.\u201d Axelrod cautioned: \u201cYour rationale has to lead your candidacy. It didn\u2019t in 2008.\u201d He pegged former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as the most formidable potential Republican presidential candidate in the field, if he can make it through the GOP primary without compromising his position on immigration reform and other hot-button issues. \u201cThat\u2019s a big if. Because the center of gravity in the party has been so far to the right that the notion of getting through that process without having to compromise and make Faustian bargains, I think, is very remote,\u201d Axelrod said.",

            "article_content": "Breaking from traditional presidential politics orthodoxy, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush gave his first major speech as a potential 2016 candidate in Detroit, highlighting conservative principles in a city often ignored by many in his own party. Bush presented economic growth ideas aimed at challenging not just many in his own party, but Democrats in a potential general election as well. \u201cIf Americans are working harder than ever earning less than they once did, our government and our leaders should step up, offer a plan, fix what\u2019s wrong \u2013 or they should step aside,\u201d Bush told the Detroit Economic Club. \u201cThe recovery has been everywhere but in the family paychecks. The American Dream has become a mirage for far too many.\u201d READ: Jeb Bush heads to Iowa next month Is Jeb Bush too conservative for the GOP? Pivoting strongly to his message of a \u201cright to rise,\u201d Bush used the Detroit backdrop to face criticism of Republicans\u2019 interest in large, metropolitan areas. \u201cI know some in the media think conservatives don\u2019t care about the cities,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re wrong. We believe that every American and in every community has a right to pursue happiness.\u201d The way to bring about that success, he said, would be through conservative principles, not taxes or welfare programs. Aides say Bush is focusing on a general election run and won\u2019t be bogged down by traditional campaign strategies for a primary \u2013 running so far to the right, he won\u2019t be able to win the political center. Reflecting on the GOP losses in 2008 and 2012, he endorsed the shorter primary process and fewer debates mandated by the Republican National Committee during the primary season, and alluded to why a general election strategy during the primaries could work this time around for his party. \u201cOne \u2013 the desire to win. It\u2019s lonely sticking your head through the White House gate and wondering what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cEight years in exile is a long time. And so I think there will be some discipline to be able to recognize how important this race is for the future of the country.\u201d Challenging many conservative Republicans, Bush argued the critical component for America to achieve 4% annual rate of economic growth \u2013 almost double that of current economic predictions \u2013 would require immigration reform. Answering questions pre-submitted by the audience of about 400 club members and local leaders, he spoke about the \u201cgreat frustration\u201d of government failing to pass significant reform. \u201cThis should be the lowest-hanging fruit, to be honest with you, because this is a huge opportunity. Immigration is not a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need young, dynamic people that can make an immediate contribution to our economy. We shouldn\u2019t be fearful of this, we should say, \u2018What an incredible opportunity.\u2019\u201d The issue, now a lightning rod within the GOP, was front and center at the Iowa Freedom Summit last month, which Bush notably skipped. Sponsored by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King, the forum served as the first gathering of conservative activists to see multiple presidential candidates at one time. King, a stalwart objector to immigration reform, disagrees with Bush on the issue. Though other moderate Republicans who believe in immigration reform, like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, attended, Bush sent a stronger message by not appearing. His first scheduled appearance in Iowa will be next month, at the Iowa Agriculture Summit. The event, billed as \u201cbipartisan,\u201d will feature other presidential candidates as well to speak about farms, biosciences, food and federal subsidies, according to the press release. Introduced to the stage with laughter as the father of newly elected Texas Land Commissioner George Prescott Bush, the governor smiled while talking about his son and the two Bushes people connect him to the most. \u201cI\u2019m pretty proud also of 41 and 43 \u2013 I love them very much,\u201d he said in a nod to his presidential father and brother. \u201cI know that\u2019s hard for the political world to accept, but it\u2019s pretty easy for me to love them.\u201d George H.W. Bush, whom he refers to as \u201cthe greatest man alive\u201d was also part of his formal remarks about a successful American business. He spoke about two automotive engineers who left their jobs to start iRule, which now employs 21 people, including one of the founders\u2019 fathers as CFO. \u201cMust be nice to hire your dad,\u201d Bush joked. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, but he\u2019s kind of retired.\u201d The only unscripted moment during his official remarks came while he tackled education \u2013 the issue for which he\u2019s most known. Listing a string of education accomplishments like working with leaders in minority communities to close the education gap, raising standards and graduation rates and eliminating grade promotion for children without the necessary skills to compete, Bush spoke with passion about his work during Florida governorship. \u201cIt\u2019s an economic development issue for sure, but it\u2019s also I think the great moral issue of our time,\u201d he said later. Bush\u2019s strong support of Common Core, in which states voluntarily subscribe to higher education standards, has already become a flashpoint for conservatives who prefer local school districts to set their own standards. Potential debate opponents will assuredly watch him speak on education to prepare to argue against him. Bush will not back down on the issue. Another strong statement came from a question about child vaccinations, which has dogged some Republicans this week over their support of the practice. \u201cParents ought to make sure their children are vaccinated,\u201d he said in a strong statement, though not addressing the government\u2019s role in mandating them. \u201cParents have a responsibility to make sure their children are protected. Over and out.\u201d Just a few days after the dramatic 2015 Super Bowl, Jeb revealed he could have been in NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s hot seat during this tumultuous season. Visibly caught off guard, he confirmed that he was approached to lead the NFL in 2006. \u201cI was encouraged to consider it,\u201d by some of the owners, he said. \u201cIt was nine months prior to \u2026 ending my tenure as governor. And to be honest with you that\u2019s the greatest job in the world \u2013 being governor of a state. And I could have never imagined abandoning that job.\u201d Luckily for him, he stuck to his instincts to complete all eight years of his governorship, and did not pursue the post. After a season plagued by the Ray Rice scandal and \u201cDeflategate\u201d, he seemed relieved. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy of a job as it might have appeared in 2007,\u201d he said. Those are the same instincts he hopes will take him to the White House. CNN\u2019s Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash contributed to this report.",

In the last four weeks Boehner had to beat back a challenge in his re-election to a third term as Speaker, manage a divisive vote on immigration policy, defend a late night decision to pull an abortion bill after several GOP women complained it was too extreme.  He was also forced to shelve a GOP border bill, which he hoped would be the first step in his effort to reform the immigration system. \u201cThere have been a couple of stumbles,\u201d the Speaker admitted to reporters Tuesday. Two House Republicans lamented to CNN that the series of high profile internal fights were hurting morale and frustrating those who hoped the new session would feature a series of legislative accomplishments instead of fumbles. \u201cWe were promised it would get better,\u201d one of these Republicans, who spoke under anonymity to speak freely about private discussions, told CNN. In a closed door meeting with rank and file members earlier this week Boehner pledged that things would get back on track, according to GOP sources who attended.  He conceded that he and his leadership team moved legislation to the floor without going through \u201cregular order\u201d because committees were still being formed and they wanted to start addressing key priorities out of the gate. Going forward the Speaker said members would have more time to review legislation before votes. Boehner is no stranger to complaints from his right flank. Internal skirmishes among House GOP members were a hallmark of his first four years.  On the first day of the new Congress Boehner beat back a challenge from a group of 25 mostly conservatives who wanted to force a change in leadership. But even some of those who voted for Boehner for his third term aren\u2019t convinced he\u2019s listening, so they started a new initiative they say will help keep him honest. \u201cMany of us feel here in Washington that politicians go back home and make promises and then they forget them when they get here,\u201d Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador told CNN. Earlier this week Labrador and eight other House Republicans announced the formation of a new group called the \u201cHouse Freedom Caucus.\u201d  These members had already been meeting informally to discuss how they could more effectively push for conservative policies.   Labrador said the existing group of fiscal conservatives, the Republican Study Committee (RSC) had grown too big and that these members wanted \u201csomething more than a debating society.\u201d Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, a longtime critic of Boehner\u2019s, told CNN he is still waiting to hear how House GOP leaders will fight to roll back Obamacare, fight the President\u2019s policies on immigration, and vote on measures that represent the party\u2019s position on major social issues. \u201cI see no strategic path to do what we promised to do on any of these issues - they just all just seem to be endlessly going nowhere,\u201d Huelskamp said. As some of the right continue to bristle, the larger House majority also includes a segment of centrist members who are wielding new influence. In recent years fears of getting a primary challenge from the right meant most members didn\u2019t publicly break ranks with the mostly conservative House Republican conference. But two times in the last four weeks more moderate members demonstrated they can impact the House agenda. Several GOP women opposed provisions of the House GOP late term abortion bill would turn off young voters and women. Even though leadership aides thought the bill could still pass they abruptly pulled it because they wanted to avoid the optics of women opposing one of the first major bills. RELATED: House passes abortion measure Another segment of House Republicans rebelled against an immigration amendment championed by conservatives. The proposal, which was attached to a spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security would effectively end the Administration\u2019s policies that deferred the deportation of those children who were brought to the U.S. by immigrant parents entering the country illegally. Twenty six moderate GOP members voted against it, saying it went too far. It wasn\u2019t enough to block the amendment, but it was a notable group that could be a force in future immigration debates. Many of these centrist members who represent competitive districts see a small window of time for Congress to produce results before the attention turns to the 2016 election. They stress that their colleagues need to be realistic about what can get through both chambers \u2013 especially when Republicans don\u2019t have the 60 votes needed in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster. \u201cThere are a lot of members who came her to govern like myself and who see this as an opportunity. Let\u2019s not lose this opportunity, let\u2019s not squander it. Let\u2019s get it done and that to me what\u2019s motivating a lot of members,\u201d Rep Tom Reed, of New York told CNN. Boehner starts his second month as Speaker with a vote on an issue that unites House Republicans \u2013 repealing Obamacare. The measure will pass easily, but bringing up the issue raises the question about how the GOP would replace the health care law. The Speaker has committed to coming up with an alternative, but the internal divisions among his members about who would need to be covered and how to structure a new system will likely showcase the splits among House Republicans. But the Speaker doesn\u2019t appeared to be phased by the rough first month, or the fights ahead over immigration, the debt ceiling, tax reform and other issues. Asked in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday if this would be his last term, Boehner waved off the question, saying, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll be here for a while.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Lindsey Graham says he is testing the waters on a presidential run because he is sick of hearing himself complain. \u201cI complain a lot and also have some solutions. I\u2019m tired of just complaining and now ready to try to lead. Whether or not there is a market for me, I won\u2019t know until I try,\u201d Graham told CNN in an interview. Graham set up a new political organization on Thursday called \u201cSecurity Through Strength,\u201d which will allow him to raise money and hire a political staff as he weighs whether to officially run for president. The South Carolina Republican said he expects to make a decision by the end of April. Graham is a conservative, but bucks his party on big issues like immigration, where he thinks there should be a path to citizenship, and climate change, which he believes is at least in partly the result of human activity. READ: Have Republicans wised up about 2016? \u201cConservatism will sell to any demographic in this country as long as it\u2019s sold in a way to be inclusive and not hateful,\u201d said Graham. He made a point of noting that he beat back several challengers from the right in a GOP primary last year for his Senate seat in South Carolina, a conservative state. \u201cI\u2019m not going to run away from the idea that the President of the United States has to bring the parties together. Conservatism is an asset in terms of winning a national election, but what is needed more than conservatism or liberalism is pragmatism and somebody that can get a result. Only time will tell,\u201d said Graham. When asked what he would bring to the table that other establishment Republicans like Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney or Chris Christie do not, Graham focused immediately on foreign policy. \u201cIt will be about who can best protect the county, who has an alternative to Obama on foreign policy at a time when we need one,\u201d Graham said. \u201cRonald Reagan said that his platform was peace through strength. I\u2019ve concluded that with radical Islam, peaceful coexistence is nonexistent, is a fantasy. I think I can articulate how to straighten out a screwed up world when it comes to national security.\u201d Graham says he believes he can be competitive in Iowa, as well as New Hampshire, the second Republican contest. The next would be his home state, where he says he is confident he could win. There is no guarantee of that, of course. Graham won his GOP primary for the Senate in large part because he worked to keep formidable conservative opponents off the ballot. Still, South Carolina is his home turf where voters know him, and some Republicans there who relish their role as the GOP gateway to the South in the presidential process, are privately concerned that Graham getting in could effectively take that state off the map. Graham, an Air Force reservist who is still a military lawyer, is one of the Senate\u2019s leading foreign policy hawks, so it\u2019s clear he thinks national security is his main calling card in any presidential race. But he also plans to push the desire for deal-making on the domestic front. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta convince people that not only would I be a good commander-in-chief but I can do more than the foreign policy stuff, that I can be someone that gets both parties in a room that comes out with an outcome,\u201d said Graham. Graham was a constant presence on the presidential campaign trail in 2000 and 2008 when his close friend, Sen. John McCain, ran for president. SEE ALSO: Graham forms committee to test 2016 waters McCain on Thursday called Graham his \u201cbest friend\u201d and also recently joked that Graham, almost two decades younger than McCain, is his \u201cillegitimate son.\u201d \u201cWell, I hope I get to be in his will now that I\u2019m his illegitimate son \u2013 which was news to me and Cindy [McCain] and everybody else,\u201d Graham joked. But Graham then got serious, and emotional, talking about the fact that McCain has been telling anyone who will listen for months he believes Graham should throw his hat in the presidential ring. \u201cJohn is a dear friend. One of the highlights in my time in politics is him, and I know he loves me dearly,\u201d Graham said, as he tried to fight back tears. \u201cWe are truly friends, but he wouldn\u2019t say to anybody that I should be president if he didn\u2019t really mean it, and believe it.\u201d He calls McCain\u2019s encouragement a \u201cpersonal honor I will cherish,\u201d but also says that it is \u201cnot going to carry the day for me.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Speaker John Boehner confirmed the GOP lawsuit against Obama's immigration actions Boehner also defended his decision to invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak in March He said he plans to remain as speaker: \"I'll be here for a while.\" House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday confirmed House Republicans are filing a lawsuit against Obama\u2019s executive action delaying deportations for millions of immigrants here illegally. \u201cThe President\u2019s overreach when he took executive action to deal with the immigration problems in our country, frankly, in my view, is a violation of our Constitution,\u201d he said in an interview on Fox News. READ: Boehner opens door to Obama immigration lawsuit \u201cThis isn\u2019t about immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the President violating the Constitution, violating his oath of office, and frankly, not upholding the rule of law.\u201d Boehner had told House Republicans of the planned lawsuit during their closed-door meeting on Tuesday. The move comes as House leadership struggles to round up support for a border security bill they planned to vote on this week, in part due to conservative opposition. Conservatives have expressed frustration that leadership hasn\u2019t done enough to oppose Obama\u2019s unilateral action on immigration. Boehner insisted during the interview that the bill will ultimately pass. But while the lawsuit\u00a0may help quell some of those complaints, it\u2019s unlikely to ultimately have much impact on deportations. Boehner turned to a similar tactic on Obamacare, bringing a lawsuit against the administration for delaying the employer mandate that remains stalled in court. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the administration believes Obama was acting well within his power when he issued the order on deportations. \u201cHouse Republicans seem to be relying more and more on the courts these days to challenge the president\u2019s authority,\u201d Shultz said at Wednesday\u2019s daily press briefing. \u201cWe believe that we acted within the full bounds of authority enshrined to the executive branch, and we\u2019ll be defending that.\u201d Boehner also defended his decision to invite Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the House in March, without letting the White House know in advance, a move that\u2019s drawn widespread criticism from even pro-Israel groups. SEE ALSO: Obama says Netanyahu\u2019s visit is too close to election for a meeting \u201cThe Israeli prime minister can also talk with some expertise about the growing threat of radical Islam,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a serious problem in the world and the President just wants to act like it\u2019s going to just disappear. And so as a co-equal branch of our government, I don\u2019t have any problem at all in doing what I did to invite the prime minister to come to Congress and address those concerns.\u201d Netanyahu is expected to lobby Congress to pass new sanctions on Iran, putting him squarely at odds with Obama. The President said during a Wednesday interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria that he hadn\u2019t heard \u201ca persuasive rebuttal of my argument that we crafted very effective sanctions against Iran specifically to bring them to the negotiations table.\u201d Obama also told Zakaria that he won\u2019t be meeting with Netanyahu when he comes because \u201cour general policy is, we don\u2019t meet with any world leader two weeks before their election.\u201d But Boehner said there\u2019s clear \u201cantipathy\u201d from the White House towards Netanyahu. \u201cThey don\u2019t even try to hide it,\u201d he said. Boehner also said House Republicans will eventually offer an alternative to the health care reform law, and that he himself expects to remain speaker \u2014 despite facing another conservative coup attempt \u2014 for quite some time. \u201cI\u2019ll be here for a while,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch is a career prosecutor who spent her career notching high-profile courtroom victories and climbing to the top of the legal ranks of Brooklyn\u2019s U.S. attorney\u2019s office. But on Wednesday, she\u2019ll walk into a Senate Judiciary Committee where the newly Republican-controlled chamber is seething with anger at President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, and looking for outlets to express it. READ: Obama nominated Loretta who? Specifically, the GOP is looking for opportunities to combat Obama\u2019s executive overhaul of U.S. immigration rules. They\u2019ll seek answers on how the Justice Department will treat new local laws that permit marijuana use. They\u2019ll ask questions about U.S. military interventions overseas. Whether she\u2019s confirmed as Eric Holder\u2019s replacement could largely depend on her answers. Holder had a tempestuous relationship with Congress, particularly House Republicans, and many observers will be watching how Lynch carries herself during the expected scrutiny. The biggest potential hurdle could be immigration. Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter said Lynch\u2019s nomination would be an opportunity to swing back at Obama for his post-midterm election executive moves to forestall some deportations. Lynch nominated for U.S. Attorney General \u201cWe\u2019ll have the opportunity to push back on executive amnesty with one of our first major battles: the attorney general nomination,\u201d Vitter said in a statement in December. \u201cThe attorney general is one of the linchpins to Obama\u2019s amnesty plan, and I\u2019ll be working to get the new Congress to block this nomination.\u201d Lynch could also face questions about the Justice Department\u2019s investigations of police departments \u2013 particularly since her U.S. attorney\u2019s office is leading the investigation into the police killing of an unarmed black suspect in Staten Island. The issue isn\u2019t new to Lynch, who is perhaps best known for her prosecution and conviction of two New York City police officers who sodomized the Haitian immigrant Abner Louima after arresting him outside a Brooklyn nightclub in 1997. Lynch wouldn\u2019t need many Republican supporters to win confirmation, since \u2013 unlike most legislation \u2013 the Senate currently only requires 51 votes for some presidential nominees. She\u2019s likely to be backed by all the chamber\u2019s Democrats, led by New York Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand. White House press secretary Josh Earnest has urged Congress to confirm Lynch before Feb. 16, though Senate Republicans appear unlikely to move that quickly. RELATED: President nominates Loretta Lynch as attorney general Wednesday\u2019s hearing will also be the first major test for new Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who took over after the GOP claimed the Senate in November. \u201cI have every confidence that Ms. Lynch will receive a very fair, but thorough, vetting by the Judiciary Committee,\u201d Grassley said in a statement after Lynch was nominated. \u201cU.S. Attorneys are rarely elevated directly to this position, so I look forward to learning more about her, how she will interact with Congress, and how she proposes to lead the department,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that her tenure, if confirmed, will restore confidence in the Attorney General as a politically independent voice for the American people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Marco Rubio has the campaign organization ready to run for president, an aide tells CNN He told supporters at a two-day meeting in Miami he plans to decide sooner rather than later Aides say they're not concerned about his role in the immigration reform effort in 2013 Sen. Marco Rubio is on track to run for president if he decides to jump in the race, an aide tells CNN. A presidential bid isn\u2019t the definite next move for the senator, who\u2019s also up for reelection in 2016 and has said he\u2019ll only run for one office \u2014 but for many of his donors and supporters attending his two-day summit in Miami, it\u2019s the obvious one. Attendees were given the impression by Rubio and his aides that while the senator hasn\u2019t made a decision yet, he has prepared the funding and staffing infrastructure to go all in. And speaking to some audience members who were listening, the pitch worked. \u201cI\u2019m very taken with him,\u201d said Anthony Gioia, an ambassador under George W. Bush and a major GOP fundraiser who supported Mitt Romney in 2012. Convincing his financial backers that he has the campaign organization to launch a 2016 bid at a moment\u2019s notice is important as Rubio\u2019s would-be primary challengers have been more public and direct about their intentions for weeks now. While the freshman Florida senator gathered donors and staff at the posh Delano hotel, at least 10 Republican hopefuls were addressing potential Iowa caucus-goers and former governors Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney criss-crossed the country meeting with voters and Republican officials. Back in Miami, Gioia said that while he hasn\u2019t decided who to support in the GOP primary, he was impressed by Rubio\u2019s command of the foreign policy challenges facing the nation and, in particular, the senator\u2019s charisma and compelling personal story. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely articulate,\u201d Gioia said. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s going to be president has to be able to lead. And you have to be articulate to be able to lead.\u201d READ: Rubio \u2018down to the last decision\u2019 on 2016 Gioia was one of nearly 300 donors and supporters gathered at the hotel on Friday night and Saturday morning for the senator\u2019s annual \u201cTeam Rubio\u201d meeting. Attendees included Al Cardenas, former chairman of the American Conservative Union and a supporter of both Rubio and Jeb Bush; Dirk Van Dongen, chair of Rubio\u2019s D.C. steering committee; Matt Keelen, a major Rubio donor, and Geoff Verhoff, a D.C. lobbyist and a member of Rubio\u2019s D.C. steering committee. Rubio spent nearly three hours Friday night chatting individually with attendees, telling jokes and stories with them on the candlelit patio after guests enjoyed a buffet dinner and open bar. Over a breakfast buffet Saturday morning, Rubio told the group about his thinking as he contemplates a presidential run. He\u2019s huddling with a few dozen of his top fundraisers and aides over lunch to strategize for his future, and has a more casual dinner planned Saturday night with a small circle to continue the conversation. According to multiple attendees at the breakfast briefing, Rubio said he\u2019d make the decision sooner rather than later, as he wants to give Republicans in the state enough time to front a strong candidate to defend his seat if he does decide to go for the White House. Terry Sullivan, Rubio\u2019s former chief of staff who now runs his PAC, also gave a powerpoint presentation to the group outlining the senator\u2019s midterm efforts and successes, introducing the attendees to the new Republicans their money helped elect in 2014. Aides caution that Rubio hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet, and that these preparations will be just as useful for a Senate campaign if he decides to run for reelection. Florida Republicans are expecting to face a fierce battle with Democrats to hold onto the seat regardless of who they run, because it\u2019s both a top pickup opportunity for Democrats hoping to take back the Senate, and a key swing state in the electoral college calculus. Cardenas predicted the Senate fight alone could top $100 million. \u201cFlorida\u2019s going to be the number one state in a presidential election and in the U.S. Senate election, and whether you\u2019re running for reelection in the Senate in a race that could cost 100 million, or you\u2019re running for president, you need an incredible effort just for the reelection,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t start working on that now, you\u2019re not going to be able to amass the resources you need.\u201d Rubio\u2019s well on track to amass those resources. The senator had a record January fundraising haul, beating all of his goals, according to an aide. And he\u2019s on track to surpass his February goals as well, with fundraising trips to Chicago and Texas planned for next month. He recently brought on Anna Rogers, the top fundraiser for major GOP spending group American Crossroads, as his finance director, though his current finance director, Dorinda Moss, will still be active in the team\u2019s fundraising efforts. Still, many in the party remain skeptical of a first-term senator who\u2019s still haunted, in some conservative circles, by his role in negotiating the failed Senate immigration reform bill in 2013. That which both lost him support within the conservative wing in the party and raised questions about his ability to effectively govern. He was one of a handful of potential 2016 contenders who skipped out on a conservative gathering hosted by Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King this weekend \u2014 a snub that did not go unnoticed by King, who told the crowd he believed the country\u2019s next president was one of the speakers at the confab. But Rubio\u2019s own team doesn\u2019t believe immigration will be an issue for him in the race, if he runs. They note the senator\u2019s got strong credentials on nearly every other key conservative issue, including gun control and abortion, and see the immigration snafu as a mulligan of sorts that conservatives could forgive. And his supporters believe he\u2019s got the charisma and compelling personal story that many other potential contenders lack. Gioia, who\u2019s hosted fundraising dinners at his home that have netted candidates upwards of a million dollars, said he has yet to decide which Republican to support. But between Rubio and Bush, the younger senator may have won his heart. \u201cI\u2019m certainly leaning very heavily towards Marco, or possibly Jeb \u2014 but I really like Marco. He\u2019s a really talented guy,\u201d Gioia said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a good inner self too. He\u2019s comfortable in his own skin,\u201d he added.",

            "article_content": "Election Day 2016 is still nearly two years away, but Iowa Rep. Steve King is already making trouble for Republican presidential contenders. The congressman issued yet another of his infamously off-color comments on undocumented immigrants in a tweet about the First Lady\u2019s guest to the State of the Union on Tuesday night. #Obama perverts \"prosecutorial discretion\" by inviting a deportable to sit in place of honor at #SOTU w/1st Lady. I should sit with Alito. King was tweeting about 21-year-old Ana Zamora, the college senior joining the First Lady who benefitted from Obama\u2019s 2012 executive action that deferred deportation for hundreds of thousands of young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, it\u2019s drawn outspoken opposition from Republicans, who voted last week passed a symbolic measure overturning the order. The Tea Party-backed Iowan isn\u2019t known for his diplomacy on illegal immigration, however \u2014 he\u2019s staunchly opposed to DACA and other measures that allow undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S., and once decried immigrants trying to cross the southern border with \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes\u201d from hauling marijuana across the desert. But with 10 Republicans who have openly expressed their interest in a presidential bid planning to attend a conservative confab he\u2019s hosting in Iowa this weekend, his comments are certain to put many of them in difficult spots. Democrats were already asking the question, tying King\u2019s latest remarks to comments 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said about encouraging undocumented immigrants to \u201cself-deport.\u201d \u201cThese Romney-style \u2018self deport\u2019 type comments are what we\u2019ve come to expect from Steve King but the important question is: do each and every potential 2016 GOP nominee who is attending his Freedom Summit this weekend in Iowa agree with King\u2019s \u2018deportable\u2019 comment?\u201d the Democratic National Committee asked in an email blast to reporters.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Joni Ernst  firmly seized \u2013 and waved \u2013 the mandate Republicans believe they won in the November midterm elections, which swept her party into power in the Senate, as she delivered the Republican response to President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union address. The freshman senator from Iowa pledged Republicans will take the country on a new course that eschews Washington\u2019s \u201cstale mindset\u201d and called on Obama to work with her party in the new Congress. But Ernst largely trained her sights on Washington, not Obama, during the under 10-minute address. Sen. Ernst: A lot we can achieve if we work together \u201cWe heard the message you sent in November \u2014 loud and clear. And now we\u2019re getting to work to change the direction Washington has been taking our country,\u201d Ernst is expected to say. \u201cAmericans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare. It\u2019s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions.\u201d After Obama highlighted improvements in the economy following continued decreases in the unemployment rate and an uptick in job creation, Ernst made it clear that the U.S. economy has not yet fully recovered and much more still remains to be done. Ernst even talked about the \u201csting of the economy\u201d as something \u201cmany of us\u201d didn\u2019t have to read about, but \u201cfelt them every day.\u201d From \u201cstagnant wages and lost jobs\u201d to \u201cthe hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans,\u201d Ernst painted a far less rosier picture of the economy than Obama presented moments before. Full text of Ernst\u2019s response \u201cWe see too many moms and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they\u2019ll be able to leave to their children,\u201d Ernst said. All while sticking to conservative Republican policy ideas, Ernst also spoke about the potential for common ground with the President. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can achieve if we work together,\u201d Ernst said in her rebuttal late Tuesday night. That common ground includes tearing down trade barriers in Europe and reforming the U.S. tax code, both issue areas that Republicans and Democrats have heralded as potential bipartisan success stories. Ernst even notes that Obama has expressed his willingness to work with Republicans on tax reform. But Ernst also hit Obama\u2019s signature health care law, repeating the all-but-impossible goal of repealing and replacing Obamacare. She also criticized Obama over his opposition to a bill that would authorize the Keystone XL pipeline, which he recently threatened to veto. \u201cWill he sign the bill or block good American jobs?\u201d Ernst said. Ernst, who successfully pulled support from establishment and tea party groups during her election campaign, also made note of plans to continue fighting for conservative causes: \u201cWe\u2019ll defend life,\u201d she said. Ernst also signaled that the GOP Congress would fight to rein in Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, vowing to \u201ccorrect executive ovverreach.\u201d And speaking from the Armed Services Committee room, Ernst also called for a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to defeat \u201cthe forces of violence and oppression,\u201d addressing renewed concerns over terrorism revived in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 17 less than two weeks ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve been reminded of terrorism\u2019s reach both at home and abroad; most recently in France and Nigeria, but also in places like Canada and Australia. Our hearts go out to all the innocent victims of terrorism and their loved ones. We can only imagine the depth of their grief,\u201d Ernst said.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama made a feisty pitch for economic populism in his penultimate State of the Union Tuesday night, touting the improving economy on his watch and making the case that government has a role in ensuring equal opportunity for all. Obama began his speech at 9:10 p.m. in front of a joint session of the House and Senate, declaring that \u201cthe shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the union is strong.\u201d \u201cAt this moment \u2013 with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production \u2013 we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come,\u201d he said. \u201cWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\u201d Obama argued that a raft of new policy proposals \u2014\u00a0which include an ambitious plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans and financial institutions to pay for progressive priorities \u2014\u00a0favor the middle class, and that \u201cmiddle-class economics works.\u201d And he laid down the gauntlet to Republicans: They\u2019ll \u201ccontinue to work, as long as politics don\u2019t get in the way.\u201d It\u2019s a defiant speech for the President, now freed from the shackles of vulnerable red-state Democrats up for re-election and looking to burnish his legacy in his final two years. Read the full transcript of President Obama\u2019s address Instead of granting Republicans their wish for a realistic compromiser-in-chief chastened by a midterm election drubbing, Obama is attempting to set the terms of an economic debate that could continue into the 2016 race to replace him in the Oval Office. He called for cooperation, reprising the theme that there isn\u2019t a \u201cred America\u201d or \u201cblue America\u201d from the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech that shot Obama into stardom. And he flashed a renewed confidence, going off-script after touting the improving economy to say, \u201cThis is good news, people\u201d \u2013 and followed it with a wink. Later, when Obama said he had no campaigns left to run and some Republicans sarcastically clapped, the President shot back: \u201cI know, \u2018cause I won both of them.\u201d Obama: 'The State of the Union is strong' At the heart of his message is a Robin Hood-style plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans\u2019 investments and financial institutions and use that money to foot the bill for free community college tuition and new tax credits for child care and two-worker households. That proposal stands next to no chance of clearing Congress. But \u2013 along with campaign-style events and interviews with YouTube stars touting his initiatives both before and after the speech \u2013 Democrats hope Obama\u2019s decision to play up the parties\u2019 philosophical differences will remind Republicans who now control both the House and the Senate of the political force they couldn\u2019t overcome in 2008 and 2012. Obama heads into big speech on popularity uptick Republicans, though, see a President in denial \u2013 one who hasn\u2019t learned anything from the shellacking that cost his party the Senate in November; whose veto threats and tax-and-spend proposals are a lame duck flailing as his influence fades. The President\u2019s \u201cproposals are so out of touch you have to ask if there is any point to the speech,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted. Freshman Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst delivered the GOP\u2019s response, calling on Obama to \u201ccooperate\u201d with congressional leaders to advance new trade pacts and overhaul the tax code. But she also said now that her party controls both the House and the Senate, changes are coming \u2013 and she hit Obama\u2019s signature health care law while doing it. \u201cAmericans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions.\u201d Obama\u2019s 2012 Republican opponent, Mitt Romney \u2013 who is considering a 2016 run for the White House \u2013 called the speech \u201cdisappointing.\u201d Romney said Obama \u201cis more interested in politics than in leadership. More intent on winning elections than on winning progress, he ignores the fact that the country has elected a Congress that favors smaller government and lower taxes.\u201d But Hillary Clinton, the leading 2016 Democratic contender, praised Obama\u2019s speech, tweeting that the President \u201cpointed [the] way to an economy that works for all. Now we need to step up and deliver for the middle class.\u201d Obama pitches community college plan GOP\u2019s rebuttal: \u2018We heard the message you sent in November\u2019 But the White House is wagering that \u2013 with free trade and cybersecurity, two potential areas for deals, as the major exceptions \u2013 there\u2019s little to be gained in trying to bargain with a Congress already bent on forcing showdowns with Obama on immigration, the Keystone XL pipeline, Cuba, health care and more. They see an opening: The economy has improved, the President\u2019s approval rating now tops 50% for the first time in years, and, free of the constraints he felt ahead of the midterm elections, an emboldened Obama is unfurling a series of executive actions to check item after item off his long-stalled to-do list. This could be his best shot at pivoting from an unending series of fiscal crises and legislative battles toward an economic debate that could set the tone for the last two years of his presidency \u2013 and for a 2016 race that had been about moving past him. Showdown at State of the Union? Taking top billing in Tuesday night\u2019s speech is the tax-and-spend plan Obama has rolled out in recent days. The benefits would largely go to students and young families: The child care tax credit would triple to $3,000; households in which both spouses work could qualify for a new $500 credit; and college students and those repaying loans could get breaks thanks to Obama\u2019s plan to make two-year community college degrees free. Footing the bill are tax hikes on the rich: a total of $320 billion over 10 years by targeting wealthy individuals and banks. Paying most of the price would be couples earning more than $500,000, who would see their capital gains rate jump from 23.8% to 28%. More inherited assets would be subject to capital gains taxes and top financial firms would face new fees. Reality check on Obama\u2019s State of the Union proposals State of the Union: 67 years in 67 seconds Obama is also making his own moves to give federal workers at least six weeks of paid maternity leave once their children are born \u2013 and he\u2019s lobbying lawmakers to pass a bill allowing workers to earn up to seven paid sick days, and pushing local governments to set up their own sick leave programs. Before the speech, Republican congressional leaders made clear that Obama\u2019s proposals are dead on arrival. \u201cIt all looks like the same old tax and spend that the president has been advocating for the last six years,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) said. He called Obama\u2019s tax plan \u201canother income redistribution effort\u201d and said it won\u2019t help Congress work on a comprehensive tax overhaul. \u201cHopefully that\u2019s just rhetoric,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cHe knows we\u2019re not likely to pass these kinds of measures. And we\u2019ll still look for things that we can actually agree on to try and make some progress here.\u201d Here are several other issues that have dominated the news in recent weeks, and how Obama addressed them in the prepared text of his speech: FIGHTING ISIS: Obama said that \u201cAmerican leadership, including our military power\u201d has played a key role in stopping ISIS, and called on Congress to authorize the use of military force against the group in Iraq and Syria. Obama to Congress: Authorize force against ISIS \u201cInstead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. \u2026 This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.\u201d CYBERSECURITY: The President asked Congress to approve legislation that would allow government and businesses to work together more closely to thwart online attacks \u2013 a proposal that could win the support of the GOP-led Congress. \u201cNo foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children\u2019s information.\u201d CUBA: Perhaps the richest pageantry of the night is over Obama\u2019s recent move to thaw the decades-old economic and diplomatic freeze with the small island country. Obama had invited Alan Gross, the U.S. contractor whose release from a Cuban prison he had secured in November. The President\u2019s top critic, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), had asked Cuban activist Rosa Mar\u00eda Pay\u00e1 to come as his guest. She\u2019s the daughter of Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, a pro-democracy activist who was killed in a 2012 crash in which the car\u2019s driver has said it was deliberately targeted by Cuban government officials. Obama on Cuba policy shift: End legacy of mistrust \u201cWhen what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t work for fifty years, it\u2019s time to try something new,\u201d Obama said. \u201cOur shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.\u201d IRAN: The White House had extended the deadline for its negotiations with Iran to end the country\u2019s nuclear program, but lawmakers have said they\u2019ve run out of patience with the Iranian regime and want to impose new sanctions. Obama urged them to wait. \u201cThere are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails \u2013 alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.\u201d FREE TRADE: Obama risked angering his own base by asking lawmakers to hand him authority to fast-track Pacific Rim and European Union trade deals through Congress with limited debate and no amendments \u2013 a power seen as crucial to finalizing those negotiations with foreign leaders. He posited the trade deals as an opportunity to combat China\u2019s growing influence in Asia. \u201cWhy would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren\u2019t just free, but fair,\u201d he said. And in a move to acknowledge liberal criticism, Obama said: \u201cLook, I\u2019m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven\u2019t always lived up to the hype, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But 95% of the world\u2019s customers live outside our borders, and we can\u2019t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they\u2019re actively looking at bringing jobs back from China. Let\u2019s give them one more reason to get it done.\u201d INTERNET ACCESS: In an in-the-weeds regulatory proposal that could result in much-faster Internet access for many cities and states, Obama is calling on the Federal Communications Commission to override 19 states\u2019 laws against municipalities setting up their own broadband infrastructure. \u201cI intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world,\u201d Obama said.

            "article_content": "House and Senate Republicans will meet jointly for the first time in a decade Conservatives are frustrated with leadership Chocolate is on the menu and unity is the message as Republicans head to Hershey, Pennsylvania, for the first joint GOP House and Senate retreat in 10 years. But as House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lay the groundwork for their agenda on Capitol Hill this year, tension from conservatives unhappy that their leaders aren\u2019t being bold enough could make things awkward. Comedian Jay Leno is slated to warm up the group on Wednesday night. But even before boarding buses to Pennsylvania, some Republicans clearly weren\u2019t ready to sing kumbaya. \u201cI think the leadership is unified - unified in doing very little,\u201d conservative Rep. Tim Huelskamp told CNN. The Kansas Republican told CNN it was time to plot a way forward to repeal Obamacare and roll back the president\u2019s actions on immigration \u2013 not focus on finding compromises with President Barack Obama. \u201cThey want to all get along with the President, which is not the election results,\u201d Huelskamp said about GOP leaders, adding, \u201cthat\u2019s misreading exactly the opposite of what November 2014 is about.\u201d READ: GOP immigration showdown looms Huelskamp was one of the 25 House Republicans who tried to deny Boehner his third term as Speaker, opposing him on a vote earlier this month. This vocal group is demanding that Boehner and McConnell go big and schedule votes on a variety of proposals to highlight a contrast with the President and congressional Democrats, even if those things don\u2019t have the chance of becoming law. Other House Republicans are fed up that this small bloc of conservatives has been able to force the debate to tack to the right, and start off the New Year with a focus on the divisions inside the party on hot button issues like immigration. \u201cAt some point our far right has got to understand that us \u2018regular conservatives\u2019 are not necessarily on board with what they want to do,\u201d Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger told CNN.  He noted, \u201cour caucus has got to understand that sometimes the noisiest 25 in the caucus is not a majority.\u201d In another potential headache for GOP leaders, a new group of House conservatives is setting up a formal structure to meet regularly and develop policy proposals. These members don\u2019t believe the current group that already does this - known as the Republican Study Committee (RSC) -  is sufficiently independent of the leadership. The current RSC Chair, Texas Rep. Bill Flores, told CNN his group was already influencing the agenda in the House. \u201cLook at what we\u2019ve had on the floor- that\u2019s nothing but a conservative agenda,\u201d he said. The splits that have emerged in public are sure to be highlighted in closed door meetings in Hershey.  Organizers have planned breakout sessions on immigration, health care and the budget process. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, columnist Peggy Noonan, and author Walter Isaacson are also slated to address the group. But Kinzinger warned \u201cour flanks in the party have got to understand that when you work as a team and accomplish 70%m it\u2019s way better than what we had last week,\u201d referring to the contentious debate over immigration. Republican leaders started out the year putting a priority on items conservatives wanted to tackle.  The House voted on bills approving the Keystone pipeline, repealing a key provision of Obamacare, and reversing some of the Wall Street reforms the President pushed for in 2010. READ: Meet the poorest members of Congress Right before members left for the retreat, the House approved a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that also attached a series of amendments nullifying the President\u2019s most recent executive action on immigration. GOP leaders also allowed a vote on a measure that went even further \u2013 it eliminated a program that deferred deportations for so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d - children of those who entered the U.S. illegally. While the bill passed, a group of 26 House Republicans opposed that amendment dealing with deportations on young people, with many saying that proposal went too far. The President had already threatened vetoes on the bulk of the GOP bills the House was passing. But at a meeting with bipartisan congressional leaders with President Obama on Wednesday there was a lot of talk about trying to focus on the things where both sides could agree. Republican aides are setting low expectations for the retreat - saying this is the beginning of discussions on the way forward on key priorities like getting rid of Obamacare, drafting major tax reform legislation, pushing jobs bills, and cutting federal spending. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we get together, open up lines of communication and unify around some goals that we have for the upcoming Congress,\u201d House GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rogers told CNN. One controversial decision leaders are still grappling with is whether or not to use a procedure known as \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d to try to repeal Obamacare. If they decide to use this process - one that is available for items that impact the debt and the deficit - Senate leaders would just need a simple majority to pass legislation, which gets around a likely Democratic-led filibuster on Obamacare. READ: The perils of stardom on Capitol Hill Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea-party favorite, in a speech before Heritage Foundation this week, said Congress should use \u201cevery procedural tool available including reconciliation to repeal Obamacare with 51 votes in the Senate.\u201d But other congressional Republicans argue it should be reserved for something the President could sign - like tax reform or a bill boosting infrastructure across the country. Huelskamp said if leaders decided to use that process to do tax reform instead of repealing Obamacare that would be \u201ca very stupid Republican decision - we\u2019re going to help corporations and let the rest of these guys suffer?\u201d One potential complication for McConnell is maneuvering his plans while three Senate Republicans  - Cruz, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul - are preparing possible presidential campaigns for 2016. But Rubio and Paul are skipping the retreat.",

            "article_content": "Progressives deride her as cozy with Wall Street but Hillary Clinton appears to be a near-ideological equal on banking policy with Elizabeth Warren, the liberal crusader for financial reform. That convention-busting piece of data is one of the many surprises released Wednesday from a novel political ranking system that uses public campaign finance data to plot where potential White House contenders fall on the political spectrum. The results were provided exclusively to CNN before Wednesday\u2019s release. Charting the course of a presidential candidate\u2019s money may be just as \u2013 if not more - important than keeping track of the words coming out of their mouths, according to the algorithm built by Stanford University researchers at Crowdpac, a for-profit group that rates candidates by their previous voting records, statements and campaign finance data. The Crowdpac method suggests the money given to and from candidates creates a marker to map a candidate\u2019s political DNA. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is the most moderate Republican considering a bid for the White House, according to Crowdpac\u2019s methodology. Jeb Bush is the potential candidate ideologically nearest to Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2012. Both men are considering runs in 2016. Among Democrats, Vice President Joe Biden stands closest to the political center. Founders of the political start-up hope users will be able to make more informed decisions when they donate to candidates. Crowdpac wants to help with that too, with the unveiling of a new way for donors to create a slate of candidates and give money to them based on their ideological ranking. Crowdpac\u2019s findings \u2013 along with its new way to give money to campaigns - include 25 potential White House contenders, drawing from an exhaustive body of data. The algorithm displays the contenders on a liberal\u2013conservative spectrum, and rates each person on 15 issue areas. The third piece of the algorithm\u2014which includes the ideology of donors and examines how the politicians spend their own money\u2014makes Crowdpac\u2019s analysis unusual, and helps provide a clearer picture of how those seeking the White House compare to their peers. The results can confound commonly held perceptions, as in the case of Clinton and Warren on finance and banking policy. Clinton\u2019s donor base is centered on Wall Street and her husband oversaw a spate of financial deregulation in the 1990s. Warren\u2019s entire political identity is built on calling for more regulation. The data also suggest Bush, the former Florida governor who is one of the few to make public moves toward an official campaign, is nearly in line with the Republican mainstream on education and immigration, despite a wide perception on the right that he\u2019s too moderate because of his support for Common Core and an immigration overhaul. \u201cHe\u2019s actually more conservative than a lot of people are assuming,\u201d said Crowdpac CEO and co-founder Steven Hilton, a veteran of British politics and former aide to Prime Minister David Cameron. \u201cThe data we have suggests that he\u2019s much more in line with the [Republican] average than people are thinking.\u201d With such a broad slate of potential candidates, there are, of course, challenges to rating everyone equally. Sitting lawmakers and governors have a richer trove of recent data from which to draw, with hundreds of votes, statements and donors available for public view. Others, who left office years ago\u2014or hopefuls who have never held office before, as is the case of Dr. Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina\u2014provide a less complete picture. Rick Santorum\u2019s record as a swing state senator eight years ago is far different than his rhetoric as a conservative presidential candidate. That\u2019s why the donors are so important and provide much-needed insight into a possible candidate\u2019s views, according to Hilton. \u201cIn terms of its accuracy, it\u2019s pretty much the same as a voting record,\u201d said Hilton. Challenges in defining conservative, liberal and Rand Paul Perhaps the most counterintuitive find suggests that Sen. Rand Paul, known as a vocal champion of non-interventionist policies, earned a slightly more conservative rating on defense and foreign policy than Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who supports a robust American action abroad. Crowdpac advisers pointed to Paul\u2019s donor base and his Senate record. In particular, they cited four votes that they said push him to the \u201cright\u201d of Rubio: A 2014 vote to provide loan guarantees to Ukraine in which Paul opposed and Rubio supported; a 2012 Paul-proposed bill to restrict foreign aid that Rubio abstained from voting; another to renew import restrictions which Paul supported and Rubio opposed; and Paul\u2019s opposition to the 2014 defense authorization bill. Of course, any ideological rating system that seeks to apply to a wide range of complicated issues is imperfect\u2013and defining a \u201cconservative foreign policy\u201d is especially difficult. The algorithm pulls politicians further to the extreme end of the spectrum the more they vote with their own party, said Mike Polyakov, Crowdpac\u2019s head of data. That  helps explain Paul\u2019s placement furthest to the right. \u201cIt looks at who tends to vote with whom,\u201d Polyakov said. \u201cIn simple terms, Republicans who tend to vote only with other Republicans in Congress get a more extreme score than those who frequently cross party lines. There\u2019s some theoretical tension in assigning scores on certain issues, like foreign policy.  After all, \u2018conservative\u2019 can at times mean either aggressive or isolationist.\u201d Overall, Paul took the award for Crowdpac\u2019s most conservative presidential contender although he\u2019s considered the \u201cmost liberal\u201d on issues of government intelligence and surveillance. Of the potential Democrats, Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders is the most liberal both overall and on the issue of surveillance. \u201cSenator Rand Paul has a very conservative outlook on foreign policy, yet his detractors try to paint him as something that he is not,\u201d said Paul spokesman Brian Darling, who was happy to see his boss named most conservative. \u201cThere is nothing conservative about spending billions of taxpayer dollars on foreign nation building and trying to be everywhere all the time. This study recognizes that the conservative tradition of defending freedom, yet using restraint when committing U.S. forces abroad and analyzing threats.\u201d Sanders was asked by CNN if he agrees that he\u2019s the most liberal senator - he doesn\u2019t like that term, preferring \u201cprogressive,\u201d but did nod his head and explained he\u2019s considering a White House run even though he\u2019s to the left of most of the country. \u201cI think that there have not been enough voices out there, and I think there\u2019s a reservoir out there of people who are angry at the establishment,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd I mean certainly the economic establishment, the political establishment\u2013the two parties\u2013and the media establishment, frankly. I think people want to hear voices that are going to stand for working families. I think you\u2019re going to find that those arguments can resonate across the political spectrum more than you think.\u201d Representatives for other potential candidates declined or did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Displaying information that seems counterintuitive is part of the reason Crowdpac exists, Hilton said, especially in an environment so crowded with spin and highly-paid messaging. \u201cThe whole point is to make it easier for people to get involved with politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we do that is to give people simple, objective data about candidates and issues that cuts out the spin and the party positioning and gives people really clear, simple information that\u2019s objective about where the candidates are on the issues.\u201d A new way to donate Crowdpac established the rating system to help connect candidates with small-dollar donors, Hilton said.  On Wednesday, the site also rolled out a service that allows supporters to donate to any of White House hopefuls, even before they announce a bid. The site, which received approval to accept and process donations from the Federal Election Commission last year, will hand the money over to the candidate if he or she runs for president or return it to the donor in full if no campaign materializes. Traditionally, the easiest way to support those who haven\u2019t officially announced candidacy is to donate to a leadership PAC or a super PAC that\u2019s legally barred from coordinating with the candidate.You can already show support for Bush, for example, by donating to his new PAC, \u201cRight to Rise\u201d or give to the \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d super PAC, an unaffiliated group that\u2019s urging Clinton to run. But Crowdpac\u2014which, despite its name, is not a political action committee \u2013says their model could upend the PAC format in what Hilton called \u201ca total innovation in campaign finance.\u201d One of the goals, Hilton said, is to increase engagement between donors and candidates in a way that lets voters show their support publicly in ways that haven\u2019t been possible before. (The only catch is that Crowdpac will pocket an 3 percent fee and an additional 5 percent, which will go to Democracy Engine, a processing company.) The idea is not totally new\u2014the FEC granted similar privileges to the Democratic fundraising group Act Blue in 2006\u2014but Crowdpac is the first to provide a platform to donate to any candidate from either party who has expressed interest in a presidential bid. \u201cUntil now, this process of figuring out whether the candidates have enough money and support to run has taken place behind closed doors because they can\u2019t officially raise money,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cWe are opening up that process to everyone.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Billionaire Tom Steyer exploring run for Barbara Boxer's seat California Attorney General Kamala Harris raising money for Senate bid Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom is out of the race Hours after California Attorney General Kamala Harris began raising money for a bid to replace Barbara Boxer in the U.S. Senate, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer outlined the case for his own run Tuesday and said he would decide soon \u2013 setting up the likelihood of an exorbitantly expensive contest that could have two Democrats facing off in November of 2016. California\u2019s two Senate seats have been locked down by Boxer and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein since 1992, closing off statewide opportunities for the next generation of politicians. Under California\u2019s new top-two primary system, the top two candidates in the first round will advance to the general election, regardless of their party. In a column on the Huffington Post website, Steyer said he was intrigued by the opportunity of taking on interests in Washington that \u201coppose recognizing global warming and fight against the rights and futures of average Americans.\u201d \u201cWashington needs to be shaken up and we need climate champions who will fight for the next generation,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cCalifornia Democrats are blessed to have a deep bench of talent, and I will decide soon based on what I think is the best way to continue the hard work we have already started together to prevent climate disaster and preserve American prosperity.\u201d Steyer and Harris would be among the most formidable contenders for Boxer\u2019s seat, along with former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has said he is \u201cseriously considering\u201d a run. Several members of the California congressional delegation and of the state leadership have signaled interest, including Rep. Loretta Sanchez, Rep. John Garamendi, and state Treasurer John Chiang. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Sanchez touted her focus on working families, immigration reform and affordable healthcare: \u201d I have advocated for policies that give all families the same access to the American Dream,\u201d she said. \u201cCalifornians deserve a strong voice in Washington and I have never been afraid to speak up, which is why I am seriously considering running for the United States Senate in 2016.\u201d But lesser-known candidates could face great difficulty raising the money needed to run. Boxer raised some $35 million in conjunction with party committees for her 2010 race against former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina. Steyer, a former hedge fund manager from San Francisco whose net worth has been estimated at $1.6 billion by Forbes, has pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune to public interest and philanthropic causes during his lifetime. He has been a vocal opponent of the Keystone XL pipeline and a free-spending advocate for California environmental causes. His NextGen Climate Action Committee spent more than $74 million in the midterm elections \u2013 much of it Steyer\u2019s money \u2013 trying to defeat candidates who had expressed doubt about climate change, but they had little demonstrable success in a Republican wave year. As a candidate, Steyer\u2019s investments throughout his business career are also likely to come under uncomfortable scrutiny. Last year, for example, the New York Times examined lucrative investments by Steyer\u2019s former fund, Farallon Capital Management in companies across the globe that own coal-fired power plants. Harris, the former district attorney of San Francisco who was just re-elected to her second term as attorney general, was the first to formally declare her candidacy since Boxer announced last week that she would not run for re-election in 2016. While Villaraigosa could build a strong Southern California base, and draw on his support from California\u2019s growing Latino community,  Harris also has a solid fundraising base in California from her two statewide runs and her close alliance with President Barack Obama. She has won praise as attorney general for pursuing banks that did not follow proper procedures when they foreclosed on the properties of California homeowners and she has kept a steady focus on reducing recidivism and truancy. \u201cFrom my first days as a prosecutor in Alameda County, to my work as San Francisco District Attorney to my current service as California Attorney General, I have worked to bring smart, innovative and effective approaches to fighting crime, fighting for consumers and fighting for equal rights for all,\u201d Harris said in a statement on her new campaign web page Tuesday. \u201cI will be a fighter for the next generation on the critical issues facing our country. I will be a fighter for middle class families who are feeling the pinch of stagnant wages and diminishing opportunity,\u201d she continued. \u201cI will be a fighter for our children who deserve a world-class education, and for students burdened by predatory lenders and skyrocketing tuition. And I will fight relentlessly to protect our coast, our immigrant communities and our seniors.\u201d Gavin Newsom passes on bid for Boxer\u2019s seat Harris\u2019 position was strengthened on Monday when Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom bowed out of contention. Speculation had swirled around the possibility of a heated race between Harris, 50, and Newsom, 47, who could have potentially split the Northern California vote, clearing the way for a Southern California candidate like Villaraigosa. Newsom has told many confidantes that he is interested in running for governor when Jerry Brown faces term limits in 2018, and he and Harris share the same political consultants. In a statement on his Facebook page, Newsom said it was better \u201cto be candid than be coy\u201d and noted that it would be better for his three children, Montana, Hunter and Brooklynn, if he stayed in California. \u201cWhile I am humbled by the widespread encouragement of so many and hold in the highest esteem those who serve us in federal office, I know that my head and my heart, my young family\u2019s future and our unfinished work all remain firmly in the state of California \u2013 not Washington, D.C. Therefore I will not seek election to the U.S. Senate in 2016,\u201d Newsom said. Hinting at his potential alliance with Harris, he added that in the months to come, he looked \u201cforward to doing whatever I can to help elect California\u2019s next great Democratic senator \u2013 one worthy of succeeding Barbara Boxer and serving this remarkable state of dreamers and doers in the United States Senate.\u201d Shortly after Boxer announced that she would retire from the Senate in 2016, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he would not run for the seat.",

            "article_content": "House will vote Tuesday on whether John Boehner will serve a third term as Speaker Boehner is facing conservative opposition but is still expected to win This isn\u2019t how House Speaker John Boehner wanted to start 2015. He\u2019s presiding over a historic majority in the House while the Senate is controlled by Republicans for the first time in nearly a decade. But the Ohio Republican is still wrestling with a familiar problem that could threaten his agenda over the next two years: conservative unrest. That dynamic was on display Tuesday when a surprisingly large group of Republicans voted against giving Boehner a third term as Speaker. \u201cI think a lot of Republicans are looking for a new direction,\u201d Oklahoma GOP Rep. Jim Bridenstine, one of those saying he\u2019ll back another candidate, told CNN. This group, which includes about a dozen lawmakers, is almost certain to fail. But even if they don\u2019t block Boehner from another term wielding the Speaker\u2019s gavel, their opposition is a fresh reminder of Boehner\u2019s struggles to control his rank-and-file just as he and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell try to prove that Republicans can govern heading into 2016. And the drama is all playing out amid turmoil in the leadership ranks after revelations that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise once spoke to a white supremacist group, unfortunate news for a party that is trying to expand its reach to minorities ahead of the next presidential election. READ: The GOP agenda Although he already got the nod to keep his post by the House Republican conference after the midterms in November, Boehner doesn\u2019t officially get the gavel again until a majority of members vote for him on the House floor on Tuesday. If 29 GOP members vote for someone else, they can force a potentially embarrassing second ballot \u2013 with the scene playing out on live C-SPAN cameras. The opposition movement isn\u2019t entirely unexpected. Two years ago, Boehner faced a similar, poorly organized effort when a dozen House Republicans backed other candidates or declined to vote for him. Some Boehner opponents say their position isn\u2019t personal. They just don\u2019t like the way he ran the House. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about John Boehner,\u201d Bridenstine said. Republicans looking for an alternative \u201cjust want to make sure that we\u2019re doing the right thing on behalf of our constituents.\u201d Rep. King explains why he opposes Boehner for Speaker Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert and Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, who are tea party favorites, announced they would run for the Speaker. In an interview on CNN Monday, Rep. Steve King of Iowa floated Florida Rep. Daniel Webster as another possible candidate. But even Bridenstine conceded no one can defeat Boehner outright. Kentucky Republican Rep. Tom Massie told reporters he opposed Boehner not because he wasn\u2019t conservative enough, but because he failed to give members enough input into legislation like the massive spending bill that passed in December. Conservatives were angry that the bill didn\u2019t do anything to block President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration executive order. Massie estimated there were between 10 and 50 House Republicans who could back an alternative to Boehner. Still, he said he was only confident that those who have publicly announced they opposed Boehner would actually follow through and vote for someone else on the House floor. Massie declined to tell reporters on Monday night who he was supporting. Indiana Rep. Marlin Stuzman, another conservative Boehner critic, told reporters Monday he was still deciding who to back and was hoping he and others trying to force a change in leadership could agree on a \u201cconsensus candidate.\u201d Boehner\u2019s allies say they aren\u2019t worried about him losing his job and GOP members across the ideological spectrum left the first meeting of all House Republicans on Monday night predicting the Speaker would be re-elected. Even Texas Rep. Roger Williams, who told CNN he didn\u2019t always support Boehner, said he thought the Speaker would overcome the challenge, and that he deserved a chance to shepherd a conservative agenda through a new session. At a time when GOP leaders want to turn the page on the dysfunction that has dominated Capitol Hill, this latest effort feeds into the familiar narrative that played out over the past four years that Boehner can\u2019t control his conference. \u201cThis is a last moment sideshow,\u201d Rep Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Boehner supporter, told CNN. He added: \u201cthe sad thing is it distracts from what our messages ought to be. We ought to be talking about the Republican agenda \u2013 about the possibilities now that we have the Senate \u2013 about Keystone, about fixes on Obamacare, trade regulatory reform.\u201d Michael Steel, a spokesman for the Speaker, said Boehner is \u201cconfident he\u2019ll remain the Speaker.\u201d Indeed, Boehner has laid a groundwork for being re-elected. He reached out individually by phone to House GOP members after the midterms and was the party\u2019s top fundraiser in 2014, collecting chits along the campaign trail. According to his political staff, the Speaker brought in over $100 million over the 2014 cycle, and traveled extensively for members and candidates, attending 150 events. In Monday evening\u2019s meeting in the Capitol basement, Boehner didn\u2019t specifically address his critics. But he made a general pitch to his fellow Republicans on the need to stay united in the new Congress, according to several GOP members who attended the session. He noted his party had a real opportunity to get some of their top priorities done if they worked as a team. Still, some outside groups are trying to whip up a grassroots campaign to get conservative activists to call in and demand members vote against Boehner. READ: GOP moves early to court conservative Christians FreedomWorks, a group with strong tea party ties, is part of this effort, but Boehner supporters say this group and others who have been critical of the Speaker have a history of seizing on internal feuds to raise money. Boehner slammed some of these conservative groups out after the 2013 government shutdown, arguing they are more concerned with their elevating their own profile than helping the GOP govern effectively. South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, who didn\u2019t vote for Boehner in 2013, wouldn\u2019t say how he would vote on Tuesday. But he appeared to criticize the anti-Boehner forces for not standing up and saying they wanted someone else earlier this fall. \u201cWe had an election for Speaker in November and no one opposed John Boehner. I find it hard to believe that those folks who really don\u2019t like Mr. Boehner today suddenly discovered they didn\u2019t like him between November and today,\u201d Mulvaney said. In addition to his own political problems, Boehner is also opening the new Congress grappling with a scandal caused by a top Republican ally. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the third ranking House GOP leader who is tasked with counting votes, admitted last month he spoke to a white supremacist group in 2002. Scalise apologized and renounced the group, which has ties to former Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke. Boehner stood behind him calling him a \u201cman of high integrity and good character.\u201d But some Republicans outside Congress are calling on Scalise to step aside, to prevent any damage to the party\u2019s efforts to diversify its supporters. House Democrats are already using the Scalise story \u2013 targeting 30 House Republicans in competitive districts and challenging them to publicly say whether or not they support him remaining in his post. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, asked Monday whether Scalise should stay, took a jab at the GOP, saying who Republicans choose as their elected leaders \u201csays a lot about who the conference is and what their priorities and values are.\u201d He also repeatedly noted that Scalise had referred to himself as \u201cDavid Duke without the baggage,\u201d but said it\u2019s up to Republicans on who they elect as their leaders. As the former chair of a group of influential House conservatives, Scalise is viewed as Boehner\u2019s bridge to those on the right, so any effort to push him out could hurt the Speaker at a time he needs to hold conservative support to keep his own job. For now, Scalise seems poised to remain in the leadership. Republicans are facing high expectations as they take full control of Congress. Many House GOP members and outside groups are saying they expect many items \u2013 such as changes to banking rules, Obamacare, environmental regulations \u2013 that Senate Democrats blocked to sail through now that McConnell is in charge. That might be easier said than done since Senate Republicans will still have to rely on Democratic votes to overcome filibusters and pass legislation. North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is a close personal friend of Boehner\u2019s said the Speaker will have to guide House members to concentrate on things that are doable. \u201cI think he has to tap down unrealistic initiatives and focus people on the tools we do have,\u201d Burr told reporters, mentioning using spending bills to strip away money for programs or limit the Administration\u2019s actions. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Adam Levy and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republicans are eager to shake off past scandals and seize control of both chambers of Congress Top agenda items for the GOP include: Approving the Keystone XL pipeline expansion and confronting the President House and Senate Republicans will huddle in a rare joint retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania in mid-January If Republican leaders can quell conservative dissatisfaction with House Speaker John Boehner, and no further drama comes out from the House leadership\u2019s No. 3 Rep. Steve Scalise, GOP heads hope to get back on track with their aggressive agenda to forcefully confront President Barack Obama on the top issues of the day, including the Keystone XL pipeline, immigration, health care and national security. Republicans believe their legislative plans will sharpen for voters the contrast between the GOP and Democrats, and set the stage for the 2016 presidential and congressional elections. \u201cThe first thing we need to do is demonstrate we heard what the voters were saying on Nov. 4.  To me, they said we want you to function and we want you to solve problems,\u201d Texas GOP Senator John Cornyn, the number two Republican leader, told CNN. Republicans have a long list of priorities, chief among them unraveling many of the president\u2019s signature policies on energy, health care, the environment, and banking. Their job won\u2019t be easy because for any bill to get through the Senate, the 54 Republicans will need a handful of Democratic votes. Republican leaders say they want to put on the floor compromise bills that can bridge the ideological gap between the most conservative members of the GOP and a small group of centrist Democrats who might vote with them. In addition, the President is vowing to veto major changes to his signature health care law or the recent immigration reforms he ordered. So anything Republicans hope to get signed into law will have to be negotiated with Obama, who they fiercely stood up to during his first six years in office. \u201cWhen the American people elect divided government, they\u2019re not saying they don\u2019t want anything done,\u201d a collaborative sounding incoming Senate Majority leader Sen. Mitch McConnell recently told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash.  \u201cWhat they are saying is they want things done in the political center, things that both sides can agree on.\u201d In a sign of how important Republicans are taking their new responsibilities, House and Senate Republicans will huddle in a rare joint retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania in mid-January to finalize and unite around their strategies for 2015. Approval of the Keystone pipeline, which the administration has delayed for years, tops the GOP agenda. Votes are planned on the House and Senate floor during the first two weeks of January. GOP leaders also plan quick votes on Obamacare and immigration. RELATED: Obama, Senate GOP to test new relationship If they pass, the President would be forced to either accept or reject the bills.  Republicans believe they win either way: If he signs them, Republicans will have accomplishment to point to.  If he vetoes them, the GOP can blame the President for blocking bipartisan bills. \u201cHopefully, the President will follow our lead and go in a different direction,\u201d McConnell said. McConnell has said also he wants to allow Democratic amendments to GOP bills, something Republicans were denied regularly by Democrats when they controlled the Senate. In doing so, McConnell believes he can build good will across the aisle and grow support for individual bills. He believes also, strategically, that Democrats will quickly run through a series of hot-button Democratic issues \u2013 like bolstering EPA regulations and boosting the minimum wage \u2013 that could be more difficult for GOP senators running again in swing states to vote on if they took place closer to the election. In the House, Boehner will have a larger majority \u2013 246 GOP seats \u2013 and aides from both parties expect the Speaker will be able to bypass Democrats push through most legislation with mainly Republican votes.  But because the continued internal tensions between conservatives and those GOP members hoping to resolve key policy issues will persist, Boehner might again need to turn to Democrats on key spending or fiscal matters. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the President we\u2019d be shuttered off to the side \u2013 we don\u2019t care what you think,\u201d Rep Steny Hoyer, the number two House Democrat told CNN.  While he said he was willing to work with GOP leaders, Hoyer said even in the minority Democrats would remain relevant in major policy debates because of GOP defections, and a key role for Democrats in the new Congress would be to work with the president to sustain any vetoes. Here is a look at what Republicans have in the works: Keystone/energy \u2013 Republicans say construction of the pipeline is an easy way to create jobs and lessen U.S. dependence on oil from the Middle East.   A Senate bill fell one vote shy of the 60 needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster in November.  Republican leaders are confident they can pass it now but acknowledge it\u2019s unlikely they can get 67 votes to override a presidential veto. RELATED: Senate eyes Keystone fight Economy/jobs \u2013 In 2014, House Republicans passed a series of narrowly focused bills designed to create new jobs. Many of these rolled back federal regulations on manufacturers, which the GOP argued prevented businesses from expanding. Some passed with bipartisan support but hit a wall in the Democratic-controlled Senate.  Now Republicans are scheduling new votes on these same bills in both chambers and hope to garner enough support to send them to the President. Obamacare \u2013 The day after the midterm election Boehner and McConnell promised to keep up their effort to repeal Obamacare, which not a single Republican voted for when it was enacted.  They recognize they don\u2019t have the votes to get over a certain presidential veto of a complete repeal so are looking at smaller changes to the law that are supported by bipartisan lawmakers. The first week back House GOP leaders scheduled votes on two measures increase the threshold employers have to reach to provide healthcare to workers from 30 to 40 hours per week.  One GOP bill deals narrowly with changing the law to encourage hiring more veterans and another is a broader proposal affecting all businesses. Votes are likely on doing away with the medical device tax that helps pay for the law. There is an internal debate among Republicans whether to use a special budget tool \u2013 known as \u201creconciliation\u201d \u2013 that could allow them to pass a repeal in the Senate with just 51 votes.  But because the President has said he will veto that bill, some Republicans want to save reconciliation, which can only be used once, for another priority, like tax reform, entitlement changes, or energy policy. Immigration: Boehner vowed he would fight \u201ctooth and nail\u201d to reverse the president\u2019s executive actions, enacted in November, to allow roughly 5 million undocumented workers to remain in the U.S.  Funding for the Department of Homeland Security runs out at the end of February. Late last year, Republicans would only agree to fund the agency, which needs to carry out the immigration orders, until then because they want to try to force the President to reverse course. The standoff has the risk of shuttering the department, which responds to terrorism, natural disasters and other politically-sensitive matters.  Republicans are readying action on this issue soon \u2013 likely in the House in the second week of January. Tax reform: Members have both parties have stressed they want to simplify the tax code, but a major impasse has prevented progress.  Republicans oppose measures that could be characterized as a tax hike.  Democrats want to expand current tax breaks such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, but some in the GOP argue these are abused by undocumented workers.  Democrats also want to close loopholes for corporations, which Republicans oppose. Foreign policy and National Security: Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Syria likely will dominate the agenda.  Republicans are vowing to push back on the President\u2019s executive actions to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba but aren\u2019t settled on a strategy yet on how to do it.  They also oppose his negotiations with Iran over that nation\u2019s nuclear program and may quickly call a vote on a bipartisan bill to increase sanctions on Iran.  That could upset the delicate multinational talks that were recently extended. Congress is expected to act early in 2015 on a new use of force authorization against ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria.  That debate will focus on how much latitude to give the White House and whether to restrict the use of ground troops as many Democrats want. IRS/Benghazi: Republican-led investigations will continue into whether the IRS unfairly targeted conservative groups and whether the administration covered up its handling of the Benghazi attacks. Democrats complain both investigations are politically motivated and should be ended. Trade/Infrastructure: Republicans will likely advance trade bills that were opposed by many House and Senate Democrats.  New spending for upgrading the nation\u2019s roads and bridges in another area where both parties could cobble together a bipartisan vote.   McConnell told CNN in December, \u201cWe have certainly a lot of bipartisan interest in the crumbling infrastructure in the country and what to do about it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "There are 10 lawmakers who've committed to voting against Boehner, or voting \"present\" Leadership aides say they remain confident Boehner will hold his position as speaker Reps. Ted Yoho and Louie Gohmert have offered themselves as alternatives Conservative momentum to oust John Boehner from House leadership during Tuesday\u2019s election for speaker continued to build through the weekend, with two alternatives emerging and a national conservative group joining the effort. On Monday, Virginia Rep.-elect Dave Brat became the latest to confirm his intention to vote against Boehner for speaker. On Sunday night, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and Iowa Rep. Steve King also came out opposed to Boehner. In an op-ed published on Breitbart.com, King outlined a litany of complaints with the Speaker, arguing Boehner hasn\u2019t done enough to oppose President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law or the President\u2019s executive action on immigration and pointing to passage of the recent government funding bill, which tackled neither, as evidence. READ: Senate passes spending bill, averting shutdown Leadership aides, however, remain confident that Boehner will hold onto his position as the top Republican in the House. Conservatives need to gather nearly 30 lawmakers opposed to him to force a second round of voting in the race. But the developing coup attempt is the latest reminder for the Ohio Republican that conservatives remain a troublesome and unpredictable force in his caucus that can cause public embarrassment if not out-and-out regime change. \u201cWe need a Speaker who will help us all keep our oath, including his own, to the Constitution, not one who has consistently blocked our efforts to keep ours. I will vote for an alternative candidate for Speaker,\u201d King wrote. Those frustrations are shared by many of his fellow conservatives, and the passage of the cromnibus last month pushed already simmering tensions with Boehner to a boiling point. And it threatens to start things off on precisely the wrong foot for Republicans as they take full control of Congress and seek to prove to Americans they\u2019re the party that can govern in time for 2016. There are at least 10 lawmakers who have publicly said they\u2019ll oppose Boehner or vote \u201cpresent\u201d in the election for speaker. READ: Boehner\u2019s challengers: Gohmert, Yoho GOP Reps. Ted Yoho of Florida and Louie Gohmert of Texas both offered themselves up as alternatives to Boehner this weekend, after two prominent conservatives in the House \u2014\u00a0Rep. Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma and Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014\u00a0came out publicly opposed to him. North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones, an early organizer of the effort to unseat Boehner, told a local North Carolina paper that he plans to support Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida, whose name will also be offered as an alternative to Boehner on Tuesday. \u201cI want us to have a leader who is willing to stand up for conservative, religious principles I believe in. It is to make a statement and it\u2019s based on many months of consideration,\u201d Jones said. National conservative group FreedomWorks has launched a national campaign in support of the effort, urging its members to call their lawmaker and tell them to vote against the Ohio Republican as speaker. And Bridenstine launched a short-lived website pitching Gohmert as speaker that included endorsements from both himself and Massie for the Texas Republican, which was soon after wiped of its content. Still, none of the lawmakers who have offered themselves as potential alternatives are favorites of the far-right. Other prominent conservatives,  including Fox News host Sean Hannity, have offered Rep. Trey Gowdy up for the job, but Gowdy has declined. A coup attempt orchestrated by many of the same lawmakers two years ago fell short of the votes needed to force a second ballot, with only a dozen conservatives voting against Boehner. And since then, many of those have expressed a change of heart, coming out in support of the Ohio Republican as Speaker \u2014 including prominent conservative Reps. Mick Mulvaney, Tim Huelskamp and Raul Labrador. But conservatives say they\u2019re confident now that alternative options have stepped forward, they can corral the needed votes to at least force the election to a second ballot, where they hope Boehner will drop out of the race. They also note that many members of the freshman class promised to vote against Boehner on the campaign trail \u2014\u00a0including Dave Brat, the Republican who ousted former Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary \u2013 and are looking to them\u00a0to round out their numbers. On Monday morning, Brat stood by that promise, also in an op-ed on Breitbart. It\u2019s unclear what efforts leadership has undertaken to whip support for the speaker. Colorado Rep.-elect Ken Buck, the GOP freshman class president, said he hasn\u2019t heard from the speaker \u2014 but he has heard from Boehner\u2019s opponents. \u201cI have not talked to anybody in the Speaker\u2019s office. I have not talked to the Speaker. I have not heard that he is reaching out to anybody in the freshman class,\u201d Buck told CNN in an interview Monday. \u201cOn the other end, I have received some calls.\u201d Daniel Horowitz, a conservative strategist and editor of ConservativeReview.com, said that the situation is \u201cvery fluid\u201d but expressed cautious optimism. \u201cThis is a much more robust effort than any of us ever hoped,\u201d he said. He noted, however, that \u201cthings could still fall apart\u201d in the final day before the election, and that he expects Boehner and his allies are applying heavy pressure on the incoming freshmen to make sure they fall in line. Following the last coup attempt, a handful of the members who voted against Boehner were removed from their positions on plum House committees. This time around, conservatives say they\u2019re not worried about punishment. Yoho said on Monday during an interview on Fox News that \u201cI fear no man.\u201d \u201cThere should not be any retribution. We\u2019re doing what my voters want me to do,\u201d he said. But he promised to support whomever eventually wins the election for speaker \u2014\u00a0at least for the next session. \u201cI\u2019ll go up to \u2018em, I\u2019ll thank \u2018em and I\u2019ll tell \u2018em, you\u2019re the speaker for the next two years, and I look forward to working with you to solve America\u2019s problems,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Republicans are vying for support from Christian conservatives Tony Perkins: 'It is going to be very competitive' The first votes of the 2016 campaign won\u2019t be cast for another year but there\u2019s already a race well underway: The Christian primary. Republicans are actively courting white evangelical and born again Christian voters, knowing they will be crucial in early-voting states such as Iowa and South Carolina. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal will meet with religious leaders Tuesday at two separate events in Iowa to promote the Response, a day of fasting, repentance and prayer focused on the future of the United States, a person close to Jindal tells CNN. While the Louisiana governor will encourage the Iowa religious leaders to attend the Jan. 24 Baton Rogue event, these influential social conservatives are also expected to question Jindal about his interest in seeking the GOP presidential nomination. On the same day, another gathering will take place in Des Moines, where at least seven potential GOP presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee, will address Iowa voters on \u201ccore principles\u201d that include \u201csocial conservatism,\u201d at a forum co-hosted by Citizens United and Iowa Rep. Steve King. Huckabee\u2019s announcement this weekend to end his Fox News Channel television program to explore a presidential bid will likely shake up the race and cause other potential like-minded conservative candidates to accelerate their decision making processes. The wooing of white evangelical and born again Christian voters by potential presidential candidates has been an ongoing process that began soon after President Barack Obama won a second term in 2012. In the past six months alone, Marco Rubio spoke at South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan\u2019s \u201cFaith and Freedom\u201d fundraiser; Jindal, Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry and Huckabee addressed the Iowa Family Leader Summit; and Ben Carson was the keynote speaker at the Family Leader\u2019s annual fundraising dinner. \u201cIt looks like we are going to have more social conservative candidates than we did the last time,\u201d said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. \u201cIt is going to be very competitive.\u201d READ: Ben Carson: Political phenomenon That\u2019s great for social conservatives who are yearning for Republican presidential candidates to speak openly and forcefully about the issues they care about: abortion, religious liberty, and same sex marriage, among others. But a competitive primary could wind up hurting their cause if they aren\u2019t able to unite behind one or two candidates. The splintering of white evangelical and born again Christians may provide an opening for a more centrist candidate to win the Republican nomination \u2013 leaving social conservatives, once again, frustrated that a candidate of their political stripe failed to win. \u201cFrom my perspective, it would be a whole lot wiser for us to coalesce behind one candidate than divide up,\u201d said Bob Vander Plaats, president and CEO of the Family Leader. \u201cBut that is easier said than done. I think you let the process play out and if there is an opening, then coalesce. I think you try to do it, but I am not confident.\u201d This lack of certainty has some leaders in the social conservative movement already engaged in discussions about how to avoid diluting their power, especially in Iowa and South Carolina. For these leaders, the hope is to prevent a repeat of 2012 when Mitt Romney \u2013 considered the more centrist, establishment candidate \u2013 won the nomination in a crowded field of self-described social conservatives. Romney was initially declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses by a mere eight votes over Santorum, who made social conservatism a major part of his campaign. Several weeks later, after all the caucus votes were certified, it was announced that Santorum, not Romney, had actually won Iowa. But it was too late. Romney had the wind at his back and eventually went on to win the nomination. A review of the 2012 Iowa caucus entrance poll shows that Santorum won the white evangelical and born Christian vote with 32%, while the remaining support split among five of his rivals: Ron Paul, 19%; Newt Gingrich, 14%; Perry, 14%; and Michele Bachmann, 5%. WATCH: Michele Bachmann\u2019s not so quiet exit What if the white evangelical and born again voters had backed Santorum over one of the other five candidates? It is not clear if a win in Iowa would have changed the ultimate outcome of Romney winning the nomination. After all, he had the money, infrastructure, and backing of the GOP establishment. But naming Romney the initial winner of the caucuses deprived Santorum the chance to fully seize on an important moment in the campaign. \u201cAt the time, we thought it was ok,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, a senior aide on Santorum\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cWe got all of the publicity and we called it a win, because we were outspent by so much. But looking back on it, we didn\u2019t realize it at the time what comes along with a win in Iowa such as the cover Newsweek, the cover of Time, all of the major publications would have pronounced Rick Santorum as the blue collar conservative and winner of Iowa.\u201d Social conservative leaders also note that John McCain won the 2008 nomination under similar circumstances \u2013 a fractured social conservative base. \u201cWhat has happened in the last two presidential election cycles is that the candidates that the Christian conservatives favored split the votes up,\u201d said Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association. \u201cWhen you get three or four social conservative candidates splitting up the vote, McCain and Romney are going to win.\u201d Jeb Bush and Chris Christie are two names that are often mentioned by social conservatives as centrist candidates who would benefit if the Christian vote splits between several candidates in this election cycle. READ: Christie says Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 ambitions are not a factor Discussions on how to rally Christian conservatives behind one candidate are quietly taking place on many levels, according to several sources familiar with the effort. The most influential group is the Council for National Policy, whose membership includes leaders representing prominent social conservative organizations. GOP candidates are invited to address the CNP in private meetings. \u201cMy goal will be to give conservative leaders every opportunity to see the candidates, to get to know them and to do an apples to apples comparison at the right time,\u201d said Perkins, who also serves as the CNP\u2019s president. \u201cIf that time comes, encourage people to get behind a candidate. But I don\u2019t think it is going to be something that happens early.\u201d The next CNP meeting is expected to happen in early 2015. A major roadblock in unifying behind a singular candidate is the deep, personal relationships that social conservative activists and leaders have developed with individual candidates over the years. As one activist noted, \u201cYou bleed with them in battle. There are alliances, friendships \u2026 people who worked hard for you. You don\u2019t want to burn them.\u201d But this lack of early unity in the Christian conservative ranks gives the candidates time to sell their vision of governing to this important Republican constituency. And it has already begun in small meetings in Iowa and South Carolina as well as large public meetings over the past year. Heading into 2015, the Conservative Political Action Conference is the biggest meeting \u2013 drawing activists and leaders to the Washington suburbs in late February. In the spring, the Faith & Freedom Coalition is expected to hold its meeting in Washington, followed by the Values Voter Summit in the fall. And the Family Leader will host its leadership summit in Iowa. READ: Evangelicals step back from gay marriage fight Sprinkled throughout these events will be dinners, fundraisers and candidate forums in several states \u2013 all soapboxes for candidates to woo social conservatives. Penny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women for America, said at the very base level, candidates need to embrace social conservative positions on \u201clife, marriage, religious freedom, and support for Israel.\u201d But Nance noted that championing these policy positions is not enough for the candidates if they hope to receive support from conservative Christian voters. \u201cYou have to have a winsome personality,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have got to have a message that works, that people understand, that deals with the issues that are in the hearts of the voters. And you need to have muscle, infrastructure, ground game and money to win. If you don\u2019t have one of these it will be very hard.\u201d Over and over again, Christian conservative activists and leaders emphasized that they are not a single issue constituency group \u2013 noting that candidates need to weave their personal position on social issues into their overall governing plan. \u201cEvangelical voters are concerned about other issues: the economy, immigration, foreign policy and the U.S. decline on the world stage,\u201d said Dr. Tony Beam, an ordained Southern Baptist minister who hosts a morning drive Christian talk radio program in Greenville, South Carolina. Huckabee\u2019s decision to give up a lucrative television deal at Fox News Channel sends a powerful signal to religious leaders who may have questioned whether he was truly committed to running for President. For now, it would appear that Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and Southern Baptist minister, would have an early edge in the Christian primary \u2013 a group of voters he has been courting since his 2008 presidential run. \u201cThere is no doubt he excites a healthy portion of the still-substantial social conservative base and he also appeals to middle class voters, which have deserted Republicans in the past two presidential elections,\u201d said Steve Deace, an Iowa-based nationally syndicated radio talk show host. Huckabee knows how to speak to white evangelical and born again Christian voters, and emphasized that he was leaving Fox New Channel because he believed that \u201cGod hasn\u2019t put me on earth just to have a good time or to make a good living, but rather has put me on earth to try to make a good life.\u201d This type of language is important, because a deep understanding of social conservative issues will be closely watched by leaders and activists who make up the movement. \u201cWhatever they say, they need to truly believe it,\u201d said Lisa Van Riper, a longtime social conservative activist in South Carolina. \u201cThey need to have a clear action plan, not just give lip service. They need to talk about the current situation and need to be fluid in that and what specific kinds of policies they might propose. If they\u2019ve done something on the issues, it gives them a lot more credibility than just talking about it.\u201d Mark DeMoss, a leading Christian public relations consultant, said that in the past ideology has trumped pragmatism when social conservatives look at presidential candidates, although he noted in recent year there has been \u201ca little more willingness to not have perfect alignment [on issues] in exchange for trying to win.\u201d Still, DeMoss added, this ideological standard is unique to politics, not to everyday life. \u201cWe don\u2019t apply it in business, in school, hiring of a plumber, a painter or an architect,\u201d said DeMoss, who was a senior adviser on Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThere is nothing else we do in life where this person has to be my stripe of Christian or I won\u2019t work with them. I think it is a double standard litmus test.\u201d",

Ted Yoho, R-Florida, said this weekend that he won\u2019t support Boehner as speaker when lawmakers vote Tuesday, and offered himself up as an alternative. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, did the same thing on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox and Friends Sunday.\u201d \u201cWell, we have heard from a lot of Republicans that, \u2018Gee, I would vote for somebody besides Speaker Boehner but nobody will put their name out there as running so there\u2019s nobody else to vote for,\u2019\u201d Gohmert said. Conservative call for Boehner coup grows louder \u201cWell that changed yesterday when my friend Ted Yoho said \u2018I\u2019m putting my name out there. I\u2019ll be a candidate for speaker,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m putting my name out there also, today, to be another candidate for speaker. All people are welcome, unlike what some of the establishment people are saying.\u201d His comments come as conservatives simmer over a 10-month government funding measure that both Boehner and President Barack Obama backed in December. Conservatives saw that measure \u2013 in the wake of the GOP\u2019s major midterm election victories \u2013 as the time to fight Obama on health care reform, his immigration executive action and more. Gohmert\u2019s move comes after another Republican, Rep. Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma, said that he\u2019ll be voting against Boehner as well. Bridenstine said Sunday that both Yoho and Gohmert are good alternatives. \u201cIn my opinion, this vote is between continuing the status quo or moving in a new direction,\u201d Bridenstine said in a statement. \u201cMembers of Congress now have two good choices, neither one including a vote for the status quo.\u201d Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar announced late Sunday he too will not be voting for Boehner. \u201cAmerica needs bold leadership from the House of Representatives that breaks from the status quo and embraces an open and transparent legislative process,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOur country deserves getting back to regular order and holding wrongdoers accountable for their actions. This will require courage, not fear.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chloe Sommers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican lawmakers insist they can strike some big deals with the White House in the coming months \u2013 as long as President Barack Obama goes along with their ideas. The first test of how the new Washington will operate \u2013 whether Obama will bend to the GOP\u2019s will, and how hard the GOP will fight each battle \u2013 could be the Keystone XL pipeline, a 1,179-mile project that Republicans love, environmentalists oppose and the State Department has gone six years without approving. READ: Senate eyes Keystone fight Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged the first measure the Republican-controlled Senate will take up this January will be one authorizing the pipeline\u2019s construction. Obama, meanwhile, has signaled he could veto it. Obama: Keystone issue is Canadian oil \u201cIt is going to be a bellwether decision by the President,\u201d Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Other Republicans made similar arguments Sunday. \u201cThis will certainly be a way in which we can measure where he\u2019s going to come down,\u201d Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, told Fox News. Keystone is one of the high-profile issues lawmakers will have on their plate after being sworn in Tuesday. So far, GOP lawmakers haven\u2019t explained how they\u2019ll soften their own positions to reach agreements with Obama, while insisting he should meet them on their terms on Keystone and more. Still, with control of both the House and Senate, they also said on Sunday it\u2019s up to them to prove the legislative process can function properly \u2013 something they can\u2019t do without Obama\u2019s help. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of serious issues that need to be addressed. The bigger issues absolutely require the President to be involved, and I think with anticipation, we look forward to that opportunity,\u201d Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, told Fox News on Sunday. Lawmakers debate whether to give Obama an updated authorization to use military force against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. They\u2019ll need to extend Homeland Security funding past February. Two of Obama\u2019s major nominees need Senate confirmation: Ashton Carter as Defense secretary, and Loretta Lynch as attorney general. Government funding and debt issues loom larger \u2013 with Republicans\u2019 leverage increased now that they control the Senate. But some top conservatives say they\u2019re hopeful they can strike deals on at least some major issues. \u201cBased on our past experience, it would be a triumph of hope over experience,\u201d Thune said. \u201cBut you always enter a new session of Congress with high hopes, and I know that Republicans in the Senate are looking forward to and are willing to work with the President on areas where we can create jobs and grow the economy and strengthen America\u2019s middle class, and I hope the President will meet us there,\u201d he said. Many Republicans say the party has something to prove. New Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the mark of a functional Congress is sending measures to Obama\u2019s desk that the President actually signs into law \u2013 citing Keystone and regulatory legislation as possibilities. But others say it\u2019s up to Obama to set the tone for the weeks ahead. \u201cHe has an opportunity to actually show that he wants to work with Congress,\u201d said incoming freshman Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah. Another incoming freshman senator, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, said many of the debates that will start in the coming weeks will extend into the next presidential campaign. \u201cWe need to demonstrate an ability to govern,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cBut we also need to admit that the big challenges facing this country aren\u2019t going to be solved in the next 24 months. We need to set the stage for a 2016 presidential election.\u201d The roster of Republican senators who could soon launch White House bids is long. It includes Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has used every congressional spending debate as a chance to face off with Democrats over Obamacare; Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has called for less U.S. intervention overseas; and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who has insisted he\u2019ll try to shut down Obama\u2019s recent diplomatic move with Cuba. Republicans are also set on challenging Obama\u2019s recent moves on immigration, climate change, extending nuclear talks with Iran and more. GOP lawmakers insist they have strong grounds to try to block Obama on those issues, while also rolling back his health care law, in whole and in part: Voters ousted Democrats from the Senate majority and extended conservatives\u2019 advantage in the House in November\u2019s midterm elections. \u201cWe\u2019ll be voting on things I know he\u2019s not going to like and I hope we can put them on his desk,\u201d McConnell told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash in an interview aired Sunday on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d But Washington\u2019s dynamics have shifted again since the election. Obama announced executive moves to overhaul U.S. immigration policies, thaw the diplomatic freeze with Cuba, curtail environmentally harmful emissions, extend nuclear talks with Iran and more \u2013 all moves he delayed until after the elections, but that made 2014\u2019s final weeks by far his most active. Eager to keep his momentum from being stalled by the new Congress \u2013 where the GOP will control both the House and the Senate for the first time in his presidency \u2013 Obama is hitting the road. RELATED: White House aims to avoid year of reaction He\u2019s planning a three-day campaign-style swing later this week in which he\u2019ll talk higher education in Tennessee, housing in Arizona and jobs in Michigan \u2013 previews of themes that will appear in his State of the Union speech on Jan. 20. That trip is likely to be followed by more, as Obama works to send Republicans the message that he won\u2019t be giving ground on his top accomplishments and priorities. \u201cThe President is eager to get to work, and looks forward to working with the new Congress on policies that will make sure middle class Americans are sharing in the economic recovery,\u201d said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. \u201cThere are a number of issues we could make progress on, but the President is clear that he will not let this Congress undo important protections gained \u2013 particularly in areas of health care, Wall Street reform and the environment,\u201d Schultz said.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama, freed from the burden of further elections, is hoping to get things done From normalizing relations with Cuba to pressing for immigration changes, Obama is active The lame duck is loose. Little more than two years before the moment he stands next to his successor at the presidential inauguration of 2017, President Barack Obama is feeling unshackled from the constraints of eyeing the next election cycle after last month\u2019s disastrous midterms for Democrats. Simply put, top White House officials say, the President is on a mission to get stuff done. From his dramatic decision to open up diplomatic relations with Cuba to his executive actions on immigration, Obama no longer has to worry about the hand-wringing of endangered Senate Democrats concerned with reelection. READ: The wait for Cuban beaches and cigars continues \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d former White House press secretary and CNN political contributor Jay Carney said. \u201cHaving lost (the Senate), it does provide some liberation to him.\u201d The unbridled Obama even took the time to call in to a Massachusetts radio show to needle his friend, outgoing Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. The \u201cfourth quarter\u201d policy blitz that is underway at the West Wing is similar in some respects to the \u201cbear is loose\u201d image strategy the White House employed last summer. The looser and more active Obama appears, the more the public likes him, aides thought at the time. Asked how he felt about being a \u201clame duck\u201d at his post-midterm news conference, Obama said he planned to squeeze as much as he could into his final years in office. \u201cYou know, if you look at the history of almost every President, those last two years, all kinds of stuff happens. In some cases, stuff that we couldn\u2019t predict,\u201d the President said. Current White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama accomplished his goal of making 2014 a \u201cyear of action,\u201d filled with executive orders carried out with the President\u2019s \u201cpen and phone.\u201d \u201cThere is a lot more that needs to get done and the President has a long list of things that he\u2019s looking forward to tackling in the new year after a couple weeks with his family after the holidays,\u201d Earnest told reporters at his final press briefing of 2014. READ: 5 burning questions for Obama Privately, senior aides push back on the notion that Obama has adopted the newly frenetic pace solely because the midterms are behind him. The administration\u2019s sanctions on Russia may only now be paying dividends but they were applied over a course of the last year.  Re-establishing ties with Cuba, one official notes, was a long-term project that began 18 months ago. \u201cIf Democrats had kept the Senate, Obama would still be doing this,\u201d Carney said about Cuba. But Carney said the transfer of the gavel of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee from current chairman Sen. Bob Menendez \u2013 a Democrat and fierce critic of Obama\u2019s Cuba policy \u2013 to Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee may have helped somewhat. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult when the chairman is your own party member,\u201d Carney added. Losing control of Congress to Republicans has pushed Obama into the late presidency \u201crefuge\u201d of foreign policy. \u201cHe has an enormous capacity to act and that, I think, is what he is doing,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East analyst at the Wilson Center. Case in point is the administration\u2019s long-delayed but persistent hope to contain Iran\u2019s nuclear program. A deadline for a deal with the Iranian government was pushed back again just weeks ago. \u201cHe\u2019s now in a position for a comprehensive agreement,\u201d Miller said of post-midterm Obama. Cuba is another matter. The unpredictability of the Castro brothers could create headaches for the Obama administration and, by extension, the Democrats heading into 2016. \u201cHillary is going to have a hard time with this one,\u201d Miller said. But successes in foreign policy could easily translate into higher approval ratings. Witness the strides made by Ronald Reagan at the end of the Cold War. Reagan\u2019s cry, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,\u201d still resonates today. Obama\u2019s standing in public opinion polls are situated nearly where Reagan\u2019s popularity stood at the same point in his second term, according to Andrew Kohut, the founding director of the respected Pew Research Center. \u201cIndeed views of Obama are not any worse than were attitudes toward Ronald Reagan at about this time in his second term. Understanding the arc of a presidential popularity rating, especially one as varied as Obama\u2019s, requires a longer perspective than a single midterm snapshot,\u201d Andrew Kohut, Pew Research Center\u2019s founding director wrote in a Politico op-ed. Reagan was also buoyed by a rapidly expanding economy.  As the Obama White House is finding, the economic picture is finally brightening after the worst recession since the Great Depression. \u201cThe economy is doing well. It\u2019s in a good place. It\u2019s going to be in a better place,\u201d Carney said.",

            "article_content": "The Obama legacy likely will include many elements One will be the economy It might even be THE one in the long-term of history There will be plenty of legacy items by which to judge President Barack Obama. Obamacare, for instance: Whether the new law that seeks health insurance for every American is a prudent piece of policy or an albatross of government overreach is a matter of opinion. How about drawing down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? What about his efforts to police suspected terrorists abroad through the use of deadly drone strikes? None of these, in the long run, might be as important as his efforts to help the economy, which, ironically, has felt stronger just as Americans\u2019 faith in Obama to steer it has dwindled. Economic impact of November jobs report Granholm: Put min wage on state ballots Gov. Granholm defends Michigan record According to a Pew Research Center poll from November, just 31% of Americans approve of the way he is handling the economy. By one measure, the Obama economy is almost back to par. If he\u2019s lucky, the economy might be able to save his second term. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to tell the future,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton who has written about presidents and their legacies for CNN. \u201cIf the economy moves in a positive direction and in the next two years we are really out of the sluggish economy that he started his presidency with, people will value that.\u201d What sort of value remains to be seen. The short-memory syndrome Certainly, handing off a good economy would help his long-term legacy. In the short term, there seems to be little appetite among Republicans on Capitol Hill for some of his legislative priorities like raising the minimum wage or passing an immigration reform bill. An emboldened president would enter those negotiations with a stronger hand. He\u2019d also have more power to sway budget negotiations that could affect future spending on social programs such as Medicare and Social Security. Stephen Weatherford, a political science professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said Americans have short memories. \u201cTo a kind of ironic extent, if presidents come in facing big problems and they\u2019re able to do something to solve those problems, people don\u2019t evaluate them based on those problems,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes a kind of, \u2018What have you done for me lately?\u2019 problem,\u201d said Weatherford, who thinks Obama\u2019s domestic legacy will be focused squarely on the health care law. \u201cI think if the health care law is in place and works, he\u2019ll be remembered really favorably,\u201d said Weatherford, comparing the law to the Great Society social programs enacted by President Lyndon Johnson. Are the right jobs coming back? 7% jobless rate is lowest in 5 years November jobs report released The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7% in November. It\u2019s an imperfect measure for the health of the economy. People long unemployed and who aren\u2019t looking for work aren\u2019t counted, for example. But that\u2019s the lowest unemployment rate since Obama was first elected president, when the rate sat at 6.8%. In hindsight, that 6.8% figure from 2008 seems low, either because Americans at the time were used to much lower jobless rates or because in the time since then we\u2019ve become used to much higher rates. In 2008, the economic ground was rumbling with talk of the potential for an economic apocalypse. The unemployment rate grew a full percentage point in the 2 1/2 months between his election that year and his inauguration in January 2009, and it peaked a little less than a year into his presidency at 10% in October 2009. Now we call it the Great Recession, something much worse than your father\u2019s recession but probably not quite as bad as your grandfather\u2019s Great Depression. The U.S. government took an activist approach to saving the economy. It began pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into bailouts of the banking and auto industries in the final days of the Bush administration. The Federal Reserve was just beginning to pump trillions of dollars into the economy through a menu of bond-buying programs and artificially low interest rates. Taking an approach, running with it Obama took this activist approach and ran with it. He spent a good portion of his new political capital passing a nearly $800 billion stimulus program opposed by all but three Republicans in the Senate. The rollout of the stimulus, by the way, was beset by a flawed website and created a huge political headache as those hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars flooded into the economy \u2013 the effect was not immediately felt by everyone and it was hard to quantify as it was spread across years. Even if the recovery is felt most prominently in the coming years, it could affect perception of those early programs, Zelizer said. \u201cIf the last two years of the Obama presidency are filled with a possibility economy, it\u2019s going to change the way we view the stimulus and his other economic programs,\u201d he said. Temporary increases to food stamps authorized by the stimulus package only ran out at the beginning of November. Temporary increases in unemployment insurance are set to run out at the end of this year. The ultimate effect of billions spent on infrastructure had a short-term effect on jobs, but will also have long-term benefits. Continued growth will come with growing pains. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke or his soon-to-be successor Janet Yellen are expected to taper off the Fed programs that have helped buoy the back end of the economy and kept interest rates down. The Congressional Budget Office guessed that the stimulus kept the unemployment rate 2% lower than it otherwise would have been in 2010. That means the country could have faced 12% unemployment instead of 10% at the height of the Great Recession, but we\u2019ll never know for sure. What we do know is that the national debt skyrocketed as the federal government spent furiously to save the economy. The stimulus cost $830 billion, according to the CBO. Deficits have started to shrink as the economy has improved and Republicans in Congress have insisted on spending cuts. But the debt now stands at nearly $17 trillion. America\u2019s Debt: CNN Money special section A Wall Street rally; a widening divide But while the stock market has rallied during the Obama presidency \u2013 the Dow Jones Industrial Average has nearly doubled during his time in office \u2013 the divide between wealthy and struggling Americans has grown exponentially. Potentially rising interest rates and less help for the unemployed and the hungry as those stimulus programs run out could exacerbate the problem, which Obama has made clear will be a focus of his remaining time in office. \u201cI believe this is the defining challenge of our time:  Making sure our economy works for every working American. It\u2019s why I ran for President.  It was at the center of last year\u2019s campaign,\u201d Obama told a liberal group during a speech in an economically depressed area of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. \u201cIt drives everything I do in this office. And I know I\u2019ve raised this issue before, and some will ask why I raise the issue again right now.\u201d He later added that he think the government should be spending money to invest in creating opportunities for Americans. \u201cA relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity is a bigger threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit,\u201d he said. After his re-election, Obama extended Bush-era tax cuts for all but the wealthiest Americans, making good on his campaign effort to make them pay a little more in the coming years. The economy for years has been the issue that Americans want politicians to fix. More than health care or the Iraq war, the economy dominated the 2008 election \u2014 55% of voters said it was the most important problem facing the country. Four years later, when Obama was re-elected, the economy and unemployment split the top spot. Perhaps one sign of an improved economy is that a different poll, conducted by Gallup in October, found that the economy is no longer the top concern of Americans. Now it is \u201cgovernment dysfunction.\u201d Two academics wrote recently that Democratic presidents seem to preside over generally better economies than Republicans. But there\u2019s no evidence that their policies are the reason. That means it\u2019s perhaps not fair to give presidents credit when the economy improves or blame them when it goes bad. \u201cIt\u2019s never fair,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cPresidents don\u2019t have total control of the economy. They can\u2019t even control Congress. But fair or not, that\u2019s what happens.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Traditionally, young adults vote in smaller percentages than their elders But in a tight election, their vote can make a difference In the next presidential election, Republican leaders are hoping to win among young voters \u2013 something they haven\u2019t done since 1988, before many of today\u2019s young voters were born. But winning over the current crop of young adults \u2013 millennials \u2013 won\u2019t be easy. They are more liberal than their parents, even when they identify as Republican. They rely heavily on social media, to which the GOP has been slow to adapt. And although several Republican candidates and the party itself are trying to appeal to them, some of the youngest party members say they simply aren\u2019t feeling the love. \u201cPersonally, national party leaders have been relatively non-existent in response to our generation,\u201d said Alexander Staudt, 21, a University of Iowa senior and president of Students for Rand Paul. \u201cThis is one thing that disappoints me, that our age group has effectively been disenfranchised due the general lack of motivation by party leaders to drive the youth to vote.\u201d Traditionally, young adults vote in smaller percentages than their elders. But in a tight election, their vote can make a difference. In 2012, 60% of voters under 30 voted for President Barack Obama, giving him the edge he needed to defeat Republican Mitt Romney. That explains why, this time around, the Republican Party and many GOP candidates are working harder to appeal to young voters. The Republican National Committee has posted on its website profiles of young adult campaign workers, or \u201cGOP Millennials,\u201d photos of young people attending debate parties and registering voters and a link for college students to become \u201cCampus Captains\u201d to educate their classmates on Republican candidates. Individual candidates and their supporters also are working to attract millennials, the generation born after 1980. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky launched an 11-campus college tour to connect with students. The campaign of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has a group called Students for Carson, which regularly hosts debate parties at college campuses. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina appeared in a well-received video on BuzzFeed, a news site popular with younger voters. And a student at Claremont McKenna College in California started the Millennials Rising PAC, a super PAC that supports former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. A number of Republican candidates are taking steps to reach millennials through social media, said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of the Tufts University Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning & Engagement (CIRCLE), which studies young people\u2019s political engagement. Carson has aggressively engaged social media and has more Facebook fans \u2013 upwards of 4.87 million \u2013 than any other candidate. Fiorina and Trump have hosted live chats on Periscope, an app popular with millennials. And arguably, no candidate\u2019s Twitter account is more active than Donald Trump\u2019s. Matt Moore, a millennial who is chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, crowed about the latest GOP outreach efforts. \u201cThe RNC\u2019s leaders, especially Reince Priebus, really get it. That\u2019s why you are seeing such innovative ideas on connecting with young voters,\u201d said Moore, 33, one of the youngest members of the Republican National Committee. \u201cThe RNC has opened an office in Silicon Valley not only to attract the best and brightest tech minds to the political arena, but to show our commitment to the innovation economy.\u201d The Difficulty Nevertheless, Republicans face a number of challenges. Millennials are more liberal than any other age group, and even those who are Republican or who grew up in conservative households consider themselves more progressive than their parents, particularly on social issues, according to the Pew Research Center. Young conservatives are more likely than their older counterparts to support gay rights, immigrants and environmental regulations, positions more closely aligned with the Democratic Party. Some millennial Republicans say they have trouble getting the party elders to hear them. Lilia Dashevsky, 18, a former chair of the Arizona Teenage Republicans, said helping the old guard understand their progressive positions on social issues is a major challenge for younger conservatives. \u201cMany people are hesitant to listen to us or even give second thought to our opinions and beliefs because they are different from the Republican \u2018norm,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be the open-tent party; it is extremely attractive for young people to feel included and accepted,\u201d Dashevsky added. \u201cWe are all about social inclusion and listening to opposing ideas while formulating our own thoughts based on our personal experiences.\u201d That vision of an open-tent party has taken a beating during a year in which various Republican candidates have advocated building a wall to keep out immigrants, deporting undocumented immigrants and preventing Syrian refugees from settling in the U.S. Perhaps there is one issue that best illustrates the challenges Republicans face in winning over millennials: More than 60% of young Republicans support same-sex marriage, Pew reported. Every one of the Republican presidential candidates opposes it. Opinion: What Millennials want from the candidates The Numbers Candidates\u2019 positions aside, Republicans start out at a numerical disadvantage among young voters. Millennials are the most Democratic of any generation, Pew found. Slightly more than half (51%) of them identify as Democrats or lean Democratic, while just 35% are or lean Republican. \u201cPresident Obama won two terms due to his overwhelming success among young and minority voters,\u201d said Moore, the South Carolina Republican chair. \u201cIn 2016 and beyond, our party faces a demographic tidal wave unless we get ahead of it.\u201d Despite the obstacles, the candidates see some openings. For instance, like Republicans in general, many millennials are economic conservatives. In fact, this generation is the most fiscally conservative since the Great Depression, preferring to save rather than invest their money, according to a study by UBS Wealth Management Americas. \u201cStudents are graduating from college with very bleak job prospects and, in most cases, very high debt,\u201d said Garrison Coward, the 25-year-old political director for Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Virginia). \u201cWe are running the risk of being the first generation that may not do better than our parents\u2019 generation.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, of Florida, is responding to that sentiment both in his language \u2013 he talks a lot about creating a \u201cNew American Century\u201d \u2013 and in his policy proposals. He is proposing to reduce student debt by establishing repayment plans that are based on income. He also promotes the \u201csharing economy\u201d \u2013 businesses such as Uber and AirBnB that are popular with millennials because they offer peer-to-peer exchanges as a fiscally conservative alternative to the traditional way of doing things. \u201cMarco\u2019s message about a New American Century obviously speaks directly to the hopes and dreams of young Americans,\u201d said Rubio\u2019s communications director, Alex Conant. \u201cThe entire purpose of our campaign is to ensure that future generations of Americans have the same opportunities to achieve the American Dream that our parents and grandparents did.\u201d In addition, many of the millennials who say they \u201clean Democratic\u201d actually are independent voters. \u201cMost millennials are not familiar with party structures; they just want to be involved,\u201d Coward said. \u201cSo it is important for us to find non-conventional ways to get millennials involved in the sometimes mundane party processes, especially on the state levels.\u201d Opinion: Who will grab the Millennial vote? The Competition Therein lies another problem. Across the partisan divide is a candidate who is something of a superstar among the young adult crowd. And even if he doesn\u2019t win the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders has tapped into a passion among millennials that could accrue to the party\u2019s ultimate nominee. Sanders, a septuagenarian who represents Vermont, has addressed large crowds on college campuses as he rails against income inequality, advocates free tuition at public colleges and universities and argues that the government should reduce the burden of student loans. He also has met with millennials who are pushing for criminal justice reform. \u201cOur campaign attracts millennials because we\u2019ve put forth an aggressive agenda that speaks to the real and pressing needs of young people: Make college affordable, create jobs to reduce high youth unemployment and fight climate change for future generations,\u201d said Kenneth Pennington, Sanders\u2019 digital director. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to sell Bernie\u2019s agenda to young voters. We just need to get it in front of more people.\u201d Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is working to reach millennials through an aggressive use of social media, by appearing on late-night talk shows and rolling out more than 100 Students for Hillary chapters across the country, said Xochitl Hinojosa, a campaign spokeswoman. \u201cThe campaign has made it a priority to engage millennials through policy positions like marriage equality, college affordability and addressing student debt, climate change and providing people with economic opportunity, including increasing wages,\u201d she said. The Recipe for Success In the end, it will be up to the candidates to show millennials they care about them and about the issues that most concern young adults, said Kristen Soltis Anderson, author of The Selfie Vote: Where Millennials Are Leading America (And How Republicans Can Keep Up). \u201cUltimately, the GOP\u2019s success with millennials will come down to the nominee and the extent to which he or she makes millennials a priority,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe most Republicans now understand that they can\u2019t lose young voters by 20-plus points and still expect to win the White House, but it remains to be seen if they will do what it takes to win them back.\u201d",

Some Republicans are increasingly predicting that the final one-on-one would feature Cruz and Rubio, both of whom earned plaudits for their showings in the last GOP debate. Cruz intimated that he believed that as well, telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d that a match-up between the two Cuban-American senators was a \u201cplausible outcome.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of political observers that are saying that and I think that\u2019s certainly a plausible outcome,\u201d Cruz said, calling the Florida senator a \u201cformidable\u201d candidate in the \u201cmoderate lane\u201d for the Republican nomination. Who's running for President? 2016 election candidates Cruz, after months of never criticizing any Republican candidate by name, is increasingly doing so \u2013 and Rubio has found himself the target. The Texas senator has twice in the past two weeks mentioned Rubio by name for not being on the side of conservatives, pointing out his vote in favor of Trade Promotion Authority for the White House and his past support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Cruz has spoken admiringly of Rubio, telling reporters that he has modeled his 2012 campaign after Rubio\u2019s insurgent 2010 run, and the pair has remained close in the Senate. But Cruz labeled Rubio a moderate, one of four categories that the Cruz campaign believes groups the field. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to slug it out for a while,\u201d Cruz said, predicting a battle between Rubio, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and others. \u201cOnce it gets down to a head-to-head contest, I think the conservative wins.\u201d",

He said a plan to \u201cabolish\u201d Medicaid and Medicare is \u201ccrazy\u201d \u2013 a reference to Ben Carson\u2019s suggested alternative of a health savings account, though Carson has not called for the elimination of the popular entitlement programs. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get a reality check on what the heck needs to be done in this country? Yeah, we can save Social Security, we shouldn\u2019t get rid of it, we can save Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d Kasich said. Kasich has faced criticism himself for what Democrats say is a dismissive tone toward those concerned about entitlement reform. Speaking to about 200 people gathered in a barn here on Tuesday, he didn\u2019t back down, saying reform will inevitably make some unhappy. \u201cWe have to pay no attention to the people who we hear whining about don\u2019t touch my program, we don\u2019t care about that. You know why? Because you come first and they come dead last. People that get in the way of progress come dead last in my career and in my life,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cThe people we\u2019re gonna lift are the people who go to work every day and play by the rules.\u201d Referencing Donald Trump\u2019s comments on deporting all undocumented immigrants in the country, Kasich said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to pick them up, we\u2019re going to take them to the border and scream at them to get out of our country? That\u2019s just crazy.\u201d Kasich also brought up Trump\u2019s comments on Ford, saying he is taking undue credit for the company moving jobs back to America from Mexico. \u201cThat was like something out of a \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 movie. We made that agreement in 2011 for the simple reason that we knew what we were doing in Ohio. We know how to balance budgets and grow jobs, and do workforce training,\u201d Kasich said. Kasich also took a stronger tone on Jeb Bush than he ever has before \u2013 again, not by name \u2013 calling him out for his fondness of a nickname he gained while governor of Florida. \u201cOne of the candidates said he\u2019s known as Veto Corleone. He\u2019s so proud of the fact that he vetoes everything, you what vetoes are? Vetoes are a sign you can\u2019t get what you want,\u201d Kasich said. Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Kasich, acknowledged to CNN that the confrontational tone signaled a new decision in strategy ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Republican debate. In a CBS/New York Times poll released Tuesday, Kasich drew only 4% among Republican primary voters. \u201cWhat has happened to our party? What has happened to the conservative movement?\u201d Kasich asked. He added that he is \u201csick and tired of  listening to this nonsense.\u201d \u201cIf we turn this country over to somebody with wild ideas who thinks they can scream and bluster or operate their way to success, it\u2019s my kids that are going to be at risk, and your kids, and your grandchildren,\u201d Kasich told the audience. \u201cI\u2019m going to have call it like it is as long as I\u2019m in this race,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI\u2019m done with being polite and listening to this nonsense, and it\u2019s time we educate the American people about the consequences of very bad choices.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Eugene Scott contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The field of Democratic presidential hopefuls faced off in their first debate, hosted by CNN and Facebook, on Tuesday night. For more than two hours, the candidates tried to make their best impressions before a national audience discovering many of them for the first time. Here\u2019s how they did: Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton proved without a doubt Tuesday night why she is the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential front-runner. Clinton remained unflappable throughout the debate, showcasing her political experience and her command of the issues \u2013 all the while deftly handling criticism of her flip-flops and displaying a humor that put a more human face to her oft-criticized candidacy. From the outset, Clinton was pressed to defend her changing stances on various issues \u2013 from the Pacific Rim trade deal to same-sex marriage \u2013 and came out from the tough questioning with a strong one-liner that very much fits the frame of her campaign: \u201cI\u2019m a progressive. But I\u2019m a progressive who likes to get things done.\u201d David Axelrod, CNN senior political commentator and the chief strategist for the Obama campaign that trounced Clinton in 2008, said she did \u201cvery well\u201d and that her campaign was likely \u201cthrilled with the performance.\u201d Clinton\u2019s big night on the debate stage \u201cShe was poised she was passionate and she was in command,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cIf I were her campaign I would be thrilled with what she did tonight.\u201d The first Democratic debate And Clinton showed her mettle when she came under attack from three of her opponents on the stage over her vote in favor of the Iraq War, dismissing the idea that her judgment should be questioned over that vote by tying in President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to tap her as secretary of state. And to top it off, she used the question to play up her foreign policy chops. \u201cI recall very well being on a debate stage, I think, about 25 times with then Senator Obama, debating this very issue. After the election, he asked me to become secretary of state. He valued my judgment, and I spent a lot of time with him in the Situation Room, going over some very difficult issues,\u201d Clinton said. Opinion: Clinton brings it In what came as a surprise to some pundits, Clinton also did not shy away from taking on her chief rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton tested Sanders over his shifting stance on gun control in a way that he failed to do on her policy flips \u2013 Sanders even appeared flustered. When asked whether Sanders is \u201ctough enough on guns,\u201d Clinton didn\u2019t do any tip-toeing. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she said, before pointing out that Sanders has five times voted against the Brady Bill, which aimed to curtail gun violence. Clinton didn\u2019t just take on her runner-up, she also made a point of going after Republicans \u2013 making the case yet again that she\u2019s the best prepared to take on the GOP in the general election. 7 memorable debate moments Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t shock anyone: he played to his base and thrived off the momentum that his insurgent campaign has enjoyed. But his attempts at expanding his base of support \u2013 by including criminal justice reform in his opening statement and unequivocally stating \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d later on \u2013 checked boxes but likely didn\u2019t inspire voters in the African-American community. And he didn\u2019t do anything to convince voters he can overcome the electability hurdles a self-declared \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d is sure to face in the general election. \u201cHe spoke to his supporters. He spoke to the base of the Democratic Party. I\u2019m not sure he showed why he\u2019s electable,\u201d CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said. What would Clinton, Sanders do on marijuana? Key quotes from the Democratic debate But one thing Sanders did show was his passion for addressing the core issues of his campaign: income inequality and reckless behavior and excesses on Wall Street. And for voters still getting introduced to Sanders, that\u2019s likely appealing. Sanders displayed the same impassioned, off-the-cuff speaking style that has galvanized hundreds of thousands of Americans to join what Sanders hopes will become a veritable \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d But the Vermont senator faced his toughest moment as he addressed his record on gun laws. It\u2019s the one issue where Clinton has consistently been to Sanders\u2019 left and he seemed ill-equipped to cope with her frontal attack. Fact-checking the debate Joe Biden Clinton\u2019s win was Joe Biden\u2019s loss. The vice president is still mulling whether to jump into the presidential contest, but Clinton\u2019s dominant showing Tuesday night makes the case for a Biden candidacy that much more difficult. Clinton\u2019s performance at the first primary debate is sure to soothe many anxious Democratic donors and supporters who have been wringing their hands over the start-and-stop pace of the opening months of Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign \u2013 notably the wobbly response to the controversies that have rocked its debut. Biden could have joined the first debate and the result might have been different. But he didn\u2019t. And now Biden has to grapple with the reality of the outcome. Martin O\u2019Malley Martin O\u2019Malley needed a breakout moment and he came up empty. At face value, O\u2019Malley didn\u2019t have a bad night. He cogently and concisely laid out his talking points and even took on both Clinton and Sanders at different points during the debate. He hit all the right notes on several of his responses and touted his results-driven record. And if he wasn\u2019t mired at just 1% in the polls, that might have been enough. But O\u2019Malley left the debate stage Tuesday night without a standout moment or zinger that people will be talking about Wednesday. O\u2019Malley\u2019s strongest moment came when he challenged Sanders on gun control and made an fervent call for stricter gun laws \u2013 showing that he was prepared to fight to wrestle the mantle of the progressive wing away from Sanders, whose candidacy has wrecked O\u2019Malley\u2019s plans to present himself as the progressive alternative to a more moderate Clinton. The Democratic debate by the numbers Jim Webb It started off as a rough night for former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb whose first impression to the overwhelming majority of Americans came as he stumbled in his opening statement as he listed the names of his five daughters. And as the debate wore on, Webb seemed more pressed squabbling with debate moderator Anderson Cooper over the amount of time allotted to the different candidates than in making an impression that would win over voters. At one point, when asked about giving undocumented immigrants access to Obamacare benefits, Webb appeared to formulate his position on the spot after pausing for a few seconds. Lincoln Chafee The former senator, governor and mayor simply didn\u2019t make a lasting impression. He tried to stake out the moral high ground from the get-go \u2013 pointing to his \u201chigh ethical standards\u201d and the fact that he\u2019s never had any \u201cscandals.\u201d But he failed to turn his thinly veiled jab at Clinton and her email woes into any kind of more direct contrast or confrontation. The Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat proclaimed that he is a \u201cblock of granite when it comes to the issues,\u201d but when pressed over his vote to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, Chafee gave a head-scratching response: \u201cI had just arrived in the Senate. \u201c 6 takeaways from the debate",

The announcement, which comes after months of Clinton remaining mum over the hot-button 2016 issue, immediately drew praise from liberals and environmental groups but was criticized by Republican presidential candidates. \u201cI think it is imperative that we look at the Keystone pipeline as what I believe it is \u2013 a distraction from important work we have to do on climate change,\u201d Clinton told a community forum in Des Moines, Iowa. \u201cAnd unfortunately from my perspective, one that interferes with our ability to move forward with all the other issues,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore I oppose it.\u201d The Democratic 2016 front-runner announced her opposition to the project \u2013 which is still the subject of a years-long State Department review \u2013 as Pope Francis landed in the United States, dominating national media attention. RELATED: Clinton says decision on Keystone pipeline coming \u2018soon\u2019 Clinton had not previously disclosed her position on the campaign trail despite consistent questions about her position on the project, which is widely favored by conservatives but opposed by liberals who believe it will contribute to climate change. In explaining her answer Tuesday, Clinton said she didn\u2019t want to interfere with a review process that started under her watch. \u201cI was in a unique position as secretary of state at the start of this process, and not wanting to interfere with ongoing decision-making that the President and Secretary (of State John) Kerry have to do in order to make whatever final decisions they need,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo I thought this would be decided by now, and therefore I could tell you whether I agree or disagree, but it hasn\u2019t been decided, and I feel now I\u2019ve got a responsibility to you and voters who ask me about this.\u201d Speaking to the Des Moines Register\u2019s editorial board after the event, Clinton said she had \u201cno idea\u201d she would be asked about the pipeline Tuesday. But, she said, \u201cI think I owed it to people to say where I stood,\u201d adding, \u201cclearly, the time had come for me to answer the question.\u201d Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s communications director, said in a statement to CNN that Clinton\u2019s role as a former secretary of state put her \u201cin a different situation than other candidates.\u201d Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight \u201cHaving the experience of being a former secretary of state distinguishes her and her candidacy, but it comes with responsibilities that at times can limit her,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cBut we know that the experience is well worth whatever price she may pay politically.\u201d A Clinton campaign aide told CNN that the former secretary of state couldn\u2019t wait any longer to explain her position. \u201cShe\u2019s been taking on water for (not taking a position) \u2026 She didn\u2019t want to jam Secretary Kerry or jam the President but it was just time. It\u2019s September,\u201d the aide said. The aide said as pressure had mounted for Clinton to take a position, she wanted to give the administration space but doing so became untenable. The aide noted Clinton\u2019s meeting with the Des Moines Register, and the campaign was expecting the question to come up. She wanted to be able to answer, the aide said. The White House was briefed on Clinton\u2019s position prior to her comments Tuesday, another Clinton aide said. \u201cAlso, in the course of discussing her plans for increasing investment in energy infrastructure with labor officials in recent weeks, she privately made her opposition to the pipeline known to them as well,\u201d the aide added. RELATED: Is Hillary Clinton \u2018likable enough\u2019? Clio Cullison, a student at Drake University who came to the event after a friend of hers at 350.org, an active climate change advocacy group that has regularly followed Clinton on the campaign trail, asked her to attend and ask Clinton about the pipeline. \u201cI was really nervous to ask,\u201d Cullison told CNN. \u201cI haven\u2019t asked any political candidates a question ever, so that was really exciting.\u201d The student added that she \u201cwas afraid of her answer, to be honest. I didn\u2019t know where she was going to stand. I didn\u2019t know if she was going to answer at all. I am really glad she did answer, one, and two, did oppose the Keystone pipeline.\u201d Clinton has repeatedly been asked about Keystone on the campaign trail but has never answered directly. \u201cI am not going to second guess (President Barack Obama) because I was in a position to set this in motion,\u201d Clinton said at a July event in New Hampshire. \u201cI want to wait and see what he and Secretary Kerry decide.\u201d At the same event, she later added, \u201cIf it is undecided when I become president, I will answer your question.\u201d And throughout much of 2013 and 2014, Clinton criss-crossed the country on the paid speaking circuit and later on her book tour. She was asked about Keystone a number of times, particularly in Canada, where the pipeline would originate. At no point did she take a position, however. Hillary Clinton won't answer Keystone XL pipeline question Clinton\u2019s announcement on Tuesday was met with praise from environmental groups. Jane Kleeb, director of the anti-pipeline group Bold Nebraska, said the decision \u201cwas a long time coming,\u201d and demonstrates that Democratic candidates need to pay closer attention to the progressive base. \u201cPolitical insiders continue to not give credit to the climate movement and not give credit to farmers and ranchers who are opposed to these risky fossil fuel projects,\u201d Kleeb told CNN. \u201cThis is a big part of her progressive base \u2013 people who are not just against Keystone but want to see action on climate change.\u201d And Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, said Clinton has slowly been moving in this direction since 2010, when she said she was \u201cinclined\u201d to approve the project. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good evolution, always in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cOver time, she has come to understand that a defining issue of the next election is climate change and there\u2019s no way to address it seriously without this being answered,\u201d McKibben said, calling it a \u201cboondoggle\u201d that he expects Obama to reject as well. Clinton\u2019s Democratic presidential opponents have opposed the deal. On Tuesday, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, lambasted her for the delay in taking a position. \u201cOn issue after issue \u2013 marriage equality, drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants, children fleeing violence in Central America, the Syrian refugee crisis, and now the Keystone Pipeline, Secretary Clinton has followed \u2013 not forged \u2013 public opinion,\u201d O\u2019Malley said in a statement.

            "article_content": "Warning: This presidential campaign may be harmful to your emotional well-being. Seriously, there is some evidence that just as the country was starting to feel good about itself, the presidential campaign, while drawing intense interest, is turning into the year\u2019s biggest buzz killer. Consider this. Last September, 50% of people responding to a CNN/ORC International poll said they believed that \u201cthings are going\u201d either \u201cvery well\u201d or \u201cfairly well\u201d in the country. It was the first time that at least half of the poll respondents felt that good about the state of the nation since April, 2013, and only the sixth time that measure, which is asked every few months, cracked the 50% mark since August, 2006. It was not a fluke. Two months later, 52% of people said things were going \u201cvery well\u201d or \u201cfairly well\u201d in the country. And in March of this year, 53% of people polled said they felt that way. But then, this summer the presidential campaign heated up, and the country\u2019s mood went south. In May, the percentage of people who felt things were going relatively well dropped six points to 47%, and last month that number came in at 48%. Keep in mind, this more pessimistic turn occurred at a time of an improving economy, falling unemployment, tumbling gas prices, low inflation, rising housing prices and no terrorist attack that caused mass casualties. What turned our blue skies gray? There are probably a number of reasons. Or maybe just one: a presidential campaign. More specifically a presidential campaign dominated by Donald Trump and others who are pounding out a message that things are just terrible. 32 key political moments from a wild summer Take, for example, what Trump said at a recent press conference on Thursday. \u201cOur country could be doing much better,\u201d he told reporters and supporters in a typical riff. \u201cWe have deficits that are enormous. We have all bad trade agreements. We have an army that the head says is not prepared. We have a military that needs help, especially in these times. We have nuclear weapons that \u2013 you look at \u201960 Minutes\u2019 \u2013 that don\u2019t even work; if anybody saw that report. The phones don\u2019t work. They\u2019re 40-years-old. They have wires that don\u2019t work. \u201cNothing works. Our country doesn\u2019t work. Everybody wins except us.\u201d \u201cWhen so much of the attention is going to a candidate or candidates whose sole role is to say that the country is going to hell in a handbasket and only I can make it better, that can have an impact on the public mood,\u201d says Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. To be sure, the country still faces major problems. Wages remain stagnant. ISIS continues its brutality in the Middle East and threatens attacks on the homeland. College and health care costs remain obscenely high. The quiet candidate gains on Trump But with the possible exception of violent crime \u2013 an important exception indeed \u2013 it is hard to argue that any of these problem have gotten significantly worse in the year since Americans began to express relative happiness in the country\u2019s state of affairs. The images of undocumented children swarming across the border have faded. The Ebola scare has come and gone. No American has been beheaded by ISIS in nearly a year. It is, of course, not surprising for candidates in the party out of the White House to paint a picture using the colors of impending doom. \u201cIt is certainly the case that one of the effects of a presidential campaign is that one side will be raising criticism of the incumbent administration and the job it is doing,\u201d says Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. \u201cSo it is not unreasonable to think that when voters hear messages from their candidate we would expect them to become more negative about the state of the country.\u201d And as Republican candidates, especially Trump, keep up a constant drumbeat on how terrible things are, their loyalists\u2019 moods followed suit. Indeed the biggest slump in the country\u2019s mood occurred in Republicans. In March, 33% of Republicans told CNN that things were going \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cpretty well\u201d in the country. By August that figure had dropped to 21%. Notably, the biggest falloff is seen in men, people making less than $50,000 a year and those who have not attended college \u2013 the core of Trump\u2019s support. Could it be that candidates like Trump are not just tapping into the voters\u2019 anger, but also fomenting it? Clinton campaign pushes restart button \u201cThere is this subset that is unhappy culturally, economically, internationally,\u201d says Christine Matthews, president of Bellwether Research, a Republican polling firm. \u201cHe is sort of exacerbating this alienation and anger and bringing it out.\u201d Democrats also have to take some blame for the country\u2019s increasingly dour mood. Without an incumbent running for re-election, or a vice president running to replace his boss \u2013 at least not yet \u2013 there is no one giving a full-throated defense of the status quo. Hillary Clinton comes the closest, but she has been careful not to suggest things are just fine. And the most energy on the Democratic side is being generated by Bernie Sanders, who doesn\u2019t let a day go by without reminding everyone how the middle class is being screwed. It does seem as though the nature of this presidential campaign is unabashedly pessimistic. It seems a long way both in time and attitude from Ronald Reagan campaigned in 1984 on the slogan, \u201cIt\u2019s Morning in America.\u201d Or when George H.W. Bush adopted the theme song in 1988, \u201cDon\u2019t Worry; Be Happy.\u201d Or when Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s campaign in 1932 \u2013 a time when the Great Depression had pushed the unemployment rate up the nearly 24% \u2013 ginned up crowds with the song, \u201cHappy Days Are Here Again.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of the Reagan approach,\u201d says Matthews. \u201cAs much as these candidates like to compare themselves to Ronald Reagan, they have his yang, without his yin. Reagan\u2019s yin was optimism. With him it always was, things are good. I can make them better.\u201d 2016 rhetoric is out of control",

            "article_content": "Ben Carson is tied with Donald Trump in Iowa, according to a new poll Challenge for Carson is to prove whether he can topple Trump Watch out Donald Trump. Here comes Ben Carson. While the bombastic real estate tycoon dominates much of the GOP field, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon with a calm bedside manner is quietly emerging as a serious presidential contender. Carson is tied with Trump for first place in a new Monmouth University survey of likely Iowa Republican caucusgoers, with the rest of the field lagging by double digits. The Carson surge comes as Trump has set the terms of debate for the past two months, forcing other candidates to shift their focus and decide whether \u2013 and how \u2013 to fight back against his constant attacks. Carson, who was awarded the Medal of Freedom for his groundbreaking surgical work, is charting his own unorthodox campaign, running as a mild-mannered culture warrior with an inspirational biography. But the challenge is whether he is the Republican who could topple Trump, and move beyond the cult-of-personality phase of the campaign to create a lasting coalition energized more by substance than style. \u201cThe most important number right now is his net favorability, which is about popularity and personality. Our guy is 71 and Trump is at 26. That is the highest we have seen since (President Barack) Obama,\u201d said Armstrong Williams, Carson\u2019s business manager. \u201cThe key for us to be able to maintain such high ratings through the ideas portion of the primary.\u201d Carson\u2019s gains are especially notable considering he\u2019s one of the few Republican presidential contenders who hasn\u2019t engaged in a war of words with Trump. In fact, Trump, who has battled with Republican rivals including Jeb Bush and Rick Perry, has gone out of his way to praise Carson. Ben Carson's career in politics \u201cI like Ben Carson very much,\u201d Trump said last week in South Carolina. \u201cHe\u2019s really a fine man. He\u2019s a friend of mine. He\u2019s doing well also.\u201d Carson hasn\u2019t criticized Trump. In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d in August, Carson insisted he isn\u2019t trying to \u201ccatch\u201d Trump. \u201cWhat I am doing is steadily getting the message out, and connecting with the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are responding.\u201d And though Trump\u2019s rhetoric has upended the Republican presidential race, Carson is no stranger to controversy. He told CNN earlier this year that some people become gay in prison, indicating homosexuality is a choice \u2013 a comment for which he later apologized. And in August, he said that while he wouldn\u2019t use drones to kill undocumented immigrants, he would order strikes on caves used to transport people across the southern U.S. border. Carson will likely roll out policy ideas in the coming weeks. But the most immediate focus for his campaign is the next debate, hosted by CNN and set for September 16 in Simi Valley, California. While the goal of the first debate was for Carson to simply look like a credible presidential candidate, now that he is firmly in the top tier, he must offer more. READ: Donald Trump: No attacks on Ben Carson, Ted Cruz \u2013 yet Carson seized on momentum from the first debate, flooding the airwaves in Iowa and New Hampshire for two weeks with radio and television ads with Carson speaking directly to the camera. \u201cOur children face a very harsh future, unsustainable debt. Future generations will suffer,\u201d Carson said in the ad. \u201cWashington is broken. The political class broke it. Please join me.\u201d In Iowa, he has hosted a series of \u201cfamily festivals\u201d in three cities, featuring pony rides, popcorn and entertainment. Some 6,000 people showed up to the small scale fairs that doubled as political events. \u201cThat was really, really smart because most candidates aren\u2019t doing events where the candidate isn\u2019t the highlight but a side detail,\u201d said Kedron Bardwell, a political science professor at Simpson College. \u201cIt burnishes his credentials as unconventional and focuses on value issues and family and he did it in a way that is nonthreatening. It was almost like a circus.\u201d As far back as June, Carson\u2019s allies dropped thousands of copies of \u201cBen Carson, Rx for America,\u201d on doorsteps in central Iowa, giving him a head start in a crowded field. \u201cWe have to keep doing the same thing.  Keep delivering the message that Washington is broken and we need new leaders and you can do that in a way where people are working together and not banging everyone\u2019s head together,\u201d said Ed Brookover, a senior Carson strategist. \u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Carson\u2019s style.\u201d Carson, who rose to prominence in 2013 when he criticized Obama\u2019s health care plan as he sat a few feet away during an annual prayer breakfast, polls well among evangelicals, a voting bloc that will be crucial in Iowa and throughout the South. Like Trump, Carson has never held an elected office, and is riding a wave of deep discontent with the political establishment. READ: How to give a Donald Trump stump speech, in 12 easy steps But as a campaigner, Carson is more like the antithesis of Trump. Carson announced his run in Detroit, a rollout that included a stop at a school named for him where students asked him for advice on how to study. Trump announced at Trump Tower in New York with a fiery speech that slammed illegal immigrants. Trump brags about his billions while Carson talks about delicate surgical procedures and how his mother\u2019s emphasis on reading helped him overcome poverty. And days after Trump packed thousands into an Alabama football arena, Carson held a small luncheon and fundraiser in Montgomery. Aides said that Carson also has another advantage over the rest of the field because of his connection to African-Americans, who have long celebrated his medical achievements. They argue that he could get 13% of the black vote in the general election. \u201cA lot of his likeability is driven by his story growing up and his story and career as a neurosurgeon and his personality,\u201d said Cody Hoefert, co-chairman of the Iowa GOP.  \u201cPeople say he just seems trustworthy and they compare that to Hillary Clinton and the rest of the field. He has developed a real presence here. And people are responding.\u201d Carson got six minutes and 46 seconds of speaking time in the first debate, landing fifth in the GOP pack. But his closing statement, in which he touted his unique resume, won over skeptics who thought he was this cycle\u2019s Herman Cain, an African-American GOP candidate whose 2012 campaign rose to the top before quickly flaming out. READ: Ben Carson tells Black Lives Matter to refocus In an August blogpost called \u201cThe One I got Wrong,\u201d RedState.com\u2019s editor-in-chief, Erick Erickson, said Carson\u2019s debate performance and the engagement of his supporters made him give Carson a second look. \u201cHe was and is a legitimate contender. His closing at the debate was one of the best closings I\u2019ve seen in a debate. He did not have the depth as some of the others on the issues, but showed he has been spending his time learning,\u201d Erickson wrote in a mea culpa over not inviting Carson to his annual summit. \u201cAbove all, he was humorous, respectful and showed a real good nature. And I know, based on all the incoming polling, that I was not the only one to take a second look at Ben Carson. It seems a great many people realized Ben Carson is a legitimate candidate for President.\u201d Carson has proven himself to be one of the most unique fundraisers in the 2016 field, and his unconventional way of raising presidential money could give him a financial base that no candidate can rival. Carson raises money for both his campaign and super PAC in the same way: by spending big to steadily raise just a little more. While most candidates prioritize the bundlers who collect $2,700 checks from their networks or the megadonors who can write seven-digit donations with ease, Carson\u2019s fundraising operation is almost entirely focused on low-dollar donors who have powered a surprisingly effective money shop. READ: Carson calls for drone strikes on border \u2018caves\u2019 But low-dollar fundraising is vastly more expensive than traditional courting of super PAC megadonors, and Carson\u2019s groups have already shown signs of financial duress that may bedevil a candidate who can\u2019t count on a seven-figure check from a wealthy donor. Carson\u2019s campaign raised $8.5 million in the opening months of his campaign, two-thirds of which came in donations under $200. That gives the neurosurgeon a vast fundraising base of donors who aren\u2019t even close to hitting the ceiling on the amount they can give.   Aides have set a $65 million goal through the primary season. \u201cI absolutely think that Carson could win Iowa, it\u2019s more likely if the Trump balloon deflates,\u201d Bardwell said.  \u201cA lot of those people who are primed to hear stuff that is unconventional will move to another candidate that is not a politician and Carson would be the main beneficiary.\u201d",

            "article_content": "While commenting on Trump, a conservative pundit makes a remark some Hispanic viewers found offensive On Trump and English, Ben Ferguson said, \"I highly doubt you're going to know what he was saying anyway\" Nearly two-thirds of Hispanic people living in the United States speak English, Pew Research Center says How do you say, \u201cOpen mouth, insert foot,\u201d in Spanish?  Many English-Spanish bilingual viewers watching conservative commentator Ben Ferguson on CNN late Tuesday thought that\u2019s what he did. During a panel discussion with Don Lemon about the fallout after news anchor Jorge Ramos of Spanish-language broadcaster Univision was ejected from a Trump news conference on Tuesday, Ferguson said that people who watch Univision probably didn\u2019t understand Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump anyway. His comment triggered social media outrage. Frank Bruni: Trump, Ramos exchange will benefit Trump But first, for context, a recap of the incident with Ramos: Ramos had previously had a testy exchange with Trump over the candidate\u2019s ideas about expatriating all undocumented immigrants out of the United States. Then Ramos went to Trump\u2019s Tuesday news conference in Dubuque, Iowa. Though not called upon, Ramos tried to engage Trump again on the topic. \u201cGo back to Univision,\u201d Trump told him. Ramos persisted, and a security officer walked Ramos out of the conference. Trump: Univision anchor was 'out of order' Late Tuesday, on CNN, Ferguson blamed the incident on Ramos, saying it was a Univision stunt. He also asserted that any perceived affront by Trump to Hispanic Americans over Ramos would not hurt his candidacy. \u201cIf you like Univision and Jorge Ramos and illegal immigrants in this country, you\u2019re not looking at any Republican candidate, so I\u2019m not worried,\u201d Ferguson said. He continued with the line that became contentious on social media, \u201cAnd to be real honest, if you\u2019re watching Jorge Ramos, the chances you even understand the words coming out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth tonight \u2013 I highly doubt you\u2019re going to know what he was saying anyway.\u201d Some viewers who like to watch Univision were also watching Ferguson\u2019s comments on CNN. And they let him know on Twitter what languages they understood well. \u201cAccording to Ben Ferguson if you watch Univison you probably don\u2019t understand English because apparently Hispanics are not bilingual,\u201d Ana tweeted. \u201c@benfergusonshow FYI I\u2019m fluent in both English & Spanish. I understand what is being said on @Univision. Univision viewers are #bilingual,\u201d Patricia Alexandra tweeted. \u201cAccording to @benfergusonshow, because I watch Univision, I don\u2019t understand English,\u201d Carlos A. Martinez posted. According to @benfergusonshow, because I watch Univision, I don't understand English. #NoMames All three of them and many more who responded to Ferguson\u2019s remarks have something in common. Looking at their Twitter feeds, nearly all of their posts are in English. That should come as no surprise, according to a Pew Research Center study. Some 62% of Hispanic people living in the United States speak English \u2013 most of them are bilingual. And a quarter of people identifying as Hispanic Americans don\u2019t speak Spanish. And as with myriads of families that have immigrated to the United States over the centuries, every nascent generation losses proficiency in its ancestors\u2019 original language, until knowledge of it disappears from the family. People of Hispanic origin born in the United States mostly don\u2019t speak Spanish, according to Pew. Some 56% did not become proficient in their ancestors\u2019 native language. But Ferguson may have also been wrong in his overall assertion that any perceived affront by Trump to Hispanic Americans won\u2019t hurt his election chances or those of other GOP candidates. It could, according to a Pew study published in July. In the notorious swing state of Florida, for example, known to be decisive in presidential elections with its large number of Electoral College votes, Latino voters in the past overwhelmingly pulled the lever for a Republican candidate. In 2004, they got mostly behind George W. Bush. The state is home to his brother Jeb Bush, who is also running for president on the Republican ticket. But since 2008, Hispanic American voter registration affiliation with the Democratic Party has soared, as has independent registration \u2013 both vastly overtaking the number of Hispanic registered Republicans, Pew says. In 2008 and 2012, the majority of Hispanic Americans in Florida voted for Barack Obama. CNN\u2019s Ana Johnson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is a grieving father and a potential presidential candidate But as he weighs a bid for the White House, he must also grapple with whether he has a path to victory Joe Biden faces a host of complicated emotional questions in deciding whether to run for president. But in the end, his decision could rest on a very simple political one. As he mulls one last bid for the White House, Biden is working through an MRI of the soul, filtering his undimmed dreams of the presidency and gnawing grief for his son Beau, who before he died reportedly urged him to run. He must ask whether his age \u2013 he would be 74 when he took office \u2013 would permit a long, grueling campaign, not to mention a subsequent presidency, and ponder the strains of a race on his family, which has endured more pain than most could bear. \u201cIf I were to announce to run I have to be able to commit to all of you that I would be able to give it my whole heart and my whole soul and right now, both are pretty well banged up,\u201d Biden told DNC members on a conference call Wednesday, adding that he must decide whether he has the \u201cemotional fuel\u201d in him. But even if he conquers those concerns \u2013 and can shed an image of sometimes being a gaffe machine \u2013 Biden has to ponder something more basic: Where can he beat Hillary Clinton? \u201cI just want the vice president to decide to do what\u2019s right for him and his family,\u201d Clinton told reporters Wednesday after a campaign event in Ankeny, Iowa, calling Biden a \u201cfriend.\u201d The more Biden\u2019s potential primary prospects are examined in detail, the narrower they seem to become. READ: Obama gives Joe Biden \u2018blessing\u2019 for 2016 bid Clinton might be battered by a rough start to her campaign, haunted by the controversy over her emails, criticized for having a political tin ear and surprised by the surge of left-wing opponent Bernie Sanders. But she remains a formidable front-runner for the Democratic nomination. So great are her advantages that many Democrats privately agree that Biden could only triumph if so-far unknown revelations about her use of a private server as secretary of state \u2013 currently being investigated by the Justice Department and the FBI \u2013 cause her campaign to implode. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a lane (for Biden) unless Hillary Clinton has legal difficulties in relation to her email situation,\u201d said Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute for Politics at Saint Anselm College. Clinton fans appear to have plenty to worry about: Recent polls show rising unfavorability ratings that seem to counter claims by her campaign that voters don\u2019t really care about the episode. And Quinnipiac University polls last week had Biden doing better than Clinton in a hypothetical general election matchup against GOP candidates, including Donald Trump, in swing states Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. But Biden backers don\u2019t just rely on Clinton liabilities to make a positive case for why he\u2019s the best choice to succeed President Barack Obama, who CNN reported on Monday has given his blessing for a campaign by his vice president. \u201cJoe Biden is arguably the most consequential vice president in history. His fingerprints have been on pretty much every foreign policy and domestic issue,\u201d said Steve Schale, a key Obama campaign aide who has signed up with the \u201cDraft Biden\u201d effort, on CNN Tuesday. But though he\u2019s beloved by Democrats, radiates a love for campaigning that Clinton can\u2019t match and has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his boss during the most sweeping progressive presidency in decades, Biden still faces unpromising political math. Democrats in early voting states, political analysts and consultants all suggest that if Biden does have a path to the Democratic nomination, it is exceedingly slim. Joe Biden: Images from a political life \u201cI think he would be fighting for a lot of the same voters that have been canvassed by Hillary Clinton and are firmly in her camp,\u201d said Michael Bronstein, a Pennsylvania-based political consultant, who is not working for any presidential candidate. \u201cHe is starting off fairly late in the cycle. A lot of the top-level support that you have to have being an institutional candidate like the VP certainly has been locked up,\u201d said Bronstein. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see where the light of day is in the Democratic establishment to bring another candidate into this space.\u201d Biden\u2019s biggest liability might be the fact that he lags far behind in the critical task of building the precinct-by-precinct network needed to identify voters and get them to the polls in early caucus and primary states. He also starts off well behind Clinton in a duel over key Democratic constituencies, like African-Americans and women, who  strongly back the former first lady but whom the vice president would need for a successful campaign. Biden might also struggle to tap a rich Democratic donor base already lined up by Clinton, and any hope of running a populist crusade to the left of the former first lady is complicated by the strength of Sanders. A Biden campaign would seek to leverage the candidate\u2019s undeniable connection to blue-collar voters and his fabled tales of a hard-scrabble upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania \u2013 and to subtly play on suspicions of the wealth Clinton now enjoys. \u201cIf you look at the way Democrats have struggled with working-class white voters primarily, I think Joe Biden is a guy that has come from that world. He was a middle-class guy growing up, and he has never lost his roots,\u201d said Schale. \u201cHe gives us a chance to talk to some voters that we have struggled with in the last few cycles.\u201d But it is not yet clear that Clinton\u2019s own ties with this key voting bloc have eroded. In fact, blue-collar Americans in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Ohio helped her prolong her 2008 campaign against Obama for months. Back then, she profited from ties first forged in Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign and a presidency remembered for middle-class prosperity. She\u2019s working hard now to build a campaign based on restoring what she calls the basic bargain of America: that if you work hard, you should get ahead. READ: Biden meets with Warren in Washington Another potential Biden approach is to argue that having spent seven years a heartbeat away from the presidency, he is uniquely prepared to be commander-in-chief. But Clinton has her own experience to tout \u2013 after all, she served four years as secretary of state and can relate to Obama supporters how she swallowed her defeat in 2008 to join the President\u2019s team-of-rivals Cabinet. In the end, though, presidential primary races boil down to amassing delegates, winning state races and methodical organization. And here again, Biden is at a disadvantage, especially in the early voting states that could dictate the shape of the race. He failed to win even 1% of the vote in the Iowa caucuses in 2008 and was overshadowed by Obama, John Edwards and Clinton. He might do better this time \u2013 thanks to his enhanced reputation as vice president \u2013 but he has a lot of work to do. In a CNN/ORC International Poll of the Hawkeye state this month, the vice president was at 11%, behind Clinton at 54% and Sanders at 31%. Clinton has learned the lessons of her 2008 defeat in Iowa by quietly building a broad political network there. So with only five months to go before the 2016 caucuses, and with campaign funds possibly at a premium, could Biden emulate Clinton? \u201cIf you scramble, you could get it done, I suppose, but to pull that off you really have a challenge,\u201d said Jerry Tormey, a senior Iowa Democratic Party official. \u201cI think there would be a lot of people who would stand by their commitment and stay with Hillary. It would be a challenge for Joe.\u201d If not Iowa, then why not New Hampshire, where Clinton is under pressure from Sanders, whom she trailed in one recent bombshell poll? Again, Biden is starting well behind. Clinton has already snapped up legions of volunteers and party elites, building on long political relationships in the state, which she won in 2008, just as her husband did in his first presidential race. \u201cThe Clinton campaign has locked up not only what they had way back in \u201992, they have locked up the Obama people, too,\u201d said Levesque. 'Draft Biden' adviser: This is not about Clinton Edward Shumaker, a former U.S. ambassador to Trinidad and a supporter of both Clintons who also worked on Biden\u2019s short-lived 1988 presidential campaign, said the vice president\u2019s late start would be a serious disadvantage in the Granite State. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not impossible but \u2013 to use a sports metaphor from diving \u2013 the degree of difficulty would be quite significant,\u201d he said. So, South Carolina, which follows New Hampshire in the nominating race, could shape up as make-or-break for Biden. Here there may be some good news for him. Sources in the state say Biden enjoys significant support among activists, county chairs and local party officials and would enjoy a near-level playing field with Clinton. He would get a break because Sanders is expected to be less strong in South Carolina than in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 given that his coalition of white progressives is less prevalent in the Palmetto state and he hasn\u2019t registered much support from black voters. But Biden would still be starting from behind. \u201cCan Biden compare to Hillary\u2019s outreach to African-Americans?\u201d asked Scott Huffmon, professor of political science at Winthrop University, South Carolina. \u201cAfrican-Americans are the absolute must-haves of the South Carolina Democratic Primary,\u201d he said, referring to a voting bloc that made up 56% of the party primary electorate in 2008. READ: Does Elizabeth Warren regret not running for president? Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have worked exhaustively to repair ties with African-American voters since the bitter 2008 primary clash in South Carolina that was won by Obama after a remark by the former president was perceived by some to have racist overtones. They have been so successful that in a CNN/ORC Poll in August, 49% of Democratic voters said the former first lady would do the best job in tackling race relations, well ahead of Sanders or Biden. An endorsement from Obama could be decisive in the state, but the President is thought unlikely to intervene directly in a contest between two such close allies as his vice president and former secretary of state. The next contest of the early nominating season, in Nevada, also looks dicey for Biden given Clinton\u2019s historic popularity among Hispanic voters. Though the vice president could argue that he played a key role in Obama\u2019s decision to stay the deportations of millions of undocumented migrants through executive action, the Western desert state looks just as likely to underline the challenging questions that could dog his yet-to-be-launched primary campaign. Still, despite the daunting obstacles for a run, there appear to be growing signs that Biden is seriously contemplating entering the race, perhaps simply to position himself in case Clinton stumbles. Presidential politics is always unpredictable and the only certainty is that no one can win the presidency without entering the fray. \u201cYou never know what is going to happen until somebody gets into the race,\u201d said Bronstein. \u201cPresidential politics is messy.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "In Tuesday's CNN/ORC national poll, Carson placed third after Trump and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush Carson has rallied much of the GOP's conservative Christian base Ben Carson says he wouldn\u2019t use drones to kill undocumented immigrants \u2013 but he\u2019d order strikes on the caves used to transport people across the United States\u2019 southern border. \u201cThere are caves that they utilize. Those caves can be eliminated. There are a number of possibilities \u2013 that could be one of them,\u201d Carson told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta Sunday on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates He added emphatically: \u201cI\u2019m not talking about killing people. No people with drones.\u201d Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who is now among the top polling candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, also proposed using military strategists and the National Guard to secure the border. He suggested last week that he would consider using drones along the border \u2013 but said Sunday that he only meant they could be used to watch porous portions of the border, and to shut down \u201cthe caves that are utilized to hide people\u201d by smugglers. \u201cDrones can help with the surveillance. In no way did I suggest that drones be used to kill people,\u201d Carson said. Following a well-received performance at the first GOP debate and his frequent criticism of Planned Parenthood, Carson has recently seen interest in his campaign rise. In Tuesday\u2019s CNN/ORC national poll, Carson placed third after Trump and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who rose to political prominence two years ago with his blistering attack against President Barack Obama\u2019s policies at the National Prayer Breakfast, has rallied much of the GOP\u2019s conservative Christian base with a cry for greater religious freedoms and his fierce opposition to abortion rights. A look back at Ben Carson on fetal tissue research Carson says he opposes abortion today, despite a history as \u201ca pretty left-wing Democrat\u201d who once disavowed a television ad he appeared in promoting an anti-abortion ballot measure in Maryland. Carson said he changed his mind on abortion after thinking through how slavery was eliminated. \u201cI make no bones about the fact that I used to be a Democrat. I used to be a pretty left-wing Democrat, in fact. Over the course of time, you know, my views have changed very dramatically,\u201d Carson said Sunday. \u201cIn 1992, I personally was against abortion, but I was not for causing anybody else to do anything. I was pro-choice in that region,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve changed because I\u2019ve learned a lot of things, and I began to think about, if abolitionists a long time ago had said, I don\u2019t believe in slavery, but anybody else can do it if they want to, where would we be today? So that changed my opinion about a lot of things.\u201d In 1992, Carson appeared in a video that urged voters to reject a controversial Maryland referendum that sought to make it easier for women to get an abortion. The video, sponsored by anti-abortion group Vote Know, made clear in a tagline at the end that it was urging voters to vote down the measure. Ben Carson's career in politics \u201cLife is hectic. And it\u2019s sometimes easy to let important decisions be made for us. Ballot Question 6 could be like that,\u201d Carson says in the clip. Soon after, Carson appeared in a press conference in which he backed away from taking a stance on the issue. He said he did not realize the ad would take a political position on the referendum. \u201cMy message is not to vote for or against Question Six, but to educate yourself,\u201d he said, adding that he asked Vote Know to pull the clip. \u201cIt became quite apparent that there were things that could be easily misconstrued.\u201d But the media avail was sponsored by Maryland for Choice \u2013 a pro-abortion rights organization. Anti-abortion activists said at the time that political pressure may have caused Carson to back away from his support for their cause. \u201cHe may have said that today, but when he agreed to do the spot, he signed off with approval,\u201d Ellen Curro of Vote Know said. \u201cI think he has just gotten tremendous pressure from the other side because of the political nature of this argument.\u201d Abortion rights activists, however, praised Carson\u2019s decision to denounce his appearance in the anti-abortion ad. \u201cI see it as a victory for Dr. Carson to be able to thoughtfully and legitimately explain how he feels about the issue,\u201d said Stacie Spector, a member of Maryland for Choice. Carson\u2019s message has resonated with Republican voters. In a CNN/ORC poll earlier this month, he tied with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as the best GOP candidate to handle abortion, grabbing 17% of the vote. And he was the considered the top GOP candidate who \u201cbest represents Republican values.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Political strategists are waiting to see if Donald Trump's recent comment on Megyn Kelly turn the tide on his polling Despite repeatedly igniting a backlash from within his party, previous rhetorical missteps have failed to derail Trump's rise Trump stood by his comments in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday Now, finally, Donald Trump might have thrown cold water on his own white-hot summer surge to the top of the Republican presidential primary field. The real estate mogul\u2019s attacks on Fox News host Megyn Kelly, his steadfast decision to lash out at anybody who questioned him, and yet another high profile HR departure from his campaign has led some GOP operatives to predict that Trump will finally face a backlash from voters who have until now tolerated his bombastic comments out of an appreciation for his willingness to rage against the political machine. At least, some political strategists think so. But like one of the summer\u2019s other great cliffhangers, no one can really be sure. \u201cThis is like wondering whether Jon Snow is really dead in \u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019 Every time I think I understand it, it changes,\u201d said New Hampshire Republican strategist Tom Rath, comparing the Trump campaign\u2019s future \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 to the not-so-certain recent death of a lead character in the HBO series. Trump sparked his latest controversy Friday night by declaring that Kelly, one of the three moderators of Thursday night\u2019s first Republican presidential debate of 2016\u2019s primary season, \u201chad blood coming out of her nose; blood coming out of her \u2013 whatever,\u201d because she had grilled him over his history of derogatory comments aimed at women. Many of his opponents took it as a reference to menstruation. In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Trump characteristically refused to give an inch, saying he wouldn\u2019t apologize and he\u2019d meant nothing of the sort. \u201cOnly a sick person would even think about that,\u201d he said. RELATED: 13 jaw-dropping moments of the 2016 campaign The attack on Kelly \u2013 a revered figure on the right \u2013 has again ignited worries among party leaders that the presidential campaign is handing Democrats opportunities to reprise their 2012 playbook and accuse Republicans of waging a war on women. It comes days after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush made his own blunder, questioning \u2013 mistakenly, he later said \u2013 whether the United States should spend as much as it does on women\u2019s health, as he attacked Planned Parenthood. What did the GOP candidates' body language say? Bush himself raised those concerns about Trump on Saturday. \u201cCome on. Give me a break. I mean, do we want to win? Do we want to insult 53% of all voters?\u201d Bush said. \u201cWhat Donald Trump said is wrong. That is not how we win elections.\u201d Trump\u2019s standing had improved in recent weeks among conservatives, but some operatives predicted that he\u2019ll be hurt by his latest remarks because they will raise questions even among his loyal supporters about whether he has the temperament necessary to win a general election. \u201cPoliticians have survived plenty of unfortunate statements and events, but Trump is turning his greatest asset into a weakness. Flippant comments eventually catch up with you,\u201d said Pete Seat, a former aide to President George W. Bush. In a reference to gifts that politicians typically log on campaign finance disclosures, Seat said: \u201cWhat he is achieving is making considerable in-kind contributions to Hillary Clinton through his comments.\u201d RELATED: How GOP 2016ers responded to Trump\u2019s \u2018blood\u2019 comment This, though, is far from the first round of speculation about Trump\u2019s demise. First his declaration that many undocumented Mexican immigrants are \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ckillers\u201d sparked backlash from a party fearful of losing the Latino vote. Then his questioning of the hero status of McCain, a prisoner of war for five years in Vietnam, led top GOP officials to ask him to tone it down. Yet each time, Trump\u2019s poll numbers climbed higher. \u201cTrump has been declared dead so many times that he must feel like Huck Finn at his own funeral,\u201d said Eric Fehrnstrom, a veteran of Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 Republican presidential campaign. \u201cThe fact is, he\u2019s not going away. He defies the normal political laws of gravity,\u201d Fehrnstrom said. \u201cHe may go up and down in the polls but he will be there when the first voting takes place in February. The rest of the field is going to have to get used to him and make their adjustments.\u201d That view isn\u2019t unanimous, however. While attacking McCain is \u201cvery, very popular for conservatives,\u201d going after Kelly is a different story, said Republican strategist Ford O\u2019Connell, a veteran of McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle Megyn Kelly, how are you going to handle Hillary Clinton?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the comments per se. It\u2019s more the thin-skinned tantrum that he threw afterwards. And that is what is less presidential.\u201d RELATED: Donald Trump slams Megyn Kelly On Sunday, Trump blamed his Republican presidential opponents for fanning the flames of controversy, and claimed he meant to refer to her \u201cnose and/or ears\u201d \u2013 not a woman\u2019s period. In the hours after the interview, Trump also attacked on twitter former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, the only woman running in the 17-person Republican presidential primary field. \u201cI just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight, you develop a massive headache. She has zero chance!\u201d Trump tweeted. Trump attacked several other Republicans who have criticized his remarks about Kelly. He pointed to Bush\u2019s gaffe over women\u2019s health funding last week, saying he \u201ccame out horribly\u201d and that the comment \u201cwill go down to haunt him and be the same as Romney\u2019s \u201947%.\u2019\u201d Of blogger Erick Erickson\u2019s decision to revoke Trump\u2019s invitation to the weekend\u2019s conservative RedState Gathering, Trump said Sunday: \u201cThis guy\u2019s a loser. He\u2019s backed so many candidates who have lost.\u201d He even said he\u2019s gotten the better of his attacks on Kelly, which stemmed from her question during Thursday night\u2019s debate about Trump using words like \u201cpigs\u201d to describe women. \u201cI have nothing against Megyn Kelly. I think her question was extremely unfair to me \u2013 her whole question was unfair to me. \u2026 On social media, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s beloved,\u201d Trump said. Former Trump adviser Roger Stone talks to CNN His attacks come as Trump has gone, in the span of 72 hours, from the surging front-runner to the public face of a campaign in turmoil. Trump\u2019s campaign said Saturday it had fired top political adviser Roger Stone \u2013 who promptly denied being let go and insisted he had quit. The back-and-forth over Stone, coming at the same time as the Kelly controversy, fueled a sense of growing tumult surrounding Trump\u2019s campaign, which recently cut ties with two men accused of writing inflammatory Facebook posts. RELATED: Trump campaign claims it fired top adviser \u2013 who says he quit The back-and-forth over Stone, who provided CNN with what he said was his resignation letter as Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski insisted that Trump\u2019s team never saw the letter, highlighted the campaign\u2019s seeming lack of veteran political advisers. And the letter from Stone, a former Richard Nixon aide who helped the campaign with debate preparations, also highlights concerns similar to those national Republican leaders have expressed over how the real estate mogul\u2019s rise in the polls has proven a distraction from the 2016 race\u2019s key policy debates. \u201cUnfortunately, the current controversies involving personalities and provocative media fights have reached such a high volume that it has distracted attention from your platform and overwhelmed your core message. With this current direction of the candidacy, I no longer can remain involved in your campaign,\u201d Stone\u2019s letter to Trump says.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton undid some family history and hit two of her Republican opponents in their own backyards on Friday as she called for an end to the Cuba embargo. The former secretary of state became the first major presidential candidate to come to the heart of America\u2019s Cuban exile community to make her case that Congress should lift the Cuban embargo. That wasn\u2019t the only reason Clinton picked Miami, though. It\u2019s also home to two top Republican presidential contenders: Bush, the former Florida governor, and Sen. Marco Rubio. Bush lives nearby, and Rubio teaches a class at Florida International University \u2013 which hosted Clinton\u2019s speech. The location offered an implicit contrast that Clinton had already made directly earlier Friday morning, when she and Bush spoke within minutes of each other at the National Urban League\u2019s conference in Fort Lauderdale. \u201cThe real test of a candidates\u2019 commitment is not whether we come to speak,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cit is whether we are still around after the cameras are gone and the votes are counted. It is whether our positions live up to our rhetoric and too often we see a mismatch between what some candidates say in venues like this and what they actually do when they are elected.\u201d RELATED: Hillary Clinton knocks Jeb Bush\u2019s \u2018right to rise\u2019 at Urban League speech Then, she made the 45-minute drive into Miami to draw a contrast with Republicans on Cuban policy, saying the future of the U.S.-Cuban relationship is at stake in the upcoming presidential election. \u201cWe have arrived at a decisive moment. The Cuban people have waited long enough for progress to come,\u201d Clinton said Friday. \u201cEven many Republicans on Capitol Hill are starting to recognize the urgency of moving forward. It\u2019s time for their leaders to either get on board or get out of the way.\u201d She called out by name Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, urging the two to \u201cstep up and answer the pleas of the Cuban people.\u201d And then she took a shot at the entire GOP field of presidential contenders, saying that their support for the embargo will \u201cplay right into the hard-liners\u2019 hands. They would reverse the progress we made.\u201d \u201cThey have it backwards. Engagement is not a gift to the Castros, it\u2019s a threat to the Castros,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton\u2019s position mirrors one President Barack Obama took weeks earlier, calling for an end to the embargo as he announced the opening of a U.S. embassy in Havana. RELATED: Obama announces re-establishment of U.S.-Cuba diplomatic ties But it was a major change from the position both Clinton and her husband have taken before. It was then-President Bill Clinton who in 1996 signed into law a requirement that Congress approve the lifting of any part of the Cuba embargo. The move made political sense at the time: Clinton was running for re-election and the bipartisan bill landed on his desk after the Cuban military shot down two U.S. civilian planes over the Straits of Florida, killing four members of the Cuban-American exile group Brothers to the Rescue. \u201cWe will not tolerate attacks on United States citizens,\u201d Bill Clinton said at the time, \u201cand we will stand with those both inside and outside Cuba who are working for a peaceful transition to freedom and democracy.\u201d Hillary Clinton said the embargo should remain in place during her 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cUntil there is some recognition on the part of whoever is in charge of the Cuban government that they have to move toward democracy and freedom for the Cuban people, it will be very difficult for us to change our policy,\u201d she said then. Clinton acknowledged Friday that she\u2019d previously supported the embargo. But she said watching closer ties between Cuba and America as the Obama administration in 2009 made it easier for Cuban-Americans to visit and send money to people on the island led her to recommend, by the end of her tenure as secretary of state, that the embargo be lifted. Dropping it, she said, would \u201cstrip the Castro regime of its excuses and force it to grapple with the demands and the aspirations of the Cuban people,\u201d and to \u201cfigure out how to adapt to a rapidly transforming society.\u201d RELATED: Shift in Cuba politics boosts Obama, challenges Rubio Hillary Clinton is visiting a changed Florida, two decades after her original remarks. The Cuban-American vote, once solidly Republican, has shifted to the left as younger generations with fewer direct ties to Castro\u2019s Cuba make up an ever-growing portion of the population. A Florida International University survey of Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade County, home of the nation\u2019s largest Cuban exile community, found that a majority favor lifting the embargo. Meanwhile, Cuban-Americans make up a smaller portion of Florida\u2019s Latino population, as Puerto Ricans and other groups grow in numbers. The changing trends weren\u2019t the only upside for Clinton: At least 20 television cameras, the majority from Hispanic outlets, were present for Friday\u2019s speech. Just like Clinton\u2019s support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, her position on Cuba is in line with the majority of Latinos \u2013 a key voting bloc in several 2016 swing states. Despite Florida\u2019s changing demographics and the Cuban-American diaspora\u2019s softened view of the embargo, Republican presidential contenders remain stiffly opposed to lifting it \u2013 and they\u2019re earning some supporters for it. Daniela Ferrera, a 17-year-old Miami resident, protested outside Clinton\u2019s event, saying she\u2019ll support Rubio because he \u201cactually believes in freedom for the Cuban people.\u201d Ferrera\u2019s family left Cuba in a boat with her family when she was 3. She became a U.S. citizen in 2001 and will be eligible to vote in 2016, she said. Of Clinton, she said, \u201cI respect her as a person, however I don\u2019t see eye-to-eye with her on this issue and frankly, I think she is wrong on this issue.\u201d She said Clinton should \u201cstrengthen, strengthen the sanctions if anything, because right now they are not really strong and they need to be stronger.\u201d Bush responded in a statement Friday, saying \u201cIt\u2019s insulting to many residents of Miami for Hillary Clinton to come here to endorse a retreat in the struggle for democracy in Cuba.\u201d \u201cThis city has become a home and a refuge to thousands and thousands of Castro\u2019s victims,\u201d he said. \u201cSecretary Clinton\u2019s call to abandon the embargo \u2013 and the principles of democracy and freedom for the Cuban people \u2013 in exchange for nothing in return from the regime in Havana adds insult to the pain they and their families feel.\u201d Rubio called Clinton\u2019s position \u201ca grave mistake,\u201d issuing a call for Cuban democracy that echoed Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 position. \u201cUnilateral concessions to the Castros will only strengthen a brutal, anti-American regime 90 miles from our shore,\u201d Rubio said in a statement. \u201cPresident Obama and Secretary Clinton must learn that appeasement only emboldens dictators and repressive governments, and weakens America\u2019s global standing in the 21st century,\u201d he said. \u201cAs president, I will stand with the Cuban people and only support an end to the embargo that is accompanied by real democratic reform.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Kasich announced Tuesday a bid for White House Kasich has run before, but said he lacked funding last time He's taken contrary positions on Obamacare funding, immigration, common core Ohio Gov. John Kasich burst onto the Republican playing field Tuesday with a freewheeling and, at times, emotional speech that hit on two main points: Americans should be working together and he can win, despite long odds. The second-term Ohio governor told his life story for 45 minutes Tuesday at his alma mater, Ohio State University. And it was 20 minutes into his speech, at times meandering and sounding unscripted, before he made it official: \u201cI am here to ask you for your prayers, for your support \u2026 because I have decided to run for president of the United States,\u201d Kasich told the crowd of roughly 4,000. Kasich tacked to the left throughout his speech, in a way that no other Republican candidate has this cycle, touching on themes of unity and support. \u201cThere are those who say \u2018Just work harder.\u2019 \u2018Pull yourselves up by your bootstraps.\u2019 I believe in all of that. Some people just don\u2019t have the fortune we have,\u201d he said. Later in his speech, Kasich \u2013 who has been criticized heavily for expanding Medicaid under the President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law \u2013 asked for empathy. \u201cThe Lord wants our hearts to reach out to those who don\u2019t have what we have,\u201d he said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be hard for America, that\u2019s who we are. Empathy. Don\u2019t be so quick too judge.\u201d As he becomes the 16th major Republican candidate to enter the field, Kasich faces an immediate hurdle of trying to make it onstage for the first Republican debate. Fox News has said only the top 10 candidates in national polling will make the cut and Kasich has been trailing in the back of the pack with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Kasich hinted at his task in a refrain throughout his speech, laying down the argument for why he could upend the frontrunners in the wide-open field. \u201cThey said it couldn\u2019t be done, and we proved them wrong again\u201d Kasich said, as he recounted his first run for Congress, then his 2010 run for governor. Though he waited until Tuesday to announce, the Kasich campaign has effectively been up and running for months. His affiliated campaign group, New Day for America, began airing its second television ad in New Hampshire this week. He blasted his way on-air late in June with the first major buy of the cycle, spending $1.7 million to introduce himself to New Hampshire voters. Now, as he formalized his bid 20 minutes into his speech Tuesday, Kasich will be looking to ride the post-announcement bump into the top 10 candidates \u2013 the group that will be able to participate in the first GOP debate next month sponsored by Fox Next. The 63-year-old Republican has a resume tailor-made for presidential politics: elected twice statewide in battleground Ohio, worked in the private sector and served nearly two decades in Congress, which included a six-year run as chairman of the House Budget Committee. Why Donald Trump is surging in the polls Kasich launches his presidential campaign near the back of the pack in the polls. A CNN/ORC survey released in July showed the Ohio Republican with just 2% support among likely GOP primary voters. And the latest average tallied by RealClearPolitics has Kasich at 1.5% nationwide, and in 12th place, just behind former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum. His candidacy offers mainstream Republicans another option alongside former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. As he looks to differentiate himself, his calling card may end up being his blunt and sometimes prickly style \u2013 which could be spun to present a straight-talking candidate, ready to break out of typical molds. Kasich previously sought the presidency 16 years ago, but withdrew from the race in July 1999 and endorsed George W. Bush. During that campaign he referred to himself as the \u201cJolt Cola\u201d of the Republican field to draw a contrast between his lively personality and what he saw as less exciting candidates. Potential 2016 presidential candidates This time, however, he said he\u2019s staffed up and ready to run. \u201cI\u2019ve done this before. The problem was last time that I had this jet airplane ready to take off but I didn\u2019t have any gas for it. It never got into the air,\u201d Kasich said earlier this month, following a meeting of Washington backers he convened near the Capitol. \u201cI learned a lot from that.\u201d More than a decade-and-a-half later, Kasich is still full of energy, and is not shy about taking on his fellow Republicans: He has accepted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, supports Common Core education standards and has allowed for the possibility of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. That call-it-like-he-sees-it style has helped raise Kasich\u2019s political stock, at least in Ohio. The Republican scored a resounding victory in his 2014 re-election fight, receiving 64% of the vote and winning all but two of the Buckeye State\u2019s 88 counties, albeit against a flawed Democratic challenger. That 2014 victory was even more remarkable considering Kasich\u2019s standing just a few years earlier. Shortly after taking office, Kasich pushed to end the collective bargaining rights for public employee unions in the state, a bruising battle that saw his approval ratings dip into the 30s. In November 2011, Ohio voters rejected the measure at the ballot by a 22-point margin, 61% to 39%. John Kasich's political career \u201cIt\u2019s clear the people have spoken,\u201d Kasich said in the aftermath of the defeat. \u201cI heard their voices. I understand their decision. And frankly, I respect what the people have to say in an effort like this. And as a result of that, it requires me to take a deep breath and to spend some time to reflect on what happened here.\u201d Perry and Trump trade shots over border security Less than two years later, Kasich took a step that would roil some conservatives, announcing in February of 2013 that Ohio would accept federal money under President Obama\u2019s health care law to dramatically expand Medicaid coverage to some 275,000 residents. The decision resulted in a months-long fight with GOP state lawmakers, but Kasich ultimately prevailed in an effort that he has framed as both an economic and moral cause. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve been doing for the people who have been living in the shadows, living under a bridge or whatever,\u201d Kasich said during a Republican Governors Association panel last November. \u201cAnd the people have responded to it. Conservatives in my state have responded to it by and large.\u201d The effort did not appear to have any lingering effects by the time November 2014 rolled around, with 88% of conservatives saying they backed Kasich for a second term, according to exit polls. But it was Kasich\u2019s ability to expand his support among groups that Republicans have struggled to win over at the national level, winning 60% of women, 59% of moderates and 26% of African-Americans. Kasich suggests other Republicans should be following his example if they want to take back the White House next year. \u201cI think it\u2019s a formula for the country. Look at problems and fix them. Don\u2019t be worried about the next election,\u201d Kasich told CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger during a visit to South Carolina in February. \u201cI mean, too many politicians worry about getting elected as they do their job \u2013 if they worried more about doing their job they\u2019d get elected. No Republican has waged a successful campaign for the White House without winning Ohio. And there is one thing Kasich says will not work with Buckeye State voters: extremism. \u201cIf somebody comes into Ohio and they\u2019re extreme, they\u2019re not going to win,\u201d Kasich told CNN. \u201cI mean, we don\u2019t operate that way in Ohio.\u201d Walker pushes back on flip-flop accusations That has been a common refrain for Kasich as he explored a potential presidential bid earlier this year. During a March appearance in New Hampshire Kasich blasted \u201call the divisions in America\u201d and said leaders should \u201ccross their own interest groups and reach out to unite and lift Americans.\u201d The challenge for Kasich, though, is selling a more pragmatic brand of politics to a conservative GOP primary electorate eager to draw sharp contrasts with President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee in 2016. Kasich has an answer ready for critics who contend his approach to governing does not line up with conservative principles. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ve got as much a right as anybody in the Republican Party to define what conservatism means,\u201d Kasich told CNN in February. \u201cI was the governor of Ohio that took an $8 billion hole and produced a surplus. We\u2019ve cut taxes more than anybody in the country, and they\u2019re wondering about my conservatism? Maybe I should wonder about theirs.\u201d There is one policy area where it is hard to deny Kasich\u2019s conservative chops: the budget. The fiscal health of the country has been a focus of the Ohio Republican for decades. Kasich describes himself as the \u201cchief architect\u201d of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, signed by President Bill Clinton, which resulted in the first federal budget surplus since the late 1960s. Last December, fresh off his 2014 re-election victory, Kasich launched what he dubbed a \u201ccrusade\u201d to adopt a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which included travel to the key early voting states of South Carolina and New Hampshire, as well as others such as Idaho and Utah. \u201cIf you don\u2019t manage the debt, it\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Kasich said during a March stop in New Hampshire, pledging to \u201ctravel all over America\u201d to promote his agenda. When he was mulling a bid earlier this year, Kasich said that one of the key factors in his decision would be whether there was a way for him to win the White House. Amid a field of bigger-name contenders \u2013 like Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2013 Kasich looks crowded out. However, his affiliated \u201cNew Day\u201d group announced a combined fundraising haul of $11.5 million during a somewhat-abbreviated period starting from May 1, enough for the Kasich team to land in the middle of the pack. And Kasich has the backing of a handful of key Republicans, including top media strategists from Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 bid, Fred Davis and John Weaver, and former New Hampshire Sen. John Sununu, something Kasich often points out. \u201cGive me somebody better than John Sununu in New Hampshire, tell me who it is,\u201d Kasich said earlier this month. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out who it would be. Maybe (former) Gov. (John) Sununu, his father. But I\u2019ll take young John.\u201d",

One of those is ethanol \u2013 with corn often a key ingredient. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with the RFS,\u201d Gov. Terry Branstad said Saturday, offering a not so subtle warning as he kicked off a daylong agriculture summit that featured a string of likely Republican presidential candidates. The RFS is a major issue that White House hopefuls are forced to address whenever they visit the No. 1 corn-producing state that also goes first in the presidential nominating calendar. But it\u2019s a less popular policy for small government conservatives, who decry the mandate as federal overreach in the private sector. In his first 2016 visit to Iowa, Jeb Bush sought to delicately explain his desire to see the RFS disappear over time. \u201cThe market\u2019s ultimately going to have to decide this,\u201d he told the audience at the event, which took place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Bush acknowledged that the mandate, which passed in 2007, has helped lower dependence on foreign oil and boost corn-heavy economies. \u201cBut as we move forward over the long haul, there should be certainty for people to invest,\u201d he argued, saying ethanol will no longer need help from the government. \u201cSo at some point we\u2019ll see a reduction of the RFS need, because ethanol will be such a valuable part of the energy feedstock for our country.\u201d He declined, however, to suggest when exactly that may happen. In his remarks, Bush also defended his position in favor of legal status for undocumented immigrants after they meet a wide set of requirements. And while attending a fundraiser Friday night in Des Moines, he stood by his support for Common Core, the controversial testing standards that have become a point of contention for conservatives. Election 2016: Jeb Bush makes his first Iowa foray Bush\u2019s frank statements on the RFS and his defense of some of his most controversial views indicated that the former Florida governor plans on sticking with his positions as he gets ready to hit the campaign trail, no matter how unpopular they may be to certain audiences. Still, he was not totally immune to at least some pandering. Bush told the crowd that he\u2019ll be cooking some \u201cIowa beef\u201d Sunday when he\u2019s back home with his family in Florida, adding that he\u2019ll probably make some \u201creally good guacamole,\u201d too. Talking about campaigning for his father\u2019s presidential campaigns in Iowa, Bush said he went to at least 50 counties. \u201cI remember eating really well \u2013 eating really, really well.\u201d With a John Deere tractor towering near the stage, each candidate sat on stage for a 20-minute Q&A with Bruce Rastetter, an agribusiness entrepreneur and major Republican donor in Iowa. The audience of close to 1,200 was comprised largely of farmers and other leaders in the agriculture industry. While Bush took a mild approach to the RFS, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas flat out opposed it, saying Washington shouldn\u2019t be \u201cpicking winners and losers.\u201d \u201cI have every bit of faith that businesses can continue to compete and continue to do well without having to go on bended knee asking for subsidies, asking for special favors,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s how we got in this problem to begin win.\u201d Ethanol proponents argue that because oil companies own gas stations, consumers are unable to access ethanol and therefore it needs the government\u2019s support to break through oil\u2019s stronghold of the market. Cruz acknowledged that his view wouldn\u2019t be well-received, but tried to argue that it proved his authenticity. \u201cLook, I recognize that this is a gathering of a lot of folks who the answer you\u2019d like me to give is, \u2018I\u2019m for the RFS, darn it.\u2019 That\u2019d be the easy thing to do. But I\u2019ll tell ya, people are pretty fed up, I think, with politicians that run around and tell one group one thing, tell another group another thing.\u201d Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry took a similar stance and defended his decision to request a waiver that would exempt Texas from the federal mandate. If individual states want to require that ethanol be used in gasoline, that\u2019s fine, he said, but not the federal government. \u201cI philosophically don\u2019t agree that Washington, D.C. needs to be making these decision that affect \u2026 our agriculture industry,\u201d Perry said. Other contenders offered entirely opposite positions. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d supports the RFS. \u201cThat\u2019s what the law requires. So let\u2019s make sure we comply with the law. That should be the minimum,\u201d he said, drawing applause from the crowd. Rick Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, ticked off what he called a \u201claundry list\u201d of benefits, including more energy independence and more jobs for farmers. \u201cIt is very important for rural Americans,\u201d said the former senator from Pennsylvania. For his part, Mike Huckabee argued that the ethanol mandate was a matter of national security. \u201cAmerica needs to do three things to be free: feed itself, fuel itself, fight for itself,\u201d the former Arkansas governor said, adding that relying on foreign governments for energy leads to a weakened United States. Huckabee, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, hit back at criticism that politicians like him simply support the RFS for political reasons. \u201cThe decisions are made not just frankly for what\u2019s best for Iowa \u2013 that\u2019s not the rationale. You can\u2019t make a decision and say, \u2018It\u2019s good for Iowa. Gee, they\u2019re the caucus state, we better suck up to them.\u2019 We better make decisions that are good for every consumer,\u201d he said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who\u2019s had a strong showing in polls since he visited the state in January, made clear that while he\u2019s generally a free market guy, he believes ethanol is being blocked from consumers and needs government assistance. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t have a free and open marketplace, and so that\u2019s why I\u2019m willing to take that position,\u201d he said. But, similar to Bush, Walker said that he expects ethanol can one day compete openly and \u201cyou no longer need in the industry to have these subsidies.\u201d The audience at Saturday\u2019s event was largely subdued, given the tone and dialogue of the summit was more substance, less red meat. Those who supported the RFS, however, received a strong response from the crowd. As for those who opposed it, Bill Couser, who co-chairs a campaign called America\u2019s Renewable Future which pushes the ethanol mandate, said he\u2019s not ready to write anyone off quite yet. But those candidates can expect to hear a lot more from him in the coming months. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t like a few of their answers, but it\u2019s going to give me some time to go help them understand the issues,\u201d he said.",

Follow him on Twitter: @TheDeansreport. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Dean Obeidallah: Trump, as media manipulator, draws outrage, buzz over Muslim remarks Who's scarier? His followers, Obeidallah says He says polls show Trump supporters are far to right of the GOP and offer dark view of America Donald Trump, as we all know, is a master media manipulator. He knows how to get headlines better than any modern-day presidential candidate. (Or for that matter better than almost anyone not named Kardashian.) The latest? He called Monday for all Muslims to be blocked from entering the United States.  (How will Trump determine if a person is a Muslim? Will he make everyone trying to get into the United States eat a bacon cheeseburger?) Some have speculated that Trump\u2019s extreme rhetoric during this campaign may just be simply to get headlines. That may or may not be true. But I\u2019ll tell you one group that doesn\u2019t care either way. This group clings ferociously to Trump\u2019s most extreme positions, and its member are far to the right of the rest of the Republican Party. The group: Trump\u2019s supporters and they are scarier than he is. One recent clue? After Trump\u2019s speech Monday night detailing his plan for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u201d his supporters gave him a standing ovation. Trump\u2019s GOP rivals have publicly criticized the proposal, by contrast. Even Dick Cheney, yes Cheney, said the proposal \u201cgoes against everything we stand for and believe in.\u201d But there\u2019s so much more. A recent poll found that three quarters of Trump\u2019s supporters are in favor of deporting all of the 11 million-plus undocumented immigrants and banning any Syrian refugees from seeking shelter in America. In contrast, Marco Rubio only has 5% and Jeb Bush 6% of those far-right voters. And a recent Iowa poll found that 73% of Trump supporters in that state favor his idea to create a \u201cdeportation force\u201d and deport all undocumented immigrants in our country. In comparison, only 40% of Republicans supporting any of the other GOP presidential candidates agree. Trump also polls well among people who are apprehensive about Muslims. Republican voters who believe that Muslims support ISIS are 35% more likely to support Trump than those Republicans who think \u201cvery few\u201d Muslims support that the terrorist group, a survey found. Worse, Republicans who think Muslims in general (which would include American Muslims) are \u201can immediate threat to the United States\u201d support the Donald by more than 30 percentage points. Speaking of Muslims, while 43% of Republicans in a September poll believe Obama is a Muslim, that number goes up to 54% among Trump supporters. OK, I\u2019m pretty sure you get it: Trump\u2019s supporters are really right wing, even when compared with other Republicans. In fact, a poll released this week finds that 68% of Trump supporters would vote for him if he leaves the GOP and runs as an independent candidate. But what\u2019s more alarming is some of the hateful rhetoric I have witnessed firsthand by some Trump supporters on Twitter. It\u2019s been a parade of hateful comments about Latinos, Muslims and Black Lives Matter. Trump has even received the support of white supremacists for his endorsement of President Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d plan to deport undocumented immigrants in the \u201950s. Trump has become one-stop shopping for the far-right. He may lose this election, but he has shown the country something important about itself: that the greatest threat to America, as we know it, may not be foreign threats but un-American ideologies right here at home.

            "article_content": "CNN commentators weigh in on winners and losers in Fox Business debate No clear winner, but Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina had good nights, they write CNN Opinion asked a range of contributors for their take on last week\u2019s attacks in Paris and how the war on ISIS must change if the U.S. and its allies want to defeat it. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors. The best moments of this debate were when the candidates actually debated each other. Whether it was Rand Paul and Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio all debating the role of the United States in combating ISIS, or John Kasich and Ted Cruz on Dodd-Frank, Tuesday night provided voters with real contrast. We need to construct debates where the moderators don\u2019t silo the candidates off from one another so that they\u2019re delivering monologues, but are allowed to have a conversation about important issues where they disagree. Frontrunner Ben Carson gave an unimpressive performance. Where Rubio, Fiorina and others were substantive, Carson was vague and unsure. Trump\u2019s attack against Fiorina for interrupting deserved its boos. He may be good at counter-punching, but not when it comes to Fiorina \u2013 or Carson \u2013 yet. Jeb Bush actually had a decent night, perhaps proving that when he swings against President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton he\u2019s much more effective than when he attempts it against his Republican opponents. Rubio and Fiorina had another great debate. They were polished and on point. The loser of the night was John Kasich, who was annoyingly pushy, and when he was allowed to interject, didn\u2019t do much with the opportunity. S.E. Cupp is the author of \u201cLosing Our Religion: The Liberal Media\u2019s Attack on Christianity,\u201d co-author of \u201cWhy You\u2019re Wrong About the Right\u201d and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The fourth Republican debate featured a striking set of attacks on frontrunner Donald Trump \u2013 not just engaging him on economic and foreign policy, but ridiculing the logic and plausibility of his plans. Ohio Gov. John Kasich went straight at Trump\u2019s stated intention to find and deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a silly argument. It\u2019s not an adult argument,\u201d he said. Ex-Gov. Jeb Bush jumped in, pointing out that Trump\u2019s strident anti-immigrant rhetoric will ultimately hurt Republicans come Election Day next year. \u201cThey\u2019re doing high fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this,\u201d said Bush. On foreign policy, several candidates attacked Trump\u2019s plan to take a tougher line with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who Trump said appeared on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d the same night he did (\u201cWe were stablemates\u2026and that went pretty well\u201d). \u201cDonald is wrong on this. He is absolutely wrong on this,\u201d said Bush. \u201cThat\u2019s like a board game\u2026That\u2019s not how the real world works.\u201d  Former business executive Carly Fiorina not only disagreed with Trump but pointedly mentioned that she has met in private with Putin, not in a television waiting room. Remarkably, Trump mostly refrained from issuing his well-known counterattacks, insults and put-downs. The complaints signal a new attitude among candidates who have seen Trump\u2019s stalled approval numbers and sky-high negative numbers in the polls. The path to victory for candidates with years of government experience \u2013 especially Bush, Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 is to steer voters away from vague boasts and ideas lacking in specifics. Errol Louis is the host of \u201cInside City Hall,\u201d a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. Tuesday night\u2019s Fox Business-hosted Republican debate offered up nothing that we haven\u2019t already seen in prior tilts: Egregious and easily fact-checkable misstatements, over-the-top anti-Obama hyperbole, vague guarantees of magical American transformation and raw red meat tossed in steaming lumps to all the usual right-wing interest groups: border-blockers, flat-taxers, defense hawks and the pro-Israel lobby. The most rational appearing person on stage, John Kasich, looked increasingly like he didn\u2019t belong there, even referring to himself as a party crasher, as he made the vital mistakes (for today\u2019s GOP) of dismissing mass deportation, supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership and saying one begrudgingly nice thing about President Obama. The debate\u2019s big dogs, meanwhile, reinforced the support of their bases \u2013 evangelicals for Ben Carson, nativists for Trump \u2013 while doing nothing to make themselves any more appealing to voters beyond the primary. (Trump\u2019s entire case for election is \u201cI\u2019ll make America great again.\u201d How? \u201cI\u2019m rich.\u201d) As for the once and never frontrunner Jeb Bush, Tuesday evening should mark the end of his campaign. Listless, tongue-tied and peevish, Bush ended the debate by making what seemed to be a fervent pitch to be chosen as secretary of Veterans Affairs. Just as well: He\u2019ll certainly never be elected president. Jeff Yang is a columnist for the Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows, including Public Radio International\u2019s \u201cThe Takeaway\u201d and WNYC\u2019s \u201cThe Brian Lehrer Show.\u201d There was no single candidate who was the standout victor in the Fox Business GOP debate, but there was a top tier of performers: Cruz, Rubio, Fiorina. Cruz separated himself from the other candidates with a straightforward strategy: Answer the question asked, clearly and precisely. Instead of a long preamble, sprinkled with r\u00e9sum\u00e9 non sequiturs and campaign talking points, Cruz got right into the meat of the matter and showed a mastery of subjects ranging from bank bailouts to tax policy. He might have gained some supporters; he certainly didn\u2019t lose any. Rubio was in his usual slick form, fluid on policy and charismatic with personal anecdotes. There is a fine line, however, between going to one\u2019s strengths and going to the well too often. Rubio is starting to sound less like a standard-bearer of the American Dream and more like a commission-based salesman for it. Not every debate answer should start with a variation of \u201cI\u2019m the son of immigrants, my father was a bartender\u2026\u201d Carly Fiorina needed a big night; she did well, but probably not well enough to matter. Arguably the most knowledgeable candidate on the stage on economic matters (sorry, Trump fans), Fiorina\u2019s fiscal clarion call was for zero-based budgeting which, while sensible reform, isn\u2019t the sort of thing that gets a crowd fired up, or that they remember. Honorable mention goes to Rand Paul, who gets the award for most improved. It won\u2019t be enough to matter in the polls, but if his purpose is now to be an \u201cideas candidate\u201d for libertarianism, he may have finally left a mark by going after defense spending and interventionism in the Middle East. Carson and Trump showed up, were fine, not much else to say. No major flubs, no grand slams either. They will stay at the top of the GOP pack, for now. Jeb Bush was mostly defensive and irascible. Instead of winning converts, he seems intent on scolding America into liking him. At various points during the night, it felt like maybe he realized this whole being president situation isn\u2019t going to work out for him. And one last thing: we learned that nothing can make you long for Chris Christie quite like a belligerent John Kasich. Buck Sexton is a political commentator for CNN and host of \u201cThe Buck Sexton Show\u201d on The Blaze. He was previously a CIA counterterrorism analyst. The reality show phase of the GOP presidential race may have ended tonight. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there were reality show-esque moments such as when Donald Trump channeled the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d by lashing out at Carly Fiorina with the remark, \u201cWhy does she keep interrupting people?\u201d But for the most part, the debate focused on policies, not the moderators nor lashing out at the media like the last debate on CNBC. Ohio Gov. John Kasich was truly impressive in his command of the issues and trying to introduce reality, such as calling out Trump\u2019s unrealistic plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. Kasich also was able to avoid just serving up talking points \u2013 in contrast to Carly Fiorina and Ted Cruz, who seemed to give stump speeches to answer any question. Ben Carson truly seemed lost when it came to foreign policy questions, as if he didn\u2019t know that would be on the test. And Carson\u2019s answer on whether he would break up big banks was truly a WTF moment. On the flip side, this may have been Jeb Bush\u2019s best debate. Marco Rubio was again impressive and Trump was competent. Will this matter much in the polls? Maybe not now, but I bet many in the establishment wing of the GOP will start gravitating toward Rubio unless they are moved by Kasich\u2019s argument that he\u2019s better suited to be president than a one-term U.S. senator.

Tonight\u2019s Republican debate didn\u2019t do anything to change the dynamic of the GOP race. Surprisingly, Jeb Bush seemed alive, but his deliveries were still stuttering and unnatural. While this was probably one of his best debates, it seems GOP voters have already made their decision \u2013 they\u2019re done with him. Ben Carson seemed to fade again into the background. But this effect didn\u2019t seem to hurt him at the last debate, it may not this time either: He didn\u2019t shine, but he didn\u2019t make any obvious mistakes. He is very well-liked and will continue, with Trump, to stay atop the polls. Trump had flashes of the bravado persona that Republican voters have fallen in love with. While Sen. Rand Paul got the better of him during the Trans-Pacific Partnership discussion \u2013 when Paul pointed out that China was not part of the TPP \u2013 it won\u2019t make a dent in Trump\u2019s popularity. And sadly for Paul, who had his best debate yet, it won\u2019t make a difference in his support, either. He will continue to lag and may have to look for an exit soon. Carly Fiorina looked strong, but she wasn\u2019t able to build on the advantage she gained during her last spectacular debate. She will make a good vice presidential option. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz had very good nights once again. They were strong, pointed and clear. It was disappointing however, that Rubio wasn\u2019t asked where he stood on deportation of the 11 million undocumented immigrants during the exchange that occurred between Trump and Kasich on that issue. Rubio and Cruz\u2019s numbers will probably go up in the polls, but neither is likely to best Carson or Trump out of this one debate. The biggest winners were the debate moderators and the Fox Business Channel. Kudos to them for keeping the debate to the issues, for imposing discipline and for going into details on the economy, taxes, immigration and foreign policy. Unfortunately, every GOP candidate still stuck to his and her evidence-free stances on minimum wage, immigration reform, health care, tax policy, job creation and focused on talking down the resilience of our economy, taking away health security from 17 million Americans by repealing Obamacare and pushing policies that would keep working Americans\u2019 and middle class families\u2019 wages down, while cutting taxes for the rich. If this is how the Republican candidate will run in a general election, we can all welcome a third Democratic president to the White House in January of 2017.

That probably sounds as interesting as tonight\u2019s debate proved to be. Coming into the GOP debate, there were questions with answers that only true political junkies were dying to know. Would Donald Trump go after new frontrunner Ben Carson? Would Marco Rubio turn in another strong performance? Would the Fox Business moderators learn from the poor reviews of their CNBC counterparts and keep control of the debate? As it turned out, this debate was more substantive, and yet it is hard to say who was the clear winner and loser. Tuesday night, no one had any especially memorable gaffes, although Ted Cruz did evoke former Texas Gov. Rick Perry at one point. Talking about his spending plan, Cruz attempted to rattle off the five government agencies he would eliminate. But apparently he forgot one, because he named the Department of Commerce twice. While this was reminiscent of Perry\u2019s infamous 2011 debate moment, at least Cruz avoided Perry\u2019s embarrassment by not saying \u201cOops!\u201d The winner of the debate was Marco Rubio. He very luckily avoided being questioned by the moderators on his past support for immigration reform, which remains a third rail among much of the Republican primary base. He was not asked about his commitment to ending President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which is overwhelmingly popular with Latinos, or the recent Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling against President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration. Similarly, while Rubio invokes his family history at every debate, he has yet to be questioned about the fact that his family \u2013 like other Cuban immigrants \u2013 enjoyed special privileges not afforded to those from other countries. For now, this should allow Rubio to continue to walk the fine line between appealing to GOP voters and winning Hispanic support \u2013 at least until he is more forcefully called out for his actual (shifting) positions. Although Rubio\u2019s answers often came across as glib and somewhat rehearsed, he will probably continue his rise in the polls. Tonight\u2019s loser was Jeb Bush. He turned in his strongest debate performance so far, but that was not enough. Bush needed a home run, and he did not hit the ball out of the park. Consider that it is an ominous sign for \u201cJeb!\u201d that Politico recently reported that the top Google search related to him was the question, \u201cIs Jeb Bush still running for President?\u201d Or that he recently rebooted his campaign under the much-ridiculed slogan, \u201cJeb can fix it.\u201d While Bush sounded passionate defending immigrants and stating his support for legalization for the undocumented, at other times he seemed to fade into the background. On a stage full of showboaters, the self-described \u201cintrovert\u201d had a hard time standing out. On a side note, if Donald Trump remains near the top of this field, things can only get worse for the Republican brand.  Trump\u2019s call for mass deportation of the undocumented will continue to drive Hispanics away from the party (To his credit, Bush reminded Trump this was both impractical and a losing political strategy). And Trump\u2019s remark about Carly Fiorina \u2013 \u201cWhy does she keep interrupting everyone?\u201d \u2013 was unseemly and sexist. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes. So, who won Tuesday night\u2019s Republican debate? The pundits who work for Fox Business seem pretty sure who won the debate \u2013 and their unanimous consensus is that Fox Business won. At the end of the debate there was more self-congratulation than you would see at a Donald Trump rally. It\u2019s pretty obvious that this debate was designed to make it easy for the candidates, but it was even more obvious that it was meant to be a bed of roses for Fox Business. Their main objective seemed to be to studiously avoid anything that could even remotely smack of unfair questions so that they could triumphantly compare themselves to CNBC. But the refusal to press the candidates allowed parts of the debate to devolve into a series of competing stump speeches. Yes, moderators refrained from asking frivolous questions, but their lack of aggressiveness allowed the candidates to give frivolous answers. If there were no \u201cgotcha\u201d questions, there were plenty of what sounded like \u201cgimme\u201d questions. When Ben Carson was asked about media that were \u201cobsessed with inconsistencies and potential exaggerations in your life story, but looked the other way when it came to then Senator Barack Obama\u2019s,\u201d it was softer than a softball question \u2013 it was set up like a T-ball for Carson to smack out of the park. They didn\u2019t even follow up when Ted Cruz pulled a total Rick Perry! When listing the five federal agencies that he would abolish, Cruz stumbled and only ended up naming four because he said \u201cCommerce\u201d twice. The moderators either weren\u2019t counting, or think that there are two Departments of Commerce. One thing seems clear \u2013 Donald Trump cannot find a friend at these debates, and that includes Donald Trump. The traditional, establishment types who make up the audiences at GOP debates consider Donald Trump to be a crass interloper who is damaging the party (though they seem to give Ben Carson a pass, perhaps because of his appeal to evangelicals.) But if nobody seems to be pulling for him, Trump does himself no favors by constantly taking ill-advised swipes at people. This time he asked why Carly Fiorina was always interrupting, earning himself some of the biggest boos of the night. No matter \u2013 Trump will still speak to crowds of people wildly cheering his plans to deport 11 million people. The people in Trump\u2019s audiences don\u2019t attend the debates. The question is whether they will vote. Here are some thoughts on some of the other individual performances: \u2013Ben Carson seems unable to make a point that doesn\u2019t end with him decrying \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d \u2013Marco Rubio is easily the best at disguising empty platitudes as a real answer. It\u2019s a skill that should not be underestimated. \u2013 Even with a panel of moderators who were virtually serving him dinner, Ted Cruz still felt it necessary to bash the media, making an awkward joke about how journalists would care about border security if cheaper foreign journalists were sneaking into this country. \u2013 Jeb Bush used his final 30 seconds to give a tip of the hat to our veterans. It was a brilliant political move\u2026if he\u2019s running to win Miss Congeniality. \u2013 Carly Fiorina has referred to people being \u201ccrushed\u201d at least a half-dozen times in every debate. Literally. \u2013 John Kasich proved that it\u2019s not enough to fight and get yourself as much air time as the big boys \u2013 you have to have something gripping to say once you\u2019ve got the microphone. \u2013 Rand Paul has staked out territory as the conservative who opposes increased military spending. There is a reason the territory was vacant. In the end, there were enough dustups between candidates to keep things lively, even without the moderators actively encouraging engagement. We don\u2019t need the moderators to egg the candidates on, but it would be nice if they at least followed up on candidates\u2019 answers. Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation for the Democratic National Committee. A nationally syndicated columnist, she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \u201cCooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.\u201d Slowly but surely, the most unpredictable and unusual primary in modern Republican history is becoming clearer. After tonight\u2019s debate on Fox Business, it\u2019s still an outsider-dominated race, but at least part of the conventional wisdom looks to be coming true. That conventional wisdom has held that Donald Trump will ultimately decline, likely followed by Ben Carson as well. And while nothing in tonight\u2019s performance spells instant doom in polls for either man, a fatal erosion of credibility seems to be gaining speed. As with the last debate, Trump seemed diminished. With more professional moderators, neither Trump nor the other candidates could score points against overbearing media personalities. Ben Carson again displayed his admirable personality and made a fundamentally important point about how a high minimum wage drives scandalously high unemployment for young minorities. He displayed candor and genuine humility that is lacking in our public life. However, Carson is tacitly reminding Republicans that running for president ought not to be an entry-level political job. Meanwhile, Jeb Bush showed a bit of life and even some passion, but \u201cenergetic Jeb\u201d seemed at times to be even more awkward than low-energy Jeb. Touting a 4%-growth program is sound but boring. Statements like, \u201cThe economic cost far exceeds the social benefits\u201d are wonky. While his performance was not disastrous, Bush conveyed nothing that is likely to stem the gradual shift of Republican establishment support from Jeb to Marco Rubio. Furthermore, Bush and John Kasich once again presented voters with the false choice of either offering amnesty or immediately deporting 11 million people residing here illegally. Rank-and-file Republicans suspect that American common sense and pragmatism might open other possibilities. Ted Cruz turned the tables on the pro-amnesty candidates by invoking the economic challenges that uncontrolled immigration presents to the middle class. Rubio was energetic and even a bit caffeinated. He had great ideas: \u201cWe need more welders and less philosophers\u201d was a great line. Ted Cruz\u2019s call for flat tax, regulatory reform and sound money combined with a shout-out to fiscal conservatives Coolidge, Kennedy and Reagan was solid. Conservatives like me made fun of Bill Clinton for saying, \u201cI feel your pain,\u201d and rightly so \u2013 a president needn\u2019t mimic Oprah. Nonetheless, Republicans need to get beyond tax plans and highfalutin talk about economic freedom and address the challenges of middle-class Americans who find it harder than before to buy a house, send kids to college, afford health care, and maybe even take a vacation once in a while. Republicans should hope their nominee has this skill. Carly Fiorina exhibited this on more than one occasion, including talking about a 40-year-old woman worried about her children\u2019s future amid the crush of big government. Most important, her invocations of experiences ranging from Silicon Valley change agent to cancer survivor conveyed that she is a real person with gravitas that could rival and surpass that of Hillary Clinton. Read the full reaction Christian Whiton is a former deputy special envoy for human rights in North Korea for the George W. Bush administration. He is president of the Hamilton Foundation, a principal with DC Advisory, a public policy consultancy, and the author of \u201cSmart Power: Between Diplomacy and War.\u201d You won\u2019t hear any complaints about sensationalism over substance this time around. Many have been clamoring for more policy from the candidates and that\u2019s exactly what they got. However, for a debate that was billed to feature economics, it was the foreign policy portion that stole the show. Senator Cruz\u2019s highlight came with his response to the immigration discussion, the first memorable moment of the night. But arguably the biggest moment came during an exchange between Marco Rubio and Rand Paul over the role of U.S. overseas and military spending. Rubio won the exchange outright after pushing back Rand Paul\u2019s assertion that his stance on military spending was not a conservative one. Rubio said, \u201cWe cannot even have an economy if we\u2019re not safe\u2026There are radical jihadists in the Middle East beheading and crucifying Christians. A radical Shia cleric in Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon. The Chinese trying to take over the South China Sea. \u2026I know, the world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest military power in the world. \u2026Either they win or we win, and we had better take this risk seriously, it is not going away on its own.\u201d Yes indeed. Which is why the foreign policy section also exposed Ben Carson for the neophyte that he is on one of the most fundamentally important roles of the president: commander in chief. It was clear Carson was out of his league and that should cost him support. Donald Trump, too, muddled his foreign policy responses, giving circuitous answers that were far from definitive. As voters begin contemplating who should occupy the Oval Office to make such decisions, they may re-evaluate their support for the politically inexperienced candidates. Senator Rubio overall had command of the issues, control over the discussion and delivered his message with charisma. From his \u201cpro family\u201d tax plans to his emphasis on representing a new generation of American leadership, Rubio has demonstrated in all four debates thus far that he possesses a unique ability to make the conservative message fresh, forward-thinking and relatable across voter demographics. All qualities the GOP will need to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Errol Louis is the host of \u201cInside City Hall,\u201d a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Errol Louis: Paper's expos\u00e9 details dangerous conditions, wage theft for nail salon workers He says feds should boost oversight to fix conditions in under-the-table economy Louis: Labor unions are faster, effective approach to problems of low-wage workers A blockbuster investigation in The New York Times has exposed the harrowing, illegal conditions prevalent in nail salons in and around New York City \u2013 including cases of illegal stealing of tips, failure to pay overtime or minimum wage and forced exposure to toxic fumes and chemicals. That, in turn, has triggered an emergency crackdown on the industry by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, complete with a plan to inspect every nail salon in New York and a promise to fine or close shops that don\u2019t immediately clean up their act. While Cuomo\u2019s intervention is a welcome step in the right direction, it underscores the reality that safeguarding the rights and working conditions of millions of low-wage workers is too big of a job for any one governor \u2013 or even a group of governors, even yours \u2013 to tackle without the backing of the federal government. The situation of workers in New York City\u2019s estimated 2,000 nail salons has been a scandal hiding in plain sight. As the Times investigation showed, many shop owners viciously exploit young women from Asia and Latin America, many of them undocumented immigrants, by requiring them to work 10- and 12-hour days for weeks as unpaid apprentices, after which they might earn as little as $30 a day plus tips. Some salon owners seize their employees\u2019 tips, deny workers a place for meal breaks, ride herd on workers for breaking minor rules \u2013 all enforced by the use of video surveillance, fines and even physical abuse. Those practices violate a slew of laws that mandate a minimum wage, extra pay for overtime and meal breaks. The Times expos\u00e9 focused on nail shops, but it could have been written about any number of low-wage workplaces across the country. Car wash employees in New York recently took to the streets, filed a lawsuit and eventually unionized to protest the stealing of tips and lack of minimum wage or overtime pay. Similar violations of wage laws have been documented at car washes in Chicago and in Los Angeles. Restaurants \u2013 another workplace dependent on low-wage workers and cash transactions \u2013 turn out to be so rife with wage violations that California authorities have launched crackdowns; ditto for Colorado and Idaho. Boston has gone so far as to deny permits to restaurants that steal employees\u2019 tips and pay. Construction sites may be havens of wage theft. Many hotels have the same problem. Although the exact extent of wage theft and underpayment nationwide isn\u2019t recorded in any one place, \u201csurvey evidence suggests that wage theft is widespread and costs workers billions of dollars a year,\u201d says a September report by the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, citing a study of conditions in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. \u201cThe total annual wage theft from front-line workers in low-wage industries in the three cities approached $3 billion,\u201d the institute said. \u201cIf these findings in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles are generalizable to the rest of the U.S. low-wage workforce of 30 million, wage theft is costing workers more than $50 billion a year.\u201d The Wage and Hour Division of the federal Department of Labor, which tracks wage violations, found last year that more than 270,000 workers nationwide were owed $240 million. The phenomenon extends well beyond big cities. The Economic Policy Institute surveyed federal and local agencies that regulate wage conditions and found that \u201cstate departments of labor in 44 states recovered $172 million; state attorneys general in 45 states recovered $14 million; and private attorneys recovered $467 million in wage and hour class action lawsuits.\u201d No single city or state can individually expect to make serious headway in ending a problem taking place in nearly half the country; what\u2019s needed is a federal commitment to enforcing workplace conditions. The Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division has 200 offices nationwide \u2013 a number that only sounds impressive until you consider the millions of workplaces where violations might take place. (Nationwide, for example, there are 17,000 nail salons.) This is a case where the simplest and best solution is an old one: labor unions. When workers collectively negotiate wages, hours and other conditions \u2013 and keep a permanent watch for violations \u2013 abuses get caught earlier and are resolved through a process that is faster and less costly than launching a regulatory crackdown or filing lawsuits. This happens to be an election season, so every candidate for the presidency should put up their best ideas \u2013 whether it\u2019s supporting unions, tougher regulation or some other method \u2013 to make sure our workplaces are run with fairness and according to law.

            "article_content": "U.S. will likely face pressure to become more involved in the migrant crisis State Department spokesman says he expects U.S. to take in more migrants It took a tragic photo of a drowned toddler on a Turkish beach to make the refugee torrent pouring into Europe a problem for America too. Until now, the agony of the four million refugees who have fled Syria\u2019s civil war has been background noise in Washington \u2013 even amid tales of some drowning on ill-fated voyages to safety across the Mediterranean have emerged. But the heartbreaking photo of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who died along with his young brother and mother in an attempt to reach Greece, was splashed across U.S. front pages this week and sent the refugee exodus up the political agenda. It also focused attention on the fact that the United States has so far only accepted 1,500 refugees from Syria. The process is complicated by a long security vetting procedure meant to ensure that only desperate refugees \u2013 and not extremists from groups like ISIS \u2013 reach American soil. The process is so onerous that it typically takes 18 months before a refugee designated for resettlement in the United States actually sets foot in the country. Like all apparently insoluble challenges, what is being called Europe\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster since World War II is certain to end up on President Barack Obama\u2019s desk, amid calls for Washington to do more to resettle desperate refugees. State Department spokesman John Kirby told CNN on Friday that the United States expected that figure of 1,500 accepted refugees to double before the end of the year. \u201cI expect to see the U.S. will take in even more going forward,\u201d Kirby said. READ: Drowned toddler Aylan Kurdi laid to rest in Syrian city he fled But aid agencies and others say that is not enough \u2013 especially since the Syrian exodus is being exacerbated by refugee flows from other conflicts and shattered states, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Somalia. Oxfam America is calling on the U.S to accept 70,000 Syrian refugees for resettlement and for the U.S. government and others to do more to resolve the underlying cause of the crisis: Syria\u2019s relentless civil war. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic we had to see the images of that young boy in order for people to see the urgency of this and start to move on an issue that is not going away,\u201d said Shannon Scribner, Oxfam America\u2019s Humanitarian Policy Manager. Another group, the International Rescue Committee, wants Washington to resettle 65,000 Syrian refugees before the end of next year, warning that the countries around Syria are being overwhelmed by the size of the humanitarian crisis. \u201cThe U.S. has historically been the world leader in recognizing the moral obligation to resettle refugees,\u201d said IRC president and CEO David Milliband in a statement this week. \u201cBut in the four years of the Syria crisis, there has been inertia rather than leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the German government calmly says that it expects 800,000 refugees and asylum seekers in 2015, it is vital for the U.S. to step up its response.\u201d Ultimately, however, the refugee crisis will only be solved with the resolution of the underlying cause \u2013 the dismembering of Syria by a vicious civil war between President Bashar al-Assad and rebel groups. \u201cIt is time for people to start talking about solutions to end the conflict. It will continue to grow in terms of human suffering until world leaders come together,\u201d said Scribner. But there is little hope for peace soon. Previous U.S. efforts to end the conflict failed partly because of the desire of states like Russia and Iran to retain Assad as a geopolitical ally in the divided Middle East. READ: European migrant crisis: A country-by-country glance Obama said in 2011 that the time had come for Assad to leave, but he remains president, at least of the rump of territory still controlled by his Allawite minority sect. Republican presidential hopefuls are blaming Obama for pulling back at the last minute in 2013 from a threat to attack Syrian government targets after its forces crossed his \u201cred line\u201d by using chemical weapons. They argue that he is overcompensating for the costly U.S. interventions in Iraq as part of a loose doctrine of avoiding more Middle East wars and say his neglect has allowed the Syria nightmare to get worse. GOP front-runner Donald Trump, who has been running a campaign anchored on expelling illegal immigrants, said on MSNBC the situation was \u201cso horrible\u201d that Washington should probably accept more refugees. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Obama \u201chas allowed these folks to be slaughtered.\u201d \u201cI frankly can\u2019t imagine as president of the United States how you could permit this to happen on this scale, and now we\u2019re seeing those results,\u201d he said this week at a campaign stop in New Hampshire. \u201cAnd it\u2019s much different when you read about it. And when you see it, it becomes even more powerful.\u201d It was that kind of attack that might have prompted Hillary Clinton to sense a potential general election vulnerability, given her role as Obama\u2019s former secretary of state. She pointed out Friday that she, along with other senior members of the Obama administration, had wanted to be more aggressive in identifying and training Syrian rebels when the conflict first broke out to fight Assad. \u201cI advocated for a more robust policy,\u201d Clinton said in an interview with MSNBC, and called on the \u201centire world\u201d to come together to solve the crisis. One of Clinton\u2019s Democratic rivals, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who has been struggling to make an impact in the race, tried to outflank the former secretary of state on the refugee crisis on Friday, backing the IRC call for the U.S. to accept 65,000 refugees. \u201cAmericans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values. We must do more to support Syrian refugees \u2013 and we must certainly welcome more than the proposed 5,000 to 8,000 refugees next year,\u201d he said.",

It\u2019s Friday, and here are the five things to know for your New Day. Mudslinging continues: It\u2019s safe to say candidates in the 2016 presidential election are taking no prisoners. Campaigning is in full swing, and  in some cases, that means making everyone else look bad. Donald Trump lived up to that yesterday when an audience member at his event said President Barack Obama is a Muslim and not an American.  Obama, who is a Christian, was  born in Hawaii. But did Trump correct the man? Naaah. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton tweeted that Trump\u2019s action \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 is \u201cjust plain wrong.\u201d Suspect\u2019s friend arrested:  Friends can be liabilities sometimes. Just  ask Joey Meek, friend of confessed Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof, who was arrested by the FBI yesterday. It was not immediately clear what charges Meek faces, but he has been under investigations for allegedly knowing about the June shooting and not telling authorities, an official said. In the days after the shooting, Meek recounted how Roof drunkenly vowed one night \u201cto do something crazy.\u201d Roof killed nine people during a prayer meeting at a historic African-American church on June 17 in South Carolina. Red cards: Big names are going down as investigations continue into allegations of bribery in FIFA.  The latest leader snared in the fallout is the international soccer governing body\u2019s  No. 2. FIFA said Secretary General Jerome Valcke was suspended, effective immediately, amid allegations he participated in a scheme to profit off the sale of World Cup tickets on the black market. FIFA has been embroiled in scandal since a U.S. grand jury  indicted 14 people, including nine top FIFA officials, on corruption charges in May. So many choices: Oh what to do, what to do? Visit the White House, Google, or Facebook offices?  The week started pretty terribly for Texas high school student Ahmed Mohamed. On Monday, he brought a clock to school, one he made on his own.  Police arrested him for what they initially \u2013 and falsely \u2013 said was a hoax bomb. But by mid-week, it was the complete opposite. His face and name were splashed across traditional and social media. Thousands of messages of encouragement poured in, with Facebook and President Obama inviting him to the White House, and Twitter offered him internships. But wait \u2026. there\u2019s more! Google executives said they were reserving him a spot at their science fair and MIT asked him to visit the campus.  But first, his family says, he plans to transfer to another high school.  How is that for a bad week turned awesome? About face?: First Croatia said it would take in migrants. Then it closed seven border crossings. A day after the nation invited migrants & refugees across its borders, chaos erupted as thousands overwhelmed Croatian authorities at the border town of Tovarnik. The U.N. says Croatia was prepared to handle 500 immigrants a day. Instead more than 7,000 people crossed in the first 36 hours after the Croatian president announced the country\u2019s doors were open. By yesterday, the president was calling for possible stricter border controls. Watch New Day weekdays at 6am-9am ET. For the latest on New Day click here",

So now they are finding a new way to Germany and other nations of Western Europe: Croatia.

Croatia has said migrants are welcome to transit through the country on their way to their next stop in Europe. One serious obstacle refugees have to look out for though \u2013 landmines.

Members of the Hispanic Caucus, the Black Caucus and others loudly complained in listening sessions with Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi that failing to help Puerto Rico deal with a serious debt crisis may lead them to oppose the deal.

Steve Israel of New York told CNN about the spending package, saying it is fueled mainly by complaints about the lack of action on Puerto Rico, but also by a move to do away with a 40-year-old ban on exporting crude oil. The rumblings about the Puerto Rico issue got loud enough that Ryan, seeking to protect the deal, released a statement Wednesday vowing to take action on the issue next year. \u201cWhile we could not agree to including precedent-setting changes to bankruptcy law in this omnibus spending bill, I understand that many members on both sides of the aisle remain committed to addressing the challenges facing the territory,\u201d Ryan said, pledging committees would draft a remedy in the first quarter of 2016. What in the World: Puerto Rico's debt debacle House Democrats huddled behind closed doors on Thursday morning to plot a path forward. Pelosi told her members that she\u2019ll support the funding package. The opposition that became apparent Wednesday afternoon marked an escalation from the initial response to the massive 2,009-page spending bill \u2013 plus a separate package of $650 billion in tax breaks \u2013 congressional leaders agreed to late Tuesday night. The legislation left members of both parties grumbling but generally feeling that it included provisions they support. The year-end crush on the large and complex bills comes days before the Christmas holidays. With the tight calendar, and arguments that there is something good for everyone in the bill, leaders still hope to cobble together bipartisan votes on both items before the week is out. But the task won\u2019t be easy. Republicans were upset a wide range of policy riders they wanted attached \u2013 such as a provision to require more rigorous vetting of refugees from Iraq and Syria \u2013 didn\u2019t make it into the bill. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of problems,\u201d GOP Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina told CNN, listing a host of riders involving water and environmental regulations that didn\u2019t make it in, plus the refugee bill he authored. Hudson said he understands Ryan faced tough challenges negotiating with the White House and Democrats, but said, \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to support a lot of bad policy. I\u2019m just not sure I can get there.\u201d After GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s controversial comments about banning Muslims from entering the U.S., Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger said the pressure increased on the GOP to get the language on Syrian refugees to the spending deal. But the former Air Force pilot told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the kind of thing that should kill fixing sequester on our military,\u201d stressing that his party needed to back the measure that did eliminate scheduled cuts to the Pentagon budget at a time it was ramping up the fight against ISIS. Ryan downplayed what didn\u2019t make it into the bill and instead argued the move to lift a 40-year-old ban on exporting crude oil is \u201chuge.\u201d \u201cThis is a big win for American jobs and for our energy industry. This is a big win for our manufacturers and for our foreign policy,\u201d Ryan said. That provision, in turn, left some Democrats upset. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a bitter pill for a great many of us,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, said about the oil provision. Schiff explained an internal struggle on how he will ultimately vote. He represents a pro-environment constituency in California, but as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, he was pleased leaders added two major bills to the large package: the intelligence authorization bill and a cybersecurity bill. Paul Ryan condemns Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims Meanwhile, Ryan touted a commitment he says he got from Reid that Democrats would not block spending bills from coming up for vote on the Senate floor. This is all part of Ryan\u2019s push to return to \u201cregular order\u201d and avoid rolling bills into a last-minute massive deal like this omnibus measure. Idaho GOP Rep. Mike Simpson, a member of the appropriations panel, told reporters, \u201cTo me, that\u2019s huge.\u201d But some of the frustration extended to the other side of the Capitol. Arizona Sen. John McCain was furious and threatened to vote against the bill because of a provision that he says was \u201csnuck\u201d into the bill to allow the U.S. to buy rockets from Russia for the American space program despite a prohibition that passed in a recent defense bill. He complained that buying the expensive hardware would bolster Russian President Vladimir Putin who has worked against the U.S. in Ukraine and Syria. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, denied they snuck in the provision but acknowledged having a deep disagreement with McCain over cutting off purchases from Russia and how best to supply the engines for U.S. space program. Congress got rid of earmarks \u2013 pet projects and money designated for specific districts, but lawmakers were quick to claim credit for provisions they got in the bill to help back home. A flurry of press releases listed examples of projects that amounted to jobs and money for both Democrats and Republicans. Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland announced she had secured almost $400 million in her quest to get the FBI to move its headquarters to Maryland. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, got $50 million in security funding for the upcoming Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, got $25 million for the End Modern Slavery Initiative he supports. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who is in a tight re-election race, told reporters there is money to battle opioid abuse in her state. \u201cMy state is facing a public health epidemic, so I\u2019m very pleased to see that in there,\u201d she said Leaders from both parties urged members to pocket the wins they got, vote for the bill, and move on to the next legislative fights in 2016. \u201cI have no reason to believe that we\u2019re going to have a shutdown. In divided government, you don\u2019t get everything you want,\u201d Ryan told reporters on Wednesday morning after a closed-door session with members to review the details. \u201cThis is a good compromise,\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said on the floor. The White House also backed the package on Wednesday. Pelosi released a statement noting \u201cconcerns\u201d have arisen from her members about the deal and she spent much of the day hearing out members of own party. She made no secret of her strong dislike for the tax measure, but on the spending bill she was reserved, telling reporters, \u201cWe are trying to be as positive as possible because we must keep government open. But we\u2019re going to make a knowledgeable vote about it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Clinton stepped deeper into the debate over terrorism with the speech, offering what her campaign aides called a \"360-degree strategy to keep America safe\" Terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Paris have dramatically altered the tenor of the 2016 campaign Hillary Clinton argued Tuesday that the U.S. can stop homegrown terrorism, outlining a plan to combat domestic radicalization two weeks after two ISIS-inspired terrorists killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. In a speech that was part policy, part politics, Clinton contrasted herself directly with Republicans running for president, stating that Muslim-Americans are the \u201cfirst, last and best defense against homegrown radicalization and terrorism.\u201d \u201cI am confident once again we will choose resolve over fear,\u201d Clinton said in remarks at the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis. \u201cAnd we will defeat these new enemies just as we have defeated those who have threatened us in the past, because it is not enough to contain ISIS \u2013 we must defeat ISIS.\u201d Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Opinion: Does Clinton\u2019s strategy for beating ISIS add up? Clinton stepped deeper into the debate over terrorism with the speech, offering what her campaign aides called a \u201c360-degree strategy to keep America safe,\u201d including how she will work to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they happen and how she will work with Muslim-American communities to fight radicalization. As a way to stop terrorists from entering the United States, Clinton also proposed more strict screening of anyone entering the country who had visited a country known to be a hotbed for terrorism. One key to Clinton\u2019s plan is ending ISIS radicalization online, including by shutting down ISIS-inspired Facebook and Twitter profiles and removing terrorist content. \u201cOur security professionals need to more effectively track and analyze ISIS\u2019 social media posts and map jihadist networks,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe have to stop jihadists from radicalizing new recruits in person and through social media, chat rooms and what is called the dark web. To do that we need stronger relationships between Washington, Silicon Valley and all of our great tech companies.\u201d Clinton also took subtle swipes at Republicans\u2019 rhetoric on ISIS, telling the audience that \u201cshallow slogans don\u2019t add up to a strategy.\u201d \u201cPromising to carpet bomb until the desert glows doesn\u2019t make you sound strong, it makes you sound like you\u2019re in over your head,\u201d Clinton said, referencing a comment Sen. Ted Cruz made earlier this month. \u201cBluster and bigotry are not credentials for becoming commander-and-chief and it is hard to take serious senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations.\u201d Terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Paris have dramatically altered the tenor of the 2016 campaign, drawing attention to fighting terrorism and protecting the United States. After terrorists killed 130 in Paris last month, Clinton delivered a lengthy speech on fighting ISIS, calling for the United States to \u201cintensify and broaden\u201d efforts against the terrorist group. Clinton makes general election pitch with focus on terrorism The crowd, which included a number of high-profile Muslim leaders from the Minneapolis area who met with Clinton before the speech, responded with multiple standing ovations when Clinton spoke to the need to work with Muslim-American communities to combat domestic radicalization after the attacks in San Bernardino. \u201cWe cannot give in to fear, we can\u2019t let it stop us from doing what is right and necessary to make us safe and doing it in a way that is consistent with our values. We cannot let fear push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe,\u201d Clinton said. Speaking directly to Muslim-Americans, Clinton said, \u201cThis is your country, too, and I am proud to be your fellow American.\u201d The ISIS terror threat That comment in particular was well received by local imams in the audience. \u201cI felt at home,\u201d said Abdisalam Adam, imam at Dar Al-Hijrah Mosque in Minneapolis. To hear \u201cMuslim-Americans are bothers and sisters coming from a presidential candidate really instilled hope in this country. \u2026 It was very uplifting.\u201d Clinton was introduced on Tuesday by former Vice President Walter Mondale, who was defeated by Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election. Minnesota Sens. Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar, Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges also attended the event. \u201cI have known Hillary for a long time,\u201d Mondale said. \u201cThere is no one I trust more to sit in the Oval Office.\u201d Republicans, however, have hammered Clinton for her time in the Cabinet of President Barack Obama, whose administration they have attacked as weak and ineffective in facing international challenges, particularly the rise of ISIS. Poll: Clinton beating Trump, Cruz but not Rubio They have in particular pilloried her for her record in Libya, where she was an architect of the international intervention that eventually led to leader Moammar Ghadafi\u2019s removal, with many blaming the chaos that has followed for allowing terrorist groups to flourish. Most emphatically, they\u2019ve attacked her for not doing more to protect U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans killed in a terror attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi in 2012. Clinton\u2019s decision to deliver her speech in Minnesota is not without significance. Clinton held up Minnesota\u2019s efforts to combat domestic radicalization in the state\u2019s Somali-American population, noting the multi-million dollar efforts Minneapolis, St. Paul and other cities have spent to identify radicalization in young people and combat ISIS propaganda. Hillary Clinton calls for increased airstrikes on ISIS Religious leaders from Minneapolis\u2019 Muslim community sat in the front row for Clinton\u2019s speech, watching the former secretary of state argue that in order to effectively combat terrorism, Americans need to work with Muslims, not demonize them. \u201cWe must all stand up against offensive, inflammatory, hateful anti-Muslim rhetoric,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cAs hard as this is, it is time to move from fear to resolve. It is time to step up and say we are Americans, we are the greatest nation on earth, not in spite of the challenges we face but because of this.\u201d Clinton: GOP\u2019s \u2018hateful rhetoric\u2019 on Syrian refugees \u2018a new low\u2019 Since Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump proposed a short-term ban on Muslims entering the United States, Clinton and other Democrats have been quick to deride the proposal. \u201cWhen he says he wants to stop all Muslims from entering the United States, that runs counter to what I and others who have actually been in the Situation Room, making hard choices, know we have to do,\u201d she said in Waterloo, Iowa, earlier this month, adding that Trump \u201cis supplying [ISIS] with new propaganda\u201d and \u201cplaying right into their hands.\u201d Clinton hopes to parlay her years as secretary of state and New York senator after the September 11, 2001, attacks into traction for her presidential campaign, with the topic of terrorism providing the candidate with a ripe opportunity to showcase her commander-in-chief credentials. It is also yet another example of Clinton looking ahead to the general election, where terrorism is an issue more important to independents and Republicans than Democrats.",

            "article_content": "Watch CNN\u2019s coverage of the fifth Republican presidential debate live from Las Vegas on Tuesday, December 15. Coverage begins at 6 p.m. ET. What happens in Vegas tonight will not stay in Vegas -- it will have significant implications for the destiny of the GOP nomination This will be the first Republican debate since the attack by a radicalized Muslim couple in San Bernardino killed 14 people It\u2019s debate night in Sin City. Republican presidential candidates are in Las Vegas for their last debate of the year, just seven weeks before the 2016 nominating race gets underway at the Iowa caucuses. And what unfolds on stage at the Venetian casino will have significant implications for the destiny of the GOP nomination. Always controversial front-runner Donald Trump is looking to tighten his grip on the lead spot. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, suddenly ahead of Trump in the Hawkeye state, wants to justify the hopes of those who see him as the most authentic conservative in the race. And the GOP establishment is increasingly desperate for someone \u2013 perhaps Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2013 to prove he or she can take on Trump and Cruz. As for the rest of the pack, they are searching for a lucky break. Here are seven things to watch at tonight\u2019s showdown. Cruz suddenly finds himself in the top tier of the Republican presidential race \u2013 and in the crosshairs of his rivals. The Texas senator surged to a 10-point lead in the closely watched Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll of the Iowa caucuses released over the weekend, meaning Cruz can expect plenty of incoming fire on Tuesday night. Cruz has had an easy ride from Trump so far, but the front-runner has started to pointedly question the freshman senator\u2019s readiness for the Oval Office. Ted Cruz grabs 10-point lead over Donald Trump in Iowa \u201cI would say I have far better judgment than Ted, and I think I have really great temperament. It\u2019s a strong temperament,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. If Trump does unload, Cruz must parry the attack without alienating Trump\u2019s army of supporters. The Texas senator has being extremely solicitous to the front-runner, hoping to eat into his constituency of anti-Washington voters furious at politics as usual should Trump fade. Cruz\u2019s strength in attracting evangelical voters and tea party supporters is hardly a surprise, but the Texan is under pressure to show that he can widen his appeal in the party and he needs to show that he is a true rival to the dominant personality of Trump. So Cruz also needs to keep an eye out for the other Cuban-American 40-something on stage, Marco Rubio. The Florida senator hopes to peel off some of Cruz\u2019s evangelical and social conservative base and build a bridge to establishment supporters who, as former front-runner Jeb Bush continues to fade, are casting around for anyone who is not Trump or Cruz to support. Rubio has already questioned Cruz on foreign policy, suggesting he is guilty of an \u201cisolationist\u201d approach and criticizing him for voting to restrict the bulk metadata programs used by intelligence agencies \u2013 a move that leaves Cruz more exposed following the San Bernardino terror attack. A showdown between Cruz and Rubio could be a highlight of the primary season, since they are both supremely talented debaters. He might be under pressure in Iowa, but Trump is, if anything, cementing his lead elsewhere. In one poll released Monday, by Monmouth University, he was a staggering 27 percentage points ahead of his nearest national challenger, Cruz. So that gives the Donald a dilemma when he takes his familiar front-runner\u2019s spot at center stage. There\u2019s one school of thought that says that Trump should play it safe and lock in his front-runner status. After all, it\u2019s only seven weeks until voters start to weigh in. Such an approach may have the virtue of papering over one of Trump\u2019s biggest vulnerabilities, the idea that he\u2019s too bombastic to be commander-in-chief. Donald Trump: His own words At other times during the debate season, he\u2019s been happy to fade into the background. And in interviews over the weekend \u2013 following his demand last week for a ban on Muslims entering the United States \u2013 Trump seemed a little more mellow than usual. But Trump also knows that millions of viewers are tuning in to see him put on a show. It\u2019s a dynamic that has been the foundation of his unorthodox presidential campaign for months as he\u2019s identified a rich seam in the Republican Party electorate that feels let down by its leaders and disgusted by what it sees as an epidemic of political correctness. It\u2019s time for Rubio to turn potential into poll numbers. Many establishment Republicans are now looking to the Florida senator as they become increasingly desperate for a candidate to consolidate opposition to Cruz and Trump, whom many elites doubt can win a general election. \u201cWhoever the establishment person is needs to emerge,\u201d said Matthew Dowd, a former George W. Bush strategist, on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d \u201cRight now this race looks like it is Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and one other person \u2013 who is an establishment person.\u201d Rubio faces high expectations, mostly of his own making, after turning in a string of quality debate performances. And circumstances may favor him, as he presents himself as the candidate best prepared to serve as commander-in-chief at a time of global uproar and terror threats. READ: How Donald Trump took the Republican Party by storm But so far, Rubio does not lead in any of the crucial first four nominating states \u2013 leaving him under pressure to chart a path to the nomination. If Rubio fails to break out at the debate, is there anyone else that could unite the establishment? Bush\u2019s campaign, once seen as a multi-million-dollar juggernaut, is now dormant; the former Florida governor needs theatrics worthy of Las Vegas to turn it around. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, meanwhile, is showing signs of life in New Hampshire following a key local endorsement and climbing poll numbers that have allowed him to re-enter the top-tier GOP debate. He has seized on the aftermath of the terror attacks to present himself as a ruthless potential foe of ISIS. Expect more hawkish national security rhetoric and denunciations of President Barack Obama\u2019s anti-terror record during the debate. Previous predictions that Ohio Gov. John Kasich could emerge as the establishment champion have fizzled, but he may take on the role of attack dog against Trump after branding the front-runner \u201cdead wrong\u201d for his comments on Muslims. This will be the first Republican debate since the attack by a radicalized Muslim couple in San Bernardino killed 14 people and brought a revitalized fear of terrorism much closer to home following an ISIS rampage in Paris. Look for candidates to outdo one another with searing critiques of Obama, who is seen among the conservative base as a feckless and weak leader who fails to understand the Republican orthodoxy that the United States is at war with radical Islam. \u201cBarack Obama is a bad president because he is an unmitigated socialist who won\u2019t stand up and defend the United States of America,\u201d Cruz said last month, giving the flavor of the kind of rhetoric likely on display Tuesday night. READ: Terrorism now tops list of voter concerns But the debate also offers a chance for Trump\u2019s rivals to weigh in on his call last week for Muslims to be temporarily banned from entering the United States. The proposal was seen by more mainstream Republicans as an example of the kind of overreach that is not just damaging to the party, and will complicate its hopes in November 2016, but which also threatens to tarnish America\u2019s reputation overseas. Any candidate wishing to take Trump on over the issue will be walking a tightrope, however. New polling by ABC News and The Washington Post released Monday found that 59% of Republicans nationwide supported his plan. The poll also showed that it was opposed by independents and Democrats, encapsulating the Republican Party\u2019s wider vulnerability on Trump\u2019s rhetoric. No candidate has been hurt more by the campaign\u2019s turn to national security than Ben Carson. The soft-spoken former neurosurgeon briefly threatened to outpace Trump for the outsider vote before dropping more than 10 percentage points in national polls after struggling on foreign policy questions in the wake of ISIS attacks. Carson is likely to try to seek a recovery by talking about his recent trip to Jordan to assess the plight of Syrian refugees \u2013 and to affirm his belief that allowing them into the U.S. poses a risk that terrorists could infiltrate American soil. Carson may also mention his plans to further his national security knowledge with a trip to Africa over the Christmas and New Year holiday. But unless he demonstrates at the debate that frantic cramming on national security is getting results, his White House hopes may be beyond rescue. Conventional wisdom has it that campaigning over Christmas and the New Year rarely moves the needle in presidential races. Voters have more pleasurable diversions than politics over the holiday and the race may freeze in place until everyone gears up to go back to work in January, when Iowa and New Hampshire will be a matter of a few weeks away. That means time is running out for candidates lagging behind to somehow muscle their way into contention, with the debate taking on the aura of a last chance for the likes of Bush, Kasich and businesswoman Carly Fiorina. And that means that this debate, more than any other clash of the candidates before it, has the potential to have a lasting impact. In fact, it may mark the end of the beginning of the Republican race for president and set the table for the frenzied run-up to the Iowa caucuses in early February. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul made a big deal about getting into the debate and secured a spot only on Sunday after showing viability in Iowa in a Fox News poll. So far in this campaign, Paul has hardly enhanced his political standing. He\u2019s not managed to harness his father Ron Paul\u2019s libertarian base and has yet to live up to hopes in the GOP that the curly-haired former eye surgeon\u2019s sometimes quirky approach could expand the party\u2019s appeal among younger voters. The isolationist tint of his foreign policy \u2013 which once looked a good fit for a war-weary America \u2013 now seems more like a liability given the rise of ISIS. See the stage being set at the CNN GOP Debate So, for Paul, the debate may be as much about salvaging his political brand ahead of a Senate re-election race next year as engineering an unlikely leap to the top of the presidential pack. Before the big show, CNN will also host a debate for bottom-of-the-polling-barrel candidates whom most of the political world has forgotten. Former New York Gov. George Pataki, ex-Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham will grab what might be one of their final slices of the spotlight in the 2016 race. They all need a miracle to move out of the basement. But at least one of them, Graham, is having the time of his life running for president. He is the reigning king of the undercard debate and can probably be relied upon for a sprightly performance.",

RELATED: Why Ted Cruz won\u2019t slam Donald Trump Kentucky Sen.

Obama will address the nation on terrorism at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday The president is facing heated criticism for his handling of the issue President Barack Obama will try to reassure a nervous nation on Sunday that he has a plan to defeat the fast-evolving threat of terrorism, as fears multiply of ISIS attacks on the homeland and public trust in his handling of the threat has dipped to record lows. Obama\u2019s rare 8 p.m. ET Oval Office address reflects growing anxiety that the global showdown with the extremist group has now spread to U.S. soil following a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, that authorities are treating as terrorism. His appearance comes at a time of public disquiet over terrorism and a political debate over the threat, now consuming the 2016 campaign, raging at levels not seen since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Obama has also struggled to convince critics he has a viable strategy for destroying ISIS in the Middle East and has been accused of downplaying the threat from the group for political reasons. Obama will use Sunday night\u2019s address to pledge to use of every available tool to keep American people safe and destroy ISIS, senior administration official says. The gravity of the occasion is underscored by Obama\u2019s decision to use the symbolic power of the Oval Office for only the third time in his presidency, following addresses on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and the end of the Iraq war in 2010. He is under intense pressure to strike a rhetorical note equal to the moment, following a string of comments about ISIS that left him vulnerable to claims by opponents that he had not take the group\u2019s rise seriously. Once, the president\u2019s handling of terrorism was a political asset and helped him win re-election, following the killing of Osama bin Laden. But now it looks more like a liability with ISIS plotting or inspiring attacks from California to Paris and on a Russian airliner over Egypt and capturing territory from North Africa to Afghanistan. In a new CNN/ORC poll released on Sunday, 60% of Americans disapproved of Obama\u2019s handling of terrorism \u2013 up nine points since May. Two thirds of those polled, meanwhile, said they disapproved of the president\u2019s handling of ISIS. The poll was conducted before the attacks in San Bernardino and also showed a shift in public opinion on how to tackle the group \u2013 with a majority \u2013 53% \u2013 for the first time saying the U.S. should send ground troops to fight ISIS. And 68% said the American response to the group\u2019s rise had not been sufficiently aggressive. Those figures reflect Obama\u2019s struggle so far to convince critics he has a viable strategy for destroying ISIS in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria and after he has been accused of downplaying the threat from the group for political reasons. The figures tracked with a a Washington Post/ABC News poll last month, after an ISIS rampage in Paris but also before the California attack, that found that a record low of 40% of Americans approved of Obama\u2019s handling of terrorism and only 35% The White House said that Obama would discuss the investigation into the San Bernardino attack last week, which killed 14 people, and then address the broader threat from terrorism, how it has evolved and how ISIS will be defeated. \u201cHe will reiterate his firm conviction that ISIL will be destroyed and that the United States will draw upon our values \u2013 our unwavering commitment to justice, equality and freedom \u2013 to prevail over terrorist groups that use violence to advance a destructive ideology,\u201d said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Obama: U.S. safe against ISIS attack Barack Obama's presidency Earnest\u2019s statement was a clear hint that Obama will also touch on the place of Muslims in U.S. society, following emotive rhetoric on Islam by some GOP presidential candidates, and a fierce debate sparked by calls to halt the flow of Syrian refugees into the country as terror fears spike. Sunday\u2019s address also seems to be an implicit acknowledgment that Obama has failed to convince Americans that he is prepared to take on the ISIS threat, amid widespread criticism of his strategy and rhetoric on the issue that keeps being overtaken by events. Inside the White House there is an acknowledgment that the attacks in Paris and California have made the threat of terrorism feel much closer to home for many Americans and that there are very real fears about ISIS that the president wants to address. Obama is also expected to detail extra steps to safeguard the homeland that have been taken since the attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. His speech comes after Obama has variously referred to ISIS as a \u201cJV\u201d team, said it was \u201ccontained\u201d and described its fighters as \u201ckillers with good social media\u201d despite its widening footprint in the Middle East and apparent turn to attacking soft Western targets in recent weeks. Republicans have redoubled attacks following the California killings to fire up a hawkish party base ahead of early nominating contests and to suggest that Obama\u2019s policy isn\u2019t working and that the president does not understand the threat. Trump praises police response to shooting that Carson calls \u2018hate crime\u2019 \u201cThe president stands up and says the Islamic state is not Islamic. That\u2019s just nutty,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in Iowa on Friday. \u201cWhy on earth did the Obama administration not know this ahead of time and stop them before they carried out this terror attack?\u201d Cruz said of the California shooting. Speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, Sen. Marco Rubio pressed for ground troops in the Middle East. \u201cMoving forward, this is not going to be the last attempt to attack the homeland,\u201d Rubio said. San Bernardino shooting GOP front-runner Donald Trump, who has pledged to be \u201cso tough\u201d on ISIS, also appears to be benefiting politically from his aggressive stance on terrorism. \u201cPeople are dead. A lot of people are dead right now,\u201d Trump said on CBS \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday.. \u201cSo everybody wants to be politically correct, and that\u2019s part of the problem that we have with our country.\u201d The real estate mogul also said he would \u201clive tweet\u201d the President\u2019s address. I will be live-tweeting President Obama's prime-time speech tonight starting at 7:50 P.M. (Eastern).Will he finally state the real problems? Other candidates have warned the United States is in a war of civilizations with radical Islam and that a new \u201cworld war\u201d has reached U.S. soil. Opinion: How is this not World War III? Such political fury complicates Obama\u2019s effort to ease public fears of terrorism and to build support to confront two critical problems \u2013 the expanding battle against ISIS and its evolving tactics and his own political vulnerabilities on the issue. His speech comes at an alarming moment. Terrorism experts are warning that the San Bernardino attack could be the harbinger of a much more acute threat to U.S. soil. \u201cUnfortunately I think it is more of what we can expect in the future \u2013 whether it is copy cats or whether you have, again, either ISIS-aligned or inspired or ISIS-directed individuals,\u201d said Dean Alexander, director of the Homeland Security Research Program at Western Illinois University. \u201cIt might instigate ISIS to take a more proactive approach to send individuals here to the U.S. or to try to recruit.\u201d The California attack is so concerning because Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Mali, the couple behind it, seem to have been inspired by ISIS, but not linked directly to the group. Such a \u201cself radicalization\u201d scenario by Muslims on U.S. soil has long been feared by anti-terrorism experts who say such attacks are nearly impossible for the administration to detect and stop. Opinion: How to stop ISIS from recruiting Americans Still, the White House insists that an intensifying air war against ISIS in Syria and Iraq is succeeding in curtailing the group, and Obama is adamant that sending U.S. ground troops back into a Middle East conflict is not the way to defeat it. But critics say he has consistently underplayed the threat from ISIS because its rise conflicts with his assurances that he has severely degraded the threat from global terror \u2013 a key legacy issue as he nears the end of his second term. Political violence is driving terrorism \u201cAt every turn, the American people can see with their own eyes how tragically wrong the President has been,\u201d said John Hannah, a former deputy national security advisor for Vice President Dick Cheney. \u201cInstead of being the JV team, they turn out to be the most powerful terrorist group in history,\u201d said Hannah, who also worked in the Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cInstead of being contained, they\u2019re conducting or inspiring spectacular terrorist operations on multiple continents \u2013 including now in the United States. ISIS affiliates are spreading across the Middle East and south Asia.\u201d Under increasing pressure to toughen his rhetoric, Obama is also likely to use his address to counter claims the United States is somehow at war with Islam itself. \u201cThey can\u2019t beat us on the battlefield, so they try to terrorize us into being afraid, and changing our patterns of behavior, and panicking, and abandoning our allies and partners, and retreating from the world,\u201d Obama said at a press conference in Malaysia last month. Worst mass shootings in U.S. But his critics \u2013 like Rubio for instance \u2013 warn that the president, and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, are being too politically correct and even refuse to voice the true nature of the threat. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be clear \u2013 we are at war with ISIS. We are at war with radical, apocalyptic jihadists. And that is why ultimately we must defeat them,\u201d Rubio said on Fox News on Friday, as he accused Obama of using the California attack as a new spur for his push for gun control rather than as a terrorist outrage. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie rejected the idea that Muslims would be offended by the use of specific terminology to describe the threat. \u201cNow when you say radical Islamic jihadist, they understand, the rest of the Muslim community understands,\u201d Christie said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d But Clinton said on ABC News \u201cThis Week\u201d that throwing around such terms actually helped the extremists. \u201cIt helps to create this clash of civilizations that is actually a recruiting tool for ISIS and other radical jihadists who use this as a way of saying, \u2018We are in a war against the West \u2013 you must join us,\u2019\u201d she said. Obama has taken a similar line. \u201cWe must never accept the premise that they put forward because it is a lie,\u201d Obama said in February. \u201cNor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek. They are not religious leaders. They are terrorists.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Senate Republicans are moving forward a budget bill to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood Lawmakers also debated gun control measures one day following the mass shooting in Southern California The Senate Thursday approved on a largely party line vote a budget bill that would repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood, two top priorities of Republicans who control the chamber. Not to be outdone, Democrats seized the debate to try to force votes on gun control legislation that could put some Republicans in a politically tough position as the country is reeling from a recent spate of mass shootings. Worst mass shootings in U.S. By voting to nullify Obamacare \u2013 the signature domestic accomplishment of the Obama administration \u2013 GOP congressional leaders fulfilled a longtime pledge to voters and rank-and-file members to get a repeal to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk, even though he will veto it. Republican leaders also want to send an unmistakable message to voters: If you elect a GOP president next year and keep the them in charge of Congress, Obamacare will go. \u201cIt demonstrates that if you have a president prepared to support health care reform, it could pass next time,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act who insisted this was not a show vote just because the President will veto the bill. \u201cIf this vote occurred after the next presidential election, instead of vetoing it the President would sign it. This would force a bipartisan reevaluation of health care in America and put us in a position to make major changes.\u201d The bill would also cut off federal funding to Planned Parenthood, the women\u2019s health group that provides abortions and has long under GOP scrutiny. Republicans\u2019 passions to cutoff taxpayer dollars to the organization increased in recent months when videos were released that purported to show Planned Parenthood executives selling the tissue of aborted fetuses to researchers. Paul Ryan\u2019s vision for a \u2018confident America\u2019 While the House and Senate have voted scores of times to repeal portions of Obamacare, this was the first time they are using a special tool known as \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d that allow the measure to clear the Senate with just 51 votes instead of the 60 votes typically required for major legislation. That higher threshold has allowed Democrats to block all past repeal efforts. By steering these two hot-button issues into the reconciliation bill, Republican leaders also steered them away from a separate must-pass government funding bill Congress is dealing with now known as the omnibus. Had those controversial issues been included in that bill, it would have made even harder to pass before the December 11 deadline when the government could shut down. Democrats on edge over Obamacare As with Obamacare, Senate Democrats have blocked recent efforts to defund the organization so the reconciliation bill became the GOP\u2019s best option to move the measure. \u201cMiddle class Americans continue to call on Washington to build a bridge away from Obamacare. They want better care. They want real health reform,\u201d argued Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cFor too long, Democrats did everything to prevent Congress from passing the type of legislation necessary to help these Americans who are hurting. Today that ends.\u201d Opinion: GOP, stop attacking, and start improving, Obamacare During floor debate, Republicans recounted with frustration the 7 a.m. vote on Christmas Eve morning in 2009 when the 60 Democrats who held a filibuster-proof margin of control \u201ccrammed\u201d the bill through Senate, in Sessions\u2019 words, without a single Republican vote. \u201cThe American people knew this wouldn\u2019t work, they opposed it from the beginning. They opposed the philosophy of it and they knew we were going to have a mess on our hands,\u201d Sessions said. Others, like Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, argued there was no way for the law to be sustained in the long run without GOP backing. \u201cIt was a terrible mistake,\u201d Cornyn said about the way Democrats and the President pushed the bill through. 5 ways Obamacare has helped Americans Democrats countered that Republicans were wasting time with more political show votes. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing on this reconciliation is just going nowhere,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday. \u201cThey want to do this to satisfy a few radical right-wing people who they have joined forces with.  Another charade may make some Republican senators feel better, but it won\u2019t make law.\u201d In recent months, many Senate Democrats have grown increasingly agitated at their inability to respond to the growing number of mass shootings across the country and pass tougher gun control legislation and measures to help mentally unstable people before they carry out a tragedy. Their last major effort came after 20 children and 6 adults were killed by a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, three years ago. Even then, a bipartisan measure from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania to expand background checks failed. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders seek gun control reform after shootings Democrats took advantage of the special rules of debate to push for votes on gun-related measures Republicans probably would not have allowed. The 2016 candidates stances on gun control \u201cThe entire country will know where every member of the Senate stands on tightening background checks, on keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists, and on strengthening and improving mental health in this country,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. \u201cThe scourge of gun violence that has swept through this country in recent years has snuffed out thousands upon thousands of lives.  It\u2019s an epidemic that must be dealt with head on and that means keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.\u201d Democrats brought up the Manchin-Toomey measure, a proposal from Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California that would prevent people on the terror watch list from buying guns, and a third amendment to strengthen mental health and substance abuse treatment all failed. Each was blocked from getting 60 votes to advance. Republicans offered alternatives to each and they were blocked as well. Three Republicans besides Toomey voted for the expanded background check legislation: Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan Collins of Maine. Democrat Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota also voted against the amendment. The other amendments fell on party lines. San Bernardino: At least 14 people killed in mass shooting Some moderate Republicans also tried to thread the needle on the budget during the Planned Parenthood debate. Collins, Kirk, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska offered an amendment that would have stripped the defunding language, but it was defeated. Kirk and Collins were the only Republicans to vote against the final bill. One bit of drama on the final vote was whether GOP presidential candidates Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida would support the bill. They had complained the Obamacare repeal was not deep enough but Senate GOP leaders made changes to satisfy them and were confident they would back the bill, especially because pro-life groups adamantly support defunding Planned Parenthood and the candidates are courting those pro-life voters. In the end, they both voted for the bill. The debate included a wide variety of issues including a proposal from Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a GOP presidential candidate, to curb Syrian refugees from coming into the U.S. but his measure failed to get 60 votes. The bill, which was approved on a 52-47 vote, now goes back to the House, which is expected to adopt it and send it to the President for his veto. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated that Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was up for re-election this cycle. She is next up for re-election in 2020.",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush accused Donald Trump of making controversial statements \"to get attention.\" \"It says that we have some candidates who are trying to get attention the wrong way,\" Bush said Bush also pledged to support the Republican nominee no matter what Jeb Bush ripped into Donald Trump on Wednesday, knocking the Republican front-runner for making controversial statements as a way \u201cto get attention.\u201d In an interview with the Iowa Public Television segment \u201cIowa Press,\u201d which is set to air in full this weekend, the former Florida governor also tweaked Ben Carson for making an analogy that compared Syrian refugees to rabid dogs. Asked what he thinks about the rhetoric from some of his rivals in the presidential race, Bush argued that it shows a lack of seriousness. \u201cIt says that we have some candidates who are trying to get attention the wrong way. We\u2019re running for the presidency of the United States. It\u2019s a serious job that requires serious candidates that offer serious plans,\u201d Bush said. Related: Christie on Trump\u2019s 9/11 claims: \u2018It\u2019s just wrong\u2019 He added that he found Trump\u2019s call to track some Muslims in the country in the wake of the Paris attacks to be inappropriate (Trump later modified his comments). \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that refugees are dogs. That\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Bush continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be tracking people unless there is well-founded evidence that people are preparing to attack us.\u201d Bush, who trails far behind Trump in the polls, said he doubts the real estate titan will make any apologies for his controversial statements. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to apologize for anything, he\u2019s not a serious person. It\u2019s hard to imaging him being President of the United States. If he gets upset, is he going to start disparaging our allies?\u201d Bush said. \u201cThis lack of seriousness is a serious problem for our country. If a guy, capable as he is as a politician, became president, has no clue what he\u2019s doing, that\u2019s a dangerous thing.\u201d His comments echo sentiments Bush made earlier in the week, when he said in an interview that a Trump presidency would be \u201cscary.\u201d Bush conceded Wednesday that he\u2019d pledged to support the Republican nominee, no matter who it is, \u201cbut I have total confidence that primary voters are not going to support Donald Trump as the nominee.\u201d Bush was also asked if he agreed with comments that his brother, former President George W. Bush, made after the 9/11 attacks, when he stressed that Islam is a peaceful religion. \u201cYeah for a great majority of practitioners, it is a peaceful religion. It\u2019s been co-opted by radical terrorists that have turned it into a political ideology,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not insulting peace-loving practitioners of the Muslim faith, the Islamic faith, by calling ISIS a group of Islamic terrorists.\u201d The interview capped a three-day swing in Iowa, where Bush is struggling to gain traction as candidates like Trump, Carson and first-term Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, have taken off. The latest poll in Iowa showed Trump leading the pack at 25%, with Bush in fifth place at 4%, a little more than two months ahead of the Iowa Republican caucuses. But Bush maintained his organization is strong in the first four early voting states, and he continued to place his faith in history, arguing that voters tend to make their final decision at the last minute. \u201cIn December of the last two election cycles, the people that were winning in December weren\u2019t the ones who ended up winning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the nature of the beast \u2014 no reason to rewrite history. People make up their minds late.\u201d Asked if he was angry enough and able to tap into the frustrations expressed by the Republican electorate, Bush rejected the idea that he has to abandon his pledge to run a \u201cjoyful\u201d campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be angry. I have to understand why people are angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we\u2019re the greatest country on the face of the earth. I\u2019m not going to change who I am just because I have to, I\u2019m not going to be a faux candidate. I\u2019m not going to fake people out. I believe if we fix a few big complex things. This is the most extraordinary time to be alive.\u201d",

During an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d host George Stephanopoulos, Christie was questioned about his hardline opposition to accepting Syrian refugees. \u201cListen, George, we have seen women and children play roles in terrorist attacks before,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThe fact is, we can all play to the UN crowd and say we want to get applause from those folks around the world \u2013 I\u2019m worried about the homeland here, and the American people are worried about their safety and security.\u201d Christie expressed his skepticism of the current vetting process for refugees, stressing, \u201cWe have to make sure that folks are vetted. That is not an unreasonable request.\u201d The New Jersey governor has written to President Barack Obama calling on him to halt the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the U.S. and informed the President that state agencies would not assist in settling any.

            "article_content": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy insists that the U.S. Government won't shut down over Planned Parenthood \"I do not see a shutdown happening,\" McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol on Monday House conservatives have spent much of the past three months attempting to force a vote to strip taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. But key Republicans aren\u2019t ready to force a government shutdown over it. After the shooting at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic that left three dead last Friday, it appears Republican leaders are reluctant to risk a fight with the White House and Democrats over the issue on the must-pass spending bill. \u201cI do not see a shutdown happening,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol on Monday as lawmakers returned to Washington from their Thanksgiving recess. RELATED: Paul Ryan doubtful about defunding Planned Parenthood Congress needs to clear the giant government funding bill by Dec. 11 to avoid a shutdown.  As the deadline nears, House and Senate negotiators hope to reach a compromise soon, although McCarthy suggested lawmakers could use one extra week until Dec. 18. (A stopgap measure would be needed to keep the government open in the interim.) The desire by Republicans not to shut down the government over the emotionally-charged abortion issue was seconded by Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, a staunch abortion opponent who acknowledged Monday that a successful effort to defund Planned Parenthood won\u2019t happen on this bill or is likely anytime soon. \u201cThis has been an ongoing issue for years now,\u201d the freshman Republican senator said. \u201cIt has to be addressed and it might take years to get that done.\u201d The effort to strip Medicaid reimbursements to the organization became a must-do for conservatives this fall after videos released by an anti-abortion group earlier this year featured officials from Planned Parenthood discussing the sale of fetal tissue. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he would stand with Planned Parenthood and prevent GOP efforts to defund it. He also warned Republican leaders against using caustic language that he suggested could lead to violence against abortion clinics. \u201cWe as leaders must be mindful of our words and actions,\u201d Reid said on the Senate floor. Monday \u201cWhipping people into a frenzy of hate and anger while providing easy access to firearms has proven disastrous to our country.\u201d RELATED: Planned Parenthood shooting suspect appears in court The Obama administration is warning Republicans not to include controversial policy provisions in the government funding bill. \u201cI say with some confidence the newly elected Speaker of the House doesn\u2019t want to preside over a government shutdown six weeks into his tenure,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during a briefing in Paris. Lankford said the shooting was unlikely to impact the debate this week on defunding Planned Parenthood. \u201cObviously the Planned Parenthood folks want to rise up and say we wouldn\u2019t have a shooting if it wasn\u2019t for the mean folks who are talking about defunding Planned Parenthood. I don\u2019t think that plays well, quite frankly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like saying we have complaints about education reform in America so there are school shootings. The two are not connected.\u201d Senate Republicans are taking other steps this week that could ease the pressure to defund Planned Parenthood in the government spending bill. They hope to pass a separate budget bill for next year \u2014 called reconciliation \u2013 that can be approved on just 51 votes instead of the usual 60 required for major bills in the Senate. Senate Republicans emerged from their reconciliation bill meeting in the Capitol upbeat they will have the 51 votes to pass the package, which would repeal more parts of Obamacare than the House did as well as defund Planned Parenthood. A vote on that measure is expected by the end of the week, according to Senate GOP aides. While President Obama is sure to veto the bill, Republicans would consider its passage a major accomplishment, one they would tout on the campaign trail. There has been some question as to whether Senate GOP leaders can get the 51 votes they need because of opposition from some conservatives \u2013 like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, both presidential candidates who want a broader Obamacare repeal \u2013 and some moderates who favor abortion rights like Mark Kirk of Illinois and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom are up for re-election in swing states. One of the holdouts on the Obamacare question was Sen. Mike Lee or Utah.  He said afterward he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the more robust Senate language. That was relief to Sen. John Cornyn, the GOP whip in charge of counting votes, who said, \u201cIf he\u2019s encouraged than I\u2019m encouraged.\u201d RELATED: Cruz: Maybe alleged clinic shooter is \u2018transgendered leftist\u2019 Senate GOP aides say pressure has been high from the anti-abortion community to approve the reconciliation bill and they anticipate getting enough support to pass it. Debate on reconciliation is set to begin formally Wednesday and conclude Thursday, per several aides and senators. McCarthy didn\u2019t rule out that Planned Parenthood language could be added in some fashion to the government funding bill saying, \u201cI expect there to be a healthy debate on every place the government spends money and that\u2019s the way democracy works.\u201d He made it clear the spending bill would include some mix of policy riders, but declined to describe which ones. Many conservative Republicans argue the spending bill is their main leverage with the administration, and are floating adding provisions to block implementation of climate change rules, Obamacare, and other Democratic priorities. House Speaker Paul Ryan has not signaled yet which of these he wants to press as negotiators on both sides try to hammer out a deal. McCarthy also said that after the terror attacks in Paris, \u201csecurity is becoming the top issue\u201d that he hears about from GOP colleagues. The No. 2 House GOP leader touted the veto-proof margin on legislation that passed the House before Thanksgiving that would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to certify any refugees from Iraq and Syria don\u2019t pose a security threat. He suggested that refugee measure could be added to the government funding legislation, saying, \u201cthat bill needs to pass and become law whichever way it can.\u201d Before the end of the year, congressional leaders also hope to pass a long-term compromise highway bill, a rewrite of the unpopular No Child Left Behind law, and a series of tax break extensions. On Monday night negotiators to the highway bill and, separately, the No Child Left Behind measure, were in the final stages of their talks and gathering signatures from conference committee members, with hopes of releasing their final language Monday night or Tuesday. Quick floor action is expected on each. CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak contributed to this story",

            "article_content": "In New York on Thursday, Clinton called for a \"new phase\" in a more intense U.S. and allied campaign to smash ISIS Her emphasis on escalating the U.S. role seemed to contrast with President Barack Obama, who has said that the U.S. strategy has \"contained\" ISIS in Syria This is what a President Hillary Clinton would look like. At least, that was the impression the former secretary of state seemed determined to convey with a robust, comprehensive presentation on how she would meet the rising challenge from ISIS as fear of terrorism spikes following the Paris attacks. In New York on Thursday, the Democratic front-runner called for a \u201cnew phase\u201d in a more intense U.S. and allied campaign to smash ISIS. \u201cAfter a major attack, every society faces a choice between fear and resolve. The world\u2019s great democracies can\u2019t sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore we must choose resolve. And we must lead a world to meet this threat.\u201d Her sharp rhetoric, and the multi-pronged military strategy she laid out to thwart ISIS, suggested that, in political terms at least, Clinton senses a leadership vacuum in Washington over Syria. Her emphasis on escalating the U.S. role seemed to contrast with President Barack Obama, who has said that the U.S. strategy has \u201ccontained\u201d ISIS in Syria and Iraq and described the Paris attacks as a \u201csetback\u201d that should not detract from wider U.S. successes against the group. And her lengthy attention to the global terror group suggests that she reads the issue as both key to the broader presidential campaign and her argument for victory in a general election that could turn on whether voters most value her experience as secretary of state or saddle her with blame for the current administration\u2019s struggles to shape a restive world. To Clinton\u2019s left, meanwhile, her main Democratic rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is laying an economic \u2013 rather than national security \u2013 bet and gave a major speech on inequality hours after Clinton\u2019s ISIS address. To her right, a potential GOP foe, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, called for a stronger U.S. strategy against ISIS on Wednesday, and said Clinton shared Obama\u2019s \u201cdiminished\u201d view of the U.S. role in the world as he promised a huge build-up of military might to tackle terrorism. RELATED: Sanders cites American icons in defense of \u2018democratic socialism\u2019 Delivering an animated, policy-heavy address, Clinton seemed more at ease than during a mixed debate showing in Iowa on Saturday or while deploying her sometimes uneven campaigning skills on the stump. And she seemed to raise the bar for candidates on foreign policy: Her remarks were more specific, for instance, than Bush\u2019s, who was more sparing on the details of how his own Syria strategy would work. On one level, Clinton\u2019s address at the Council on Foreign Relations was her entry into the demolition derby of 2016 candidates fighting to prove they\u2019re tougher and rougher than Obama on national security. With the President thousands of miles away on an around-the-world trip \u2013 and under attack over a defensive press conference in the wake of the ISIS rampages that killed more than 120 people in France last week \u2013 Clinton had the national security stage to herself. READ: Hillary Clinton\u2019s record at State Department: Blessing or curse? Liberated for a time from questions about her private email server, her honesty, her culpability in the Benghazi attack and a challenge on the left from Sanders, Clinton flexed her wonkish muscles across a map of the Middle East Thursday in a way that showcased her taste for detailed policy analysis. A Clinton aide said the former secretary of state spent months thinking deeply about her counter-terrorism strategy and had consulted dozens of experts, and then informed her staff on Monday that she wanted to lay out the plan this week in the wake of the Paris attacks. Clinton told aides that she wanted to use the speech in part to integrate U.S. strategy on Iran with counter-terrorism policy and also wanted to raise the question of why U.S. allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia had not been more involved in the anti-ISIS campaign. And at a moment of national consternation, Clinton seemed be trying to turn her hawkish instincts \u2013 often out of step with her party\u2019s grass roots \u2013 into a political asset. She went further than Obama in calling for a no-fly zone in northern Syria to protect refugees and civilians from airstrikes by the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. The administration has already rejected such a step and many Democrats \u2013 including Sanders \u2013 believe it would suck America into another Middle East quagmire. Clinton also spoke of the need for a \u201csecond Sunni awakening\u201d in Iraq to squeeze the ISIS in the country, warning that if the government in Baghdad did not arm Sunni tribes and Kurds, a U.S.-led coalition would. Clinton was also not shy in doling out tough love to U.S. friends and acid to enemies in another possible preview of her possible administration. She rebuked Saudi Arabia for not stopping its citizens funding extremist groups and chided Europe for not sharing intelligence on extremists. She warned Silicon Valley, a rich source of Democratic campaign funds, that preventing the government from accessing encrypted technologies used by terrorists to communicate could lead to another attack. There were tough words about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for his allies Iran and Russia, which Clinton said must \u201cface the fact that continuing to prop up a vicious dictator will not bring stability.\u201d Sanders, for his part, also sought to adapt his dovish reputation to the new national security mood in the wake of the Paris attacks, noting that unlike Clinton, he had opposed the war in Iraq, he was not against military action in every case and had backed the conflict in Afghanistan. \u201cNo, I am not a pacifist. I think that war should be the last resort,\u201d he said, briefly addressing national security in remarks billed as defining his democratic socialist leanings. He called for a stepped up campaign against \u201cbarbaric\u201d ISIS but put the emphasis on regional nations like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to do much more to counter the group, warning that they should not expect Washington to do their work for them. Democratic debate in Iowa Still, Clinton\u2019s appearance also reflected the contradictions of her presidential bid. She did, after all, serve in an administration that is now being accused of ignoring the building threat of ISIS, of allowing Syria to implode with the loss of more than 250,000 lives and of engineering a retreat from the world that let extremism prosper. \u201cAcross the world, the Obama-Clinton foreign policy lies in tatters,\u201d Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee said in a statement that hinted at a major general election vulnerability for the former top U.S. diplomat. \u201cHillary Clinton has demonstrated she is the wrong person to take on and defeat the growing threats facing the United States.\u201d And despite her lead in the polls, Clinton has not won the Democratic nomination yet, and accordingly framed her differences with Obama carefully as she courts dovish Democrats. \u201cLike President Obama, I do not believe that we should again have 100,000 American troops in combat in the Middle East,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThat is just not the smart move to make here,\u201d Clinton said, adding that the lesson of Iraq and Afghanistan was that local people must secure their own neighborhoods. Clinton also lashed out at GOP candidates who want to bar entry to Syrian refugees into the United States in case their number includes extremists. \u201cThat is just not who we are. We are better than that,\u201d Clinton said, echoing sentiments that Obama has repeatedly stressed on his trip through Asia. Though the President seemed to have Clinton\u2019s support on the issue, that wasn\u2019t the case for the rest of his party. Despite his strong rhetorical calls to support Syrian refugees and the White House\u2019s dispatch of top administration envoys to Capitol Hill on Thursday, 47 Democrats joined Republicans on a bill that would suspend the program allowing them into the country \u2013 a majority that could override Obama\u2019s promised veto. Obama\u2019s clash with lawmakers was a reminder that on the refugee issue, and on the wider fight against ISIS, he is in the hot seat now, while Clinton is still in the position of staking out policies that it\u2019s possible she might not be able to deliver on if she wins power. For instance, while Clinton called for a U.S. effort to support Arab armies on the ground to rout ISIS, she did not explain exactly how that would happen. READ: House passes bill that could limit Syrian refugees And while she called for more Special Operations forces to be sent to Syria and more freedom for U.S. troops backing Iraqi forces, there\u2019s no guarantee her plan would be any more successful than Obama\u2019s. \u201cSecretary Clinton is breaking from President Obama but not in the right way,\u201d Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina senator, told MSNBC. \u201cThe only way you can protect America from another 9/11 is to destroy the caliphate, go in on the ground as part of a regional army,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t outsource this.\u201d Michael Desch, an expert in international security at Notre Dame University, said that Clinton\u2019s speech was polished and showed her to be \u201chead and shoulders\u201d above Republican candidates on framing an anti-ISIS strategy. But he said Clinton was \u201cquite sanguine about our ability to micromanage political change in Syria and Iraq (in a way that) seems to fly in the face of our unsuccessful efforts to do that previously in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.\u201d Sanders, for his part, tried to change the terms of the debate on the topic, to keep Clinton on the defensive among a base that he has succeeded in appealing to on the basis of economic issues. Speaking before a warm crowd at Georgetown University and citing President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legacy includes steering America through World War II, Sanders declared, \u201cReal freedom must include economic security.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton detailed her ISIS strategy in a Thursday speech in New York Clinton's ties to President Obama's legacy are under scrutiny after the Paris attacks Hillary Clinton is calling for more allied planes, more airstrikes and a \u201cbroader target set\u201d \u2013 though no large-scale mobilization of U.S. ground troops \u2013 to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. She urged Congress to approve a new authorization of the use of military force against ISIS, saying that doing so would signal \u201cthat the U.S. is committed to this fight. The time for delay is over. We should get this done.\u201d In the wake of the Paris attacks, for which ISIS has claimed responsibility, Clinton said that \u201cevery society faces a choice between fear and resolve\u201d \u2013 an indirect shot at her Republican foes in the 2016 presidential race, who have called for the United States to shut out Syrian refugees. \u201cThis is no time to be scoring political points. We must use every pillar of American power, including our values, to fight terror,\u201d Clinton said. She said airstrikes by an international anti-ISIS coalition \u201cwill have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from ISIS,\u201d the former secretary of state said Thursday in a speech in New York City. Clinton called for more \u201cflexibility\u201d for U.S. Special Operations forces and trainers to work with regional forces \u2013 particularly Sunnis and Kurds \u2013 in opposing ISIS. She said she is open to sending more than the 50 of those forces that President Barack Obama has already mobilized. But Clinton said she opposes a new U.S. ground war in the Middle East. \u201cThat is just not the smart move here,\u201d she said. RELATED: Hillary Clinton\u2019s record at State Department: Blessing or curse? But Clinton did not detail her plans if regional powers fail to supply more troops and arms for the fight and left herself leeway on how many American troops she would support sending. Instead, Clinton sought to ramp up pressure on Iraq\u2019s Shia-led government and on Turkey to set aside old grievances, saying that \u201cthe threat from ISIS cannot wait.\u201d She said Qatar and Saudi Arabia \u201cneed to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations.\u201d And she acknowledged that the U.S. desire to see the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who she said has slaughtered more Syrians than terrorists have, isn\u2019t a top priority. \u201cWe need people to turn against the common enemy of ISIS,\u201d Clinton said. In a shot at Republicans who have criticized her for not using the phrase, Clinton said that denouncing \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d amounts to giving \u201cthese criminals, these murderers, more standing than they deserve.\u201d \u201cOur priority should be how to fight the enemy,\u201d Clinton said during a speech attended by many of her top aides, an indication of how important they considered the remarks. \u201cIn the end, it didn\u2019t matter what kind of terrorist we called bin Laden, it mattered that we killed bin Laden.\u201d Clinton, in a major break from her GOP presidential rivals, called for the United States to continue accepting Syrian refugees despite reports that at least one of the Paris attackers entered Europe under that guise. \u201cTurning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every Syrian refugee \u2013 that is just not who we are,\u201d Clinton said. She added: \u201cIt would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from ever finding new ones.\u201d RELATED: Hillary Clinton fails to capitalize on her resume at Democratic debate Aides were working on the speech, which Clinton was said to have a substantial hand in, until hours before she delivered it. Clinton delivered the speech at the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Pratt House, an ornate mansion on New York\u2019s Upper Eastside. New York Mayor Bill De Blasio, who just recently endorsed Clinton\u2019s candidacy, sat in the front row, joined by Vernon Jordan, a longtime adviser to the Clintons, and Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. Thomas Nides, Clinton\u2019s deputy Secretary of State, was also seated in the front row. Clinton, using a teleprompter, also called for stronger intelligence-gathering capabilities \u2013 saying U.S. tech companies have a role to play. \u201cWe need Silicon Valley not to view government as its adversary,\u201d she said, calling for solutions that \u201cwill both keep us safe and protect our privacy.\u201d Clinton also made the case for U.S. leadership, saying \u2013 in a shot at Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her Democratic primary opponent, who has placed major emphasis on the need for coalitions to fight ISIS \u2013 that \u201cthere has been lot of talk about coalitions. Everybody wants one.\u201d After the Paris attacks tilted the presidential race toward foreign policy, Clinton is attempting to escape the shadows of her hawkish history and her ties to President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. Foreign policy is an area Clinton, who spent four years as Obama\u2019s secretary of state and was involved in nearly all of his administration\u2019s key decisions during that tenure, counted as a strength at the campaign\u2019s outset. But even as she has embraced Obama\u2019s domestic policy achievements \u2013 a popular move in the Democratic nominating contest \u2013 his foreign policy record has become more complicated to address. Clinton\u2019s primary rivals, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, repeatedly latched Clinton to Obama when Democrats held their second debate Saturday. Republicans, too, are connecting Clinton to Obama \u2013 with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus saying her speech Thursday was largely a repeat of Obama\u2019s existing plans. \u201cHillary Clinton is the architect of the failed Obama foreign policy that has presided over a steep increase in radical Islamic terrorism and the rise of ISIS. Rather than putting forward a new plan to defeat ISIS, Hillary Clinton offered soaring platitudes and largely doubled down on the existing Obama strategy.\u201d RELATED: GOP looks to seize national security advantage from Obama over ISIS Clinton praised Obama in February, saying that \u201ca lot of the right moves are being made.\u201d And in June of 2015, Clinton said she \u201cwould have advised him to do exactly as I believe he is now doing.\u201d Clinton has highlighted some of her differences with Obama in recent days, casting herself as a hawkish member of Obama\u2019s cabinet. She pushed for the United States to join a coalition to oust Libya\u2019s strongman Moammar Gadhafi. And Clinton pointed Saturday to her calls to train and equip moderate rebels in Syria \u201cvery early on.\u201d She underscored that position again Thursday. \u201cI have made clear that we have differences, as I think any two people do,\u201d Clinton said, adding that she and Obama \u201clargely agreed\u201d during her time as America\u2019s top diplomat. \u201cBut even as I was still there, which is publicly known, I thought we needed to do more, earlier\u201d to help local Syrian fighters against leader Bashar al-Assad. Clinton was asked by CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria, who moderated a post-speech discussion, whether Obama erred in once referring to ISIS as the \u201cJV\u201d team \u2013 but she deflected. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful to go back and re-plow old ground,\u201d she said. Clinton criticized Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, two GOP 2016 hopefuls who have said the United States should focus on helping Syrian Christians first. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we should have religious test about who we bring as refugees into our country,\u201d she said. Already, Clinton had split with Obama by calling for the institution and enforcement of a no-fly zone over Syria designed in part to offer safe harbor for refugees fleeing the country\u2019s civil war and ISIS \u2013 a move that would require greater military involvement. And she made news Saturday by saying that ISIS \u201ccannot be contained; it must be defeated.\u201d Further complicating Clinton\u2019s task is the original foreign policy wedge between her and Obama: Iraq. Then-New York senator Clinton in 2002 supported George W. Bush\u2019s push for war. That vote \u2013 which she has since repeatedly called a mistake \u2013 was key to helping Obama surpass Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. Now, Clinton\u2019s chief intra-party rival for the 2016 nomination, Sanders, is again using her Iraq vote against her \u2013 blaming that war for creating a power vacuum that allowed for the rise of ISIS. \u201cI don\u2019t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,\u201d Sanders said Saturday during the Democratic debate in Iowa. RELATED: Poll shows Americans oppose Syrian refugees in U.S. Clinton must also keep one eye on the general election \u2013 and Republicans who are advocating a much more aggressive U.S. role in fighting ISIS. Jeb Bush called Wednesday in a speech at The Citadel, a military academy in South Carolina, for American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria. The Paris terrorist attacks have in recent days dominated the 2016 cycle and Clinton has used many of her events since then to comment on how she would handle the response. Thursday\u2019s speech is an attempt to set her record out in one place, at one time. Clinton has advocated for accepting refugees fleeing Syria over the last few days, but stressed that \u2013 unlike her Republican foes in the 2016 race \u2013 she would not commit ground troops to the fight. \u201cWe need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, the barbaric, ruthless, violence jihadist, terrorist group,\u201d Clinton said at the second Democratic presidential debate earlier this month. But she said the United States should \u201csupport those who take the fight to ISIS\u201d rather than fighting the group alone. \u201cThis cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,\u201d she said. The former secretary of state cautiously supported Obama last month when he decided to authorize the use of special forces in Syria. Her spokesman, Nick Merrill, said that the candidate \u201csees merit\u201d in deploying the 50 special operations forces. Clinton has also called for the United States to continue to take in refugees from Syria, something a host of Republican governors and presidential candidates have said they would not do. \u201cWe can\u2019t act as though we are shutting the door to people in need without undermining who we are as Americans,\u201d she told a crowd of supporters in Dallas on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Trump blasted President Barack Obama and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton Trump's speech Monday drew 9,750 people to the Knoxville Convention Center Donald Trump on Monday focused on national security in a speech to a raucous crowd of nearly 10,000 people, days after the terrorist attacks in Paris sent shockwaves around the world and rippled through the 2016 presidential race. Slamming President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton for not referring to the threat from ISIS as \u201cradical Islam,\u201d Trump told his supporters here that it\u2019s time to \u201ctalk about\u201d the threat and pledged a more aggressive response if elected president. \u201cYou hear the term radical Islamic terrorism. He won\u2019t say it. He won\u2019t say it,\u201d Trump said referring to Obama. \u201cI mean you can\u2019t solve a problem if you refuse to talk about what the problem is. And he won\u2019t talk about it. I don\u2019t know what \u2018s going on with this man. And you know who else won\u2019t talk about it? Hillary. She won\u2019t talk about it.\u201d Trump also suggested that \u201cweak and ineffective\u201d leadership was to blame for the attacks in Paris, which killed at least 129 people. \u201cWhen you\u2019re weak and ineffective, bad stuff does happen. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Trump said at the top of his speech as he opened with the Paris killings, but did not elaborate on the remark. Stumping Saturday in Beaumont, Texas, Trump first reacted to the terrorist carnage by saying that the tragedy \u201cwould\u2019ve been a much, much different situation\u201d if Paris had looser gun laws. \u201cIf you have 25 people in there with guns, OK, it would\u2019ve been a totally different story,\u201d Trump said Monday, before pivoting to the need to protect the Second Amendment at home. CIA chief anticipates more ISIS attacks Trump\u2019s speech Monday drew 9,750 people to the Knoxville Convention Center, according to the venue\u2019s general manager, Mary Bogert. The animated crowd was a welcome sight for Trump, who has seen several of his competitors surging in the polls, endangering his months-long lead at the top of the GOP presidential pack. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is now neck-and-neck with Trump nationally and in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa. And Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are steadily climbing to the top-tier of the pack, with the media narrative shifting to a potential contest between the two Cuban-American senators. And while Trump hit Rubio Monday night as he typically does on the stump, the brash billionaire pulled his punches against Carson, who has been a focus of Trump\u2019s barbs \u2013 and one Instagram video \u2013 in recent weeks. Instead, Trump focused his attack lines on Obama, Clinton and the political class of politicians running for the GOP nomination. \u201cWhen a guy gives $5 million to let\u2019s say Jeb Bush, or 5 million to Hillary of 5 million to Rubio,\u201d Trump said, before pausing to say he doesn\u2019t understand Rubio\u2019s appeal. \u201cBut when they give all of this money, they expect something, folks. But Trump didn\u2019t linger on his rivals, instead delivering as promised a mostly national security-focused address. And it paid off. Trump\u2019s biggest applause lines came as he once again pledged to \u201cbomb the s\u2013t out of\u201d ISIS and forcefully insisted the U.S. should not accept any Syrian refugees. Instead, Trump called for building a \u201ctremendous safe zone\u201d in Syria where Syrians could live without fear of being bombed. How do Syrian refugees get into the U.S.? Obama has already said the U.S. would accept 10,000 Syrian refugees fleeing the civil war and ISIS\u2019s barbarism in Syria. Trump\u2019s election could spell disaster for those 10,000, though, as he once again pledged to send those refugees back to the Middle East if elected: \u201cAnyone that\u2019s brought in to this country from the migration is going to be out.\u201d It\u2019s a position that resonated with Trump\u2019s supporters in Knoxville \u2013 eight of whom interviewed Monday by CNN said they strongly agreed with Trump\u2019s hardline refusal. \u201cI would say not all of them are terrorists, obviously, but the ones that would slip in or could slip in easily present a major issue,\u201d supporter Douglas Buckley said. \u201cHow can you vet someone who\u2019s going to lie anyway? Another supporter 65-year-old Max Henderson agreed: \u201cYou think ISIS is not going to put \u2013 ISIS is going to put \u2018em there. They\u2019re gon\u2019 be there.\u201d Complete coverage on terror in Paris \u2013 CNN\u2019s Noah Gray contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On his last two foreign swings, Obama has offered blistering criticism of the slate of candidates who are vying to replace him His willingness to engage in partisan politics while on foreign soil is a point the GOP is using in blasting his approach on ISIS In his nearly seven years flying around the globe as commander in chief, President Barack Obama has aimed his ire at crooked tyrants and shadowy warlords the world over. Lately, though, he\u2019s had another target in his sights: Republicans. On his last two foreign swings, Obama has offered blistering criticism about the slate of candidates who are vying to replace him on the GOP side, lambasting their policy proposals and implying they lack the gravitas to do his job. His remarks wouldn\u2019t sound out of place during a press conference in the White House briefing room or at a speech to a room of Democratic fundraisers. But it\u2019s a new phenomenon for Obama \u2013 and rare for U.S. presidents generally \u2013 to use such pointed language about political rivals on the world stage. Some of those rivals aren\u2019t pleased. \u201cI would encourage you, Mr. President, if you want to insult me, come back and insult me to my face,\u201d dared U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas Wednesday, after Obama went after his proposals for Syrian refugees while traveling in the Philippines to attend a regional economic summit. Obama\u2019s aides say the President is simply calling out Republican language that deserves scrutiny \u2013 including what he says are \u201coffensive\u201d intimations about refugees from Syria. The decision to respond while abroad, they say, is merely a facet of his schedule. But it is a practice Obama has only engaged in more recently, and it follows a new, unguarded manner for Obama. Unrestrained by another election bid and the possibility that his words could adversely affect his political standing, Obama has taken to blunt assessments of his rivals\u2019 policies whenever they arise. Unconcerned about allegations he\u2019s abusing his bully pulpit abroad, Obama has used the foreign trips to underscore his global stature \u2013 and make a tacit comparison to what he sees as his critics\u2019 lesser positions. READ: Cruz to Obama: Debate me, insult me to my face The latest example came Wednesday, when Obama \u2013 asked about some Republicans\u2019 calls to stop Syrian migration into the United States \u2013 lit into the field of candidates, who have almost uniformly called for curbs on the refugee flow. \u201cThey\u2019ve been playing on fear in order to try to score political points or to advance their campaigns,\u201d he said, standing alongside Philippines President Benigno Aquino, who is hosting a yearly summit of Pacific nation leaders in Manila. The harsh comments from Obama come as Republicans are increasing their attacks on him after ISIS\u2019s devastating attacks in Paris, which left 129 people dead. The President maintained in a press conference Monday at the start of his trip to Asia that his current strategy for combating the terror group is working, but he was criticized on both sides of the aisle for defensiveness and testiness during his remarks. And his willingness to engage in partisan politics while on foreign soil is another point the GOP is using in blasting his approach. Cruz suggested the two men hold a debate on the issue, criticizing the venue that Obama has chosen: \u201cWe can do it anywhere you want. I\u2019d prefer it in the United States and not overseas where you\u2019re making the insults. It\u2019s easy to toss a cheap insult when no one can respond.\u201d Though Obama didn\u2019t mention Cruz by name, it was clear that he along with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was a target of the President\u2019s remarks condemning candidates who have recommended that the U.S. accept only Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war in their country. Both Republicans have suggested allowing only Christians from Syria into the U.S. \u201cWhen you start seeing individuals in positions of responsibility, suggesting that Christians are more worthy of protection than Muslims are in a war-torn land, that feeds the ISIL narrative,\u201d he said, using another term for ISIS. \u201cIt\u2019s counterproductive, and it needs to stop.\u201d Two days earlier Obama issued another barbed challenge to another Republican candidate, Dr. Ben Carson, who has suggested his foreign policy advisers had better intelligence about the situation in Syria than the White House. \u201cIf they think that somehow their advisors are better than the Chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them,\u201d taunted a visibly irritated Obama. He was speaking at the conclusion of the Group of 20 meetings held on the Turkish coast. But the President hasn\u2019t always been so willing to wade into domestic politics while speaking at an international podium. When he was running for re-election in 2011 and 2012, he avoided sharp criticism of his would-be Republican challengers even when questioned about the race. READ: Obama unyielding on ISIS as criticism mounts after Paris attacks At a November 2011 G20 meeting in the South of France \u2013 the same time in the electoral cycle as this year\u2019s meeting in Turkey \u2013 Obama said the upcoming election battle wasn\u2019t a priority. \u201cI have to tell you the least of my concerns at the moment is the politics of a year from now,\u201d he said when asked about his re-election prospects in the face of a weak economic report. Even at the next year\u2019s summit, held in Mexico five months before Election Day, Obama insisted that domestic politics weren\u2019t on his mind. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that any \u2013 all these issues, economic issues, will potentially have some impact on the election,\u201d he said, again responding to questions about the economy. \u201cBut that\u2019s not my biggest concern right now.\u201d Even given a chance to respond to his then-rival Mitt Romney, whose top adviser had written an article critical of the Obama in a German newspaper, the President demurred. \u201cI would point out that we have one President at a time and one administration at a time, and I think traditionally the notion has been that America\u2019s political differences end at the water\u2019s edge,\u201d he said. In his final term in office, however, Obama has dropped whatever resistance he had previously to lambasting his potential replacements. Asked during a July trip to Africa about comments made by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee \u2013 in which the Republican White House hopeful claimed Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal amounted to marching Israel to \u201cthe door of the oven,\u201d a reference to the Holocaust \u2013 Obama lit into the field at large. \u201cThe particular comments of Mr. Huckabee are, I think, part of just a general pattern that we\u2019ve seen that is \u2013 would be considered ridiculous if it weren\u2019t so sad,\u201d he said during a news conference with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. He went on to decry \u201ca culture that is not conducive to good policy or good politics.\u201d \u201cThe American people deserve better,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, presidential debates deserve better. In 18 months, I\u2019m turning over the keys \u2013 I want to make sure I\u2019m turning over the keys to somebody who is serious about the serious problems the country faces and the world faces.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tom LoBianco contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "GOP candidates are piling on President Barack Obama over the rise of ISIS after the Paris attacks It is not clear that a broad American electorate is now ready to embrace the more hawkish, interventionist school of foreign policy A new climate of fear stirred by the resurgence of international terrorism may offer Republicans an opening they\u2019ve long sought to repair a tattered reputation on national security and reclaim the political advantage on the issue. GOP candidates are piling on President Barack Obama over the rise of ISIS after Friday\u2019s Paris attacks. Sensing political vulnerability following his at-times defensive comments about the tragedy at a press conference on Monday, they are trying to make the most of what could be a pivotal moment in the 2016 campaign. In the past two presidential elections, Republicans, hampered by the Iraq-stained legacy of George W. Bush, were powerless to stop Obama from co-opting their party\u2019s traditional national security edge after he hunted down Osama bin Laden and largely eradicated the threat from core al Qaeda. But the Paris carnage appears to call into question Obama\u2019s assertions that his strategy to combat ISIS is working and that he had not underestimated the group, and Republicans believe the GOP has a chance to recast the debate. \u201cThere is a sense that things are spinning out of control, that the President of the United States is at the mercy of events and Syria is part of that,\u201d said Peter Wehner, who served Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. \u201cThat has got to hurt Democrats and that has got to hurt Hillary Clinton. That is their greatest vulnerability.\u201d Yet it would be premature for the Republican Party to assume it now holds a trump card on national security in the campaign. After eight years in which Obama has tried to extricate U.S. troops from foreign wars, it is not clear that a broad American electorate is now ready to embrace the more hawkish, interventionist school of foreign policy popular among many GOP activists. Republicans also have yet to identify a sweet spot between Bush\u2019s era of pre-emptive war and what they see today as Obama\u2019s retreat from global leadership. READ: How Republican candidates would respond to ISIS The president, for one, is beginning to relish the argument, using a press appearance in the Philippines on Wednesday to castigate GOP candidates for offering a \u201crecruitment tool\u201d for ISIS by demanding that no more Syria refugees be let into the U.S. for fear extremists could be among them. Obama\u2019s comments are striking for their focus on the domestic political debate while he\u2019s representing the nation from the international stage, another potential line of attack for the GOP in arguing that the President isn\u2019t handling the current crisis appropriately. For now, establishment Republican candidates are quickly maneuvering to turn the tables on the President. They are also desperate to showcase credentials of statesmanship and experience so far drowned out in the cacophony swirling around outsider candidates like real estate mogul Donald Trump and to draw contrasts with neophytes like neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has struggled when cross-examined on foreign policy in the days since the attacks. \u201cThe world changed this weekend in a lot of ways,\u201d said Jeb Bush on Tuesday, referring to the Paris attacks, which killed more than 120 people and were claimed by ISIS. On Wednesday, he will elaborate on this theme in a speech on the military. READ: Bush tries to bolster commander in chief credentials \u201cThis brutal savagery is a reminder of what is at stake in this election. We are choosing the leader of the free world,\u201d Bush will stress, according to prepared remarks. \u201cAnd if these attacks remind us of anything, it is that we are living in serious times that require serious leadership.\u201d Another candidate billing himself as a foreign policy expert, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, responded to the Paris attacks by recalling the moralistic rhetoric used by Republican icon Ronald Reagan during the Cold War. \u201cThis is a clash of civilizations. Either they win or we win,\u201d Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a video produced by his campaign. Ohio Gov. John Kasich also defined the battle with ISIS as an attack on Western civilization in his own campaign video Tuesday. In an implicit swipe at Obama and less-seasoned GOP opponents, he warned, \u201cOn-the-job training for president of the United States doesn\u2019t work.\u201d \u201cI do think this is a commander-in-chief moment for presidential candidates,\u201d said Kori Schake, a senior State Department official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThis is the moment when voters are going to pay attention, and they are going to grade everybody on the commander-in-chief test.\u201d The pace of Republican attacks has quickened since Obama\u2019s news conference on Monday. Given that he was in Turkey for a meeting of world leaders and about to head on to Asia for a regional economic conference, it is possible the President underestimated the consternation building back in Washington over the reach of ISIS in the wake of the Paris attacks \u2013 and amid warnings that the United States could be next. Certainly, GOP candidates were emboldened by critical media coverage that greeted the President\u2019s performance and potentially exacerbated his political exposure on ISIS. But as Republicans seek to blame Democrats for global chaos, they must navigate their own political challenges. After all, memories are still fresh of the disastrous unraveling of the invasion of Iraq that helped Obama get elected in the first place. A successful foreign policy offensive will require comprehensive policies and a wider narrative that can not only win the trust of voters but also suggest a path forward for the United States at a time when its global power seems to be ebbing. And the heat of a presidential campaign is not necessarily the best place to develop that program, as primary voters may reward hawkish rhetoric over policy prescriptions. Former U.S. secretary of state and national security adviser Henry Kissinger remarked on the divergent demands of a commander in chief and a candidate on Monday. \u201cThe nature of our political contest now, is with public opinion polls taken every week, the emphasis is on immediate impact and the problem we are discussing is a very long-range problem,\u201d said the top Nixon official at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Similarly, a drama like the Paris attacks often leads candidates to propose instant solutions. So there are calls for a troop surge in Syria, expanded bombing campaigns and tough new homeland security measures that may not actually be workable or fully thought out. \u201cI\u2019m going to bomb the s\u2014- out of them,\u201d Trump said on Monday, warning that ISIS has \u201cgot to be stopped.\u201d The real estate mogul also said he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d closing mosques on American soil. The ISIS terror threat Obama emphasized the gulf between the campaign trail and the Oval Office on Monday. \u201cSome of them seem to think that if I was just more bellicose in expressing what we\u2019re doing, that that would make a difference,\u201d he said, referring to his GOP critics. \u201cBecause that seems to be the only thing that they\u2019re doing, is talking as if they\u2019re tough.\u201d For now, the Republican candidates have seemed to focus more on politically attractive positions rather than policy solutions \u2013 first and foremost, the issue of accepting Syrian refugees. That, too, is fraught with risk. Almost all Republican presidential candidates have expressed concern that accepting more refugees from the fighting in Syria could allow militants to infiltrate American soil and stage attacks like those in Paris. Though this position appeals to the Republican base, for candidates like Bush and Rubio, joining such calls \u2013 which play into wider conservative demands to secure U.S. borders \u2013 threatens to undercut the larger aspirational message about America\u2019s higher moral purpose and inclusivity that underlie their campaigns. \u201cIt\u2019s a short term-reflex. People are scared,\u201d said Schake of the focus on the refugee issue. \u201cBut leadership is about explaining why people don\u2019t need to be scared. Refugees from Syria are fleeing the very terrorism we want to fight.\u201d Even if the refugees are kept out, it does little to stop the threat of ISIS, adherents of which are already regularly identified in the United States. Obama on Wednesday intervened in the Republican debate over refugees to harshly mock the national security credentials of the GOP candidates who want to succeed him. \u201cAt first they were too scared of the press being too tough on them in the debates. Now they are scared of three-year-old orphans. That doesn\u2019t seem so tough to me,\u201d the President said in Manila on the sidelines of an Asian regional summit. While the issue of refugees has now become a domestic political controversy, there are also longer term strategic questions for Republican candidates. At some point, candidates seeking to capitalize on the current administration\u2019s foreign policy woes must develop a genuine case for American voters of why it may be necessary to wade back into the Middle East to disrupt ISIS havens in Iraq and Syria. \u201cWhen you say the people are tired of war \u2013 we all get tired of war,\u201d Kasich said at the National Press Club on Tuesday. \u201cBut at the end of the day, leaders have to rally the public to a cause that is great.\u201d But while Obama is vulnerable on the Middle East, Republican candidates are also struggling to identify an approach that will end the security threats from a region where national authority has broken down, ethnic, religious and sectarian conflicts are raging, U.S. power has eroded and the political order in place since World War I is collapsing. Obama was partly correct in Turkey when he said that many of the suggestions put forward by Republican candidates were already being tried by the administration. Others, such as no-fly zones, might be impractical. And calls by the GOP for the United States to corral European and Gulf state allies skip over the reality that no other nation seems ready to make the sacrifices on the ground in Syria that Americans also want to avoid. But Republicans are not the only ones with a difficult political path. The ISIS surge also complicates Hillary Clinton\u2019s road to the White House because her former role as secretary of state ties her to Obama\u2019s national security legacy. READ: Hillary Clinton fails to capitalize on her resume at Democratic debate The party front-runner appeared to struggle to explain her past positions on Libya and Iraq during a Democratic debate in Iowa on Saturday. In front of a liberal audience among which Obama is still hugely popular, the former top U.S. diplomat avoided criticizing her former boss over ISIS, sidestepping a question about whether he had underestimated the danger from the group. But she did say ISIS \u201ccannot be contained\u201d but \u201cmust be defeated,\u201d subtly distancing herself from the President\u2019s position. It was a performance that emphasized the challenges she faces in running for a third consecutive Democratic term in the White House. Still, the debate over ISIS could also offer Clinton an opening. As the Democratic nominee, she will have to worry less about securing support among Democrats and will have some latitude to move further away from Obama\u2019s positions to protect her right flank. She could, for instance, stress that she has long taken more hawkish positions on Syria than the President \u2013 notably calling for the arming of moderate Syrian rebels earlier in the civil war, which ISIS is using to exploit its grip on territory. And Clinton\u2019s campaign believes that, ultimately, her global experience will elevate her above potential GOP opponents. \u201cAmerica is not just electing a president \u2013 we are also electing a commander In chief, and that choice matters,\u201d Clinton said in Texas on Tuesday, in an ironic echo of Bush\u2019s remarks that are likely to be a dominant theme of the fall 2016 campaign.",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush will offer a four-pronged plan to build up the military In South Carolina, Bush argued the presidential race has taken on a more somber, realistic tone with ISIS attacks Seeking a moment to catapult his candidacy to the forefront of the Republican field, Jeb Bush on Wednesday delivered a major address on defense policy at a time when the world is grappling with devastating terror threats and attacks. The former Florida governor has routinely accused the Obama administration of tearing down the military through budget cuts that he says have weakened the country\u2019s standing in the global balance of power. And he continued that criticism of the President and Hillary Clinton in a speech at The Citadel military college in Charleston, South Carolina, where Bush offered a four-pronged plan to build up the military, and, as he sees it, take back the mantle as the world\u2019s leader, with the Paris attacks as a backdrop. \u201cRadical Islamic terrorists have declared war on the western world. Their aim is our total destruction. We can\u2019t withdraw from this threat, nor negotiate with it,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe have but one choice: to defeat it.\u201d Related: GOP looks to seize national security advantage from Obama over ISIS While the speech was scheduled before the terrorist attacks in France, Bush is seizing the moment as well as on scrutiny over Obama\u2019s ISIS strategy to brand himself as the tried and trusted leader \u2013 the safer option for a Republican primary electorate that has so far preferred candidates with no political experience according to polling. \u201cThe United States should not delay in leading a global coalition to take out ISIS with overwhelming force,\u201d Bush said. He called for the United States to intensify both its air and ground efforts against the group in Syria and Iraq, and raised the prospect of a land war in the Middle East. \u201cThe United States \u2013 in conjunction with our NATO allies and more Arab partners \u2013 will need to increase our presence on the ground,\u201d Bush said. Bush appeared on five morning news shows on Sunday and Monday, calling for the U.S. to \u201cdeclare war\u201d against ISIS and urged the use of \u201cmassive force\u201d to take out the terror group. As he did Tuesday during a three-stop tour across South Carolina, Bush argued Wednesday that the presidential race has taken on a more somber, realistic tone. \u201cThis brutal savagery is a reminder of what is at stake in this election. We are choosing the leader of the free world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if these attacks remind us of anything, it is that we are living in serious times that require serious leadership.\u201d In a call with business leaders later Tuesday, Bush offered loaded criticism of Obama for saying last week that ISIS had been contained and for allowing the expansion of the terror group\u2019s reach to expand on his watch. \u201cIn effect, this President wants to run out the clock and leave this responsibility to the next president,\u201d Bush said. Bush\u2019s hawkish rhetoric about ISIS garnered him thunderous applause Tuesday night at a town hall in Conway, a small city not far from the Grand Strand coast. \u201cEvery day they exist, they create instability that we\u2019re going to have to deal with either here or there. Which one do you want? I believe we should take it to them there and do it in a comprehensive way where we lead the world.\u201d The presidential candidate has repeatedly reminded voters this week that he laid out a plan this summer to take on ISIS, and he did so again in his speech. While the proposal mirrored some actions already taken by the Obama administration, Bush differed from Obama in calling for a no-fly zone in Syria and for embedding troops with the Iraqi military. More broadly, Bush called Wednesday for increasing the size of the U.S. Army by 40,000 soldiers and the size of the Marine Corps by 4,000 Marines. He\u2019s also in favor of increasing the size of the Navy and boost Virginia class submarine production, according to his campaign. To push back against Russia, Bush would increase commitment to NATO, including sending an Army Special Forces Group back to European Command, he said. He would also favor more joint military exercises with other countries. The Pentagon, he argued, is bloated with waste, and he said he plans to reduce the number of Washington bureaucrats to free up resources for more uniformed military. As for homeland security, he placed emphasis on securing the borders, improving cybersecurity and protecting infrastructure. Bush also faced questions earlier this week about the refugee crisis in Syria. While he has previously taken a more compassionate tone than other candidates on taking in Syrian refugees \u2013 he boasts among his supporters a Syrian-American woman who has appeared at several of his events \u2013 Bush has taken a more hardline stance since the Paris attacks, saying he would prioritize Christian refugees. Speaking to reporters at a barbecue joint in Florence, South Carolina, he said the United States should take in \u201cpeople like orphans and people who are clearly not going to be terrorists. Or Christians.\u201d Even then, he supports House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s suggestion to take a \u201cpause\u201d on accepting refugees until proper screening and vetting procedures are in place to prevent members of ISIS from taking advantage of asylum grants. Asked whether he would bar moderate Muslims entirely, Bush said he wants to see what the vetting process looks like first. He was also asked how he would distinguish between Muslims and Christians. \u201cYou can prove you\u2019re a Christian,\u201d he said. Pressed further on how, Bush shrugged his shoulders and replied: \u201cI think you can prove it. If you can\u2019t prove it, then, you know, you err on the side of caution. \u201d Bush also pushed back on Obama\u2019s criticism Monday of candidates who issued a preference for Christian refugees over Muslim ones. Speaking in Conway, Bush said the persecution of Christians in the Middle East \u201cshould haunt us as a nation.\u201d \u201cThe President got after me indirectly on this yesterday, saying that somehow it was wrong to say what I just said and not have the same sympathies for Muslims. Well I do. We all have sympathies for people that have been uprooted,\u201d he said, but added: \u201cLook, we have a duty to protect our country as well.\u201d The unrest in the Middle East has been a quagmire this year for Bush\u2019s campaign because of his brother\u2019s involvement in the region with the war on terror. While Bush danced around how to handle questions about his brother and specifically Iraq earlier this summer, he seemed to find his footing when he started focusing on a message that George W. Bush kept the country safe after the 9/11 attacks. Jeb Bush won accolades from Republican voters when he defended his brother in the second Republican presidential debate against Donald Trump, and again in October when Trump criticized George W. Bush for 9/11 attacks happening on his watch. And though Jeb Bush is attempting to craft his own brand, it\u2019s clear that he sees some advantages in building on his family history. Bush embraced the legacy of his father, former President George H.W. Bush, and his handling of the Gulf War, for example, on Tuesday. At the barbecue joint, the younger Bush recalled the war as \u201cone of the most effective victories, where we had a strategy, we act(ed) on a strategy, we won and we left.\u201d And while one woman in Florence told him, \u201cI loved your brother, George,\u201d and encouraged Jeb Bush not to \u201cget that much further away from him like some people suggest,\u201d another woman in Conway took a more confrontational tone, reminding Bush that his brother created the most debt of any U.S. president, second only to Obama. Asked by a separate voter in Conway how he can convince the country that it needs a third Bush presidency, Bush said he loved his family but that \u201celections are about the future, not the past.\u201d He pledged to run on the merit of his own record, arguing that it could easily outmatch Hillary Clinton in a general election. \u201cWe can win. That\u2019s how I\u2019ll win,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do it proud of my brother and proud of my dad.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The debate's early exchanges suggested that Hillary Clinton hadn't figured out how to harness her record as an advantage rather than a liability At times she seemed caught between defending a record that has been more hawkish than the current President and appealing to a Democratic grassroots Hillary Clinton\u2019s four years as secretary of state were supposed to give her an advantage going into a debate Saturday night that began with addressing the terror attacks in Paris one day earlier. Paris terror attacks But instead, the Democratic front-runner found herself on the defensive, taking blows from competitors with considerably fewer national security credentials and giving Republicans potential lines of attack should they face her next year. The debate\u2019s early exchanges suggested that she hadn\u2019t figured out how to harness her record as an advantage rather than a liability \u2013 a resume that exposes her to attacks on President Barack Obama\u2019s perceived policy weaknesses during her time working for him in his first term. And in fact, she seemed more in control of the debate when it turned to domestic issues like banking policy and the economy than on her anticipated strong suit of foreign affairs. Is Obama foreign policy cautious or weak? Clinton started out strong in a debate that took on a suddenly somber tone after the ISIS-claimed rampage through the streets of Paris on Friday that killed more than 120 people and marked an alarming new phase in the group\u2019s expanding terror campaign. How terror in France could shape an election in America She made an implicit case that her experience uniquely prepared her to serve as president in a testing new age \u2013 recalling the famous 3 a.m. call that she used in a campaign ad to try to puncture the inexperienced Barack Obama in their 2008 primary clash. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Clinton expressed confidence in her opening statement Saturday that her national security experience would be a boon, declaring that, \u201cThis election is not only about electing a president. It\u2019s also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.\u201d And she sought to press an advantage over her closest competitor, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 who mentioned the fiscal woes facing many Americans in his initial remarks \u2013 by saying, \u201call of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.\u201d She also broke with Obama to argue that ISIS \u201ccannot be contained. It must be defeated.\u201d The President had used that description for ISIS the day earlier before the Paris attacks occurred. But early on in the debate, Sanders turned the tables on her, suggesting that the Iraq war, which she voted to authorize in the Senate, had created chaos in the Middle East that led to the rise of ISIS. 100 moments from the Iraq War \u201cI don\u2019t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now. I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States,\u201d Sanders said. Opinion: Iraq, the war that won\u2019t go away Clinton had no effective response for the jab, which has been repeated for eight years, and she replied with a meandering answer that mentioned previous attacks on U.S. interests in Beirut, Tanzania, Kenya and in the United States on September 11, 2001 in an apparent attempt to prove that terrorism was not solely the result of events in Iraq. \u201cI have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I think if we\u2019re ever going to really tackle the problems posed by Jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.\u201d She also labored to answer a question about whether the current administration had underestimated ISIS. Why did Obama declare ISIS \u2018contained\u2019 the day before Paris attack? She blamed others for the current morass in the Middle East: She called out then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for destroying an Iraqi army equipped and trained by the U.S. that folded amid the ISIS advance after American troops withdrew on a timetable sketched out by President George W. Bush. And she stressed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must be called to account for the bloody meltdown in his war-torn country. The CBS Democratic Debate in 2 Minutes Left out from her analysis was the criticism of many Republicans and some foreign policy experts that the Obama administration did not push hard enough to reach an agreement with Maliki that would have allowed U.S. troops to remain. At times she seemed caught between defending a record that has been more hawkish than the current President and appealing to a Democratic grassroots uncomfortable with those positions and resistant to any more U.S. wars abroad. 2016 hopefuls express alarm over refugees after Paris attacks In speaking about taking on ISIS, Clinton declared that, \u201cit cannot be an American fight.\u201d It was a call for a renewed effort to engage U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East in an anti-ISIS coalition that is in sync with the multilateralist inclinations of the left of the party, but could come across as less than assertive when the GOP accuse her of being part of a weak response to the deadly group spearheaded by Obama. Who is doing what in the coalition battle against ISIS? Clinton was also challenged on the U.S.-led operation that triggered the overthrow of Libya\u2019s longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, which she championed but which later led to chaos in a country that is now a haven of extremism. She argued that Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any other leader in the region and that the U.S. had acted to avert a looming massacre of opposition fighters. But she also made the case that the subsequent splintering of Libya had more to do with the sectarian forces ripping apart the Middle East than her own policy. Republicans, however, aren\u2019t likely to see her as having settled the issue and are certain to seize upon Clinton\u2019s role in the Libya operation if they meet her in a presidential debate. The ISIS terror threat At the end of the night, however, the former top U.S. diplomat was able to remind the audience that she alone of her competitors had faced the life-or-death decisions that a commander in chief must make. After the moderator asked the candidates to recall a time when they had been tested by crisis to demonstrate they were fit to face tough situations as president, Clinton described considering whether to recommend that the U.S. launch the raid to kill Osama bin Laden, which she eventually did. Joe Biden changes story on Osama Bin Laden raid No one else on the stage Saturday night \u2013 or at the Republican debate earlier in the week \u2013 could claim to have weighed such a choice.",

            "article_content": "Bush got an enthusiastic reception and delivered one of his strongest campaign performances to date Less than 24 hours before, Bush's campaign announced a major reshuffling of its resources If Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign is struggling to stay afloat, he didn\u2019t show it on Saturday. A day after slashing salaries and cutting campaign staff, the former Florida governor got an enthusiastic reception and delivered one of his strongest campaign performances to date. He tore into Donald Trump repeatedly and roused some in the crowd to their feet on answers about the military and foreign policy. Bush took part in a town hall series hosted by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, drawing an audience of more than 500 people, about twice the number Bush normally attracts on the campaign trail. Rep. Trey Gowdy, who led the daylong Benghazi hearing on Thursday, also headlined the event and joined Scott on stage to help ask questions. Bush got one of his biggest responses from the crowd when he lamented the state of politics in Washington and argued that Trump is not the kind of leader that could break through the gridlock. \u201cIf this election is about how we\u2019re going to fight to get nothing done, then \u2026 I don\u2019t want any part of it. I don\u2019t want to be elected president to sit around and see gridlock just become so dominant that people literally are in decline in their lives. That is not my motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of really cool things I could do other than sit around, being miserable, listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them. That is a joke. Elect Trump if you want that,\u201d Bush added. Less than 24 hours before, Bush\u2019s campaign announced a major reshuffling of its resources, saying it was cutting some salaries by 40% and letting go of some people in order to shift more focus on the campaign\u2019s ground game in the early voting states. George W. Bush to hit D.C. fundraising circuit for brother It was a big move by Bush\u2019s campaign as he\u2019s fighting to regain the lead after rivals Trump and Ben Carson have held onto the top spots in the polls for weeks. Speaking to reporters before the event, Bush assessed the changes as normal adjustments that campaigns need to make, citing the \u201cnew phenomenon\u201d of \u201cthe rise of candidates that have had no practical experience in politics\u201d as a reason for his decision. \u201cIn business, when you anticipate how things are going to be, you anticipate them, you don\u2019t wait for them,\u201d he said. As for the whisper campaign that he\u2019s falling apart, Bush was more frank. \u201cBlah blah blah, Blah,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my answer.\u201d He went on to point to other candidates like Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton in 2008, who were expected to take their parties\u2019 nominations but failed in the end. Jeb Bush's life Pressed with questions about Trump, especially the real estate mogul\u2019s recent slipping in the polls in Iowa to Carson, Bush grew tired of talking about his rival. \u201cI\u2019m past Donald Trump,\u201d he said. But that certainly wasn\u2019t true in the town hall a few minutes later, when Bush repeatedly needled Trump, gaining applause and laugh lines for going after the candidate who\u2019s currently dominating the GOP field in South Carolina. According to a recent CNN/ORC poll, Trump came in first at 36%. Bush had 6%. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of big personalities on the stage. A lot of them. One in particular,\u201d he said, before throwing his arms up to mock one of Trump\u2019s favorite words. \u201cHuge, huge, huge!\u201d On a more serious note, he blasted Trump for saying that he would send refugees back to Syria if he becomes president. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stand for people that will die because of their faith, wow, we have really lost our way. I think Donald Trump is dead wrong on this, and I am right,\u201d Bush said, before adding that he\u2019s anticipating a Twitter attack from Trump now that he\u2019s said that. Trump attacks force Bush out of his malaise It was Bush\u2019s second trip to South Carolina this month, a state that he has already predicted he\u2019ll win.\u201dYou can take it to the bank,\u201d he said during a stop here last month. He opened up his third office in the state recently and has eight paid staffers on the ground, with plans to add more. It\u2019s a state that was good to his brother\u2019s run for president in 2000. The audience often broke out into cheers, whistling and occasionally some people stood up while applauding Bush\u2019s answers. When he first stepped on stage, a woman from the crowd yelled out: \u201cWe love you, Jeb!\u201d She was followed by a man across the room: \u201cAnd your brother!\u201d \u201cAnd my mother,\u201d Bush added. As he was shaking hands afterward, he was swarmed by voters, with many of them telling him to hang in there. \u201cDon\u2019t give up,\u201d one voter pleaded with Bush. \u201cWe are for you. Don\u2019t give up.\u201d Another told Bush that his weight loss \u2013 he\u2019s dropped more than 40 pounds in the past year due to his the paleo diet \u2013 was looking good on him. \u201cI\u2019m svelte,\u201d Bush replied, with a stride in his step. \u201cI\u2019m a fighting machine.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly stated that South Carolina shares a border with Florida. It does not.",

            "article_content": "McConnell to CNN on Iran accord: 'It's an agreement between Barack Obama and the Iranian regime' McConnell: 'We will not' shut down the government Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged Friday that the battle over the Iran nuclear deal may now have to wait until the next president takes office, even as he vowed to tee up another vote on the issue to show that a bipartisan majority in Congress disdains the accord. In a wide-ranging interview with CNN, the Kentucky Republican said that he would hold another vote to reject the Iran nuclear agreement next week to send a message to the White House that lawmakers in both parties oppose the nuclear agreement. Four Democrats joined every Senate Republican in opposing the Iran deal on Thursday, but that wasn\u2019t enough to overcome a filibuster mounted by other Democrats. If the votes don\u2019t change next week, McConnell said that \u201cthis vote stands\u201d and will now be \u201ca defining issue\u201d in the 2016 elections. \u201cIt\u2019s an agreement between Barack Obama and the Iranian regime,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnd it will be reviewed again in a year and a half from now. It doesn\u2019t have the force of law that a treaty would\u2019ve had. So his deal is a unilateral deal with Iran is something that he can try to implement over the next year and a half. And if the next president wants to take a look at it, (he or she) is free to do it.\u201d READ: How the White House kept Democrats from killing the Iran deal While McConnell added that \u201cit would be great for the House to take him to court\u201d on the matter, as some conservatives are demanding, he added: \u201cI\u2019m a little skeptical that some judge is going to referee this dispute between the administration and us.\u201d McConnell\u2019s comments come as Republican leaders in Congress are struggling to handle a number of hot-button issues, namely how to fund the government at month\u2019s end and lift the national debt ceiling. He suggested that the October fight over the debt ceiling would be time for a major fiscal negotiation between himself, Obama and House Speaker John Boehner. McConnell promised there would be no government shutdown at the end of September, arguing that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s insistence that a must-pass funding bill should prohibit taxpayer dollars from flowing to Planned Parenthood won\u2019t fly. Democrats have vowed to block such a plan in the Senate. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t produce the result that Sen. Cruz and I would both like to produce,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cSo therefore, it would be an exercise in futility.\u201d \u201cYou could shut down the government and that will not defund Planned Parenthood,\u201d McConnell added. \u201cSo that is a strategy that will not lead to a result that I would like. Shutting down the government is something the American people overwhelmingly oppose, and we will not be doing that.\u201d READ: McConnell aims to split abortion from shutdown debate In the interview, McConnell refused to get roped into presidential politics, even as he reiterated his support for Sen. Rand Paul, a fellow Kentuckian. He did, however, acknowledge that Donald Trump gave money to his past re-election campaign. \u201cHe supported \u2013 contributed \u2013 to my campaign last year,\u201d McConnell said with a smirk. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d Sitting in the Strom Thurmond room of the Capitol, McConnell blamed the White House for contributing to the chaos in Syria that has prompted a growing refugee crisis in Europe. \u201cI think we have an obligation to take some number of refugees,\u201d McConnell said, refusing to specify an amount. \u201cWe\u2019ve done that in these situations in the past. It is important to remember why this is all happening, because the President is falling behind, leading from behind. The Middle East is in turmoil. And our policy of talking to our enemies and leaving our friends behind has contributed to all of this meltdown.\u201d Even as he was criticizing the President\u2019s foreign policy, he refused to criticize the administration for its handling of its controversial drone program in light of the accidental killing of two hostages in January, including American doctor Warren Weinstein. \u201cWell you know, mistakes are made in warfare,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThe drone is another weapon. It\u2019s used obviously to try and minimize collateral damage. Americans like minimizing collateral damage. I think it\u2019s a part of our toolbox that we should use against terrorists. I think there is plenty of oversight and we are always going to look when mistakes are made. I think it\u2019s appropriate for Congress to take a look at it.\u201d McConnell, 73, who won re-election for a sixth term last year, is entering a critical moment of his nine-month tenure as majority leader. He has to iron out differences with the House on highway funding, his party is divided over the controversial Export-Import Bank, and government funding continues to be a major source of concern. But even if Congress passes a short-term stop-gap measure this month to keep the government afloat until the winter, he will have to find a bipartisan accord for a longer-term spending bill \u2013 and raise the national debt ceiling. McConnell said the White House would need to negotiate a deal with GOP leaders to avoid a fiscal mess. \u201cWe are going to have to have a negotiation about how much we are going to spend in discretionary accounts of the government this year. And all of that will commence sometime after this fiscal year,\u201d McConnell said on the debt ceiling. \u201cI think the Speaker and myself and the White House are going to have to discuss how to resolve our differences.\u201d",

He served in the Reagan administration in posts including assistant counsel in the White House and special assistant to two attorneys general. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Hugh Hewitt: The Paris attacks immediately altered the tone of the campaign Soon a key challenge will face the GOP candidates -- getting voters to turn out and support them, he says Even as the campaign for the White House shifted on its axis after the atrocities in Paris and again following the president\u2019s tantrum in Turkey \u2013 his defenders are using the last refuge of the desperate by claiming the President\u2019s scornful mocking of slogans about \u201cAmerica leading\u201d or \u201cAmerica winning\u201d were taken out of context \u2013 the basic realities of the campaign remain fixed. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. And no one knows who will carry the GOP standard. After interviews on my radio show with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina and Sen. Lindsey Graham during or since the Paris attacks, the conversation has of course been about the security of Americans and the world in the face of an ISIS threat the President declared \u201ccontained\u201d the morning of the Paris slaughter. The Republicans all called on the President to rethink the expanded admission of Syrian refugees. Christie resisted the emotional appeal of orphaned children and bluntly stated that he opposed admission of any Syrian refugees whatsoever because the President\u2019s and his administration\u2019s record is so awful in following through on any program. Hard to argue with Christie, given the IRS, VA and Edward Snowden scandals. Even as they push for the public\u2019s attention and agreement in every setting, however, each of many GOP campaigns has to find and turn out actual voters. Opinion: In 2016 race, voters still shopping for a candidate to love In particular, they have to find weekly churchgoers, the most reliable of all Republican primary voters, and not just in Iowa and New Hampshire, but across all the states in the \u201cSEC primary\u201d on March 1 and the first day of \u201cwinner-take-all primaries\u201d on March 15.  How to find these specific people? My longtime friend Jonathan Bock in Los Angeles, whose Grace Hill Media has been successfully marketing big studio releases to Christian churches and audiences for two decades, has just launched an intriguing new technology that goes far beyond generating a mailing list of people who tell pollsters they attend church. Some Florida Jewish voters sour on Hillary Clinton His Christians in Churches (CiC) platform is a mobile advertising technology that he says is able to create exquisitely precise audiences based on their physical attendance at one of 300,000-plus churches around the country. \u201cCould your technology work for campaigns?\u201d I asked him. \u201cCould you find my Presbyterians \u2013 PCA not PCUSA \u2013 in Florida who are there every week, or Catholics who attend Mass every Sunday (or Saturday night) in Manchester?\u201d Of course, he replied. And, Republicans take note, this is not just a technological advancement that can help you. Democrats are not unaware of the developments in microtargeting by faith. Fear and voting on the Christian right The research that went into creating CiC, Bock said, indicates that while 46% of those who attend church at least once a week are registered Republicans, more than a third \u2013 36% \u2013 are Democrats. After the success the Obama campaign had in harnessing digital technology in 2008 and 2012, the Clinton team will also be mining the church attendance data. Election 2016: The perfect candidate So what exactly can CiC do? \u201cBesides church attendance,\u201d Jon explained, \u201cCiC\u2019s technology uses other attributes to hypertarget their audience: like demographics (gender, age), religious denominations, frequency of attendance and other places patronized in the last nine months (restaurants, movie theaters, sports venues, schools, you name it.) Jeb Bush says Dems lure black voters with \u2018free stuff\u2019 \u201cSo for example,\u201d he continued, \u201csuppose you are a political campaign and want to target ads at politically active mothers of young kids in Iowa City who go to a Presbyterian church every week. CiC\u2019s technology can serve that up based on church attendance, weekday proximity to elementary schools (dropping kids off and picking them up at 8 a.m. and 3 p.m.) and these moms\u2019 appearances at campaign rallies over the last few months.\u201d Ben Carson: U.S. shouldn\u2019t elect a Muslim president Of course, there is a website: www.ChristiansInChurches.com.  The vaunted \u201cvoter vaults\u201d of a decade ago are as old as dial-up now. With news cycles shorter than ever, the campaigns that manage their marketing of timely messages to the most reliable voters are going to win the political battles that begin with the Iowa caucus in February. How will evangelicals choose a candidate in 2016? The election changed last Friday, just as sermons did on Sunday and news coverage through today and beyond. But the blocking and tackling of the election didn\u2019t change \u2013the imperative to turn out your likeliest voters. The meta-messaging that candidates have been using on my show and on others, and via speeches, is intended to move a voter towards them. Now their campaigns must touch those voters, tag them, and bag them in February and March. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "CNN commentators weigh in on winner and loser in the second Democratic debate In the aftermath of Paris attacks, all three candidates were a little off their game CNN Opinion asked a range of contributors for their take on the second Democratic presidential debate held at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Who were the winner and loser? The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors. This debate was more difficult for Hillary Clinton than was expected. Though she had opportunities to highlight her extensive experience and leadership skills, she was still thrown on the defense in two pivotal areas. On foreign policy, in the aftermath of Paris, she was forced to defend the record of the Obama administration in Syria and saw how this issue \u2013 foreign policy \u2013 could be turned against her. This, more than the vote in Iraq, will be a challenge. Domestic policy also remained a concern as Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley hit harder in her ties to Wall Street and more centrist views on some economic issues. Clinton still exits from the debate as the most formidable candidate in the group and the one best positioned to defeat the GOP. O\u2019Malley continues to struggle gaining any traction and Sanders still seems too left for the party. But the debate was a warning. It brought out some of the questions that Clinton will face in the coming months. In the coming weeks, she will need to provide stronger answers if she wants a smooth victory in the primaries and the general election. Winner: No clear winner. Loser: Martin O\u2019Malley. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society\u201d and co-editor of a new book, \u201cMedicare and Medicaid at 50: America\u2019s Entitlement Programs in the Age of Affordable Care.\u201d The good news for Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley was that they shared a victory in this debate by criticizing Hillary Clinton directly and to her face, pushing back against the notion that Clinton\u2019s nomination is inevitable. Not if Sanders and O\u2019Malley have anything to say about it. When asked about the role of Wall Street, Sanders, who has criticized the influence of big-money donors in American politics, said Clinton\u2019s many backers from financial corporations are seeking to curry favor with her. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re dumb, and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to get, but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Sanders said of Clinton\u2019s Wall Street donors. \u201cWhy do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows it.\u201d Clinton, clearly stung by the statement, pointed out that Sanders \u201chas basically used his answer to impugn my integrity.\u201d At issue was a call by Sanders and O\u2019Malley to tighten regulatory controls over banking institutions by reviving elements of the now-defunct Glass-Steagall Act. Clinton dismissed her critics: \u201cMy proposal is tougher, more comprehensive and more effective,\u201d she said. But O\u2019Malley called her ideas \u201cweak tea\u201d and the cheers Sanders got by taking her on suggest a sizable portion of Democrats want the next president to control Wall Street rather than the other way around. The Sanders-O\u2019Malley duo also scored points by pushing for a $15 minimum wage, considerably higher than the $12 Clinton advocates. The recent nationwide strikes and demonstrations in favor of a $15 minimum wage \u2013 which translates into an annual full-time salary of $31,000 \u2013 show that Sanders and O\u2019Malley are riding a powerful grassroots wave. If Clinton sticks to her $12 proposal, she should expect more verbal slugfests with her opponents \u2013 and a Democratic base that may jump off the Clinton bandwagon if she doesn\u2019t move in a more liberal direction.

A day after ISIS terrorized Paris in multiple coordinated attacks with guns and suicide bombs, killing over 100 and injuring hundreds more, Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton left doubts she\u2019s up to the task to protect America. In opening questions on foreign policy during the CBS-moderated debate, Clinton danced around her lack of accomplishments as secretary of state under President Barack Obama. When asked about Obama\u2019s Syria policy, Clinton said she disagreed with Obama\u2019s strategy from the start and warned him if the United States didn\u2019t intervene in Syria, our enemies would fill the void. Clinton said the \u201cMiddle East is a complicated region\u201d and \u201cthe arch of instability.\u201d Americans don\u2019t vote for a president to tell them what they already know. Clinton\u2019s textbook responses to foreign policy questions were rote. More disturbing was she couldn\u2019t point to any accomplishments as secretary of state other than advising Obama on Osama bin Laden\u2019s capture. Libya, Syria, Egypt and Russia all fell apart under her tenure. If elected president, Clinton didn\u2019t convince voters she would do anything differently or make America safer, which brings us to terrorism. When asked if she would declare war against Islam like President Francois Hollande has, Clinton replied no. \u201cWe\u2019re not at war with Islam. We\u2019re not at war with Muslims.\u201d  Yet, that\u2019s just the problem. Islam is at war with America and the world and we need a president who will finally acknowledges this, not one who shrinks from this challenge. Obama hasn\u2019t. In an interview with \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that aired the day of the Paris attack, Obama said ISIS had been contained. Over the last four years since the civil war unraveled in Syria, ISIS has taken root there, training Muslims from around the world to be jihadists. France has a large population of Muslim nationals, many of whom have freely entered the country. America, like Germany and France, have welcomed thousands of Syrian refugees. It won\u2019t be long before what happened in Paris makes it\u2019s way to our homeland. During the second Democrat debate, Hillary Clinton revealed her biggest strength may be her biggest weakness \u2013 her foreign policy experience.

You can follow her @GOPBlackChick. On a very tough night to talk politics, it seemed all three candidates were a little off their game. Hillary Clinton was well-positioned coming in to look tough \u2013 and presidential \u2013 on terrorism. But she didn\u2019t anticipate Martin O\u2019Malley lurching to her right. \u201cIt is America\u2019s fight,\u201d he corrected her, \u201cbut not solely America\u2019s fight.\u201d With Bernie Sanders attacking from the left, she was suddenly stuck in the middle, playing defense. On the discussion regarding banks and campaign finance, however, Sanders should have had the natural upper hand, but he couldn\u2019t land a punch. Clinton won the issue in the room. Sanders also might be the first Democrat to acknowledge raising the minimum wage will have some negative repercussions, which I think will come back to haunt him. O\u2019Malley had some blunders as well. He floated a frightening 70% tax rate on the wealthy, unprompted. He walked into a critique from Sanders on the safety of Baltimore, the city he ran as mayor. All told, they each had some unexpected highlights and some surprising misses. When Clinton loses on foreign policy but wins on the banks, you know it\u2019s a weird night. S.E.

Two moments in tonight\u2019s debate clarified why Bernie Sanders won\u2019t assume the role of frontrunner any time soon.  In the first, Sanders reiterated his noble, but politically disastrous, appeal that we all stop talking about Hillary Clinton\u2019s (damn) emails.  It\u2019s the high road, for sure.  But by extricating her from a scandal that had bedeviled her campaign for months, Sanders has ceded the space needed for Clinton to take flight. The second moment illustrates the difficulty Sanders has faced in winning over African Americans.  When asked about Black Lives Matter, Sanders rattled off a bunch of standard statistics about incarceration and unemployment rates. Clinton, by contrast, acknowledged the profound pain that black mothers feel when they lose their children to violence, and she then paid tribute \u2013 by name \u2013 to some of the young men who have lost their lives to police violence. Winner: Hillary Clinton. She came across as shrewd, measured, and worldly.  Nothing about the debate tonight changed the fundamental dynamics of this race. Most improved: Martin O\u2019Malley.  He spoke fluidly and forcefully about all manner of issues. He made a showing tonight; it just won\u2019t make much of a difference. Lastly, a note on format.  With just a handful of Democratic contenders left in the race for president, the conversation in tonight\u2019s debate sank reasonably deep into policy details. The kinds of zingers and gaffes that separate winners from losers on a stage of ten just don\u2019t count for nearly as much on a stage of three.  May the Republicans take notice and winnow their ranks soon. William Howell is the Sydney Stein professor in American politics at the University of Chicago. Once again, Democrats proved that they are the adults in this race by having a civilized, high-minded and respectful debate about the important issues facing our country.  They also demonstrated they are all better equipped to lead the nation going into the 21st century as we face unprecedented threats from abroad and an economy that needs continued Democratic leadership to fully recover and give middle class voters all the tools they need to succeed. There were fireworks as both Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley tried to take the fight to Hillary Clinton, specifically on her Iraq vote and her connections to Wall Street.  She swatted away the criticisms with ease, with facts, and demonstrated she is best suited to lead the country as president and commander in chief. On foreign policy, her knowledge of the issues, her grasp of the nuances involved in global diplomacy and her determination to implement unparalleled American leadership to defeat ISIS and radical extremist jihadists in the Middle East, put her head and shoulders above the rest, both in the Democratic field as well as all Republicans vying for the presidency. On economic and domestic issues, Clinton underscored differences with Sanders and O\u2019Malley, again showing important nuances on positions such as the minimum wage, college affordability and gun control, showing her grasp of details and the \u201cweeds\u201d of these complex issues.  She showed her policies would put middle class families first while ensuring our economy can absorb them without disruption. O\u2019Malley had a great debate, showing his passionate progressive positions, at times taking the critique to both of his opponents, but mostly agreeing with them on key issues.  While his resume is impressive and he has many accomplishments to show as Maryland governor, unfortunately, he was not able to have a sufficient breakout moment that will enable him to climb out of the single digits in the polls. Sanders continued to show his passionate commitment to liberal positions, focusing on climate change and income inequality, both of which are tremendously important to the progressive base.  But his knowledge of foreign policy and issues going on in the Middle East came up wanting and did not inspire broad-based trust needed to be elected as commander In chief. As an issue that is front and center, immigration brought out the best in all of the Democratic candidates \u2013 an easy feat given the contrast with the ridiculous, unworkable, unjust and unelectable positions that are held by most Republicans. Importantly, Clinton was the first one to contrast all the Democrats with the Republicans and was the only one to defend President Obama\u2019s record.  A brilliant and important move to excite and mobilize the Democratic base. Overall, Clinton outshined her Democratic opponents, showing her proposals would pay for the opportunities and the level playing field that would help create more good paying jobs and expand economic growth for those who have been left behind.  And both Sanders and O\u2019Malley took a definitive back seat to Clinton when it came to foreign policy, defense of the homeland and what it takes to confront the challenges we face, tragically demonstrated by last night\u2019s Paris attacks.

New Canadian PM Justin Trudeau says he will end bombing mission against ISIS Expert: Counterterrorism must increasingly make use of \"soft power\" to beat ISIS Lasting solution needs political, economic, social, humanitarian, and diplomatic initiatives The day after Monday\u2019s Canadian federal election, Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister designate, received a congratulatory call from U.S. President Barack Obama. During their conversation, Trudeau told Obama that he was going to keep his promise to the Canadian electorate to end the bombing mission against ISIS in Iraq and Syria initiated by his predecessor, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, late last year. In early October 2014, Parliament approved an initial 6-month bombing campaign that was restricted to Iraq. Both opposition parties, the Liberals and the New Democrats, voted against it, though public opinion was generally favorable. On October 22, 2014, a lone gunman shot dead Corporal Nathan Cirillo while he was on ceremonial sentry duty, guarding the National War Memorial in Ottawa. The gunman then ran to Parliament Hill and entered Centre Block, where he died in a dramatic shootout with police. This attack occurred two days after another man ran down two military officers with his car in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, killing Warrant officer Patrice Vincent. Both attackers turned out to be self-radicalized Muslim converts with troubled pasts and a history of mental illness. In the wake of these two \u201clone wolf\u201d attacks, the Harper government trumpeted the threat of homegrown terrorism, arguing that Canada was directly threatened by the radical ideology of ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Syrian families brace for new round of airstrikes This flew in the face of clear evidence that ISIS was more interested in building a functioning state than attacking the West, that foreign fighters were joining them to aid in this state-building enterprise, and that the vast majority of returnees were not motivated to continue the attack at home. By the spring of 2015, the Harper government had expanded the bombing mission to include Syria, and had introduced draconian anti-terror legislation. Again, public opinion was largely in favor. In August, when Prime Minister Harper called an election, it had already become clear to many Canadians that the Syrian conflict was a quagmire, and that the homegrown threat, though admittedly real, was exaggerated. Justin Trudeau\u2019s campaign promise to end the bombing mission, while continuing to train Iraqis away from the front lines, represented a balanced approach to recognizing the complexity of the Syrian conflict and the limited options available to the West. U.S., allies step up strikes on ISIS While counterterrorism is most often linked with the exercise of \u201chard power\u201d (intelligence, law, policing, and military power), it must increasingly make use of \u201csoft power\u201d (political, social, and economic control, together with broader policy initiatives dealing with the environment, development, critical infrastructure, migration, and humanitarian intervention). The Syrian conflict has its roots in a volatile mix of discriminatory practices by government, widespread corruption, chronic lack of opportunity for young people, lack of essential services, all combined to convince many that there is no alternative other than violent extremism and terrorism. A strictly military approach to such a complex situation is dangerously reductionist. As the great American psychologist, Abraham Maslow, wrote in 1966: \u201cI suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.\u201d The Sunni Arabs of Iraq and Syria support ISIS only because they have no other option in a divided and discriminatory environment where Shia governments favor their own, with support from Iran and Hezbollah, and Kurds enjoy the support of the U.S. and its allies (to Turkey\u2019s great chagrin). Because ISIS is the only Sunni force capable of confronting the Shia forces in both Iraq and Syria, it receives varying degrees of support from neighboring Sunni states, particularly Saudi Arabia. The Syrian conflict is in many ways a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and threatens to become a kind of proxy Cold War between Russia and the U.S. Political, economic, social, humanitarian, and diplomatic initiatives are urgently needed if a long-lasting solution is to be found. With Russia entering the fray on the side of Bashar al-Assad, and supposedly moderate rebels less and less capable of sustained and effective combat, as well as increasing waves of desperate refugees fleeing rapidly escalating violence, with no end in sight, a comprehensive approach is all the more imperative. Justin Trudeau\u2019s decision to end Canada\u2019s participation in the bombing campaign against ISIS is a step in the right direction.",

He\u2019s the author of \u201cAsian Nationalism Since 1945.\u201d The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author. Despite apprehension from his countrymen, Japanese PM forging ahead with nuclear power restarts Safety monitoring framework unsound, says Tokyo-based academic Jeff Kingston Despite a raft of unpopular policies, Abe remains politically secure -- for now Last week, Japan\u2019s government restarted a controversial nuclear reactor, pushing ahead with plans to revive an industry that many Japanese remain critical \u2013 and fearful \u2013 of. Japan\u2019s nuclear safety myth evaporated following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, where a huge earthquake and the subsequent tsunami caused a meltdown in three reactors at the northern Japanese plant. Following the incident, the government, along with the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), lost credibility as claims that they downplayed the severity of the accident, misled the public and left more than 100,000 nuclear refugees stranded in limbo emerged. Japanese citizens remain skeptical about nuclear power after media revelations about the cozy relations between safety watchdog authorities and the utility companies that compromised public safety. Three major investigations into the accident have detailed a series of errors, assumptions and omissions that enabled a culture of complacency to prevail \u2013 safety inspectors are perceived as having deferred to the utilities, averted their eyes from violations and demonstrated an unseemly tolerance for best case scenarios. The utilities are also deemed to have ignored specific recommendations prior to the 2011 accident from safety officials \u2013 a higher seawall, relocation of backup generators to a safer location and more backup electricity sources \u2013 that in retrospect looks very sensible and would probably have ensured that Fukushima did not become Japan\u2019s Chernobyl. READ: Tokyo slams UNESCO in row over Nanjing massacre Japan\u2019s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, is at the heart of the controversy and is often seen as the point man for the \u201cnuclear village,\u201d the name used by Japanese to refer to the pro-nuclear advocates \u2013 from the industry, big business, bureaucracy, politicians, the media and academia alike. It is well represented in the corridors of power,  and Abe has vigorously promoted reactor restarts to cut fuel imports, bolster economic growth and to promote exports of Japanese nuclear knowhow and technology. Restarts are vital to Abe\u2019s hopes of promoting nuclear plant and technology exports as it\u2019s hard to make a sales pitch if the country\u2019s reactors are shut down for safety reasons. As the Sendai nuclear reactor fired up again, Abe was touting Japan\u2019s nuclear safety regulations as the world\u2019s strictest. But such rhetorical grandstanding aside, the staff of the new Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) \u2013 the body now tasked with overseeing safety standards \u2013 is almost entirely culled from the discredited Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency that was supposed to be ensuring compliance with regulations before Fukushima, but failed to do so. READ: Japanese PM\u2019s election gamble puts policies on the line Utilities have spent a lot of money in upgrading safety standards in  terms of hardware such as higher seawalls, better vents and safer remote command centers, but the investigations reveal that poor emergency equipment training was a major factor in the accident, and there was a lack of drills aimed at helping workers cope with managing an accident under stressful conditions. The International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) recently-released postmortem on the Fukushima nuclear accident makes for grim reading, and a timely reminder of the pitfalls of restarting Japan\u2019s nuclear program prematurely. Given that the IAEA was established to promote atomic energy, its harsh assessments are all the more disturbing. The IAEA highlights the need for proper preparation for evacuations, something that is well beyond the capacity of the hosting communities that are responsible for this. Simulations of an evacuation around Sendai illustrate just how hard this will be even under best-case scenarios. The NRA will still rely extensively on plant operators reporting and self-inspections to ensure compliance with regulations. Given that all the utilities operating reactors admitted they faked their repair and maintenance data, why trust them now? So how is Abe able to go ahead with the restarts in the face of majority public opposition? For one thing, he has avoided holding a referendum on an issue he knows he would lose. Instead, he relies on the pro-nuclear NRA to assess applications for restarts \u2013 some 25 have been filed \u2013 and once it gives the green light there is consultation with local hosting communities,  often reliant on the stations for their economies \u2013 to secure final approval. Currently, preparations for restarts are underway in Shikoku Island and also in Fukui Prefecture on the main island of Honshu. So even though only about one quarter of Japanese support restarts and some 60% oppose, the nuclear village is relying on the public growing weary and resigned. Indeed, the media reaction to this most recent restart was fairly muted, a stark contrast to the immediate aftermath of Fukushima. The nuclear village has survived the perfect storm and energy policy is settling back in, with the government officially targeting 22-24% of electricity coming from nuclear energy by 2030. Protesters rally against Japan security bills Abe remains relatively popular \u2013 he boasts a nearly 40% approval rate \u2013 despite the fact that a majority of Japanese oppose every single one of his signature policy initiatives. Few Japanese support the state secrets legislation and the new security laws that lift constitutional constraints on Japan\u2019s military, nor do they support his patriotic education or lifting of the ban on arms exports. But his opposition, feeble and divided, has been unable to take advantage. Among those who support Abe, a majority say it is because there is no alternative, not that they agree with his policy agenda. It\u2019s a situation that could potentially leave him vulnerable, if a credible alternative could be unearthed. READ: Japanese PM Abe scores another own goal on history Now that Abenomics, his signature economic policy, designed to lift Japan out of decades-long doldrums, appears to be fizzling, there is a possibility that the public mood could swing against him before next summer\u2019s parliamentary elections. The opposition has also announced plans to present a much more unified front, eroding a typical advantage enjoyed by Abe\u2019s leading Liberal Democratic Party \u2013 it has typically won elections with support of only about 25% of eligible voters, benefiting from low turnout and a fractured opposition. The massive demonstrations this summer outside the Diet, protesting Abe\u2019s security legislation, have been seen as a barometer of pubic sentiment. At the end of August, the largest demonstration in Tokyo since the turbulent 1960s saw crowds demanding Abe\u2019s resignation, carrying placards depicting him dressed up like Hitler and others mocking him as a puppet of the U.S. But despite an unpopular raft of policies, at the moment it\u2019s Abe\u2019s election to lose. He is shoring up his loyalists in an attempt to retain power, while signaling his intention to remain in power until 2018. That will be the 150th anniversary of the Meiji restoration, the end of the Shogunate and the beginning of Japan\u2019s modernization. But many voters are looking enviously at a much more recent precedent, across the Pacific Ocean to Australia, where it seems so much easier to get rid of unpopular, unwanted leaders.

His latest book, is \u201cTwo Days in June: John F. Kennedy and the 48 Hours that Made History\u201d (Signal/Random House). The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Andrew Cohen: Real story of Conservative government rout in Canada is victorious, underestimated campaign of Justin Trudeau He says Trudeau spells return of Liberal Canada-- more moderate, tolerant--spending on green energy, roads, bridges, urban transit The story of the general election in Canada that catapulted the Liberal Party back into power after its near-death decade in exile is the unlikely story of Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s Prime Minister-elect. The charismatic son of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the iconic leader of Canada from 1968 to 1984, Justin Trudeau spent his first 12 years at 24 Sussex Drive, the official residence of the Prime Minister.  He taught mathematics and English before entering politics and was elected to parliament from Montreal in 2008. Like his father, he skis, boxes and canoes. Now 43, the same age John F. Kennedy became president, he is Canada\u2019s second-youngest prime minister. His astounding success follows the  longest national campaign since 1872 in which Canadians routed the ruling Conservatives, ending a divisive decade in power while embracing a Liberal Party which was thought to be in free fall. For the Conservatives, led by the dour Stephen Harper, it is a stunning rebuke. For the Liberals, led by the sunny Trudeau, it is a stunning reversal. And for Canada, it is a return to a familiar past in politics and personality, after 10 years of a modestly right-of-center government in a modestly left-of-center country. It was anything but a sure thing. At the beginning of the campaign, Trudeau\u2019s popularity was falling. The Conservatives had launched a multimillion-dollar negative advertising campaign that claimed he was \u201cjust not ready.\u201d The point was to portray the youthful Trudeau, who once had an unruly haircut, as an amateur, callow and hollow. While former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney warned his fellow Conservatives not to underestimate him, a senior Conservative said expectations were so low of Trudeau that he would only have to arrive at the first of the leaders\u2019 debates \u201cwith his pants on.\u201d Trudeau not only showed up fully clothed, he excelled in all the debates over the 78-day campaign. Turning the negative ads to his advantage, Trudeau declared in television commercials of his own that he was \u201cnot ready\u201d for another four years of the Conservatives. Nor were Canadians. In defeating the government, they made another Trudeau prime minister, renewing a succession as dynastic as a Bush or Clinton ascending to the presidency. They also returned political power in Canada to an exclusive two-party affair between the Liberals and Conservatives. Canadians rejected a campaign of Conservative fear-mongering, which suggested that Syrian refugees were terrorists, that the wearing of the Niqab by Muslim women was a threat to Canadian values, and that the economy would fall into recession under the Liberals. Canadians ignored that. Instead, decisively and enthusiastically, they returned to a Liberal Canada that promises to be more moderate, confident, tolerant and ambitious. Although polls had shown the Liberals pulling ahead in the last week, few predicted the scale of their victory. It was crushing. They won every seat in the four provinces of Atlantic Canada, more than half the seats in French-speaking Quebec and more than two-thirds of the seats in diverse, industrial Ontario. They won all the northern seats, as well as many in Western Canada, where the Liberals are traditionally weak. In Calgary, the heart of conservative, oil-rich Alberta, they won their first seats since 1968. In British Columbia, on the West Coast, the party won its most seats in 40 years. In Canada\u2019s new Parliament of 338 seats, the Liberals will have 184 seats, the Conservatives 99, the New Democratic Party 44. The rest are divided among the Green Party and the secessionist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. It means the Liberals can govern for four years with a free hand to implement a big agenda on climate change, a commitment to multilateralism and liberal internationalism, tax breaks for the middle class, and a major public works program. As much as the size of the majority, though, is what it represents. In an October moment, Canada has rejected a government led by Harper, a secretive former economist who had united the country\u2019s conservative movement and won three elections since 2006. This time, however, history was against him. No leader has ever won four consecutive elections. Polls said some 70% of Canadians wanted change. But that meant choosing between the New Democrats, a social democratic party that has never held power in Ottawa, and the Liberals, who have governed for most of Canada\u2019s history but suffered their worst defeat in the last election in 2011. As the New Democrats surged early in the campaign, pundits wondered whether the Liberals would survive, should they place third again. But the Liberals outflanked the New Democrats on the left, promising three years of deficit spending on green energy, roads and bridges, and urban transit, while the NDP cautiously promised to balance the budget like the fiscally hawkish Conservatives they had hoped to displace. Looking for an agent of change, progressive voters chose the Liberals, not the New Democrats. That party had hoped to realign national politics, which has always chosen between Liberals and Conservatives, both of them traditionally centrist. Now the New Democrats are in third place, the Conservatives in second, the Liberals in power, led by a man named Trudeau. In Canada, it is back to the future.

            "article_content": "President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address at a turning point in the Civil War Meant to mobilize the nation in a time of crisis, the speech went viral in its day The Gettysburg Address was a quick-hitting speech that was built to last. Length: A little over two minutes. Message: Stay the course of a difficult war. If Democracy won\u2019t work here, it won\u2019t work anywhere. On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln was able to get straight to the point and deliver a punchy speech in part because he came after Edward Everett\u2019s marathon presentation about the war, explains James Cornelius, curator of the Lincoln Collection in the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. Everett had been the main attraction, but Lincoln\u2019s speech started picking up steam afterward and seemed to \u201cgo viral\u201d in the manner of its day. Newspapers wrote about the speech. In some cities, people could buy commemorative event pamphlets that contained the speech, and key phrases were incorporated into Lincoln\u2019s 1864 election posters and memorials after his death. His words are some of the most memorable in American history, forever stamping our collective minds with \u201cfour score and seven years ago,\u201d and \u201call men are created equal,\u201d and of course a \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people.\u201d Here is a nonexhaustive rundown of some of the most popular phrases in the speech, in order of appearance. Pretty much everyone knows this part of the Gettysburg Address, even if they think a score is just something from sports. But no, in this case a score is 20 of something. Here, a span of 20 years. This line is a bit of an inside remark shared with the audience, believed by most historians to be a reference to Psalm 90:10, which most people of the day would know is an allusion to the human lifespan. \u201cThe days of our years are threescore years and 10,\u201d says the psalm. \u201cAnd if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.\u201d Cornelius said Lincoln used such phrasing as a subtle reminder that the nation was only a youthful 87 years old. Lincoln felt the United States was setting an example for the world, and he didn\u2019t want the experiment in democracy to fail. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bit worried that the nation might die at about the average lifespan that a human would,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cHe\u2019s putting forth straightforward political terms in a poetic way.\u201d That, and people tend to remember the beginnings of speeches, Cornelius said. More clever wordplay is at work in this famous quotation. \u201cIn his call for democracy and equality, (Lincoln) doesn\u2019t mention slavery, but everyone knew that was what he was talking about,\u201d Cornelius said. See what he did there? This phrase can be interpreted as both an allusion to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and also as a not-so-subtle jab at the institution of slavery. Little doubt exists that Lincoln opposed slavery, and in fact loathed it, Cornelius said. Slavery was at the heart of the war. Lincoln struggled with how to go about eliminating it, and had to be convinced by legal thinkers and abolitionists that he had the governmental power to tackle it. Lincoln can\u2019t take full credit for this phrase, Cornelius said, because it was a fairly common expression used in the parlance of war. It speaks to a need for soldiers\u2019 deaths to mean something, if they must occur \u2013 a timeless desire we echo today. \u201cThis is always a problem in warfare. Why should any other people die? There is always a percentage of the population that will make that argument at a certain point. Lincoln\u2019s contrary point was that they died defending you. They felt so strongly about the right of the cause. They felt so strongly about preserving the union and ending slavery that you should not let their efforts carry into the wind. You should continue on and further this effort.\u201d For some, this phrase has become a point of political contention due to the presence of the words \u201cunder God.\u201d There are five versions of the speech, and one of them omits those two words. Scholars have spent years reflecting on the intersection of American religion and nationalism. \u201cEvangelical efforts to make America a Christian nation justified territorial expansion, while division over slavery solidified competing visions of Christian nationhood,\u201d said Amanda Porterfield, a professor of religion at Florida State University. This famous phrase is such a beloved word grouping that numerous people have borrowed it, massaged it and restated it with a slightly different twist, like a game of telephone in an era without telephones. Cornelius said historians trace this part back to Daniel Webster, a senator and U.S. secretary of state before the Civil War. Webster\u2019s words were, \u201cThe people\u2019s government, made for the people, made by the people and answerable to the people.\u201d It was later repurposed by the abolitionist minister Theodore Parker, who talked about a \u201cgovernment of all the people, by all the people, for all the people.\u201d Even Lincoln himself is said to have used a version of the phrase in a letter 20 years before the address, Cornelius said. The key to the power of this phrase is in its skillful use of repetition, he said. The point of \u201cpeople\u201d is driven straight into your mind by its frequent mention. That\u2019s why so many people have recycled it over the years. Fast-forward to today, and we\u2019re still talking about all the phrases above. It\u2019s a speech that endures like few others, more than 150 years after the fact.",

            "article_content": "To Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, the real estate mogul-turned-presidential candidate is a refreshing reprieve from politics-as-usual, a man who shuns political correctness and the status quo. To Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican political consultant who has spent the past few months waging war on Trump\u2019s candidacy, The Donald is something else entirely. In Wilson\u2019s words, Trump is a \u201ccancer,\u201d an \u201cepic douche canoe,\u201d  a \u201cstatist\u201d with \u201ca little delicious hint of fascism in the mix\u201d whose presidential nomination will spell apocalypse for the Republican Party. And that\u2019s just the printable stuff. The rise of Trump has many in the Republican establishment screaming that his nomination would spell disaster for the party in 2016. Perhaps the loudest screamer is Wilson. Since Trump took the lead in the Republican presidential primary, Wilson has embarked on a personal and professional crusade to convince conservatives that Trump is not one of them. \u201cHe\u2019s an existential risk, not only to the conservative movement, but to the Republican Party,\u201d Wilson told CNN. \u201cWe have reached a point now where we could abandon or lose limited-government conservatives for a generation if we replace it for this statist nationalism and Trumpism as a doctrine for our party.\u201d His persistent antagonism has made Wilson one of the most vocal anti-Trumpers within the party. But to Trump\u2019s supporters who have encountered him, he represents everything that\u2019s wrong with the party\u2019s establishment wing. READ: Trump: Bush should speak English when in the U.S. They view him as a typical political operative who\u2019s merely doing the bidding of well-connected Republicans like Jeb Bush. (Wilson has not taken a presidential candidate on as a client this cycle, but he has informal ties to Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s networks as a veteran operative in the state.) Wilson, however, lives nowhere near the fever swamps of Washington. Instead, he is about 900 miles south, among the actual swamps of North Florida. Nestled on a green pasture surrounded by marshland filled with alligators and snakes, Wilson resides and works from his home\u2014which doubles as a political war room\u2013 with his family, three dogs, a cat and a small arsenal of carefully stored recreational weaponry. Between conference calls with political campaigns, interviews with reporters and, more recently, bouts of digital strength with Trump supports, Wilson regularly shoots skeet in his backyard with his shotguns or coyotes with his hand-built AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. When he needs to travel for work, he flies his own small plane from a nearby airfield. Wilson got his start in politics in the 1980s as a field director for George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaign. It was there he received a political education from the campaign operation run by the infamous Lee Atwater, a vicious political tactician\u2014many remember him as a notorious dirty trickster\u2014who changed the face of modern politics. Atwater was responsible for the controversial \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad against Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis. There are hints of Atwater in Wilson\u2019s work. Over the past three decades, he\u2019s worked as a GOP ad man. Some of his greatest hits: In 1997, he made an ad for Rudy Giuliani\u2019s mayoral campaign that revolved around sex shops. In 2002, he crafted an ad against former Democratic Sen. Max Cleland that included images of Osama bin Laden to suggest he was undermining the war on terror. And when then-Sen. Barack Obama first ran for president in 2008, Wilson organized a television campaign about his pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. \u201cI love a good negative ad. I\u2019m never going to shy from them,\u201d Wilson told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t take any of the, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re so negative\u2019 stuff to heart. Yeah, you bet. It\u2019s still a tool that works.\u201d With Trump on the rise, he wants to see more Republicans using such tactics against the Republican front-runner\u2014and sooner rather than later. READ: Poll: 82% of Hispanics view Donald Trump unfavorably \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of interest now in making certain that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t lead to the inevitable election of either Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden by a number of interested conservative outside parties,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis has to be like shark attacks. Nip. Nip. Blood. Nip. Blood. Blood. Blood. A feeding frenzy.\u201d He declined to provide specifics about plans from other presidential candidates to go after Trump, but said they were coming. Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has already started releasing videos targeting Trump online, a possible preview for what is to come. Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request to comment for this story. Wilson\u2019s outspoken\u2014and at times indecent \u2014rhetoric aimed toward Trump and his ilk has made him a prime target for the campaign\u2019s defenders, particularly with writers and editors of Breitbart.com, a conservative news site. Breitbart\u2019s writers pounced particularly hard when Wilson referred to Trump supporters as \u201clow information voters.\u201d \u201cRick Wilson has openly and publicly trashed Donald Trump\u2019s supporters. He makes his living as a Republican strategist, but what kind of a strategy is it to call upwards of 25% of Republicans \u2018low information voters\u2019 and nativists?\u201d Breitbart News editor-in-chief Alex Marlow told CNN. \u201cHe knows that if Trump is not the GOP nominee and even a fraction of his supporters stay home on general election day, the Democrats will keep the White House, yet he alienates them anyway.\u201d He also found himself in hot water with parts of the conservative base when he made a vulgar remark on Twitter implying that Trump pays for sex with conservative writer Ann Coulter.  Wilson told CNN that he sometimes goes too far, but declined to say more about it. Coulter did not return a request for comment. But it hasn\u2019t stopped him from pushing the envelope in his quest to keep Trump from becoming the GOP presidential nominee. \u201cDonald Trump is basically conning conservatives. I underestimated how powerfully they want to be conned by this guy,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThey want to be told they\u2019re still going to be loved and respected in the morning. They want the big alpha male to sweep them off their feet and treat them roughly. They want that out of this guy.\u201d For more, watch the video above from Wilson\u2019s home in Tallahassee.

            "article_content": "Here\u2019s one politician who doesn\u2019t need a \u201cScooby\u201d van, a $1 sweater or a Chipotle run to show she gets everyday people. Helping her party win an astounding 56 out of 59 seats in Scotland, the Scottish National Party\u2019s new figurehead, leader Nicola Sturgeon, clearly has the common touch. She has been behind the decimation of the Scottish Labour Party, which finished election night reeling, with one solitary seat in the country. The Liberal Democrats and Conservatives have one apiece, too. Prior to Sturgeon\u2019s elevation to leader \u2013 she stepped up from deputy after last September\u2019s independence referendum ended in a loss for the heavily-pro-independence SNP \u2013 the party had, at its peak, only 11 seats in Westminster. Significant victories this time around include 20-year-old Mhairi Black\u2019s victory over senior Labour politician Douglas Alexander, and the ousting of Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy. While much of the successes this time around are attributed to a resurgence of political activism in Scotland post-referendum, and a dissatisfaction with Labour\u2019s policies, which many in the country feel do not do enough to distinguish the party from the Conservatives, who have been in power since 2010. Ahead of the election, the face of Scotland\u2019s whirlwind political awakening was a revelation, balancing on towering heels as she dived into a crowd of star-struck Scottish voters, high-fiving kids, grabbing babies and posing for five selfies at a time. Her working-class-girl-made-good authenticity is something the American 2016 brigade can only envy amid their awkward efforts to show solidarity with the common man \u2013 Hillary Clinton with her Scooby van for cross-country campaigning, Scott Walker with his parading of a $1 sweater purchase at Kohl\u2019s and Jeb Bush\u2019s boast that he gets in his car to buy his own burritos. Combining the populism of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a hint of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s unsentimental seriousness, Sturgeon might be the planet\u2019s fastest-rising politician. Eight months ago her lifelong dreams of Scottish independence seemed to be dashed when Scotland voted against breaking away from the United Kingdom. RELATED: Why Americans should care about the UK election Friday\u2019s stunning achievement represents a rejection of Labour in the working-class heartland that helped it form multiple governments in the 20th and early 21st century and represents a historic realignment of UK politics. It could also accelerate the resurgent momentum toward another Scottish independence referendum in the years to come. The key to Sturgeon\u2019s success lies in the fact that she\u2019s spent the campaign talking about everything but independence, slamming Conservative austerity and demanding the dismantling of Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal, which she sees as an immoral waste of money. That\u2019s helped her reel in some Scottish voters who are progressive but who do not necessarily support independence. It also helps that she\u2019s still fresh. Sturgeon has only been in office for a matter of months since taking over from Alex Salmond as SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland\u2019s government \u2013 which wields powers devolved from London on education, health, spending and other issues. She\u2019s not yet become isolated from voters or bruised by the tough decisions that governing demands. That makes it easier for her to prove she has not not forgotten where she comes from \u2013 a down-on-its-luck mining area south of Glasgow where her family lived in public housing and where, unlike many top British politicians, she attended a public high school before making it to university. Perhaps because of her current popularity, Sturgeon scorns political rivals who seem scared to confront voters. \u201cThat would drive me potty. It\u2019s the interactions with the public that more than anything else gets you to have an understanding of what folk are actually thinking,\u201d she told the Scotsman newspaper. Sturgeon is the undisputed star of the UK general election campaign. She won rave reviews in a seven-way debate in April when she went head-to-head with UK foes like Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband. In much of the UK, this has been a depressing election campaign, with voters sour on the candidates who would lead them. But in Scotland, politics is raw and vibrant, and in bars, shops and on trains and buses, the word \u201cNicola\u201d is on everyone\u2019s lips, cementing her passage into the pantheon of political fame where first names are enough. It\u2019s quite a transformation for a woman who, despite dedicating her life to the SNP \u2013 she is married to the party\u2019s chief executive and her mother is a local councilor for the party \u2013 did not seem on course to become an overnight sensation. A former lawyer, Sturgeon was once known for not suffering fools gladly and perceived as surly. But her success in picking up her party after the independence defeat and her flair for working a crowd has won her new fans. RELATED: Why British politics are even more dysfunctional than America\u2019s In Motherwell \u2013 where Sturgeon spun cotton candy and rode a carousel on Sunday \u2013 and across Scotland, working class voters are defecting in droves to the SNP. Labour officials openly admit that while they learned the wrong lesson from the referendum by treating it as a victory, the SNP used it as a springboard. \u201cIt\u2019s been a seismic change in Scottish politics in the last number of months,\u201d said Richard Lyle, an SNP member of the Scottish parliament. It\u2019s not that the Scots have rejected Labour\u2019s decades-long prescription of universal health care, workers rights and welfare. They just think the SNP is more likely to deliver it, and they are beginning to view Labour as indistinguishable from the Conservatives who have long been seen in Scotland as most concerned about elite and wealthy voters in London and the south of England. But the SNP resurgence is not universally welcomed. Some Scots worry that nationalist fervor is blinding people to the economic disaster they believe could be triggered by separation from the UK. Others resent the SNP for what they see as an attempt to pose as the sole face of authentic Scottishness. \u201cThey try and conflate the country with the party,\u201d said Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson. RELATED: Cameron, Miliband spar ahead of UK election And sometimes the no-holds-barred politics boils over, as it did on Monday in an ugly scene in central Glasgow ahead of the election, where Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and comedian Eddie Izzard were jostled by fringe nationalists as they tried to hold a rally. The SNP said it had nothing to do with the protest, but that didn\u2019t stop Murphy and Izzard, a transvestite who was wearing heels and a suit skirt and who has more than three million followers on Twitter, from making a political point. \u201cOur streets don\u2019t belong to nationalism, they belong to the people,\u201d Murphy told CNN. Izzard added: \u201cI think it\u2019s sad that the Scottish National Party will not let democratic voices be heard \u2026 they are scared of that.\u201d People frequently talk about how differences on independence have strained friendships and even family relationships. Despite the SNP surge on Thursday, it\u2019s not yet a given that it will indeed result in another independence referendum. The Scottish parliament would have to approve such a step before the details could be negotiated with the London UK government. And Sturgeon must first preserve her pro-independence majority in the Scottish legislature in 2016 elections, whose outcome can\u2019t be predicted this far ahead. Labour officials, meanwhile, hope Scots will begin more critically judging the SNP record in government, which is far from an unqualified success. Scotland\u2019s rejection of independence last year was not the end of anything. It just opened a new phase, manifest in this week\u2019s spectacular SNP gains, in an intense political drama that could reshape the United Kingdom.",

            "article_content": "Romney feels vindication over 2012 campaign Warned Russia was a threat and of chaos in the Middle East But Romney underestimated the pace of economy recovery Mitt Romney is eyeing another shot at the White House, but many Republicans, including those who admire and respect the party\u2019s most recent nominee, are wondering exactly what rationale he has for mounting another campaign in 2016. After all, in 2012 Romney lost all but one of the battleground states, trailed President Barack Obama 332-206 in electoral votes and Republicans panned his gaffe-prone campaign, chaotic convention and creaky tech operation. One working theory behind Romney 3.0 \u2013 he thinks he got it right on the big issues that decided the last election and that voters have got buyers remorse. \u201cHe is been proven right on so many of the issues, certainly domestic policy but (also) foreign policy. He almost looked prophetic there talking about Russia and talking about the war on terror,\u201d said Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. Aides have told reporters, including CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger, that Romney sees vindication in a world tipping into chaos and an economic recovery that left the middle class behind. At the GOP\u2019s winter meeting in San Diego on Friday, Romney said he has given \u201cserious consideration\u201d to a new run for the presidency, and his lacerating criticism of Obama suggested he believes he has earned his chance. So how do Romney\u2019s critiques and promises stand up as he yet again sets foot on the road to the White House? What if Romney runs again? Foreign policy Romney\u2019s best case for proving he was right may lie overseas. Not even the most committed Obama supporter could convincingly argue that the world is more stable than in 2012. It\u2019s only two years since the President brandished his own first term record of ending wars and killing Osama bin Laden to pound Romney as heir to a disastrous Republican foreign policy legacy. But assumptions underpinning Obama\u2019s statesmanship have started to fray. The rise of ISIS has raised questions about his decision to pull all troops out of Iraq and his reluctance to plunge into Syria\u2019s civil war. The standoff with Vladimir Putin has left his \u201creset\u201d of relations with Russia looking naive. \u201cThe results of the Hillary Clinton/Barack Obama foreign policy have been devastating,\u201d Romney said Friday, arguing that terrorist attacks in places like France and Nigeria proved \u201cthe world is not safer.\u201d Obama responds to Romney's possible 2016 run As he watched crises consume Obama\u2019s foreign policy last year, Romney penned an \u2018I told you so\u2019 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal entitled \u201cThe Price of Failed Leadership.\u201d \u201cAble leaders anticipate events, prepare for them, and act in time to shape them,\u201d Romney wrote. \u201cSome simply cannot envision the future and are thus unpleasantly surprised when it arrives. Some simply hope for the best. Others succumb to analysis paralysis, weighing trends and forecasts and choices beyond the time of opportunity.\u201d Many Romney aides believe Russia proves his point. Romney: Obama's failed Russian diplomacy In the 2012 campaign, long before Putin annexed Crimea, the Republican said that Russia \u201cis without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.\u201d Obama reacted with derision. \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War\u2019s been over for 20 years,\u201d he crowed in the third presidential debate. But time hasn\u2019t been kind to that zinger. While there is a debate whether Washington and Russia are really locked in a true Cold War, the Kremlin is doing a passable imitation of the Soviet Union. Russian aircraft are buzzing NATO planes in Europe and Russia stands accused of incursions in Ukraine. Moscow rewrote the borders of Europe by biting off Crimea and Putin warns the West wants to \u201cchain\u201d the Russian bear. While Romney predicted Moscow\u2019s belligerence, it\u2019s impossible to know whether tougher U.S. rhetoric would have changed Putin\u2019s calculations \u2013 or antagonized him even more. And the administration argues that far from being the actions of a geopolitical foe, Putin\u2019s nationalism represents the thrashings of a weakened and desperate regime, that hardly poses a threat to the United States. And Obama might have adopted a tougher approach to Russia himself, had he not had to coax along European nations who were more reluctant than Washington to impose sanctions. Some of Romney\u2019s other 2012 foreign policy bets are yet to play out. He said that Iran\u2019s nuclear program is potentially the longest term threat to the United States. \u201cIf we re-elect Barack Obama, Iran will have a nuclear weapon,\u201d he said in a Republican debate in 2011. So far, Iran has not gone nuclear. Obama says an interim deal has frozen Tehran\u2019s atomic advances and a final pact is being sought to stop the Islamic Republic short of the bomb. On Iraq, Romney hammered Obama in 2012 for not reaching a deal with Baghdad to leave a residual force behind after the war. Obama pounced, saying that meant his opponent wanted to keep U.S. troops in the country. Two years on the tables have turned and Obama has dispatched up to 3,000 troops to train Iraqi forces to take on ISIS \u2013 though the administration insists that they will not be doing any fighting. Romney was also spot on when he warned the next few years would bring more \u201cchaos and tumult\u201d in the Middle East and that \u201cjihadists\u201d would continue to spread. But given the region\u2019s agonized history, it hardly takes a strategic genius to make such a prediction. The economy Romney argued in 2012 that Obama\u2019s economic policy led to an anemic recovery from the worst recession in 70 years. He complained Obama broke his promise to cut the budget deficit in half and cited Congressional Budget Office (CBO) figures projecting trillion dollar deficits for four years following 2014. While Romney was wrong about that, the latest CBO estimates do offer some support to his wider point. The nonpartisan body expects the deficit to only be around $500 billion in 2015 but sees a rising trend with trillion dollar deficits in 2022 through 2024 owing to higher health care costs and rising interest payments on federal debt. Romney\u2019s critique of the uneven economic recovery is also accurate. \u201cIf you are elected president, we will continue to see a middle class squeeze with wages going down,\u201d he said in the first debate. He warned that if Obama got four more years in the White House, the national debt would approach $20 trillion. The figure is now $18 trillion. But Romney\u2019s claim the U.S. economy is on \u201cthe road to Greece\u201d was always hyperbole. Romney also underestimated the pace of the recovery. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get a repeat of the last four years,\u201d he said at the second presidential debate. He promised to get unemployment under 6% or lower in his first term. Consider that promise beaten \u2013 by Obama. In December, the jobless number was 5.6%. Romney also promised to create 12 million jobs. In the first two years of Obama\u2019s second term the economy has pumped out 5.2 million jobs and could approach Romney\u2019s target before he leaves office. Last year was America\u2019s top year of job growth since 1999. But Republicans still call this the slowest economic recovery on record. Health care Nowhere was the 2012 debate more intense or more dripping with spin and falsehoods than Obamacare \u2013 on both sides. In almost every campaign rally, Romney claimed the average American family would see health costs rise by $2,500 annually because of the president\u2019s reforms. Statistics don\u2019t yet offer a full picture of Obamacare\u2019s impact on costs \u2013 and the law has so upended the health care industry it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. But a Kaiser Foundation survey found that health care costs for family coverage in employer-sponsored plans rose 3% in 2014, well below Romney\u2019s figure. In the wider marketplace, the picture is complicated because some people who did not have health care before can now get it under Obamacare. Others have chosen better plans now available which may cost more. And some patients who bought Obamacare are now paying less for health care. Total spending for health care in the nation rose 3.6% in 2013, slower than the 4.1% rise the year before, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Growth in private health insurance premiums meanwhile grew at 2.8% in 2013 compared to 4.0% the year before. But Republicans point to extra costs \u2013 claiming for instance that many people now face higher deductables. Romney was correct to say however that millions of Americans would lose their insurance policies under Obamacare, rejecting the president\u2019s health care whopper \u201cIf you like your health plan you can keep your health plan.\u201d But that\u2019s only half the story. While many people lost plans \u2013 some because they did not reach quality thresholds set by Obamacare \u2013 the White House says millions also signed up to new policies. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bear out that claim, finding that in the first half of 2014, 12.2% of Americans had no health insurance, compared to 17.3% the year before.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Ilan Berman is vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington. The views expressed are his own. Turkey held its general election on Sunday Ilan Berman: A major political reconfiguration lies ahead for country Over the weekend, Turkey experienced something resembling an electoral earthquake, with Sunday\u2019s general election yielding an array of unexpected outcomes that suggest a major political reconfiguration lies ahead for the Republic. That has come as something of a surprise. After all, over the past several years, Turkish politics have been nothing if not predictable. Since coming to power in 2002, the country\u2019s ruling Adalet ve Kalk\u0131nma Partisi, or AKP, has systematically consolidated its political control, in the process moving Turkey ever closer to becoming an authoritarian one-party state. As a result, more than a few seasoned observers concluded that this election, like past ones in 2007 and 2011, was destined to be much ado about nothing. They were wrong, and Sunday\u2019s vote instead yielded some surprising and important takeaways: The end of single party rule. Ahead of Sunday\u2019s election, the AKP had high hopes of expanding its dominance still further. In 2011, the party  garnered 327 seats in the country\u2019s 550-member parliament, just three votes shy of having the power to put constitutional changes to a national referendum. The objective was to cross that threshold again (as it had in 2002), and perhaps even to secure the 367 seats needed to make changes to the country\u2019s constitution unilaterally. But the opposite happened. Rather than expanding its electoral footprint, the AKP saw its lead shrink considerably, falling below even the threshold of 270 seats necessary for single party rule. For the first time since taking power 13 years ago, the party needs to build a coalition to govern. And while multiple scenarios are possible, one result is already clear: The AKP will no longer enjoy nearly as much unchecked power to pursue its political initiatives. A rebuke to Erdogan. In many ways, the AKP\u2019s poor showing is the fault of one man: the country\u2019s bombastic, venal president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Over the past several years, Erdogan\u2019s excesses \u2013 from his extravagant lifestyle to his ruthless political tactics to his notoriously thin skin \u2013 have drawn increasingly frequent comparisons with another larger-than-life strongman, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. Sunday\u2019s election was thus at least in part a referendum on Erdogan\u2019s divisive political style. The outcome is a clear signal that, after having a front-row seat to his preferred way of doing business, Turkish voters are not prepared to simply sit back and grant the President even more power for the next four years. Nationalism resurgent? One of the AKP\u2019s most successful political projects of the past decade has been the near-complete evisceration of its opponents. Through trumped-up conspiracy charges, dubious sex scandals and questionable criminal investigations, Erdogan\u2019s government has succeeded in clearing the decks of any real organized political opposition, including the country\u2019s once-powerful nationalist camp. Now, however, there are the early glimmers of what could, over time, turn into a nationalist revival. In Sunday\u2019s election, the Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi, or CHP, Turkey\u2019s most prominent nationalist party, won nearly a quarter of the vote \u2013 roughly the same as its 2011 performance. But the far-right Milliyet\u00e7i Hareket Partisi, or MHP, improved its standing, from just over 14% in 2011 to 16.5% today. In all, the number of seats held in the Turkish parliament by nationalist representatives increased by an appreciable 27 seats. While not a commanding performance, it nevertheless demonstrates growth in popular support for the nationalist forces that had previously been so successfully sidelined by the AKP. More political power for the Kurds. Unquestionably the biggest winner in Sunday\u2019s vote was Turkey\u2019s long-overlooked Kurdish minority. At nearly a fifth of the country\u2019s population of 81.5 million, Kurds represent Turkey\u2019s largest ethnic minority. Yet their political enfranchisement has lagged far behind their numbers, because of both systematic discrimination and longstanding official policy. That state of affairs is now changing. Sunday\u2019s election saw the rise of a new champion of Kurdish identity, the Halklar\u0131n Demokratik Partisi, or HDP. Ahead of the vote, the political debate centered on whether the fledgling party, which is only 3 years old, could manage to crest the 10% electoral threshold for representation in the country\u2019s parliament. But the HDP did much better than that. The 13% of the vote it secured assures the party of a place in the Turkish parliament \u2013 and, by extension, a much louder voice for Kurds in national politics. To be sure, not everything has changed. The AKP remains Turkey\u2019s most prominent party, having secured over 40% of the national vote. That in and of itself is a political mandate, as Erdogan and his followers will surely claim in the days ahead. Nevertheless, it\u2019s the weakest one they have ever enjoyed. Turkey\u2019s electorate, in other words, has spoken. Only time will tell whether the AKP is listening. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Political survival has been maxim of Netanyahu's domestic and foreign policies, says Andreas Krieg Krieg: Netanyahu's foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the peace process has been disaster New term for Netanyahu will not be in national interest of Israel, it will serve Palestinian interests, Krieg adds Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s recent speech to the U.S. Congress has received disproportionate media attention across the world: the leader of America\u2019s most important client state in the Middle East defies the reservations of the White House, abusing Congress as a platform for his Israeli election campaign. Disregarding Israel\u2019s already strained bilateral relations with the United States, Netanyahu readily risked the consequences of humiliating the Obama administration in exchange for less than an hour of political self-manifestation \u2013 typical for a man who is domestically known to be not much of a statesman. Netanyahu is a charismatic speaker and a passionate Israel-advocate, however, his personal and political interests have always taken precedence over serving Israel\u2019s national interests. Political survival has been the maxim of his domestic and foreign policies. Netanyahu joins a long list of Israeli politicians overwhelmed by the plurality and polarization of domestic public opinion. So far he has been just another Israeli leader seeking \u201ceasy\u201d short-term answers to fundamentally strategic problems, thereby further protracting an already protracted conflict. As a puppet of ideological, conservative playmakers who whole-heartedly reject a two-state solution, Netanyahu has been held hostage by the likes of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Economy Minister Naftali Bennett who pursue a discriminatory policy of sectarian segregation intending to contain Palestinian public dissidence through mere coercion. Consequently, Netanyahu\u2019s foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the peace process has been a disaster. He took over from Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni \u2013 two politicians who at least believed in a two-state solution and were ready to make sacrifices to keep the peace process alive. Israeli leaders typically fall into two categories: those who believe in peace and those that have the power to make peace. Olmert was the former, and Netanyahu long seemed like he could become the latter. In reality, however, Netanyahu is neither. He has given in to a toxic form of Jewish nationalism, disregarded Israel\u2019s relatively good regional position vis-\u00e0-vis its otherwise-occupied Arab neighbors; he has continued to build settlements out of spite, thought of ever new preconditions for bilateral negotiations with the Palestinians and waged a ruthless war against Gaza without a clear strategic endgame \u2013 a war that was lost militarily and in terms of international reputation. How will Israeli-Arab impact the upcoming elections? Apart from the tragic effects of Netanyahu\u2019s policy on the peace process, his stubbornness has alienated allies in Europe and Washington. While the Arab world has been widely apathetic about the Israel-Palestinian issue amid regional disintegration, partners on both sides of the Atlantic have tried to facilitate the revitalization of constructive peace talks. Yet, Netanyahu chose to ignore external initiatives, retracting to a Jewish nationalist rhetoric founded on security paranoia, self-victimization and the illusion of Israeli autarky in security and defense. As a consequence, Israel\u2019s foreign relations with its most important strategic partners have noticeably cooled. Obama\u2019s Middle Eastern focus has shifted from the Israel/Palestinian issue to a rapprochement with Iran.  European lawmakers are considering recognizing Palestinian statehood despite Israeli objections. More importantly, many traditionally pro-Israel Western publics have turned their back on the Jewish state. Younger generations in particular refuse to accept the narrative that shaped their parental generation: Israel as the David in a fight against Goliath. Israel\u2019s monopoly on victimhood has been undermined by an inflexible, uncompromising short-minded policy towards a Palestinian people under occupation whose narrative of victimhood increasingly finds attentive ears in the West. At first sight, then, the prospect of four more years of Netanyahu, does not sound too promising \u2013 at least in regards to the peace process. At a closer look, however, a continuation of Netanyahu\u2019s policies might actually help the Palestinian cause. His implicit rejection of the two-state solution; his prioritization of short-term security over sustainable security solutions; his pursuit of a toxic Jewish nationalist agenda justifying an intensification of sectarianism between Israel and the Occupied Territories as well as within Israel, are all factors that will leave Israel increasingly isolated. His Israel-first narrative might win Netanyahu votes within a highly polarized electorate that in recent years has become more and more right-wing amid a top-down constructed climate of fear. Hamas\u2019 and Hezbollah\u2019s mid-tech missile capability, Syria\u2019s socio-political disintegration and subsequent rise of Islamist non-state actors, have been used by the Netanyahu government to create an Arab bogyman ostensibly threatening the Jewish state\u2019s very existence \u2013 a new bogyman coexisting side-by-side with Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cfavorite\u201d bogeyman, Iran. Despite Netanyahu\u2019s pre-occupation with security, the derailment of the peace process has not been much of a topic during the campaign so far. If Netanyahu receives another mandate on Tuesday, Israel will be further driven into the international offside, pressure from the West will increase and thereby the Palestinian cause will receive ever more attention and support from policymakers and publics across the world. Netanyahu has become somewhat of a villain in the West \u2013 an untrustworthy, short-sighted politician who in comparison to his counterparts in Ramallah appears to lack the willingness to compromise, cooperate and empathize. Thus, while another term of Bibi will not be in the national interest of Israel, it will very likely serve the Palestinian interests.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Shooting suspect posted many right-wing opinions on the web, Southern Poverty Law Center says John Russell Houser flew swastika flag outside his tavern after losing his liquor license, public records show Wife and others sought 2008 protective order against Houser, court documents show John Russell \u201cRusty\u201d Houser \u2013 the gunman in Thursday\u2019s movie theater shooting \u2013 quietly arrived in Lafayette, Louisiana, this month, a 59-year-old man with a string of arrests and a record of \u201cextreme erratic behavior,\u201d according to court documents. He\u2019d been evicted from his house the previous year. He also left an online record of far-right, anti-government ideas that alarmed the Southern Poverty Law Center. Houser praised Hitler for his \u201cpragmatism\u201d and lauded former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and the Westboro Baptist Church, among others, the SPLC website said. The SPLC website posting on Houser included chilling words he supposedly wrote on a forum about a Greek neo-Nazi party: \u201cI do not want to discourage the last hope for the best, but you must realize the power of the lone wolf, is the power that come forth in ALL situations.\u201d CNN could not independently confirm that Houser posted these opinions. There was another side to Houser. He earned a law degree, operated taverns, ran for public office and loved political debate. He was something of a public figure in his hometown of Columbus, Georgia. His brother, Rem Houser, told CNN on Friday he and John Houser were not close. He last  talked to his brother about a month ago. \u201cHe just needed some money to continue moving on, living, surviving, so we gave him some, and that was the last we heard of him. We hadn\u2019t heard of him in probably 10 years prior to that, and hadn\u2019t heard from him since,\u201d Rem Houser said. John Houser spent much of his life in towns along the Georgia-Alabama state line. He grew up in a political family in Columbus but also had owned a house across the border in Phenix City, Alabama. He left a trail of erratic behavior. His last known major legal problem came last year when he was evicted from the house he owned in Phenix City. Heath Taylor, sheriff of Russell County, said Houser returned to the house and vandalized it by pouring concrete down the plumbing and tampering with the natural gas lines, including the one that ran to a fireplace inside. \u201cIf you\u2019d turned it on it would have blown [flames] out,\u201d Taylor said. He was arrested on arson charges in the 1980s when he was accused of hiring a man to set fire to office of a lawyer who represented pornographic movie theaters, according to the Ledger-Enquirer newspaper in Columbus. The man was a police informant who turned in Houser, the paper said. It\u2019s unclear whether Houser was prosecuted. In 2001, he lost his liquor license for Rusty\u2019s Pub in LaGrange, Georgia, for serving minors, according to public documents from the city. In response, Houser hanged a flag with a swastika approximately the size of a bed sheet on the building where the pub operated, according to a local law enforcement official. According to the official, Houser indicated it was in response to his belief that law enforcement, the city and the courts were behaving as if they were a Nazi regime. \u201cThe people who used it \u2013 the Nazis \u2013 they did what they damn well pleased,\u201d Houser was quoted as saying in the LaGrange Daily News. Houser kept the flag, which could be seen on one of the main streets in the city, on the building for several weeks. He was arrested on allegations of public drunkenness and public intoxication outside Rusty\u2019s Pub in 1999, city documents said, but it\u2019s unknown whether he was prosecuted. In 2001, he was charged with probation violation in LaGrange. Houser had a string of minor arrests, too. In Columbus alone he was arrested about 15 times between 1996 and 2011 on minor charges, such as no proof of auto insurance, no state tag, speeding and not having a business license, according to city police documents. It all seems so distant from the Rusty Houser of earlier years, the one who seems to be portrayed in a profile on the professional networking site LinkedIn, the one who graduated from law school and who, according to the LinkedIn profile, owned restaurants and invested in real estate and hung out his shingle as a financial adviser. He listed his skills as financial analysis, market forecast, public speaking and \u201cGod\u2019s business.\u201d \u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d the owner of that LinkedIn profile wrote, \u201cto assist you in financial matters or things more important.\u201d Houser graduated from Faulkner Law School in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1998, the university said Friday. It\u2019s not known whether he ever took the bar exam or practiced law. His name does not appear in a search of the Alabama State Bar. According to the LinkedIn profile of a man with the same name and hometown and educational details of the shooting suspect, he\u2019d previously graduated from Columbus State University, in his hometown of Columbus, in 1988 with a degree in accounting. At age 23, according to the profile, Houser owned a bar in Columbus called the Peachtree Pub, before selling it in 1980. He became involved in local politics, according to the Ledger-Enquirer. Houser worked with others to defeat a school bond referendum and later ran for city tax commissioner \u2013 the same post his father had held. But the younger Houser was accused of stealing an opponent\u2019s yard signs and withdrew from the election, the newspaper reported. Former Columbus Mayor Bobby Peters told CNN that Houser was something of an articulate gadfly, always jumping into a local issue with passion. He often appeared on talk shows. \u201cHe thought government was always operating behind the scenes and was not doing what we should be doing,\u201d Peters aid. \u201cHe was always challenging officials. \u2026 He seemed to be wanting to be the voice for the citizens, the champion of the cause.\u201d Peters said Houser\u2019s life seemed to go downhill beginning in 2002. That would have been after losing the liquor license at his tavern. \u201cIf you look at the whole pattern he had all these dreams and they kept falling apart and it comes to a situation like this,\u201d Peters said. The LinkedIn resume has a big gap until Houser again lists himself as the owner of the bar in LaGrange. \u201cIn a small town one in the entertainment business had better be in with all crowds,\u201d his profile reads. \u201cWe successfully provided entertainment for all while maintaining an atmosphere worth a regular visit.\u201d Another six-year gap is followed a brief dalliance in real estate investment in 2006. By 2008, it was clear that things were not going well for Houser. That\u2019s when his wife, daughter, her fianc\u00e9 and his parents sought a protective order in Georgia, saying they were worried about his \u201cextreme erratic behavior\u201d and \u201cominous as well as disturbing statements\u201d that his daughter\u2019s impending marriage would not happen. A day after one particularly jarring incident in April of that year \u2013 he\u2019d shown up at his daughter\u2019s work and then gone to the home of his wife\u2019s aunt and made threats there \u2013 they obtained an order involuntarily committing him \u201cbecause he was a danger to himself and others,\u201d according to the court filing. Houser\u2019s wife was so worried about his mental state she had removed all guns and weapons from their home, the documents said. According to the filing, Houser said he\u2019d continue his \u201cerratic as well as threatening behavior\u201d once he got out of the hospital in an effort to stop his daughter\u2019s marriage. Houser popped up a few times in the years since. He appears to have posted hundreds of messages on political forums espousing anti-government and anti-media views as recently as 2013. The Southern Poverty Law Center considered some of his online postings racist. \u201cHe promoted the disproven racist theory that a connection exists between race and IQ,\u201d the SPLC website said. Houser had a few interactions with authorities in Russell County, including a request for a permit to carry a concealed weapon that was denied because of the arson arrest and a 2005 domestic violence complaint that was never prosecuted,  Sheriff Taylor said. But none of the issues foreshadowed Thursday\u2019s violent outburst. \u201cHe has been a complainant on a few things and had a few traffic tickets, and that\u2019s all I have about him,\u201d Taylor said. In February 2014, Houser legally purchased a handgun from a pawn shop in Phenix City, said police in Lafayette. It was the gun he used in the theater shooting. Drew Griffin, a senior investigative correspondent for CNN, said law enforcement didn\u2019t necessarily drop the ball because Houser apparently didn\u2019t have any convictions for serious crimes. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t show up on any of the instant background checks,\u201d Griffin said. Movie theater shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana Houser arrived in Lafayette in early July, taking up residence at a Motel 6, said Jim Craft, the Louisiana city\u2019s police chief. Why Houser chose the city or what he was doing there remains a mystery. The only known link he had to Lafayette was an uncle who once lived there, but he died 35 years ago, police said. There\u2019s some indication Houser was trying to turn things around, Louisiana State Police Col. Michael Edmonson told reporters. \u201cHis mom had loaned him some money. He was going to get his life together,\u201d Edmonson said. Craft said Houser had talked to local businessmen about opening an oil-change shop. Jindal: \u2018We will get through this\u2019 Then came Thursday night. Police said Houser had swapped the license tag on his blue 1995 Lincoln Continental and parked it near the theater exit to the Grand Theatre 16, ready for a quick escape. He might have been drinking, Craft said, but there\u2019s no evidence of drug use. Amy Schumer reacts to movie theater shooting Houser bought a ticket to the show just like everyone else, filed in and sat down. After the movie began, he stood up and began firing, police say. He apparently tried to make his way out of the theater along with the people he\u2019d just been shooting at, then saw police swarming in, Craft said. Houser then reloaded his .40-caliber handgun, returned to the theater and shot himself in the head as police pushed toward him. Mindful of possible booby traps such as those set by Aurora, Colorado, theater shooter James Holmes three years ago, police blew out the windows of Houser\u2019s car and used a robot to blow open the trunk. While initially suspicious of some of the things they found inside, they found no explosives, authorities said. Searching his hotel room, they found wigs and glasses \u2013 \u201cdisguises, basically\u201d \u2013 leaving police yet one more thing to figure out.

A most profound service: Five days ago, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church was filled with horror after a gunman opened fire, killing nine members. On Sunday, the historic South Carolina church was filled not just with grief, but with faith and gratitude as worshipers united for their first service since the massacre. \u201cThe doors of the church are open,\u201d the Rev.

Monday marks day 17 of the search for Richard Matt and David Sweat, who have eluded authorities since carving their way out of a maximum-security prison on June 6. Over the weekend, witnesses reported seeing two suspicious men in Allegany County, near the Pennsylvania border, but police said the search of that area wrapped up late Sunday. How did he get the gun? The man accused of killing a New Orleans police officer Saturday apparently had access to two guns at the time of the shooting \u2013 even though he had been searched, handcuffed and placed in the backseat of a squad car, police said.

It\u2019s Wednesday and here are the 5 things to know for your New Day. Suspended: The Kappa Delta Rho fraternity at Penn State has been suspended for a year after members allegedly posted compromising photos of women on a private Facebook page. Many of the women are nude in the photos and were either asleep or passed out. Campus police are investigating but haven\u2019t ID\u2019d any suspects yet because the Facebook pages were, according to police, \u201csanitized\u201d and \u201cwiped clean.\u201d Just last week a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma was shut down after members were caught on video singing a chant with racial slurs. Too close: Will Benjamin Netanyahu keep his job as Prime Minister of Israel? He says he will, but exit polls released last night from Israeli media say the election is officially too close to call. Netanyahu declared victory, but his closest challenger \u2013 Isaac Herzog \u2013 said that the Prime Minister\u2019s celebration was \u201cpremature.\u201d Official results are not expected for a week. Efforts to create a coalition government will take even longer. Home search: An eventful four days for Robert Durst. On Saturday he was arrested. On Sunday HBO aired a documentary where it appears he confesses to murder. On Monday he was charged with first-degree murder. On Tuesday, the drama hit home. Police raided the millionaire real estate heir\u2019s Houston condo yesterday, but it\u2019s not yet known exactly what they were looking for. Durst\u2019s lawyer called the search \u201cridiculous,\u201d while Durst himself remained jailed in New Orleans on drug and weapons charges. A new recruit?: Did a U.S. Air Force vet really fly to Turkey to try and join ISIS? That\u2019s what U.S. authorities alleged yesterday in a two-count indictment against Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh. The former avionics instrument system specialist flew to Turkey on January 10, but was denied entry by Turkish officials, who were certain that Pugh was seeking to cross the border into Syria. When he returned to the United States officials found Internet searches on his computer for crossing points on the Turkish-Syrian border, tampered electronic devices and a letter where he allegedly promised to \u201cdefend the Islamic States.\u201d Pugh\u2019s attorney said he will plead not guilty. Progress reported: A third day of negotiations yesterday in Lausanne, Switzerland, between Iran and six world powers reportedly resulted in the closing of some remaining gaps, but a deal is still a ways off, a U.S. official said. The negotiators are working to beat a deadline at the end of this month to create the framework for a deal and then have until July 1 to finalize it. Although Republicans in Congress have been vocal in expressing their wariness of any deal, a new CNN/ORC poll shows 68% of Americans support direct diplomatic negotiations with Iran.

            "article_content": "New Hampshire voting regions divide into four areas: The Core, The Core Border, The Connecticut River Valley and The North Dante Scala, associate professor at the University of New Hampshire, has studied how the state's population has affected the presidential primary over the decades New Hampshire\u2019s famous first-in-the-nation primary is a little over a month away and the battle to win over voters is on. The race is in flux, especially for Republicans, where establishment candidates such as Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie are battling to leave New Hampshire with a strong showing that will position them to take on front-runner Donald Trump. A Boston Herald survey out December 17 had Trump ahead with 26% of the vote, 14 points ahead of Rubio and Ted Cruz who were tied for second place. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders \u2013 from neighboring Vermont \u2013 is still hoping to give Hillary Clinton a run for her money. The Herald had Sanders ahead of Clinton by two points, within the survey\u2019s margin of error. White House hopefuls including Trump, Clinton, Bush and Kasich are swarming the state this week. And understanding the state\u2019s political geography is key to winning. New Hampshire has changed over the past 12 years from being safely Republican to a swing state, with Democrats winning the last three presidential elections by slim margins. The state is also famous for the large percentage of voters registered as \u201cundeclared\u201d \u2013 these are voters who can vote in either the Republican or Democrat primaries but often lean consistently to one party. Here\u2019s a map to help you get to know the political geography of this tiny state that will play a big role in determining the next president. Dante Scala, associate professor of Political Science at the University of New Hampshire, divides the state up into four major sections. Hillsborough and Rockingham counties stretch along the southern border with Massachusetts and make up a little more than half of the electorate in New Hampshire. The area holds the state\u2019s major cities, such as Manchester and Nashua. Voters in this area are diverse, said Scala, with not just cities but also prosperous suburban towns like Bedford, one of the most Republican areas of the state. \u201cA lot of the growth that you\u2019ve seen in New Hampshire over the past 20, 30 years has occurred in these two counties, which in some ways represent the outer suburban ring of metropolitan Boston,\u201d Scala tells CNN. The region represents the modern base of the Republican party, said Scala, even as many predicted the area would grow less conservative as residents from liberal Massachusetts moved into the southern part of New Hampshire, and it has remained a GOP stronghold. Just north of the Core, Merrimack and Strafford counties include the state capitol of Concord and Durham, home to the University of New Hampshire. Scala said that half a century ago, Merrimack leaned heavily Republican, but with Concord and other prosperous towns growing, it now leans slightly Democratic. Merrimack is home to several bellwether areas such as the town of Bow just outside of Concord. \u201cWhen election night rolls around in a general election how the town of Bow goes, whether it goes to Republicans or Democrats, usually will be a good signal of what kind of night it\u2019s going to be for one major party or the other,\u201d Scala said. Strafford county on the other hand shows contrasting sides of the state. Highly educated Democrats around UNH have made the county strongly Democratic for decades, but north of Durham you\u2019ll find more rural areas sympathetic to Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most interesting counties that no one ever talks about in New Hampshire because it\u2019s got this mix of polar opposites, very strong liberal Democrats and Tea Party Republicans. It should be a place where Donald Trump does well if he\u2019s going to do well anywhere, in working class mill cities like say Rochester and Somersworth,\u201d Scala said. Made of three counties stretching along the Vermont border, Cheshire, Sullivan and Grafton, this region only makes up about one out of six voters in the state but because of its liberal leaning population it has outsized importance. \u201cArguably over the last decade, it\u2019s been more powerful than those two giant counties I mentioned, Hillsborough and Rockingham county put together, and that\u2019s because of how strongly Democratic the Connecticut River Valley has become,\u201d Scala said. The liberal population is fed by the presence of colleges like Dartmouth in Hanover and Keene State College in Keene as well as spill over from the liberal state of Vermont. Scala also said that retirees from liberal leaning states like New Jersey have moved up into the area, at least for the summer and fall, bringing their politics with them. Granite Staters might quibble about what exactly defines the \u201cnorth country,\u201d but it usually includes Belknap, Carroll and Coos counties as well as parts of Grafton. Belknap and Carroll hold the lakes region of the state and the many tourists it attracts, as well as one famous Republican resident. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney owns a house on Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro, a strongly Republican area. Further north into Carroll county is the Maine border and more rural areas that are heavily reliant on a recreational tourist industry, said Scala. The area is Republican but has drifted Democratic over time. The \u201ctrue north\u201d of the region, past Mount Washington, is considered to be Coos county and includes old mill towns like Berlin and Gorham. \u201cEvery presidential candidate worth his or her salt makes that trek way up north,\u201d Scala said. \u201cThey may not visit there often but everyone has to visit there at least once to be considered an authentic New Hampshire campaign.\u201d Coos has suffered the most from the disappearance of the manufacturing industry, said Scala, with significant population loss over the decades.",

It will be his first official visit to the United States since assuming office this fall. \u200e The White House said the visit \u201cis intended to focus on economic, climate, security and border matters.\u201d Obama and Trudeau met \u200efor the first time at a summit of Pacific leaders in November, touting their two nations\u2019 close bonds and reaffirming areas of agreement even amid rifts on issues like energy and the battle against ISIS. Like his predecessor, Trudeau was a proponent of the Keystone XL oil pipeline extension that Obama rejected earlier this year. And he campaigned on a pledge to reduce Canada\u2019s role in the anti-ISIS coalition led by the United States. Those issues aside, Obama regards Trudeau as a like-minded liberal with whom he hopes to foster close ties \u2013 both political and personal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have Justin down to the White House, hopefully, so we can have a more extensive, expanded bilateral,\u201d Obama said after his first meeting with the Canadian prime minister in November. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure Michelle is going to want a visit with Canada\u2019s new First Lady.\u201d Trudeau was similarly effusive about the budding friendship, saying his wife Sophie \u201cis going to be very excited to hear about Michelle\u2019s garden because she has started a vegetable garden as well in our backyard.\u201d In an interview with the New York Times Magazine, Trudeau recalled taking Obama\u2019s congratulatory phone call on the night he was elected earlier this year. \u201cHe said that seeing my family on TV on election night reminded him of his election in 2008 with his family. I\u2019m looking forward to having a beer with him,\u201d he said. \u200e Protocol sticklers will note that Trudeau isn\u2019t his nation\u2019s head-of-state \u2013 Queen Elizabeth II holds that title.

            "article_content": "Obama largely delivered a stay-the-course speech rather than one that heralds significant changes to his anti-terrorism approach It is not just Congress that Obama sees as frustrating his effort to combat ISIS but the realities of the conflict-torn Middle East President Barack Obama\u2019s televised address on ISIS on Sunday night was meant to calm the public\u2019s escalating fears of terrorism, to chide 2016 candidates about explosive rhetoric over waging war and the place of Muslims in society and to defend his own efforts to combat the extremist group. Whether it succeeded on any of those counts may depend where observers sit on the polarized U.S. political spectrum. But while it was largely a stay-the-course speech rather than one that heralds swift or significant changes to the anti-terrorism approach Obama has pursued throughout his presidency, the President did make several proposals and highlight some evolution in how the United States will go after ISIS in Syria and Iraq. He notably put the emphasis on Congress to take action on making it more difficult for terrorists to acquire guns in the United States and to enact changes to visa programs in the wake of the San Bernardino attack. Obama also wants lawmakers to finally put the war against ISIS on firm legal footing. Here is a look at the President\u2019s proposals \u2013 and the chances that they will actually happen. What the President said: \u201cIf Congress believes, as I do, that we are at war with ISIL, it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists.\u201d Its prospects: The United States has spent more than a year pounding ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria from the air. Obama has sent Special Operations forces to Syria and several thousand soldiers are in Iraq. Now, there are plans for the Pentagon to send a specialized expeditionary force to Iraq to target ISIS. But officially, this is an undeclared war. The administration has cited authorizations that permitted both the war in Iraq and the fight against al Qaeda to justify its actions but has repeatedly called on Congress to update its mandate to reflect the new threat from ISIS. But it has not yet happened. Why? READ: Obama: \u2018This was an act of terrorism\u2019 Despite Obama\u2019s comments in his address, the White House is not optimistic that Congress will move soon. The administration introduced its proposal in February, hoping to get a jump on the political season. But like much else touching on the war on terror, the presidential and congressional elections in 2016 are now weighing on lawmakers. Democrats running for re-election are wary of tough votes authorizing a new war that may upset the party\u2019s dovish grass roots. Republicans don\u2019t like the President\u2019s proposal, but they haven\u2019t drafted their own version and punt by saying the administration already claims to have sufficient authority. And there\u2019s a dispute over language. The White House request for an AUMF lasting three years included a provision that prevents \u201cenduring offensive ground combat operations.\u201d Republicans, who want a more robust U.S. effort and are wary of tying the hands of a possible future GOP president, rejected such restrictions. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday that the version of the authorization that the administration sent to Congress earlier this year would \u201climit\u201d the military, so \u201cit would have to be something different.\u201d What the President said: \u201cCongress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun \u2026 this is a matter of national security. We also need to make it harder for people to buy powerful assault weapons like the ones that were used in San Bernardino.\u201d Its prospects: Just as the Newtown massacre and other mass killings did not budge the politics of gun control, the same dynamic applies after San Bernardino \u2013 one reason why Obama is now framing gun control as a matter of \u201cnational security.\u201d Making it more difficult for a potential terrorist to buy a gun, in essence, would entail making it more difficult for everyone to buy a gun. That\u2019s why die-hard Second Amendment supporters in both parties are wary of the idea, with many Republicans and Democrats unenthusiastic about a tough vote on guns in an election year \u2013 especially those from rural districts where gun rights are a potent issue for many voters. In fact, even the day after the San Bernardino killings, the Republican-controlled Senate rejected a bill that would prevent people on a federal terrorism watch list from buying guns. President Obama's full Oval Office address House Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday told the Wisconsin State Journal in an interview that Obama\u2019s no-fly list plan was a \u201cdistraction,\u201d saying many people ended up on such databases erroneously and risked losing their due process rights, a concern echoed by some 2016 GOP hopefuls. McCarthy made it clear Monday that Republicans are not inclined to take up the proposal that the President pushed to deny guns to those on the terror watch list used by airlines. Some congressional Republicans want a judge to weigh in on whether someone should be on the list before his or her constitutional right to bear arms is taken away. Obama\u2019s other gun control efforts have repeatedly hit a brick wall in Congress, and he has frequently expressed frustration at his failure to do more despite ordering a series of executive actions. His efforts to pass an assault weapons ban, for instance, failed in 2013. The White House is preparing an executive order to expand background checks, given its expectation that nothing will make it through legislatively. But White House officials say the legal and administrative challenges are difficult to surmount, and that the order is going to take some time to prepare. And the President has acknowledged that wielding his own executive power cannot be as effective as action from Congress. What the President said: \u201cWe should put in place stronger screening for those who come to America without a visa so that we can take a hard look at whether they\u2019ve traveled to war zones.\u201d Obama also said that he had ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and State to review the visa program under which the female terrorist in San Bernardino originally came to this country as a fiancee of a U.S. citizen. Its prospects: The visa waiver program appears to be one rare area where there is bipartisan agreement on how to act. The Paris attacks especially alarmed U.S. security experts because of the fear that thousands of Europeans have traveled to Syria to fight with ISIS. And if those people have European passports, they don\u2019t need a visa to enter the United States, potentially making it possible for ISIS to easily dispatch operatives into the United States. One measure being considered in the House and likely to get White House support would ensure that nationals of Iraq, Syria, Iran or Sudan, or those who\u2019ve visited those countries since 2011, cannot travel to the United States without a visa. READ: Trump on Obama\u2019s speech: \u2018Is that all there is?\u2019 Instead, individuals from designated countries will have to be vetted through a more rigorous process. It requires countries who participate in the visa waiver program to share counterterrorism information or risk being cut out. And it also enhances screening for criminal activity. The bill is expected to pass with a big bipartisan vote in the House on Tuesday and may be added to broad government spending bills so has a good chance of being signed into law soon. Still, changing the visa waiver program is fraught with diplomatic complications. Visa-free travel to the United States is a prized privilege for many national governments and is strongly supported by the U.S. tourism industry. And changes to the program could also spark reprisals and complications for Americans who travel abroad. What the President said: \u201cWe cannot turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam.\u201d Its prospects: This horse is already out of the barn. Several prominent GOP presidential candidates \u2013 Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, for instance \u2013 have declared that America is facing a civilizational war against radical Islam. They have bashed Democrats like Obama and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton for not using similar terminology, arguing it shows they don\u2019t comprehend the nature of the threat or prefer to avoid offense rather than accurately delineate the enemy. The President and his former secretary of state argue that using such terminology stigmatizes every Muslim and actually plays into ISIS\u2019s hands by making it seem like a legitimate representative of a great faith. This is a dispute that will continue up to the 2016 election and beyond. What the President said: \u201cThe threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it. We will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us.\u201d Its prospects: It is not just Congress that Obama sees as frustrating his effort to combat ISIS. The realities of the conflict-torn Middle East, a region festering with sectarian hatred, geopolitical gambits by major nations and a collapse of the political order that has been in place for a century are posing imposing obstacles to U.S. strategy. On the upside, the President can legitimately claim to have assembled a 65-nation coalition to go after ISIS in a campaign that includes air strikes in Iraq and Syria that have killed thousands of militants, covert intelligence work and an effort to choke the extremist group\u2019s financial network. But there is a glaring reason why Obama has struggled to effectively sell his strategy: It does not seem sufficiently broad, kinetic or aggressive to accomplish the goal around which he built his speech \u2013 the ultimate destruction of ISIS. Another factor weighing against a big change in strategy is the self imposed limit that Obama has placed on the entire enterprise. He is staying faithful to his refusal to commit U.S. troops to another major Middle East entanglement \u2013 citing the quagmire that developed after the Iraq War. Where are Arab nations in fight against ISIS? Then, there is the intractable nature of civil wars in Iran and Syria, which have fractured both nations and allowed ISIS to build a vast cross-border terror haven. Even if the air campaign against ISIS in strongholds like Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq succeeds \u2013 progress may be fleeting without a vast ground force to secure territory, consolidate gains and allow space for the return of administrative politics. But Western leaders, with Iraq in mind, have little desire or political backing to commit a vast land army. So they, and 2016 presidential candidates, spend a lot of time calling for regional, Arab and other powers to step into the breach. But those governments are no more willing or able to thrust their soldiers into the cauldron either. And many have goals in Syria that contradict U.S aspirations, leading to inertia. Then there is the influence of other powers involved in Syria, like Iran and Russia \u2013 which may have common interests in defeating ISIS, but are hardly on the same page as the U.S. Still, the administration says it is encouraged by the increasing role of allies like France and Britain in the military air campaign over Syria since the ISIS rampage on the streets of Paris last month that killed 130 people. But due to the limited capabilities of its partners, Washington will still do most of the heavy lifting in the air campaign. READ: Rubio defends vote against banning people on watch lists from buying guns The administration has also touted recent German pledges to ramp up reconnaissance over Syria. But at the same time, Arab partners have stepped back. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are now more focused on combating Houthi rebels in Yemen. The White House is working with Turkey to seal the remaining 98 kilometers of unsecured border with Syria, an effort that includes both Turkish and Syrian Arab forces hoping to cut the flows of foreign fighters into the Syrian civil war \u2013 and their return to Europe. In the absence of a continued military campaign from the Sunni Arab states \u2013 which the U.S. would like to see resume \u2013 the White House is hopeful those nations can capitalize on their relationships with opposition forces in Syria. Saudi Arabia is also hosting an upcoming meeting of different opposition groups that the U.S. hopes can help pave the way for their participation in a political transition process that would see the eventual departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a theoretical revival of the Syrian state But those incremental steps, though significant, are unlikely to paper over the fundamental weaknesses of the anti-ISIS fight.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama on Friday rejected the proposed Keystone XL pipeline The pipeline has been the focus of a seven-year political fight President Barack Obama on Friday rejected the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, ending the political fight over the Canada-to-Texas project that has gone on for much of his presidency. Secretary of State John Kerry concluded the controversial project is not in the country\u2019s national security interest, and Obama announced from the White House that he agreed. \u201cAmerica is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change, and frankly, approving this project would have undercut that leadership,\u201d Obama said. The massive project has been a seven-year political football during presidential and congressional elections that has pitted oil companies and Republicans against environmentalists and liberal activists. The State Department has been reviewing the project for much of Obama\u2019s time in the White House. The proposed pipeline would span nearly 1,200 miles across six U.S. states, moving more than 800,000 barrels of carbon-heavy petroleum daily from Canadian oil sands through Nebraska to refineries in the Gulf Coast. Obama\u2019s move comes as the White House continues to promote its environmental agenda and efforts to fight climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency this summer put forward new regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. And next month, Obama will attend the Paris climate talks run by the United Nations, he announced Friday. The White House is hoping to broker an international agreement committing every country to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and enact other policies to curb global warming. The President has also stepped up his rhetoric on the need to address global warming, pushing back against Republicans and climate skeptics fighting his agenda. \u201cWe know that human activity is changing the climate,\u201d Obama said during a visit to Alaska in late summer. \u201cWe know that human ingenuity can do something about it. We\u2019re even starting to see that we might actually have the political will to succeed. So the time to heed the critics and cynics is past. The time to plead ignorance is surely past. The deniers are increasingly alone, on their own shrinking island.\u201d In a statement Friday, Kerry said the climate impact was the key factor. \u201cThe critical factor in my determination was this: moving forward with this project would significantly undermine our ability to continue leading the world in combatting climate change,\u201d he said. Liberals and environmentalists, including top donors such as California\u2019s Tom Steyer, who has committed tens of millions of dollars to fighting pro-pipeline political candidates, protested Keystone and made it a cause celebre among Democrats. The project was a major issue during the 2012 presidential campaign, when GOP candidate Mitt Romney said he would approve the pipeline. Republican candidates in the 2016 race have also pledged to let the project go forward. House Speaker Paul Ryan didn\u2019t mince words in criticizing Obama\u2019s action. \u201cThis decision isn\u2019t surprising, but it is sickening,\u201d Ryan said in a statement. \u201cSo sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline,\u201d GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump tweeted. \u201cThousands of jobs, good for the environment, no downside!\u201d In his speech, Obama said that he believed Keystone has had an \u201cover-inflated role in our political discourse, and said the project\u2019s potential to create jobs and the potential environmental threats were exaggerated. \u201cAll of this obscured the fact that this pipeline would neither be the silver bullet to the U.S. economy proclaimed by some, or the death knell to climate proclaimed by others,\u201d Obama said. Obama also cited falling gasoline prices as another argument against the project. \u201cWhile our politics have been consumed by a debate about whether or not this pipeline would create jobs or lower gas prices, we\u2019ve gone ahead and created jobs and lowered gas prices.\u201d The average price of regular gasoline hit $3.94 per gallon in April 2012 and stayed well above $3 for the rest of that election year. But this year, prices have been steadily below $3 per gallon. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also been caught up in Keystone politics. In October 2010, Clinton indicated she was \u201cinclined\u201d to approve the project but has since backed away from that stance, and in September said she opposes it. Fellow Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley also oppose the pipeline, and Clinton faced criticism from the left for not taking a firm stance. Related: Hillary Clinton\u2019s 5 takes on the Keystone Pipeline Sanders noted his long-standing opposition to the project in a statement Friday. \u201cIt is insane for anyone to be supporting the excavation and transportation of some of the dirtiest fuel on earth,\u201d he said. \u201cAs someone who has led the opposition to the Keystone pipeline from Day 1, I strongly applaud the President\u2019s decision to kill this project once and for all.\u201d Friday afternoon, Clinton tweeted her approval. \u201cThe right call. Now it\u2019s time to make America a clean energy superpower. -H,\u201d she tweeted. The right call. Now it's time to make America a clean energy superpower. -H https://t.co/d6kSvldOLI New Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he is \u201cdisappointed by the decision\u201d but said he is looking forward to building his relationship with Obama. \u201cThe Canada-U.S. relationship is much bigger than any one project and I look forward to a fresh start with President Obama to strengthen our remarkable ties in a spirit of friendship and cooperation,\u201d Trudeau said in a statement. \u201cWe know that Canadians want a government that they can trust to protect the environment and grow the economy. The Government of Canada will work hand-in-hand with provinces, territories and like-minded countries to combat climate change, adapt to its impacts, and create the clean jobs of tomorrow.\u201d The lobbying fight over Keystone has been expensive, with all sides spending millions of dollars in an attempt to influence the White House and Congress. The Canadian and Alberta governments in particular have pushed Obama to approve the project, and Obama and Kerry noted the sensitivity of their decision. The President spoke with Trudeau before the White House made the verdict public. Kerry, in his official determination rejecting the project, said the U.S. government understands the impact it would have. \u201cAs Secretary of State, I fully recognize the importance of this project to Canada, one of our closest strategic allies and energy trading partners,\u201d Kerry wrote. \u201cWe consulted with our Canadian friends and I spoke with Foreign Minister Dion today regarding this decision. While we understand the impact of this decision on Canada, I am confident that our close and long-standing relationship with Canada will continue to grow stronger in the years ahead.\u201d Friday, TransCanada, the firm behind the $8 billion project, said it will \u201creview all of its options\u201d in light of Obama\u2019s decision. \u201cThose options include filing a new application to receive a Presidential Permit for a cross border crude oil pipeline from Canada to the United States,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said. \u201cToday, misplaced symbolism was chosen over merit and science - rhetoric won out over reason,\u201d company president and CEO Russ Girling said. \u201cTransCanada is reviewing the decision and its rationale. We believe KXL is in the best interest of the United States and Canada.\u201d Earlier this week, Kerry rejected a request by the company to halt its review of the pipeline as it awaits a separate process at the state level. TransCanada said it could take up to 12 months for the Nebraska process to be completed, adding further delay to the already lengthy approval process. But such a move would have pushed the final decision on Keystone past 2016 and left it to Obama\u2019s successor. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said \u201cthere may be politics at play\u201d in TransCanada\u2019s request, suggesting it was an attempt to orchestrate such a scenario. TransCanada, which has spent at least $2.5 billion on the project thus far, first applied for a permit to build the pipeline in 2008. Obama vetoed legislation green-lighting the construction of the pipeline in February. At the time, the White House said it opposed the bill because it would have usurped the President\u2019s authority to approve or deny the creation of the pipeline and short-circuit the State Department analysis. Proponents of the project, including Republican presidential candidates, say the pipeline would advance energy independence in North America and construction of it will create jobs. Reaction condemning Obama\u2019s decision came swiftly on Friday, with many accusing Obama of catering to the green lobby and political left. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the decision \u201cpredictable.\u201d \u201cI wish he just would have been honest with everybody and done it a long time ago,\u201d Christie said in Concord, New Hampshire. \u201cWhy did he lie to the American people for so long that he was considering it? Did anybody with any common sense believe that Barack Obama was ever really seriously considering the Keystone pipeline?\u201d \u201cWhen I\u2019m president, Keystone will be approved, and President Obama\u2019s backward energy policies will come to an end,\u201d Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said in a statement. \u201cThe Obama Admin\u2019s politically motivated rejection of the Keystone XL Pipeline is a self-inflicted attack on the U.S. economy and jobs,\u201d former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweeted. \u201cPresident Obama is bowing to radical environmentalists and snubbing thousands of high quality, high paying energy sector jobs,\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal tweeted. \u201cObama\u2019s rejection of #KeystoneXL will flush American jobs down the drain\u2026 all to appease the agenda of science denying radicals,\u201d Jindal said in another tweet. Keystone also split a key Democratic constituency \u2013 organized labor. Terry O\u2019Sullivan, the general president of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, blasted the decision. \u201cAfter a seven-year circus of cowardly delay, the President\u2019s decision to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline is just one more indication of an utter disdain and disregard for salt-of-the-earth, middle-class working Americans,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said.

Never expected to see my beautiful daughter in jail,\" the Republican presidential candidate said Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina have also spent time speaking about drug abuse on the campaign trail Jeb Bush, on the campaign trail in New Hampshire, spoke in emotional terms and revealed new insights about a painful period when his daughter, Noelle, struggled with a drug addiction that landed her behind bars. Jeb Bush's life \u201cI visited her in jail. Never expected to see my beautiful daughter in jail,\u201d the Republican presidential candidate said in an interview with The Huffington Post, adding, \u201cShe went through hell.\u201d \u201cWhen I travel and do my regular job I can just look in someone\u2019s eyes and I can just tell, you can just see it.\u201d Noelle was arrested in 2002 at the age of 24 for trying to fill a false prescription and was sentenced 10 days in jail for contempt of court after she was found with crack cocaine in a drug rehabilitation center. Bush was Florida governor at the time, and Noelle\u2019s addiction was thrust into the full public spotlight. Her uncle, George W. Bush, was also president. Talking about addiction epidemic, Jeb Bush gets personal Prescription drug addictions have often led to heroin overdoses and it\u2019s become a growing epidemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced last month that deaths from heroin-related overdoses nearly quadrupled between 2002 and 2013 in the United States. How heroin kills you It has especially become an issue on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. At town halls and meet-and-greets across the state, voters regularly share stories of losing a loved one, and many candidates respond with their own personal stories. Father loses son to addiction, ends up in recovery himself and then\u2026 Chris Christie has spent more time than any other candidate on the trail in New Hampshire and so it may come as no surprise that he has been one of the more vocal candidates in addressing substance abuse. His frequent answer on the issue is \u201cYou got to be pro-life for the whole life, not just for the 9 months they\u2019re in the womb.\u201d He tells voters that as governor of New Jersey he has put in place policies that seek to give addicts tools for recovery, not judge them, and to tear down the stigma surrounding addiction. Christie: Imprison drug sellers, not drug buyers Christie often gives the example of a close friend of his from law school who he says seemed to have everything he wanted in life. But after being prescribed Percocet for a back injury the friend became addicted and ultimately died from alcohol and drugs with his life in shambles. Christie tells this story in a video shot by the Huffington Post at a recent town hall that has now been viewed more than 5 million times. Who's running for President? 2016 election candidates \u201cBy every measure that we define success in this country this guy had it, great looking guy, well educated, great career, plenty of money, beautiful loving wife, beautiful children, great house, he had everything. He\u2019s a drug addict and he couldn\u2019t get help and he\u2019s dead,\u201d Christie says in the video. \u201cThere but for the grace of God go I. It can happen to anyone so we need to start treating people in this country, not jailing them.\u201d The issue has personal significance for businesswoman Carly Fiorina as well. In New Hampshire she has talked about losing her step-daughter to addiction, during interviews and on the debate stage. Carly Fiorina gets personal discussing drugs In July, Fiorina spoke at a house party in Nashua, New Hampshire and told the crowd the issue touches her personally because of her own family\u2019s struggle as well as talking to the people in the Granite State. \u201cWhen I come here to New Hampshire one of the issues that I have learned a lot about that\u2019s touched me is the problem of heroin addiction here. It touches me, because it touches so many lives, but also because we lost a daughter to addiction,\u201d Fiorina said in Nashua, New Hampshire this summer. Bush said his daughter is \u201cdoing fine now, but it\u2019s with you for the rest of your life.\u201d Heroin deaths up for 3rd year in a row 2016 candidates respond to NH heroin crisis He said that Noelle had struggled with addiction since she was a teenager and expressed frustration over the difficulty of diagnosing the disorder. \u201cIf someone has a cut on the finger, you know what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone has a disorder in their brain it\u2019s just must harder.\u201d Bush also shared a story in which a woman whose son died of an overdose emailed him, accusing him of being in favor of an open border, which could lead to more drug trafficking. \u201cI called her said you\u2019re wrong. She said, I\u2019m not\u2026 basically \u2018f\u2014 you\u2019\u2026 I said I want to see you,\u201d Bush said, adding that they visited and prayed together. \u201cWe hugged about it\u2026and we\u2019re friends. There is a shared bond in this, people who go through this. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose a daughter, but I almost did.\u201d Unintended consequences: Why painkiller addicts turn to heroin Bush has been talking in personal terms all week in New Hampshire about his daughter\u2019s experience. Earlier Thursday, at a town hall in North Conway, Bush seemed to grow emotional after a man talked about his son dying from an overdose of Oxycontin. \u201cI\u2019ve had personal experience with this,\u201d Bush said. \u201cJust the heartbreaking nature of someone who you love with all your heart who is afflicted with addiction \u2013 or even worse dies \u2013 is just,\u201d Bush said, before pausing and breathing in a deep sigh, \u201cIt\u2019s horrible.\u201d He paused in silence again, looking down at his feet. Addiction: The disease that lies On Wednesday he embraced an idea that was shared with him during a campaign stop at a pharmacy in Hollis, New Hampshire. Pharmacy owner Vahrij Manoukian lost a child to overdose and said he wants to institute laws that identify drug dealers in the same light as child molesters, listing them publicly and even stamping their drivers license with some kind of marker. \u201cI love this idea of creating a sense of shame, of ostracizing people who are preying on vulnerable people,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is totally true.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Mitch McConnell privately wants the White House to pay this price to enact a major budget deal: Significant changes to Social Security and Medicare in exchange for raising the debt ceiling and funding the government. Several people familiar with the high-stakes fiscal negotiations said the Senate majority leader\u2019s staff is trying to drive a hard bargain in the private talks with the White House and Democratic leaders. McConnell is seeking a reduction in cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security recipients and new restrictions on Medicare, including limiting benefits to the rich and raising the eligibility age, several sources said. In addition, the Kentucky Republican is eager to see new policy riders enacted, including reining in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s clean water regulations. White House officials are already rejecting such entitlement changes. But the demand by McConnell showcases the major gulf that exists between the two sides as they try to avoid a potential fiscal calamity if the United States fails to raise the national debt ceiling by Nov. 5 or stumbles into a government shutdown by mid-December. The talk comes as McConnell finds himself in a tough spot headed into a pivotal stage in the negotiations \u2013 especially amid the turmoil across the Capitol. House Speaker John Boehner, who wants to resign by month\u2019s end, said he\u2019s eager to \u201cclean up the barn\u201d and get hot-button issues off the table for the next speaker. But with House Republicans in turmoil over his successor and consumed with a messy leadership fight, Boehner is in many ways insulated from political pressures from the right and could get a deal without worrying about a revolt. Meanwhile, Democratic leaders are betting that the blame of any shutdown or default will fall largely on Republicans, giving their party leverage to force GOP leaders into making concessions to raise the debt ceiling and cut a budget deal that increases domestic spending. That puts the pressure squarely on McConnell. The GOP leader, who won reelection last year and promised that his majority would prove Republicans would avoid fiscal crises, is eager to find a bipartisan consensus. Yet in the aftermath of Boehner\u2019s demise, McConnell is facing renewed criticism from the party\u2019s right flank, which is only bound to grow more pronounced if he cuts a deal viewed as a capitulation to the White House. To that end, McConnell is hoping that the White House agrees to some concessions as part of a fiscal agreement that Congress may quickly seek to enact after lawmakers return from recess next week. And he has taken a hardline on other matters too, including refusing to take up a stand-alone bill to revive the Export-Import Bank, siding with fiscal conservatives over the business community in the divisive party fight. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart declined to comment on the GOP leader\u2019s proposal in the talks with Democrats, citing the private nature of the fiscal discussions. White House officials also refused to discuss any specific proposals being traded in the talks. But even though the White House has backed some entitlement changes in the past, notably overhauling how Social Security cost-of-living payments are calculated, a spokeswoman said that the President would not accept them in the current round of negotiations if they were offered. \u201cProposals such as raising the eligibility age for Medicare and changing the way Social Security retirement benefits are indexed to inflation are non-starters for the administration and Democrats in Congress,\u201d said Jennifer Friedman, a White House spokeswoman. It\u2019s unclear how firm of a line McConnell is willing to draw in the fiscal negotiations. With 24 GOP Senate seats in contention next fall, including in blue and purple states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin, the GOP leader can\u2019t afford to see his party take a major hit from yet another fiscal debacle in Washington. Privately, McConnell has urged Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, to seek the speakership, believing he needs a strong partner to get the GOP back on track and help usher through major fiscal deals. RELATED: If Paul Ryan doesn\u2019t run, it could be a free-for-all McConnell\u2019s chief deputy, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, said in a recent interview that he\u2019s ready to raise the debt limit \u201cuntil 2017\u201d in order to get the matter off the table during an election year. McConnell, sources say, feels the same way, and the two sides are discussing the possibility of raising the debt limit until March 2017, just two months after a new president and Congress are sworn in. If there\u2019s a deal, the two parties would likely just agree on overall spending numbers, cuts to offset the spending increases and raising the debt ceiling. They would punt other matters, like highway funding and program-by-program spending levels, until later this year. Getting a deal, however, remains anything but assured. McConnell knows full well he can\u2019t simply accept what the White House and Democrats want: Higher domestic spending levels that exceed existing budget caps and a debt ceiling increase with no strings attached. Republicans are eager to see an increase in defense spending, but Democrats want defense and domestic spending to increase equally \u2013 or about $76 billion total. In order to agree on overall spending levels, party leaders are also looking at areas within the federal budget to cut spending, prompting McConnell to float the roll back on costly entitlement programs. But agreeing on offsets are typically the most complicated parts of any fiscal agreement. Anything short of that could prompt a sharp push back from fiscal hawks eager to preserve the budget caps under the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration. \u201cWhen you\u2019re undoing sequestration, you\u2019re going to have resistance from a lot of us,\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said. News of McConnell\u2019s move began to divide the GOP on Tuesday. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a presidential candidate, said he was \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d about McConnell\u2019s proposal. \u201cThis is the same GOP congressional leadership that has failed to repeal ObamaCare, defund Planned Parenthood, stop the Iranian nuclear deal, build the Keystone pipeline, defend traditional marriage, secure the border, and reject Obama\u2019s illegal executive amnesty,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cBut now we should trust them to \u2018reform\u2019 Social Security and Medicare -in exchange for more deficit spending and endless debt?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Carly Fiorina made only passing mentions of Clinton, quickly joking about her email scandal in a commonplace way that seemed even hackneyed on the Republican stump. Gone is the fiery anti-Clinton rhetoric that once defined her candidacy. Now that she stands more of a chance of facing Clinton, she's trying to move beyond her. Carly Fiorina entered the Republican presidential race with a singular purpose: Attack Hillary Clinton. At the high-profile Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Fiorina ripped into Clinton, challenging her to \u201cname one accomplishment\u201d and charging that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what leadership means.\u201d She trolled Clinton with a news conference just outside a Clinton event in Columbia. And she launched an entire website, ReadytoBeatHillary.com, that funneled visitors to a donation page \u2013 once they watched a 54-second anti-Clinton screed. But that was before her strong debate performances and rapid rise to the top-tier of Republican primary candidates. Now, Fiorina is now focused on telling her story. On the trail, she delivers a persona-heavy, policy-light mix of her personal rise in the business world and a theoretical take on who is supposed to serve in government. Gone is the fiery anti-Clinton rhetoric that once defined her candidacy. Now that she stands more of a chance of facing Clinton, she\u2019s trying to move beyond her. \u201cWith a rise in the polls comes a rise in responsibility,\u201d said Ron Christie, a Republican strategist who organized CPAC and counts himself as a longtime Fiorina-watcher. \u201cIt is a marked change and a departure from her original strategy to establish herself as the anti-Hillary candidate as to now trying to position herself as: \u2018I can win this thing.\u2019\u201d RELATED: Carly Fiorina downplays her insider credentials on the trail Republican donors and activists have encouraged Fiorina\u2019s uppercuts as good for the conservative cause, eager to see a candidate so committed to damaging a likely Democratic candidate who most expect to be formidable in the general election. But few top Republican insiders have committed to Fiorina exclusively. Despite her strong poll showings of late, many voters still don\u2019t know much about the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive. About one-third of GOP voters said in the latest CNN/ORC poll that they had no opinion of Fiorina. RELATED: Carly Fiorina urges Hill GOP to \u2018stand up and fight\u2019 over Planned Parenthood After hearing Fiorina at a Republican women\u2019s luncheon here, some South Carolina Republicans said they wanted Fiorina to define herself before asking them to envision her in a general election debate. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some of those comments too and you kind of smile about those, but that\u2019s not really what I\u2019m interested in,\u201d said Robin Duffie, applauding Fiorina for speaking about policy issues. \u201cThat is more presidential.\u201d Fiorina\u2019s toned down rhetoric suggests she\u2019s aware of her new standing in the race. In a recent interview with People Magazine, Fiorina said she empathized with Clinton\u2019s work ethic: \u201cShe\u2019s smart, she\u2019s hardworking, she\u2019s giving it all she\u2019s got.\u201d Not that Fiorina is abandoning Clinton entirely. At business lunches and grassroots rallies alike across South Carolina last week, Fiorina made only passing mentions of Clinton, quickly joking about her email scandal in a commonplace way that seemed even hackneyed on the Republican stump. And Fiorina still pokes at Clinton when asked, telling reporters outside a pregnancy center recently that she is a \u201cliar\u201d on issues like the 2012 strike on Benghazi and the videos that have surfaced impugning Planned Parenthood. And she pushed back on the idea that she\u2019s no longer leading the GOP attacks against the former secretary of state. \u201cIn order to become president of the United States, I have to beat the Democrat. She happens to be the Democrat,\u201d Fiorina told reporters when CNN asked if she was backing away from her previous language. \u201cShe represents a set of policies that are bad for this nation.\u201d Her new foil? The same as many other Republicans: Donald Trump. Fiorina, who squabbled with the boisterous frontrunner in the second debate, tells crowds that the hardliner didn\u2019t ignite the presidential discussion over border security, and that candidates shouldn\u2019t be defined by the \u201csize of your helicopter\u201d or the \u201csize of your ego.\u201d But for now, she sounds almost identical to every other Republican. \u201cWe need a president in the Oval Office who actually understands how the economy works,\u201d she told a well-dressed crowd here as forks clinked. \u201cWe have managed the decline of this great nation for quite long enough, thank you very much.\u201d VIDEO: Carly Fiorina: Hillary Clinton is \u2018pandering\u2019 That boilerplate is much gentler than the critiques she dished when she needed to rake Clinton over the coals to win attention. In the pre-campaign season, Fiorina relished in uncorking the most virulent broadsides of Republican contenders, making \u201cUnlike Hillary Clinton\u201d one of her favorite phrases as she invited Clinton\u2019s press corps to the news conferences Fiorina staged steps away from Clinton\u2019s events \u2013 supposedly unintentionally. At CPAC in February, Fiorina trained her crosshairs with plenty of intention. \u201cShe tweets about women\u2019s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights. She tweets about equal pay for women but won\u2019t answer basic questions about her own offices\u2019 pay standards,\u201d Fiorina said in one blistering passage. \u201cHillary may like hashtags. But she doesn\u2019t know what leadership means.\u201d VIDEO: Conservatives rally against Hillary Clinton at CPAC Fans of Fiorina here expressed little longing for that crusading Carly of the past. Sherri James said she too would grow quickly exasperated with an on-the-attack Fiorina. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to hear that they\u2019re going back and forth,\u201d James said, saying she\u2019d hope all the Republicans wouldn\u2019t aim at each other. One target is exempt from that rule: Trump. \u201cI\u2019m okay with that,\u201d she said with a laugh.",

            "article_content": "The high court was a topic at the Republican debate Candidates divided over Chief Justice John Roberts Four years ago, a law professor called the Supreme Court the \u201cforgotten issue\u201d of the presidential election. Not anymore. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham summed things up last night: \u201cPlease understand, we have to win this election. The court\u2019s at stake. It is the most important reason for us to turn out, to make sure we don\u2019t lose the judiciary for decades to come.\u201d Some of the candidates took on Chief Justice John Roberts, others made broad swings at the legitimacy of the Court. They discussed the Kentucky clerk who defied the gay marriage ruling, as well as issues such as birthright citizenship, gun control, and states\u2019 rights. Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 who was lauded as a near-perfect nominee by Republicans when President George W. Bush put him on the bench \u2013 took harsh criticism from some candidates. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a former clerk to Roberts\u2019 mentor, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, said that even though he originally supported Roberts, he had now come to view the nomination as a \u201cmistake\u201d especially for his two votes in favor of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care plan. Cruz said that Roberts is \u201ca good enough lawyer that he knows in these Obamacare cases, he changed the statute, he changed the law ,in order to force that failed law on millions of Americans for a political outcome.\u201d Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was more guarded. He allowed that Roberts had \u201cmade some really good decisions.\u201d But then Bush said that Roberts \u2013  the man whose resume included years in the Justice Department, White House (during the Reagan administration), and on a federal appeals court \u2013 did not have a \u201cproven extensive record.\u201d Bush suggested he\u2019d do things differently. \u201cThe simple fact is that going forward what we need to do is to have someone that has a long standing set of rulings that consistently makes it clear that he is focused exclusively on upholding the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Bush said. Louisiana Gov. Bobby JIndal did not mince words. He put Roberts in the same box as Justice Anthony Kennedy and former Justice David Souter. \u201cJustice Roberts twice rewrote the law to save Obamacare, the biggest expansion of government, creating a new entitlement when we can\u2019t afford the government we\u2019ve got today,\u201d Jindal said. Can someone please fact check this: Chief Justice John Roberts is not a liberal. But Roberts was praised by two men who voted for his confirmation. Graham called him \u201cone of the most qualified men to ever come before the United States Senate,\u201d and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said that while Roberts made a \u201cbad decision\u201d on Obamacare, \u201che\u2019s made a lot of great decisions, too.\u201d Last night, the Court as whole was also a target for some candidates. Cruz, in particular, let loose. \u201cWe have an out of control Court,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m elected president, every every single Supreme Court justice will faithfully follow the law and will not act like philosopher-kings,\u201d he said. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee once again pointed to the Court\u2019s decision clearing the way for gay marriage nationwide, saying that a 5-4 Court \u201cdecided out of thin air that they were just going to redefine marriage.\u201d And he questioned the legitimacy of the Court, arguing, \u201cIf the court can just make a decision and we just all surrender to it, we have what (President Thomas) Jefferson said was judicial tyranny.\u201d Jindal sent a message to Justice Stephen Breyer, who is currently on tour promoting his third book arguing the court should look outside U.S. borders when considering cases. \u201cThey\u2019re not appointed there to interpret international law, they\u2019re there to apply the United States Constitution!\u201d Jindal said. \u201cJudicial supremacy is not in the Constitution,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cWe need a president and a Congress to stand up to a court when it exceeds its constitutional authority.\u201d Former New York Gov. George Pataki worried about the rule of law. In response to Santorum, he said, \u201cWow. You know, we\u2019re going to have a president who defies the Supreme Court because they don\u2019t agree?\u2026Then you don\u2019t have the rule of law.\u201d There was Trump on birth right citizenship \u2013 the policy of automatic citizenship for those born in the United States. \u201cA woman gets pregnant. She\u2019s nine months pregnant, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States and we take care of the baby for 85 years? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. Former tech CEO Carly Fiorina shot back: \u201cYou can\u2019t just wave your hands and say the 14th Amendment is gonna go away.\u201d But Rand Paul came to Trump\u2019s defense. \u201cWell, I hate to say it, but Donald Trump has a bit of a point here,\u201d Paul said. Graham put it this way: \u201cThere are people buying tourist visas that go to resorts with maternity wards with the expressed purpose of having a children here in America. There are rich Asians, there are rich people up in the Mideast \u2026 That to me is bastardizing citizenship.\u201d One of the more passionate moments in the debate came when Huckabee defended Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who went to jail rather than issue gay marriage licenses. \u201cWe made accommodations to the detainees at Gitmo \u2013 I\u2019ve been to Gitmo, and I\u2019ve seen the accommodations that we made to the Muslim detainees who killed Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected Democrat county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky?\u201d Bush seemed to lay out a middle ground. He suggested that while Davis couldn\u2019t just say that \u201cgays can\u2019t get married now\u201d there should be some accommodation made for her conscience.",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday, the U.S. and Turkey announced they had finalized joint anti-ISIS air operations. Some analysts see Erdogan's increase in support for the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition as an extension of his political maneuvering. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has placed the Obama administration in a delicate position \u2013 stepping up his country\u2019s involvement in the war on ISIS at precisely the moment he is making a power play to solidify his position as Turkey\u2019s leader. On Tuesday, the U.S. and Turkey announced they had finalized joint anti-ISIS air operations, cementing a recent agreement to work more closely to take on the terror group in neighboring Syria and Iraq. The new agreement with the U.S. came just one day after Erdogan took the unprecedented political step of calling for yet another round of elections after his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) failed to form a coalition government despite earning a plurality of the vote held in June. Many in the West see the newly called snap campaign as an attempt by Erdogan to increase his grip on power by seeking another election to secure his party a parliamentary majority rather than settle for a coalition government. The confluence of events drives home the balance the Obama administration must strike between its goal of looking to promote democratic inclusiveness in Turkey and the Pentagon\u2019s increasing reliance on Erdogan\u2019s government for help battling ISIS. Turkey's 'reluctant' role in the fight against ISIS In the months since the June election, Turkey has significantly increased its commitments to the anti-ISIS effort, allowing the U.S. to conduct air operations from its Incirlik military base and, with Tuesday\u2019s announcement, joining the air campaign itself. \u201cThe fact that Turkey is now going to be flying alongside with other coalition aircraft is a significant step forward, one we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said in welcoming the move. The U.S. has long sought greater participation from Turkey in the effort to fight ISIS, in part because Incirlik is a much more convenient for U.S. sorties into Syria than the other existing options and also because Turkey\u2019s border with Syria has been a key transit point for foreign fighters seeking to join up with ISIS and the U.S. would like to see a greater clampdown. Indeed, Cook said that cooperation with Turkey \u201cremains a work in progress,\u201d but he also stressed that, \u201cWe believe that Turkey is committed\u201d to the anti-ISIS mission. Part of the difference between the U.S. and Turkish approaches to ISIS is a result of their divergent goals in the region. While Washington has the eradication of ISIS as a top priority, Ankara is at least as concerned about the PKK, a Kurdish group that has launched frequent attacks on Turkey and has positions in Syria and Iraq. In fact, some Western analysts see Erdogan\u2019s increase in support for the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition as an extension of his political maneuvering. The campaign against ISIS, along with recent actions against the Kurdish PKK, are \u201cpart and parcel,\u201d of Erdogan\u2019s election efforts, said Soner Cagaptay, Director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, as Erdogan seeks to promote nationalist sentiment to re-solidify his party\u2019s appeal. READ: Turkish President, with no majority, calls for new elections in November \u201cErdogan never wanted a coalition government,\u201d Cagaptay added. And a key reason the AKP needed to enter a coalition after the June 7 vote was an unprecedented alliance between secular Turks and Kurds in support of the new pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party, which surpassed the 10% vote threshold for parliamentary representation and helped deny AKP a majority. \u201cThis has kind of thrown a monkey wrench in President Erdogan\u2019s presidential ambitions,\u201d Cagaptay noted. But new elections, expected to take place Nov. 1, could help Erdogan get around that. Since the June contest, Turkey and the PKK have been involved in several deadly attacks and retaliations. Heightened anti-Kurdish sentiment in Turkey could both help more voters turn out for the AKP in November and peal away Turkish votes from the new pro-Kurdish party. The concern in Washington is that Erdogan is finding ways to link the PKK to moderate Kurds and the pro-Kurdish parties as part of the anti-ISIS campaign in order to alienate the latter, as well as liberal Turks who have joined with the moderate Kurds. U.S. officials do not believe the AKP has the votes to dramatically change their vote share in the November elections, but there are concerns about broader trends in Turkey, which have led to a narrowing of political space through restrictions on media freedoms and social media access. The ISIS terror threat In addition, Erdogan has been hoping to muster enough votes to change Turkey\u2019s constitution to increase his own authority, which as president is muted by Turkey\u2019s current parliamentary system. The AKP has also adopted many policies that are less friendly to the U.S. and close allies such as Israel since replacing the secular governing party 13 years ago \u2013 throughout which time it\u2019s enjoyed a parliamentary majority. Critics in Turkey argue that Erdogan\u2019s latest moves are part of this larger pattern toward less democratic openness. \u201cWe\u2019re watching this just like we watch political developments in other places around the world,\u201d State Department Spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday, after the call for new elections. \u201cI think our stance, again, around the world, for inclusiveness and representative government, fair and free, credible elections, is iron-clad.\u201d But Kirby would not go so far as to weigh in on the announcement of new elections, calling these \u201cinternal political issues.\u201d And Kirby also recalled the assistance that Turkey is providing the U.S. in the Middle East. \u201cTurkey is an ally and a partner,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to continue to work with whatever Turkish government is in place.\u201d \u201cThey continue to contribute, and we continue to be grateful for those contributions,\u201d said Kirby.",

            "article_content": "Sanders wasn't Trump's only target on Tuesday, as he also took aim at Hillary Clinton Trump also hit his rivals for fundraising efforts that he said ensure access for top donors and contribute to a corrupt political system Donald Trump said Tuesday that Bernie Sanders \u201cshowed that he\u2019s weak\u201d by allowing #BlackLivesMatter protesters to take his microphone during a weekend event in Seattle. And Trump \u2013 the Republican presidential contender who, he said, is attracting the biggest crowds to campaign events along with the Democrat Sanders \u2013 vowed: \u201cBelieve me, that\u2019s not going to happen to Trump.\u201d \u201cI would never give up my microphone. I thought that was disgusting. That showed such weakness, the way he was taken away by two young women \u2013 the microphone; they just took the whole place over,\u201d Trump told reporters during an evening news conference before speaking to a Republican group in Michigan. \u201cThat will never happen with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll do the fighting myself or if other people will, but that was a disgrace. I felt badly for him. But it showed that he\u2019s weak.\u201d Michael Briggs, a Sanders campaign spokesman, declined to comment about Trump\u2019s criticism on Tuesday. The faces behind #BlackLivesMatter Sanders wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s only target on Tuesday. Asked by Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity during an interview if raising the Monica Lewinsky affair against the Clintons in a hypothetical matchup between he and Hillary Clinton would be fair game, Trump said: \u201cI guess it is. Look, (Bill Clinton) would have had a much different presidency if he didn\u2019t have Monica and all of these things that happened. \u2026 If anything, they probably won\u2019t be doing too much talking about it, but certainly it\u2019s fair game. I guess anything is fair game.\u201d Trump also hit his rivals, including Clinton and Bush, for fundraising efforts that he said ensure access for top donors and contribute to a corrupt political system. \u201cWhen Jeb Bush raises $114 million, when Hillary raises $60 million, which she has \u2013 I know the people that gave them the money,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese are not the nicest people in the world.\u201d He told Hannity he is prepared to spend hundreds of millions of his own dollars on his presidential campaign \u201cif I\u2019m doing well.\u201d Trump hasn\u2019t talked much about policy, but he told Hannity that he believes he could get Mexico to pay \u201c100%\u201d for a wall along the United States\u2019 southern border, either by imposing a tariff or pressuring the country to \u201cjust give it to us.\u201d He also suggested health care savings accounts as an alternative to Obamacare. But Trump said during his news conference in Michigan that he has no plans to roll out a \u201c19-point plan\u201d delving into policy, and said he doesn\u2019t plan to change his style despite the controversies that have surrounded his campaign. \u201cThe people that we\u2019re dealing with and whatever\u2019s happened \u2013 it is what it is. You just look at the results,\u201d Trump said before his speech at the Genesee and Saginaw County Republican Party Lincoln Day dinner in Birch Run, Michigan. Opinion: Could a \u2018President Bernie Sanders\u2019 deliver? He\u2019s leading Republican presidential primary polls in Iowa and New Hampshire despite clashing with Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly during and after last week\u2019s prime-time debate \u2013 which drew a record-breaking audience of 24 million, for which Trump is taking credit. \u201cWho do you think they were watching? Jeb Bush?\u201d Trump said. Trump took several swipes at Bush over a gaffe last week in which the former Florida governor suggested women\u2019s health is overfunded while attacking Planned Parenthood. (Bush later said he \u201cmisspoke.\u201d) Without talking about his own stance on Planned Parenthood funding, Trump said: \u201cThe women\u2019s health issues \u2013 I\u2019m for that. I watched Jeb Bush give the worst answer the other day \u2013 I think that\u2019s going to be his 47%.\u201d It was a reference to Mitt Romney\u2019s claim during the 2012 presidential election that 47% of Americans are too reliant on the government, and would therefore never support him. \u201cI think that Jeb\u2019s answer the other day on women\u2019s health issues is a disaster for him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI cherish women. And I will be great on women\u2019s health issues. Believe me.\u201d Trump continued to insist that he won\u2019t take the option of running as an independent candidate off the table, saying he only wants to be treated \u201cfairly\u201d in the GOP primary and crediting Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus with doing just that. Asked how he\u2019d determine whether he\u2019s treated unfairly, Trump said: \u201c\u2018Fairly\u2019 is an instinct. It\u2019s an instinct. I know what fair is. You know what fair is.\u201d Jeb Bush blames Clinton, Obama for Iraq\u2019s problems CNN\u2019s Deena Zaru and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

The United States is eager to boost its ties with Nigeria now that the former president, Goodluck Jonathan, who was often a source of frustration for Washington, has left office. The Obama administration believes that President Muhammadu Buhari can become an ally in cracking down on Boko Haram, whose collaboration with ISIS is helping the spread of radical extremism in West Africa. Buhari, a devout Muslim in a country where half of residents are Muslim, said during his election that he\u2019d fight aggressively against radical Islam and promised to ramp up the fight against Boko Haram, which has horrified the world with its kidnappings of Nigerian school girls. The Obama administration, which had challenged Jonathan to fight terrorism more aggressively, emphasized the effort to combat Boko Haram in its announcement of Buhuri\u2019s visit. READ: Nigeria elections: 5 reasons you should care \u201cPresident Obama looks forward to discussing with President Buhari our many shared priorities including US.-Nigeria cooperation to advance a holistic, regional approach to combating Boko Haram,\u201d the White House said in a statement. Omolola Adele-Oso, executive director and co-founder of Act4Accountability, a D.C.-based African government advocacy organization, believes Buhari will prioritize fighting terrorism more than his predecessor. Shortly after being elected, the new president met with the families of the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram, she said. \u201cHe made promises to, in the next months, address the issue of Boko Haram pledging to do more to rescue the girls,\u201d said Adele-Oso, who is Nigerian. The Buhari administration last month slated $100 million for the Multinational Joint Task Force \u2013 military personnel from Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon specifically focused on fighting Boko Haram. Buhari made $21 million available immediately. The extremist group has said it has no interest in negotiating with the Nigerian government, but Buhari\u2019s officials said this month that they are open to discussions. \u201cIf Boko Haram opts for negotiation, the government will not be averse to it,\u201d Femi Adesina, a Buhari spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cThe government will, however, not be negotiating from a position of weakness, but that of strength.\u201d Activists are hoping that the United States can assist Nigeria in halting Boko Haram\u2019s growth, especially by focusing on strengthening the country\u2019s military. \u201cThe largest help the U.S. could give comes with intelligence \u2013 helping Nigeria develop and monitor and track our security issues, and develop a better understanding of what it means to control our border,\u201d Adele-Oso said. Boko Haram: Nigeria's crisis While Nigeria would be wise to strengthen its relationship with the United States, ultimately the solutions to the country\u2019s problems \u2013 including divisions \u2013 will have to be solved internally, said Tukufu Zuberi, a professor at the Center for Africana Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe solution to that can\u2019t come from Obama. It has to be a Nigerian solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much France can do or the U.S. can do in order to provide a national consciousness and unity in Nigeria.\u201d In its statement, the White House also emphasize the U.S. Interest in strengthening \u201cNigeria\u2019s efforts to advance important economic and political reforms that will help unlock its full potential as a regional and global leader.\u201d Having recently won Nigeria\u2019s first credible elections, Buhari enjoys the most respected status internationally of any of his predecessors. Buhari has said he desires a closer relationship with the United States and other Western partners as he seeks to improve Nigeria\u2019s position in the global community. But just how thoroughly he\u2019ll bring reform and implant democracy within Nigerian society remains a question. Buhari himself is a former oil minister and ran on a platform of cleaning up the rampant corruption in government and the oil sector. With a broom as one of his campaign icons, Buhari signaled that he plans to clean house in Nigeria. He has long opposed corruption, but his democratic credentials are less stellar: He once led a military coup against a corrupt government in 1984. He has since, however, become a vocal advocate of democracy. Adele-Oso is optimistic about Buhari\u2019s desire to make the country more democratic. \u201cHe has a track record of standing by his word. He has a track record of being someone who is being fair, firm and honest. And that is very welcome,\u201d she said. READ: Nigeria: 234 more women, children rescued The United States, for now, has praised the democratic moment in Nigeria and both Jonathan and Buhari for a peaceful transition of power. In particular, the White House emphasized the role of the Nigerian public, noting at the time of the election in March that \u201cthe last few days have shown the world the strength of Nigeria\u2019s commitment to democratic principles. By turning out in large numbers and sometimes waiting all day to cast their votes, Nigerians came together to decide the future of their country peacefully.\u201d The United States Itself helped to some extent in this process. The U.S., the United Kingdom and others in the international community warned those considering disrupting the elections that there would be serious consequences. And what happens in Nigeria could influence what happens around it. \u201cWith Africa\u2019s largest economy, a burgeoning population, and significant political stature, Nigeria matters. Its fate will affect that of its neighbors, of oil companies, and of global security,\u201d wrote foreign policy expert Sarah Chayes of the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Nigeria once had a vibrant diverse economy, but has since become an oil monoculture, according to Chayes, senior associate in Carnegie\u2019s Democracy and Rule of Law Program. Following the corruption, terrorism and environmental concerns, multiple countries and businesses have divested from Nigeria\u2019s oil industry. \u201cThere was nothing foreordained in this outcome, and it can be reversed. It is in the interests of energy companies as well as the United States and other Western governments to help Nigeria\u2019s new leadership do so,\u201d wrote Chayes.

            "article_content": "Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, once a Republican rising star who passed on an opportunity to seek the White House in 2012, announced his candidacy on Wednesday under much more trying circumstances. Jindal announced his bid over social media, just hours before hosting a kickoff rally. \u201cI\u2019m running for President of the United States of America. Join me,\u201d Jindal tweeted, with a link to his website\u2019s announcement page. I\u2019m running for President of the United States of America. Join me:\u00a0http://t.co/MmqB4kxpUq At his rally in Kenner, Louisiana, Jindal sought to promote himself as a bold leader who not only talked the talk but walked the walk as governor of Louisiana. \u201cThe big government crowd \u2013 they hate what I have done,\u201d Jindal said to the crowd of about 500. \u201cI am guilty as charged, and our state is better off for it today. We have had enough of talkers, it\u2019s time for doers. I\u2019m not running for president to be somebody, I\u2019m running for president to do something.\u201d Gov. Bobby Jindal announces run for the White House But if he wants to compete in the expansive Republican field, he\u2019ll have to resurrect a reputation that has fallen significantly in recent years. Jindal is now polling toward the bottom of the field, registering at just 1% in the latest CNN/ORC poll. Jindal\u2019s popularity in his own state has suffered \u2013 a recent poll has his approval at 32% \u2013 thanks to budget troubles and perhaps a preoccupation with playing to a national audience. His refusal to raise taxes to help balance the state\u2019s books has resulted in deep cuts to popular programs and areas of government spending such as health care and education. His wife introduced him on stage, the only speaker before he took to the podium. The roll out also featured a couple of biographical videos. Jindal: 'I don't think' Rand Paul will be the nominee RELATED: Poll shows Trump near top of GOP pack in New Hampshire Jindal, the country\u2019s first Indian-American governor, is likely best-known nationally for his flip-flop on Common Core educational standards \u2013 from support to opposition, a move many saw as opportunistic as he marches toward a presidential bid. In 2010, his state implemented the standards. By 2014, he was blasting them. In the interim, many conservatives fearful of government takeover of schools had begun to protest the standards across the country, pushing Republican politicians to rethink their support. Jindal\u2019s reversal marked a watershed moment for the politician, who following Romney\u2019s 2012 loss, pushed for the GOP to represent something other than being the \u201cparty of no.\u201d Governor Jindal talks race The Brown University graduate and Rhodes scholar went even further, chastising his peers for verbal gaffes and unforced errors when politicking leading up to the presidential election. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the last time anyone says something stupid within our party, but it can\u2019t be tolerated within our party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had enough of this dumbed-down conservatism. We need to stop being simplistic, we need to trust the intelligence of the American people and we need to stop insulting the intelligence of the voters.\u201d But his flip on Common Core marked Jindal as a man willing to play to his base \u2013 similar to those pols he had condemned in 2012. America may also recall the 44-year-old for his Republican response to Obama\u2019s first joint address to Congress in 2009 \u2013 a performance most remembered for Jindal\u2019s awkward delivery than anything else. Though initial polling shows Jindal is a longshot, he has carved out a niche of vibrant support among evangelical Christians and the anti-Common Core activists. Gov. Jindal: Marriage is between a man and woman RELATED: Top Bobby Jindal aides join campaign-in-waiting He\u2019s also positioned himself as a top opponent of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and has at times led his party\u2019s charge in railing against radical Islam, while also straying into the controversial territory. In an hour-long briefing with reporters Wednesday in New Orleans, Jindal\u2019s soon-to-be presidential campaign advisers stressed that the Louisiana governor will highlight his record as an executive as he focuses on an early state strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hunt where the ducks are,\u201d said chief strategist Curt Anderson, a Jindal adviser since 2003 and former Republican National Committee political director. Jindal\u2019s four main objectives as president would be securing the border, replacing Obamacare, growing the private sector and increasing defense, his aides said. He will also be \u201caggressive\u201d on calling for the destruction of radical Islam and that containment is a strategy for losers. The Louisiana governor will likely fight for space on the right of the so-far 13 person GOP field, alongside Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Aides argue that Jindal hasn\u2019t been on the trail like other candidates, so naturally his name recognition will be low. \u201cHalf these people don\u2019t know who their own damn governor is, let alone the governor of Louisiana,\u201d Anderson said, referring to voters nationwide who aren\u2019t plugged into presidential politics as much as reporters and operatives. Jindal was a political wunderkind when he first burst onto the scene helping shape health care policy. In 1996, at the age of just 24, Jindal was appointed as head of Louisiana\u2019s department of health policies. Later, he served under President George W. Bush in the Department of Health and Human Services as a top adviser to then-HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson. Raised in a Hindu household, Jindal converted to Catholicism in high school. He first cut his own political teeth in 2003, surprising many to force a run-off election in the Louisiana gubernatorial race. Though he lost, he set himself up for a successful congressional run in 2004, serving until finally winning the governor\u2019s mansion in 2008. Jindal\u2019s first stop after his speech Wednesday night will be New Hampshire on Thursday, followed by Iowa on Friday. He holds a fundraising event in Baton Rouge on Saturday \u2014 the only fundraising event that will appear on their financial reports for the period that ends on June 30, they say. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond and Eugene Scott contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush expected to come out on top in fundraising Big question now is who will come in second The money race for second place is on. With a June 30 fundraising deadline drawing near, speculation over how much money Republican presidential candidates will collect is reaching a fever pitch. It\u2019s already clear that Jeb Bush will come out on top regardless of whether he hits or even surpasses the $100 million target many in the donor world set for the former Florida governor. The more interesting question, many donors and campaign operatives say, is who will come in second. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has an unusually broad donor list thanks to his highly publicized recall election and big dollar backers like Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has worked meticulously to make inroads with prominent GOP fundraisers who aren\u2019t sold on Bush. And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has drawn in small dollar donors, as well as the support of a handful of super PACs. A leader of the super PACs backing Cruz expects those groups and the official campaign committee to raise a combined $50 million by the end of the week. \u201cWhen it comes to fundraising in a presidential race, it\u2019s the expectation game,\u201d said Craig Robinson, a GOP activist in Iowa and editor of The Iowa Republican website. \u201cEvery candidate has a different bar they\u2019re going to have to clear.\u201d READ: From living rooms to Lady Gaga, Clinton on aggressive fundraising push The price tag to wage a competitive primary campaign is likely to come in well below $100 million. Republican fundraisers said if a candidate and allied groups can raise $10 million to $20 million by the end of the month, they will be viewed as credible rivals. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital who is supporting Walker, said he expects Walker to raise $15 million to $22 million. \u201cThere\u2019s a number that\u2019s enough and there\u2019s a number that\u2019s not enough,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cThe $20 million number is enough.\u201d The best-positioned candidates should plan to barrel into Iowa with $20 million to $40 million in the bank between their campaign accounts and their super PACs, GOP strategists said. A candidate could win the Iowa caucuses with as little as $2 million, Robinson said. And in New Hampshire, \u201cthere\u2019s sort of a practical limit on how much TV time you can buy,\u201d said Tom Rath, a GOP operative there. But a bitter faceoff in Florida \u2013 the home state of Bush and Rubio \u2013 is a much more expensive proposition. It could cost $20 million to $30 million, said Miami-Dade Republican Party Chairman Nelson Diaz, for candidates to cover the four major media markets and adapt to a new primary system due to the timing of the Florida contest. All of the state\u2019s delegates will be awarded to the winner of the March 15 primary, the earliest possible date when states can do so rather than divvying them up proportionally. \u201cOnly one of them survives the encounter in Florida,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, who was the senior strategist for Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008. All of this requires not only strong fundraising, but also disciplined spending. That\u2019s particularly true for Bush and Rubio. While other candidates may chart their course to victory by investing heavily in a single state, both contenders from Florida are expected to compete in several states simultaneously. \u201cObviously we want to raise as much as we can and then be very careful about how we spend it,\u201d said Rubio spokesman Alex Conant. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to raise as much as the others.\u201d READ: GOP candidates head to the border Rubio will spend the rest of the month crisscrossing the country to average roughly one fundraiser a day. He\u2019ll do most of that on commercial flights while a lean staff keeps his campaign headquarters humming. At a recent Bush fundraiser in Washington, donors forked over $2,700 per person to stand around tables munching on potato chips and croissant finger sandwiches as organizers sought to keep event overhead costs low. \u201cWe understand that we\u2019re going to have to compete everywhere and that we\u2019re going to need the resources to compete everywhere,\u201d said Tim Miller, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. That requires building a campaign operation that\u2019s flush with cash and ready to spring into action when a number of states hold their contests on March 1. The leader of Cruz\u2019s super PACs said the structure \u2013 four separate organizations largely controlled by three donors \u2013 allows them to minimize costs by tapping donors\u2019 own professional networks. \u201cEverybody thinks this structure, as it relates to us, is somehow limiting our capacity and there\u2019s a chokehold \u2013 actually it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d said the group\u2019s leader. \u201cI\u2019m not going to have to buy a whole bunch of computers that I throw away at the end of this deal.\u201d Candidates\u2019 overall fundraising totals will receive plenty of attention, but Republicans cautioned that every dollar isn\u2019t created equally. Many candidates will be able to stretch their dollars further than Bush, who has the biggest target on his back and will have to combat fatigue from his family name. Frank VanderSloot, a GOP fundraiser in Idaho and chief executive of wellness company Melaleuca, said he views Bush, Walker and Rubio as the top tier of GOP candidates. At the moment, Rubio is his favorite. Bush faces a tougher path because of his family legacies, VanderSloot said.  At a recent board meeting for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mr. VanderSloot said some business executives confessed they were uncomfortable with the idea of \u201ccrowning\u201d another Bush president. \u201cThere\u2019s a general feeling of we don\u2019t have a monarchy here,\u201d Mr. VanderSloot said. Bush\u2019s unique hurdles help explain why he and his allies are pressing donors for big contributions right up to the fundraising deadline. After wrapping up his official announcement in Florida, Bush hopped on a call with his finance director and donors and prodded them to give to his official campaign account, according to someone familiar with the call. Dave Kochel, the campaign\u2019s senior strategist, assured fundraisers that Bush would be a formidable competitor in the early states. The super PAC supporting Bush has been making similar moves. On a call last week, Mike Murphy, who is running the group, encouraged donors to keep up their fundraising so he could \u201cweaponize\u201d their total.",

            "article_content": "Steer clear of the \u201cstupid zone.\u201d That\u2019s how one Republican consultant is telling the GOP field to react to Donald Trump\u2019s explosive entry into the White House race. The real estate mogul, flinging insults and bombast while announcing his run Tuesday, is threatening to upend the party\u2019s singular focus on a primary process that yields the strongest possible nominee and avoids some of the farcical scenes that tarnished candidates in 2012\u2019s circus-style debates. READ: Donald Trump\u2019s next reality show: 2016 GOP insiders also warn that more conventional presidential hopefuls must beware Trump\u2019s efforts to draw them into his constantly swirling media vortex, one that could lure them into political controversies and hurt their appeal to moderate voters. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush found out about the Trump effect firsthand Wednesday, when he was asked about the brazen reality show star\u2019s plan to build a great wall on the border to keep out Mexican \u201crapists\u201d and criminals. Rockers blast Republicans for using songs With an awkward smile, a muttered \u2018no\u2019 and a shake of the head, Bush refused to take the bait, proving that he at least is aware of the danger. Trump, of course, rejects the notion that his candidacy is anything close to damaging to his own party, instead calling it a boon to the GOP when asked Wednesday to respond to Republicans who say he is a distraction to the primary process in a tough election year. \u201cI think I\u2019ll help the party because we have a lot of Republicans who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing unfortunately. That\u2019s why the country\u2019s in such bad shape,\u201d Trump told CNN after a Manchester, New Hampshire rally. How long Bush and fellow GOP 2016 presidential hopefuls can maintain that discipline, hold their tongues and resist Trump\u2019s provocations could dictate just how much the billionaire wildcard will impact the party\u2019s primary contests. There is already genuine concern among Republican operatives about the damage that an unleashed Donald Trump could do to the party\u2019s hopes of winning back the White House. Donald Trump launches 2016 presidential bid GOP strategist Rick Wilson, not affiliated with any candidate, said Trump is a \u201cdisruptive and dangerous\u201d addition to the Republican primary field who would try to goad his rivals into confrontations that could harm the party\u2019s image. Trump, in his opening blast, questioned Bush\u2019s intellect and dress sense \u2013 what is sure to be the first of many such slams. And Trump\u2019s attacks on Mexico could jolt Republican efforts to appeal more to the vital Hispanic voting bloc. \u201cDismiss it, walk past it, ignore it,\u201d Wilson said, explaining how the 11-and-counting other GOP candidates can avoid being pulled into what he called Trump\u2019s \u201cstupid zone.\u201d But another GOP strategist, Ford O\u2019 Connell, who is not currently working with a GOP presidential contender, said it was not going to be easy for candidates to turn the other cheek. \u201cIf you are one of the other candidates, particularly one that has a window to victory, it\u2019s hard to ignore The Donald \u2026 but that is your best bet,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s extraordinary announcement speech on Tuesday was laced with cutting mockery of other GOP candidates, warnings to Iran and ISIS, a vow to beat a rising China \u2013 despite his professed \u201clove\u201d for the communist state\u2019s free-wheeling economy \u2013 and repeated boasts about his own massive wealth. In the surreal aftermath, people in politics and the media aren\u2019t quite sure how to treat Trump. Is he just a blustery reality star seeking a personal boost and an avalanche of publicity from a presidential run? Or could he, using the considerable savvy with which he built a real estate empire, actually be making a serious attempt to win the nomination \u2014 or at the very least shape the political outlines of the GOP race. While top-tier presidential candidates like Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker may have little to gain from a tangle with Trump, the temptation for a lesser candidate \u2013 desperate for the media spotlight \u2013 might prove irresistible. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a team effort to ignore Trump,\u201d said O\u2019Connell. \u201cAll that has to happen is some lower-tier candidate to fall for the Donald Trump act and have it all it ricochet back on the rest of them.\u201d The question that Bush faced in Iowa is an example of the way that other candidates, like it or not, will end up being forced to respond to Trump. But Wilson warned candidates away from thinking that could benefit them. \u201cThere\u2019s not a particularly relevant political upside to getting into a pissing match with Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cAny candidate who thinks they\u2019re going to elevate themselves off of Trump doesn\u2019t understand that celebrity candidates operate in a sort of different airspace than they do.\u201d With his fame, cash and talent for grabbing publicity, no one is betting against Trump capturing a top-10 spot in national polls, the threshhold needed to participate in the top-tier debates this summer. It is likely to be a moment of acute risk for other candidates if Trump is still on the prowl, though not every Republican believes Trump\u2019s entry into the race is bad news. Ray Tweedie, a senior official with the GOP in New Hampshire, said that Trump\u2019s undeniably entertaining announcement rally on Tuesday had got people talking and could help to convince independent voters to look at the party. \u201cThere are people who I wouldn\u2019t consider political who are talking about Mr. Trump\u2019s politics,\u201d Tweedie said of voters he\u2019s come across in the Granite State. READ: Probably not a lot more rocking in Donald Trump\u2019s free world If Trump can \u201cget people to start realizing, in very plain, Washington terms, that things are bad,\u201d he can engage new people in the political process and \u201cplant the seeds of ideas in our party,\u201d Tweedie said. New Hampshire State Rep. Stephen Stepanek has already endorsed Trump \u2013 and hosted a House party for Trump during his previous visit to the state. He said he had decided to think \u201coutside the box,\u201d as it was time to stop appeasing the political establishment. \u201cThe American people are getting tired of all this political correctness and everything that goes along with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to shake things up and it\u2019s time to do what\u2019s best for the American people.\u201d With his blunt words, Trump has a certain bracing charm that could appeal to disenchanted voters who are sick of conventional political leaders. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, another GOP hopeful, told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Wednesday that Trump is \u201chitting on issues that Americans care about\u201d and should not be dismissed. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said that although the media was \u201cscoffing\u201d about Trump\u2019s performance Wednesday, his fulminating about American decline would \u201cresonate\u201d with some voters. And there are other markers of Trump\u2019s seriousness about a long run. Presidential candidates must file an official disclosure on their finances within 120 days of launching a campaign. Trump\u2019s massive empire will make that a complicated process and an intrusive one, but he has said he will do so by the first GOP debate in August. He would also need to put his thriving media career on hold. NBC is already \u201cre-evaluating\u201d his status on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which because of rules and conventions designed to mitigate political bias, would be incompatible with his status as a declared political candidate. Why rivals should take Donald Trump seriously If Trump passes those two tests, scrutiny will start to shift toward his appeal in the GOP race, which lacks a clear front runner. In last month\u2019s CNN/ORC national poll of the Republican field, Trump languished at 3%, alongside long shots Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, and George Pataki, a former New York governor. In New Hampshire, where Trump was campaigning on Wednesday, he\u2019s doing better: fifth place with 8% of the RealClearPolitics average of recent polls. But he has significant hurdles to overcome before he can be considered a genuine threat to establishment candidates when the votes are tallied. \u201cHe is a very well-known candidate. Only Jeb Bush has higher name recognition,\u201d Andrew E. Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. He added: \u201cHe has the highest unfavorable ratings of any candidate who is running in New Hampshire.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump will appear on \u201cState of the Union with Jake Tapper\u201d this Sunday at 9 a.m. EDT. Donald Trump finally took the plunge. The real estate mogul and TV reality star launched his presidential campaign Tuesday, ending more than two decades of persistent flirtation with the idea of running for the Oval Office. \u201cSo, ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again,\u201d Trump told the crowd in a lengthy and meandering 45-minute speech that hit on his signature issues like currency manipulation from China and job creation, while also taking shots at the president and his competitors on the Republican side. \u201cSadly the American dream is dead,\u201d Trump said at the end of his speech. \u201cBut if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\u201d Donald Trump in the public eye Just over four years after he came closer than ever to launching a campaign before bowing out, Trump made his announcement at the lavish Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York, laying out a vision to match his incoming campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d The 68-story tower venue Trump used Tuesday was more than just the backdrop to Trump\u2019s presidential announcement, instead becoming a physical embodiment of what Trump is bringing to the table and the challenges he\u2019ll face as he formally enters politics: it\u2019s both a sign of his overwhelming success in business and, as the site of the famous \u201cApprentice\u201d boardroom, a symbol of the reality TV label he\u2019ll struggle to shake off. The Tower, also home to \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d television shows, crystallized the challenge Trump faces as he looks to win over voters. Donald Trump's best lines during his 2016 speech Many Americans now view him primarily as a reality TV star after 14 seasons of his \u201cApprentice\u201d series, and his numerous flirtations with a presidential run \u2013 first in 1987, then 1999 and again in 2004, 2008 and most recently in 2011 \u2013 have left voters eye-rolling as he prompted yet another round of will-he or won\u2019t-he speculation. Trump has already billed himself as the \u201cmost successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far,\u201d pointing out even that he owns a \u201cGucci store that\u2019s worth more than Romney.\u201d That Gucci store wasn\u2019t far as Trump made his announcement \u2013 it\u2019s located in the lobby of the Trump Tower. But Trump showed Tuesday that he won\u2019t shy away from the out-of-reach luxury and opulence that makes up his day-to-day lifestyle. Instead, he flaunted his wealth and success in business as a centerpiece of his presidential platform, and he began that officially on Tuesday, trumpeting his whopping $8.7 billion net worth during his announcement speech. Trump\u2019s net worth was previously estimated at roughly $4 billion. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thinking our country needs,\u201d Trump said after reading off his net worth, to the thousandth dollar. He pointed out that his wealth and successful business career not only qualified him to be president \u2013 \u201cI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.\u201d \u2013 but that it would allow him to rid himself of the special interests that he said control American politics. That\u2019s because the billionaire said he would self-fund his presidential campaign, not only ridding himself of some outside influences, but also freeing up more time to campaign as candidates can often spend about half their time raising funds to keep their campaign coffers from depleting. \u201cI\u2019m really rich,\u201d Trump said, adding that his confident attitude is what the country needs after having \u201closers\u201d run the country. Trump\u2019s press aide released a one-page summary of his assets and liabilities on Tuesday and Trump pledged to release the full financial disclosure, including income tax returns, required by the Federal Election Commission before the first debate. Trump\u2019s wealth and results-driven success is business is part of what he hopes will be his appeal to voters as he looks to set himself apart from career politicians. \u201cI\u2019ve watched the politicians, I\u2019ve dealt with them all my life,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey will never make America great again. They don\u2019t even have a chance.\u201d It\u2019s his confidence that business associates say has made him the successful mogul he is today. \u201cHe has the guts and the balls,\u201d said Roberto Bezjon, a Trump Organization board member and owner of a high-end New York hair salon located in a Trump building. \u201cHe\u2019s a straight shooter.\u201d Supporters gathered for the announcement had the same impression. Many of them were either several-time supporters of Trump\u2019s past flirtations with elected office or small business owners in New York who said they were confident Trump would be a boon for the economy. Supporters donning \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d T-shirts \u2013 several of them boisterous and interjecting loudly in the middle of Trump\u2019s speech \u2013 shuffled up golden elevators to watch from two stories up. Outside, campaign volunteers flagged down pedestrians to hand them the campaign T-shirts and invite them inside for the announcement. The spectators got a flavor for the type of candidate Trump plans to become \u2013 one who shoots from the hip and doesn\u2019t care for a script \u2013 and the ideas he\u2019ll promote. Trump called for everything from new infrastructure (\u201cWe\u2019re becoming a third world country!\u201d) to erecting a massive fence on the border with Mexico \u2013 which he said he would have Mexico pay for \u2013 to the need for a thorough plan to defeat ISIS. And the man himself was always at the center of Trump\u2019s ideas: \u201cNo one would be tougher on ISIS than Trump,\u201d he said, referring to himself in the third person. \u201cWe need a truly great leader,\u201d he said earlier, before pointing several times to his skills as a negotiator. Who's running for President? But it\u2019s not clear whether Americans are ready yet to give Trump a chance to become that leader. In recent polls, more than half of Republicans said they had a negative view of him \u2013 a tough spot to start a campaign. He and his aides remain confident, though, that voters will take Trump seriously after he has now made his intentions clear and announces he\u2019s running. \u201cWe can change that dynamic in 15 seconds by Mr. Trump sending out a press release saying he\u2019s running for president,\u201d Trump\u2019s top political adviser Corey Lewandowski said before the speech. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s single biggest detriment is that people don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to run.\u201d But over the past several months, Trump has ramped up his political activity, making key staff hires in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina \u2013 including the political strategist who drove former Sen. Rick Santorum to a surprise victory in the Iowa caucus in 2012. And even as he becomes the 12th candidate to throw his hat into a ring that will become even more crowded before the first televised debate in August, Trump could find himself grinning on Fox News along with the rest of the top 10 candidates who made the cut. Fox is limiting participation in the first debate to the top 10 GOP contenders based on national polling, and Trump is just on the edge based on the latest polls. He tied for 10th place with 3% in the latest CNN/ORC poll earlier this month and earned 4% in both the most recent Fox News and Washington Post/ABC News polls \u2013 coming in 10th and tied for ninth, respectively. That puts Trump right in line with would-be-rivals like Santorum, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York Gov. George Pataki \u2013 and above hopefuls like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Trump will look to escape that grouping as he challenges conventional political notions of nominating a presidential candidate who\u2019s held elected office, instead calling for an end to the politics he says are heavy on talk and light on action. Trump is no stranger to either, though. He famously fanned the flames of the \u201cbirther\u201d movement and today takes credit for President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to release his birth certificate \u2013 which Trump said this year at CPAC hasn\u2019t completely quelled his concerns. And he won\u2019t mince words when it comes to his GOP foes, either. And he may take the opportunity to draw a contrast with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who formally announced his candidacy just a day before Trump\u2019s announcement. Trump said earlier this year in Iowa: \u201cThe last thing we need is another Bush.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sophie Tatum contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Crucial UK election is May 7 A lot at stake on domestic, international fronts Established parties are seeing their authority fray in a volatile new era The most unpredictable and consequential election this year isn\u2019t playing out in the town meetings of New Hampshire or the fields of Iowa. It\u2019s happening an ocean away, in the United Kingdom. Politicians always say that the election they are fighting is the most important for a generation \u2013 but in the UK, for once, that might just be true. That\u2019s because British voters next week face choices that could reshape their country\u2019s global role for years to come. UK election: The pros and cons of a \u2018Brexit\u2019 They could put the ally that has a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with America on a course that tears the UK apart by reviving dreams of Scottish independence. Or that rips the island nation out of the European Union with potentially damaging blows to the global economy. Or that causes the demise of Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal, a pillar of NATO. \u201cWe could see over the next five years Scotland going for a referendum for independence again. We could see a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, which might result in Britain leaving Europe,\u201d said Joe Twyman, head political and social research at YouGov, a British public opinion research firm. \u201cThis could have enormous implications, both for people in this country now, but also for generations to come.\u201d And there\u2019s more than the UK\u2019s future as a unified nation on the line. The country\u2019s entire political system is on the verge of a lurch into the unknown after decades of political stability that produced massive majorities for prime ministers such as Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher. The big established parties, Labour and the Conservatives, are seeing their authority fray in a volatile new era in which smaller parties based on regional and single-issue loyalties are likely to pack a much harder punch than their size would suggest. That\u2019s because they can play hard-to-get when they are wooed by bigger parties trying to frame a coalition. Meanwhile, if Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives remain at the helm of government, the country will be on the path to a referendum on whether to stay in the European Union. Cameron is promising to renegotiate the terms of Britain\u2019s membership in the bloc and to hold a vote by 2017 on whether Britain should stay in. The result of such a referendum is difficult to forecast. But the mere prospect of a British exit \u2013 known as a \u201cBrexit\u201d \u2013 could hammer the sickly European economy. Scotland's political brawl: Nicola Sturgeon vs. Jim Murphy Cameron\u2019s EU rethink came amid pressure from skeptical members of his own party and an insurgency from the United Kingdom Independence Party, led by charismatic everyman Nigel Farage, who wants to pull Britain out of the EU. The party, which Cameron once derided as full of \u201cfruitcakes, loonies and closet racists,\u201d threatens to siphon away votes from the Conservatives and make it much more difficult for the party to build a House of Commons majority. But the real electricity of the race is in Scotland. Labour has traditionally been the dominant party for the working-class heartland north of the English border. But the Scottish National Party, despite losing a referendum on independence last year, looks set to wipe out Labour\u2019s support \u2013 a scenario that would represent one of British politics\u2019 most staggering political realignments in decades. The SNP surge might be coming at the expense of Labour \u2014 but given their common left wing-heritage, the two parties could find themselves thrown into a coalition together in Parliament. Such a tie-up would put the Scottish separatists in the unusual position of playing a major role in the government of a nation they have pledged to leave. The resurgent SNP is being powered by a string of strong performances in debates and recent elections by Nicola Sturgeon, its new leader. Currently serving as First Minister of Scotland, Sturgeon is not even running for a seat in the UK parliament \u2013 but polls show she is currently the most popular political leader in Britain. Both the Daily Mail and Sun tabloids have asked whether Sturgeon is the most dangerous woman in Britain. In addition to seeking Scottish independence, the SNP is opposed to a project to update the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear missile system and may try to extract a promise from Labour to ditch plans for a new fleet of submarines to carry it. CNN UK election debate: 57% support EU referendum vote That has caused consternation in Washington over the kind of message standing down the nuclear arsenal would send about NATO\u2019s readiness and capability at a time when Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s revival of Cold War-style bombast has sent shivers through the West. But while separatist fervor has taken Scotland by storm, apathy is a more accurate description of the electorate elsewhere \u2013 despite the stakes in this election. Fish, bacon and beer: The real issues in Britain\u2019s election The polls have been stubbornly frozen for months, with Labour and the Conservatives neck-and-neck but both a long way from potential majorities. It seems public anger at politicians widely seen as on the take since an expenses scandal in 2009 has created an ugly inertia in which voters are loath to trust anybody. This has lead to a situation where election day, May 7, may fail to produce a clear victory for any party but rather usher in a period of extreme instability. It might take days before Britons know whether their next prime minister is Cameron or Labour Party leader Ed Miliband. The Liberal Democrats, the centrist party that has been in the coalition with the Conservatives for the last five years, meanwhile, is bracing for a tough night \u2013 and may pay the price for serving in a government that has taken a tough austerity line. UK's breakout star not even a candidate It\u2019s all a far cry from the days when Labour and the Conservatives took turns wielding power and elections were a two-horse race. Potential post-election chaos is reflected in the political betting markets, legal in Britain, where gamblers often provide clues to the sentiment of a public expected to wager almost $40 million in this election season alone. Graham Sharpe, a political expert and media relations director at William Hill, a major bookmaking firm, compared this year\u2019s chaotic election race to Britain\u2019s premier horse race, The Grand National, where favorites often fall at giant fences and outsiders can come from nowhere to make a stunning run for the front. \u201cIt looks like a very competitive horse race. This time, anything can happen and not only do we not know what is going to happen \u2014 we don\u2019t know when it is going to happen.\u201d Sharpe\u2019s firm reckons there are at least a dozen possible outcomes to the election, and that the Conservatives are most likely to win the most seats on May 7. But his oddsmakers think the most likely result of the election as a whole is a minority Labour government. It\u2019s clear the tight race election is beginning to fray the leaders\u2019 nerves. Cameron and the other candidates are throwing out proposals on everything from tax to home rent rules that already look impossible to honor. On Tuesday, the Conservative leader rolled up his sleeves, took off his tie and told voters that he was ready to let rip in the final week of the election campaign. \u201cIf I\u2019m getting lively about it, it\u2019s because I feel bloody lively,\u201d Cameron said, trying to shake off his image as a man aloof from the suffering of everyday Britons \u2013 an image that stems from his education in Eton, one of Britain\u2019s elite private schools. On Monday, he kicked off his final push for victory by declaring in an interview with the Times newspaper that he had \u201conly 10 days to save the union,\u201d arguing that Labour would enter a coalition with the SNP and trigger the biggest constitutional crisis since before World War II. Miliband, the son of a famed socialist academic, has his own image problems. He has been lampooned for the clumsy way he ate a bacon sandwich and has had to struggle against the impression that he is just not quite prime ministerial material. UK Elections 2015 Earlier in the campaign, Miliband was asked whether he was tough enough to stand up to the likes of Putin. His reply, \u201cHell, yes, I\u2019m tough enough,\u201d came across as staged and raised new questions about his authenticity. But Miliband\u2019s populist anti-rich rhetoric, which mirrors the kind of denunciations of trickle-down economics uttered by U.S. President Barack Obama in his 2012 re-election campaign, touches a nerve in post-crisis Britain. Miliband says that if the Conservatives win, the only people who will benefit are the wealthy. The campaign has also featured heated arguments on funding the state-run health care system and tough conditions hamstringing British workers. But on one thing, at least, both men agree. When he launched his campaign in March, Cameron said it was \u201cthe most important election in a generation.\u201d Miliband said last week there were \u201c10 days until the most important election in a generation \u2026 10 days until the tightest election in a generation.\u201d Even the UK\u2019s skeptical voters may be able to take that much on trust from their beleaguered leaders.",

            "article_content": "Inflamed passions heating up the UK election campaign in Scotland turned nasty Monday, as fringe nationalist protestors jostled and jeered Scottish Labour Party leader Jim Murphy at a rally in Glasgow\u2019s city center. Hecklers tried to stop Murphy from reaching a stage where he was to address Labour supporters alongside comedian Eddie Izzard, and a huge shoving match broke out. Murphy had a cardboard banner shoved in his face as he plowed into the crowd amid shouts of \u201cRed Tories out\u201d \u2013 a reference to nationalist claims the Labour Party, which opposes independence, is not much different than the Conservatives who are mostly reviled in Scotland. Murphy finally made it to the stage, but most of his speech was drowned out by loud music, the shouts of a man on a loud hailer and nationalist supporters, prompting the Scottish Labour leader, who appeared to be relishing the confrontation, to start a chant of \u201cTories out, Tories out.\u201d Murphy told CNN that he wouldn\u2019t be silenced: \u201cWe will keep campaigning for a change of government. We will keep campaigning to get rid of David Cameron every moment between now and Thursday.\u201d Izzard, who was dressed in a dark skirt and high heels, said it was \u201csad that the Scottish National Party will not let democratic voices be heard, they just want to drown things out.\u201d But the SNP denied it had a hand in the protest and although there were some SNP members handing out campaign literature at the event, none of them appeared to be involved in the fracas. An SNP spokesman said that \u201cevery party in this campaign has a right to put their case to the people and should be heard respectfully.\u201d Organizers may have expected hostile scenes, as reporters were only told a few hours before the start of the event where Murphy planned to appear, and a temporary stage was erected only minutes before his arrival. Passions are running high ahead of Thursday\u2019s general election because the SNP is tipped by polls to almost wipe out Labour in its long-time working class heartland north of the England/Scotland border, despite losing a referendum on independence last year. The SNP surge will have a significant impact on British politics. It could either hand SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon the power to prop up a Labour minority government in London with votes on specific pieces of legislation. Or she could make the case in the event of a Conservative government that Scots are again being ruled by a party they have repeatedly rejected, strengthening the case for another vote on independence in the years to come.",

            "article_content": "If politicians feel unloved in America, they should try Britain. Here, voters castigate politicians as liars on live television, tell pollsters by 10-1 margins that their leaders don\u2019t care for the national interest and have descended into a corrosive countrywide funk challenging the very legitimacy of government. Now the electorate may add a dose of Washington-style gridlock with a May 7 vote likely to leave no big winner and instead produce a fractious coalition or a weak government without a mandate that would struggle to survive, let alone get anything done. READ: Why Americans should care about the UK election At the campaign\u2019s final televised candidate showdown on Thursday night, an audience member encapsulated in just one sentence the nation\u2019s view of the people that want to lead it. \u201cYou are frankly just lying,\u201d he said to opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband. In some ways, the concerns of voters here mirror those in the United States \u2013 the high cost of living for the middle class, worries about quality and access when it comes to health care and rising national debt after the worst economic crisis in decades. And just like the United States, where 2016 presidential candidates like Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton are battling one another to show they empathize with the struggles of \u201ceveryday Americans,\u201d no politician appears to have the answers. But whereas U.S. electoral schisms deepen political polarization between the parties, in Britain the electorate has united \u2013 in complete contempt for all the leaders. There\u2019s none of the sense of future possibility that American candidates conjure up among their followers in the early days of a U.S. primary campaign, or of the call to national renewal that presidential candidates invoke before the November general election. Will Jennings, a professor of politics at Southampton University, said the U.K. was caught in a cycle of \u201chuge, pervasive distrust\u201d of political institutions and other traditional centers of power, including the scandal-ridden parliament, print media and the police. UK party leaders The bile that poured out at the leading candidates in the question-and-answer session on Thursday was comparable to the assaults American politicians are used to receiving on conservative talk radio and partisan liberal websites. But in the U.S, candidates rarely confront such copious fury from the general public face-to-face. When South Carolina Republican Rep. Joe Wilson shouted \u201cYou lie!\u201d at President Barack Obama during an address to Congress, it was roundly criticized. In contrast, the vitriol at the candidates forum on Thursday night barely raised eyebrows. The U.K.\u2019s political distemper comes at a consequential time, when the unity of the nation is again in peril from Scottish independence aspirations and support for continued European Union membership is in doubt. And it is informed, in part, by the fallout from the global economic crisis, from which Britain was far slower to recover than the United States. \u201cThe message of austerity has depressed people. Politicians have been telling them for five years how hard this is going to be,\u201d said Jennings. Though the British economy is on the mend, the belt-tightening has made progress painful. The U.K. political dysfunction may be a lesson for America about what happens when politicians are perceived to have stopped listening to the people and there is no defining figure able to lift the national narrative from the mire of partisan politics. READ: Cameron, Miliband spar ahead of UK election Thursday night\u2019s event in Leeds may end up being the signature moment of a campaign that has seen political leaders shy away from direct contact with voters to avoid mistakes in a neck-and-neck race \u2013 and perhaps distance themselves from the anger and disgust they would face. But in Thursday nights Q&A session, they had no choice but to confront that anger head on. The BBC, which organized the debate, set the stage for fireworks by choosing to host it in Yorkshire, home to an ornery tribe of English people who combine the bluntness of Philadelphia with Texas\u2019s independent streak. Instead of debating one another, as in a U.S. presidential debate, the leaders of what are currently the country\u2019s three biggest parties in parliament \u2013 Miliband, Prime Minister David Cameron and Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg \u2013 each appeared on stage separately for a 30-minute grilling from audience members, alone and unprotected. Veteran BBC presenter and the evening\u2019s moderator David Dimbleby smoothly made sure that each one was fed to the lions. Financial Times columnist Matthew Engel said that having the party leaders make separate appearances made them seem like \u201cdefendants in a gangland trial who have to be kept apart for fear they will slit each others throats.\u201d Miliband wasn\u2019t the only one to face an audience member questioning his veracity. Cameron\u2019s suave political persona was no match for one voter who told the prime minister that anyone who believed his promises on Britain\u2019s state-run health service must have \u201chalf a brain.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t agree with you, sir,\u201d Cameron replied, trying to deflect the anger. \u201cWell you\u2019re wrong,\u201d the man said. It\u2019s not as if the British leader does not appreciate the anger boiling up in the electorate. This week he made a desperate pledge to pass a law making it illegal for him to raise taxes in order to placate those who don\u2019t trust his promises. British politics no longer a two-party race Though his austerity medicine has been a tough dose for the British people, Cameron argues that the economy is finally recovering, and his best hope of remaining Prime Minister may lie in the fact that voters may not be ready to trust Labour with the nation\u2019s purse strings again. By the end of his time on the stage Thursday, Cameron, despite putting in one of the best performances of his campaign, looked rattled \u2013 his upper lip was soaked in sweat. Miliband was up next, and drew guffaws when he insisted the last Labour government had not overspent. That elicited the audience member\u2019s skeptical response: \u201cHow can you say that? You are frankly just lying.\u201d In the end, Miliband had little option but to plead he was not like every other politician who talks big at election time but doesn\u2019t deliver. \u201cI\u2019m not the guy who makes all those easy promises,\u201d he said, before almost stumbling to the ground in an undignified exit from the stage. Clegg, for his part, has never recovered from breaking a promise to oppose a rise in tuition fees for university students, and his own parliamentary seat in the north of England is now under threat. His party is expected to see its tally of seats drastically cut, so much so that it may be mathematically impossible for the Liberal Democrats to prolong the coalition they made with the Tories in 2010. \u201cHave you got any plans for next week when you\u2019re unemployed and your party\u2019s an irrelevance?\u201d one voter asked. \u201cCharming,\u201d Clegg replied. Things have always been tough for politicians in the U.K. Voters famously thanked Winston Churchill for winning World War II by unceremoniously booting him out of office and choosing Labour in 1945. And there was plenty of grumbling at the premierships of Tory Margaret Thatcher and Labourite Tony Blair when they were in power, even as voters kept returning them with huge majorities that no one today has any chance in matching. Blair, in fact, won a hope-and-change-style mandate in 1997, but partly due to his support for the Iraq war, the love affair cooled. In some ways his tenure was the root of the disaffection being seen today. Fish, bacon and beer: The real issues in Britain\u2019s election The one exception to the political antipathy may be in Scotland, where there is a fresh, dynamic political leader rallying the people to her cause. Nicola Sturgeon has taken the campaign by storm \u2013 and could wipe Labour out of its north-of-the-English-border heartland just six months after her Scottish Nationalists lost an independence referendum. The SNP surge is in many ways part of the disillusionment with politics in London that has led some Britons to flirt with smaller parties like the UK Independence Party, which opposes the EU, and the Greens \u2013 potentially crimping the ability of Labour and the Conservatives to win enough seats for a majority. According to a YouGov survey in January, only 1 in 10 Britons believes that U.K. politicians want to do what is best for the country. Seventy-two percent, meanwhile, thought politics was dominated by self-seeking politicians determined to protect the rich and powerful. Things are considerably better in the United States, where a February 2014 Pew Research poll found that 24% of the public trust the government in Washington always or most of the time.",

            "article_content": "A small throng of GOP presidential contenders descended upon South Carolina this weekend as some of the state\u2019s most involved Republican activists gathered in Columbia for their party\u2019s convention. White House hopefuls took the stage Saturday to give speeches that focused heavily on foreign policy \u2013 a big issue for a state that has eight military installations. But it was Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz, also of Texas, who garnered the most enthusiastic responses from the crowd with fiery performances railing against the Obama administration and laying out their visions for the future. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham also made their case for their likely presidential bids. RELATED: Lindsey Graham teases presidential aspirations In multiple conversations with delegates and other activists after the speeches, South Carolina voters were generally impressed with all of the candidates who spoke. \u201cIt is overwhelming, but I\u2019m real happy with the ones I\u2019ve listened to today,\u201d said Brenda Munnerlyn of Greenwood, adding that she especially loved Perry. 2016 GOPers' foreign policy credentials \u201cHe just gave me cold chills,\u201d she said. Perry, who is expected to make a second bid for the White House after flaming out early during the 2012 primaries, fired up the audience when forcefully defending Second Amendment rights. He got perhaps the biggest applause of the day when he said \u201cthe best defense against crime is an armed citizen.\u201d On foreign policy, the former governor signaled he would take a more forceful approach than the current administration. For his own record, Perry pointed to his decision to put National Guard troops at the U.S.-Mexico border last year and hounded the federal government for failing to control the border. He also talked up his time as governor for 14 years, driving home a point he\u2019s been making on the trail that voters will ultimately choose someone with executive experience \u2013 a knock against the three first-term senators, including Cruz, who are running for president. \u201c2016 isn\u2019t going to be an election about whoever\u2019s got the loftiest rhetoric,\u201d he said. \u201cFolks are going to look past at what people are saying and look at what you\u2019ve done.\u201d Alan Morgan, third vice chairman in the Greenville County GOP, said Perry\u2019s attempt at a second chance may be able to help the former governor\u2019s image, but he argued it\u2019s too early to tell whether Perry will be able \u201cto totally erase\u201d his history as a poor debater in 2012. In his speech, Cruz blasted President Barack Obama for not calling out \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d by name and got a standing ovation for saying the administration has demonstrated \u201cshameful hostility\u201d to Israel. RELATED: Rubio leads GOP field in national poll He also focused on religious freedom in regard to the controversial law in Indiana that was tweaked after critics accused it of being discriminatory against same-sex couples. \u201cI will not flinch from defending religious liberty,\u201d he said. An expert debater known for his oratory skills, Cruz typically gets strong reviews from audience members at Republican cattle calls in early voting states. And while events like the convention on Saturday provide a sense of how the candidates are being perceived, they generally comprise a more conservative audience than the general Republican electorate. Bush used the event to introduce himself and tout conservative moves he made as a two-term governor. He also called for a more engaged foreign policy and dished out some red meat lines attacking Hillary Clinton. Jeb Bush's life \u201cShe had her fingerprint on all these foreign policy disasters,\u201d Bush said after listing what he considered bad decisions by the Obama administration. Santorum also went big on national defense and decried the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear weapons program, saying the first thing he\u2019d do if president is \u201ctake any agreement with Iran and put it in the trash can.\u201d He also said Islamic terrorists \u2013 namely ISIS \u2013 are trying to return the Middle East to \u201c7th Century Islam.\u201d \u201cSo let\u2019s bomb them back to the 7th Century,\u201d he added. Graham seized on the recent protests and riots in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, saying Republicans can turn big cities around by \u201cshutting down failing schools and replacing it with something that works.\u201d \u201cI see a Republican Party giving people in Baltimore and nearly every other big city hope like they haven\u2019t seen in past eight years,\u201d he added.",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker appeared to offer some insight Friday into his election strategy for his likely presidential run, a decision he\u2019ll announce \u201csometime later in June\u201d after the Wisconsin legislature passes a budget. Speaking to a packed room in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Republican finished his stump speech with an appeal looking straight past the GOP nominating process \u2013 the Iowa caucuses are the first major electoral event in the race to the White House \u2013 and into the general election. \u201cIf we were to get in, we wouldn\u2019t be here just for the caucus, we\u2019d be here for the full haul, all the way through November 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I think it\u2019s important that if a Republican is going to win the presidency, the path to win the presidency comes through the Midwest.\u201d He named his home state of Wisconsin, along with Iowa, Michigan and Ohio as potential pick-up states for Republicans in a general election. \u201cAnd we\u2019re even going to include Pennsylvania, \u2018cause they\u2019re part of the Big 10.\u201d A Walker-Rubio ticket? Without saying it, Walker made the argument that he\u2019s just the man to do it, pointing out his conservative accomplishments \u2013 examples include defunding Planned Parenthood and enacting voter ID laws \u2013 in a blue state like Wisconsin. He also didn\u2019t forget to mention that he\u2019s won elections there three times in the past five years. \u201cI say all these things not to brag \u2013 well, maybe not to brag too much,\u201d he joked. RELATED: Walker says he\u2019s attended a same-sex wedding Wisconsin hasn\u2019t voted for a Republican for president since backing Ronald Reagan in 1984, while Michigan and Pennsylvania haven\u2019t done so since 1988. Ohio and Iowa, meanwhile, have become reliable swing states that have wavered back and forth over the years. Now with Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, and Michigan having Republicans as governors \u2013 all of whom were re-elected last year \u2013 some are turning their eye to the Rust Belt as a potentially fruitful target for Republicans in 2016, especially as other swing states like Virginia and Colorado tend to become reliably more blue. Walker sought to paint himself as a Republican coalition builder, saying he garnered support from a wide swath of Republicans in his state \u2013 from the Chamber of Commerce to the tea party and \u201ceveryone in between,\u201d he said. But, in an attempt to bolster his electability credentials in a general election, he also pointed out that he won a majority of independents in his re-election bid last year. Walker highlights contrast with Bush As he typically has done when he\u2019s visited Iowa, Walker talked about his roots in the state, dating back to when he lived in Plainfield as a kid in the 1970s. He referenced going to Happy Chef when he was younger, a breakfast chain that can be found throughout the Midwest. And he told a story about his grandparent\u2019s tire coming off their car in Dubuque, located on the state\u2019s eastern border. Walker did not mention his tendency to shop at Kohl\u2019s, a department store chain that\u2019s become a crowd favorite during his speeches on the trail. He uses the retailer, which is headquartered in Wisconsin, to illustrate his frugalness as well as his ideal tax policy. In the same way that Kohl\u2019s makes a profit by lowering the prices of items and expanding the volume, he\u2019d like to see lower tax rates across the board with an expanded number of people paying taxes. It\u2019s already a concept called the \u201cLaffer Curve,\u201d but Walker says he\u2019s renamed it the \u201cKohl\u2019s Curve.\u201d However, Bloomberg Business published a report earlier this week detailing how Walker\u2019s administration helped obtain multimillion-dollar tax incentives for the store, which was considering moving its headquarters out of state in 2012. When asked by the Des Moines Register this week if he should disclose the tax credits whenever he talks about Kohl\u2019s, Walker asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re talking about thousands of jobs,\u201d Walker continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not unlike what we do with the (tax break) package the state has available for any number of employers out there. The dollar amount is only bigger because instead of a hundred jobs, you\u2019re talking about thousands and thousands of jobs.\u201d",

            "article_content": "There is no fizzle and no fanfare. But that\u2019s the point as Hillary Clinton, the most famous woman in the world, unveils her latest makeover here in the state where her previous White House dream died. There\u2019s no pumping rock anthem or cheering supporters waving \u201cHillary\u201d banners. Vows to take back America or remake the world along with warnings that 2016 will be the most important election in a generation are noticeably absent. Instead, Clinton is taking her first official steps on what she hopes is the road to the White House surrounded by starter motors and tools in a tiny auto repair shop and a low slung community college building in far eastern Iowa. INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries again \u201cI\u2019m running for president because I think that Americans and their families need a champion, and I want to be this champion,\u201d Clinton said Tuesday as she sat around a table with seven students and educators. \u201cI want to stand up and fight for people so that they cannot just get by, but they get ahead and they can stay ahead.\u201d Instead of a raucous rally, Clinton opened up with a wonkish \u2013 and at times dull \u2013 seminar on education policy at Kirkwood Community College. She spoke before 22 people and a few reporters in Monticello, a town of agricultural machinery merchants, hardware stores, wooden homes with peeling paint and, incongrously, a Mexican restaurant, nestled on the Iowa prairies. She did, however, allow herself a stop at Chipotle on her way to Iowa and a fancy coffee once she got there. The theater of the first few days of Clinton\u2019s latest presidential bid is noticeable since most campaign launches are designed to make a splash. This one seems designed to do the exact opposite. Reporters run after Hillary Clinton's van in Iowa The former first lady, senator and secretary of state is being born again as a reformed presidential candidate, and seems determined not to give off the air of entitlement and inevitability that doomed her last time. \u201cI\u2019m here in Iowa to begin a conversation \u2026 to hear from people about what\u2019s on your minds, what the challenges that you see are,\u201d Clinton said. Aides promised that ideas and policies will come later. It\u2019s a far cry from the 112 nation odyssey which encompassed some of the world\u2019s most exotic spots when Clinton was secretary of state. It\u2019s also a million miles away from the plush lifestyle of corporate jets and presidential suites that cushioned her on the corporate speaking circuit. READ: Rubio, GOP paint Hillary Clinton as \u2018yesterday\u2019s\u2019 news As she spoke, President Barack Obama, the man who built an Iowa grassroots movement which kept her from the White House in 2008, was unveiling historic moves in his rapprochment with Communist Cuba. Once, such sweeping foreign policy drama would have been her responsibility. But here was Clinton addressing the more prosaic concerns of what her campaign is calling \u201cEveryday Americans\u201d \u2013 how to pay for further education, how to survive as a working mom and how kids can stack up college credits while still at high school. Clinton\u2019s \u201cconversation\u201d on Tuesday was decidedly of the softball variety. There was little chance for reporters to pose questions about the most controversial aspects of her candidacy. And her interlocutors in the roundtable had other things on their minds. That meant Clinton did not have to weigh in on her controversial private email account from her days at the State Department, her mixed record as secretary of state or on foreign donors to her family\u2019s philanthropic organization. There is nothing new about candidates dodging tough questions. But what is unique about Clinton\u2019s launch is the other new campaign traditions that didn\u2019t happen. READ: Clinton campaign immediately starts fundraising drive The start of most presidential campaigns see large press packs of reporters descend on gymnasiums or sports arenas packed with supporters, in a show of strength meant to make a point about a candidate\u2019s viability. Often, candidates choose a symbolic spot. In 2007, Obama drew thousands of people on a frigid morning to the Illinois statehouse in Springfield where Abraham Lincoln once held court. This time around, Republican Ted Cruz made clear his intentions to court evangelical voters by launching his campaign at Virginia\u2019s Liberty University, which was founded by the late preacher Jerry Fallwell.  Another fellow Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, on Monday chose Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower, where the government once processed Cuban immigrants fleeing the Castro government to stress his family\u2019s roots and humble origins. Clinton\u2019s aides have said a bigger unveiling will come in May. But for now, he only remarkable thing about Clinton\u2019s launch pad was how nondescript it was. The college building was situated opposite of shining agricultural silos next to a highway close to the Wisconsin and Illinois borders. The scent of a freshly manured field wafted on the breeze. But then, Clinton\u2019s task is different than that of most candidates. She hardly has a problem with name recognition, will likely raise piles of campaign cash and may end up with no serious Democratic opposition in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. But Clinton is hoping there is a second chance for her to make a good first impression with Iowa\u2019s notoriously exacting political activists, who like to prod, poke and get to know a candidate personally before committing to support them. READ: Hillary Clinton\u2019s Wall Street dilemma Clinton learned the perils of not connecting with Iowans in 2008. She has none of the affection for the state that she and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, reserve for New Hampshire, which has saved their political hides several times. But she is trying. When the black van in which she had journeyed on a road trip from New York crossed the Iowa border, it marked the first time she had visited the state as a presidential candidate since the fateful night of January 3, 2008, when she lost the caucuses. Not only did she come in behind Obama on that disastrous night, Clinton couldn\u2019t even beat former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who had camped out in Iowa for years. Now she\u2019s back and determined not to make the same mistake again. Clinton is vowing not to repeat the top down, complacent campaign that led Iowans to turn against her last time. This time, its bottom up, Obama style. She\u2019s positioning herself as the vessel for the hopes and dreams of the Americans left behind by the tepid economic recovery. She arrived not in a sleek corporate jet, or a rented plane full of media and staff, but in her van trailed by a Secret Service SUV \u2013 the legacy of her time as first lady. Some of the big time Washington journalists who had traveled to Iowa to cover her 2016 debut couldn\u2019t even get into the building, so keen was the campaign to offer an intimate setting and to make Iowans the focus. Only a small pool of reporters was allowed. \u201cRight now,  we are focused on this ramp up period,\u201d said a Clinton campaign official, speaking anonymously to discuss strategy. \u201cThere will be time later for bigger events. Especially in this first period we are focused on allowing Hillary to have these one on one conversations and hear from Iowans from all parts of the state.\u201d But while events inside the building lacked a little in spectacle, there were surreal moments outside. When Clinton\u2019s van arrived and drove around the back of the building, a pack of journalists staged a mini running of the bulls-style charge and set off in pursuit, causing a stir on social media that may be remembered longer than the candidate\u2019s heavy-going seminar. The GOP at least made a token attempt to picket her appearance, sending a \u201cNerd Squad\u201d to distribute flyers offering to turn Clinton\u2019s email servers over to experts to retreive her deleted communications. READ: Obama holds out on Hillary Clinton endorsement And a man on a bike rode up with a sign reading \u201cshe has a better body than Christie and a far better hairdo than Trump \u2013 there may be hope for Hillary after all.\u201d But for all her outreach to Iowans, she still found a home away from home for a New Yorker during an unannounced stop at a coffee shop selling a special masala chai tea and caramellow latte.",

            "article_content": "US relieved at succession plan roll-out after King Abdullah's death Saudi Arabia a key anti-terror ally in volatile region But tensions still simmer with Riyadh over Iran Finally, something went right for the United States in the Middle East. Relief is palpable in Washington over the well-planned and seamlessly executed transfer of Saudi Arabia\u2019s throne to King Salman bin Abdulaziz, 79, following the death of his 90-year-old half brother King Abdullah. The kingdom, despite signaling rare public dissent with the Obama administration over Iran and the Arab Spring, is a fulcrum of U.S. diplomacy in a region where Washington is struggling to adapt to dissolving national borders, chaotic change and sectarian carnage. Never mind that the U.S. is the world\u2019s foremost democracy  and the transfer of power in Saudi Arabia was from one autocrat to the next. Saudi Arabia is crucial to U.S. goals on counter-terrorism, the campaign against ISIS and Al-Qaeda, the free flow of energy that sustains the global economy, as a counter-balance to Iran and as a sponsor of the long frustrated quest for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. In a sign of the kingdom\u2019s importance to the United States, President Barack Obama made hurried plans to call in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday after his trip to India to pay his respects to Abdullah and his family and to meet with King Salman. Originally, Vice President Joe Biden was to have made the trip. The message from Washington is clearly : Long live the new king. The regal choreography in Riyadh is especially welcome to the White House as it contrasts with events just across the border in Yemen, another key ally where a US-backed government crucial to its anti-terror campaign has just been toppled to rebels supported by Iran. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah James B. Smith, who served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia between 2009 and 2013, said there should be no concern in the administration that Salman\u2019s ascension will jeopardize U.S. relations with the deeply conservative kingdom. Lines of succession \u201cWe know Salman well, he was governor of Riyadh for the better part of 50 years, he is well known to the US government. I see no break in the U.S.-Saudi relationship,\u201d Smith said. Salman vowed just hours after the death of Abdullah, that the kingdom \u201cwould continue adhering to the correct policies which Saudi Arabia has followed since its establishment.\u201d State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the allies had a \u201clong history of cooperation. We don\u2019t have any indication that that cooperation will change.\u201d Saudi watchers in Washington were impressed and reassured by the line of succession outlined by Salman in an apparent effort to solve a dynastic riddle and send a signal of continuity to the outside world. He named Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, one of scores of posssible candidates, as deputy crown prince, a move which puts him second in line to the throne and establishes a future transfer of power from the sons of the founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, who have ruled the country since the 1950s, to a new generation. \u201cI think for the near term, continuity is going to be the centerpiece here,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, a former coordinator for counter-terrorism at the State Department, now at Dartmouth College, told CNN. \u201cThere is now a member of the generation of the grandchildren who is second in line, he is a very close friend of the United States \u2026 so I think there is a lot of hope the relationship will stay on an even keel.\u201d Prince Mohammed, now behind the King\u2019s brother Prince Muqrin, 69,  in the line of succession, is a frequent visitor to the United States and has presided over Saudi Arabia\u2019s anti-terrorism program. He narrowly escaped an assassination bid by Al-Qaeda in 2009. The succession plan was viewed as particularly important following unconfirmed reports that Salman has been in ill health himself, apparently having suffered a stroke. Tom Donilon, pointman for US relations with Saudi Arabia when he was Obama\u2019s National Security Advisor, praised Abdullah as a \u201csolid\u201d ally who had ensured two decades of stability in the kingdom. He also said that the late King\u2019s survivors had done a \u201cpretty effective job of indicating stability with a quick annoncement with repect to succession, continuity of policy.\u201d He told \u201cThe Lead\u201d with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that Mohammad, known as MBN in the United States was \u201ca very, very competent person who is essential in terms of our joint efforts to combat terrorists.\u201d Periods of tension Though there is relief at the apparent stability in Riyadh, relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia in recent years have have often been troubled. There was a tense period a decade ago, after it emerged that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the September 11 attacks originated from Saudi Arabia. Critics, including some in the U.S. government, faulted Saudis for backing jihadists movements throughout the region for geopolitical reasons. The Saudi government has also balked at U.S. criticisms of its human rights record and political system. What's next for Saudi's foreign relations? Questions about Iran More recently, Saudi Arabia, the key Sunni power in the Middle East,  has not hesitated to make clear its concern about Obama\u2019s quest to improve relations with its mighty Shia foe Iran, with which it is fighting various proxy struggles. Saudi leaders were dismayed to learn about a secret backchannel of talks between the administration and Iran which built on the election of \u201cmoderate\u201d Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in 2013 to launch an effort at rapprochment between Tehran and Washington. \u2018\u201cI think that the concern remains among the Saudi leadership about an agreement that is going to be at their expense,\u201d said David Ottaway, an author on Saudi Arabia and senior scholar at the Wilson Center. Some analysts believe that the Saudi government could react to what it would see as a bad nuclear deal between world powers and Iran \u2013 which left the Islamic Republic with some capacity to enrich uranium or produce plutonium \u2013 by looking to find its own nuclear capability \u2013 perhaps with assistance from Pakistan. Saudi princes took to the op-ed pages of US newspapers in 2013 in a highly unusual move to complain that a nuclear deal was a \u201cdangerous gamble.\u201d The Saudi government also made clear its deep anger with Obama\u2019s last-minute decision not to launch planned air strikes on Syria to punish the Bashar al-Assad regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons the same year. Saudi Arabia has also been frustrated at how long it has taken the United States to begin training opposition fighters in Syria. Anger at Obama comments on the Arab Spring The Saudi government also registered anger at the Obama administration\u2019s embrace of Arab Spring uprisings, which led to the ouster of allies like Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Obama appeared to make an oblique reference to those differences in a statement honoring Abdullah on Thursday as a \u201csteadfast and passionate\u201d believer in US-Saudi relations as a force for stability. \u201cAs a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions,\u201d Obama wrote. In recent years, the Obama administration has attempted to assuage Saudi fears. The US president made a visit to Riyadh last year, on a trip that was widely seen as an attempt to mend fences. Saudi Arabian pilots, reportedly including one of Salman\u2019s sons, Prince Khaled, helped carry out the first air attacks on ISIS in Syria last year. What do we know about Saudi Arabia's new king? Saudi Arabia also approved of Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s exhaustive but ultimately futile efforts to keep Israel and the Palestinians talking.  And White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that an underpinning of those efforts, an Arab Peace Plan framed by Abdullah would stand as his lasting memorial. Smith said that the relationship between Riyadh and Washington was now better than it had been earlier in the administration. \u201cA key element of our relationship with the Saudis over the years has been transparency,  not always in public but we have done a good job in talking to each other,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you leave your allies out of the conversation and they don\u2019t understand your negotiating position or don\u2019t understand how you are going to enforce an agreement. they are left to their own conclusions. \u201cI think we are doing a lot better at that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The new Congress will feature three black Republicans, a record Republicans reached double-digit support from black voters in some states But experts say the GOP has a long way to go before it attracts a large percentage of black voters Election Night 2014 was more than a landslide win for congressional Republicans \u2013 it was a historic moment for black Republicans in particular. Come January, newly elected representatives Mia Love of Utah and Will Hurd from Texas along with Sen. Tim Scott \u2013 who won election to the South Carolina Senate seat he had been appointed to \u2013 will make up the largest number of black Republicans serving in a single Congress since Reconstruction. Changing demographics \u2013 a growing Hispanic population in particular \u2013 spell trouble for Republican national candidates and the party is eager to broaden its appeal to minorities to help them win the presidency in 2016 and beyond. The key question is whether these three conservative politicians from red states can help woo more black voters to a party that has struggled to attract them for decades. \u201c(Republicans) made black voter engagement a top priority by committing time, talent and resources across the country in pivotal states and urban centers. The midterm results are the beginning fruits of that labor,\u201d said Tara Wall, a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee, who acknowledged there was still much more work to be done. A racial controversy over a speech a top a House Republican gave to white supremacists while a state politician in 2002, could make that work harder. READ: Scalise brings back Boehner\u2019s familiar right flank hangover And it\u2019s not clear that simply having a black candidate draws more black voters, said CNN contributor and polling expert Keating Holland, pointing to the two Senate races in South Carolina, where both Lindsey Graham, a white Republican, and Scott were running. Scott brought in 10% of the black vote to Graham\u2019s 6%. \u201cThat tells me that having a black Republican on a ballot gets a handful of votes,\u201d Holland said. \u201cIt may increase the Republican share of black vote by low single digits.\u201d The Republican Party\u2019s focus so far has been more on biography than ideology \u2013 finding black candidates who fit the conservative mold but have a compelling story that could appeal to blacks. Mia Love, the Mormon former mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, first made a splash on the national stage as a speaker at the Republican National Convention in 2012. She stressed her background as a child of Haitian immigrants who arrived in America with $10 in their pocket and raised her with an ethos of self-reliance. Arriving on Capitol Hill for new members\u2019 orientation shortly after Election Day, Love stressed her desire to represent everyone, regardless of race or gender. \u201cAll the issues that we face in this country, they\u2019re not black issues, they\u2019re not white issues, they\u2019re not gender-specific, they\u2019re people issues and I\u2019m doing everything I can to get the decision making closest to people,\u201d she said as she made her way to the welcome reception. Her campaign to become the first black Republican woman ever elected to Congress focused on conservative principles like local control of education and blasting Obamacare. Scott, who is the first black senator elected in the South since Reconstruction, has focused on issues like tax reform, expanding school choice and reigning in government spending. But he has also addressed the historic nature of his election. \u201cIn South Carolina, in America, it takes a generation to go from having a grandfather who is picking cotton to a grandson in Congress,\u201d he wrote in a series of tweets. \u201cWe are thankful for those trailblazers who came before us and said the status quo was not enough.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have too many young people being trapped in poverty because other people are defining them with low expectations.\u201d Campaign ads for Hurd, a former CIA officer from San Antonio, emphasized issues like securing the border and his respect for conservative values that he said would help create jobs. He is the first black Republican Texans have ever sent to Congress, but he told CNN, his victory went beyond race. RELATED: GOP agenda for Congress \u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d Hurd said outside new member check in station at a Capitol Hill hotel. \u201cWhen my parents moved to San Antonio in 1970, there were houses they weren\u2019t allowed to get because of the color of their skin and now they have a son, you know, who\u2019s in Congress, and to me this is a victory for the voters of Texas and the voters of my district that have gotten beyond skin color.\u201d Hurd was elected with the help of white and Hispanic voters, while Love and Scott won with support mostly from white voters. Black turnout for certain Republican candidates this year hit double-digits in Florida (12%), in Arkansas, South Carolina and Wisconsin (10%) and in Ohio, where Republican Gov. John Kasich won 26% of the black vote. It\u2019s news Republicans are applauding as a sign the party is making inroads with black voters, whose strong Democratic leanings are well documented. Potential presidential hopeful Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, believes that the GOP could attract blacks in even bigger numbers. \u201cIf Republicans have a clue and do this and go out and ask every African-American for their vote, I think we can transform an election in one cycle and that doesn\u2019t mean that we go to a majority of African American votes in one cycle but I think there\u2019s fully a third of the African American vote that is open to much of the message, because much of what Democrats have offered hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d Paul told Politico. That\u2019s wishful thinking, analysts say. While the election of Love, Hurd and Scott is a good sign for Republicans as they try to broaden their base, it\u2019s important not to read too much into their wins, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s dreaming,\u201d Sabato said, of Paul\u2019s goal of capturing one-third of the black vote. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s practical to spend a lot of time and money on the African-American vote because it\u2019s so heavily Democratic and so intensely Democratic. Look at the intensity of African-American support and it\u2019s very high.\u201d In the last two presidential elections, more than 90% of black voters supported the Democrat, Barack Obama, who also happened to be black. But even in 1972, the most recent low-point in terms of black vote share, the white Democrat George McGovern got a whopping 82%. Historic firsts for the GOP One big problem is the perception that the Republican Party is not as open to minorities. A September analysis by David Wasserman, the U.S. House editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, found that in 1950, 98% of House Democrats and 97% of House Republicans were white men. By this year, 89% of House Republicans were white men. Just 47% of Democrats, by comparison, are white men. \u201cThey won by getting white voters,\u201d said Amy Walter, national editor for the Cook Political Report.\u201d If Republicans don\u2019t have policies that attract minority voters, then having candidates who are minority isn\u2019t going to be enough.\u201d Paul is one exception on the policy front, a Republican whose focus on criminal justice issues like incarceration rates and other matters, like school choice, appears aimed at drawing black support. While that outreach is significant, it\u2019s not clear he is speaking for anyone else in his party, said Ron Brownstein, a CNN senior political analyst and editorial director for the National Journal. So for now, it seems that the biggest impact these black Republicans may be having is on white Republicans. \u201cHere is what we see happening throughout the country, people are aligning their votes for values and voting for candidates who are not of their own complexion,\u201d Scott told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett the day after the election. Meanwhile, the Congressional Black Caucus, which is dominated by Democrats, is ready to accept the new class of black Republicans with open arms and say they could help improve bipartisanship. READ: Conservative call for Boehner coup grows louder \u201cI\u2019ve reached out to congratulate all of the newly elected African-American members of Congress on their win, including Representatives-elect Love and Hurd, and to invite them to join the Congressional Black Caucus,\u201d said CBC Chair Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio. \u201cGovernment is most effective when both parties work together for the greater good of the country. I have no doubt that all of the new Members of the CBC will bring their own unique perspective and skills, further solidifying our strength as a caucus.\u201d Love, Hurd and Scott are being sworn in as the Republican Party deals with a controversy over Majority Whip Steve Scalise\u2019s 2002 speech to a white nationalist group run by former Ku Klux Klan leader and Neo-Nazi David Duke. The then-state-representative has apologized for speaking to the group and said he did not know about it\u2019s racist leanings. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, have thrown their support behind Scalise and Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-Louisiana, an African-American who is also the only Democrat in the Louisiana congressional delegation has also come to his defense. Congresswoman-elect Love released her own statement of support. \u201cI believe he should remain in leadership. There\u2019s one quality that he has that I think is very important in leadership, and that\u2019s humility. And he\u2019s actually shown that in this case,\u201d Love said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s apologized, and I think that we need to move on and get the work of the American people done.\u201d Still, CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Kevin Madden acknowledged the controversy could complicate the party\u2019s efforts to expand its appeal to minorities heading into 2016. \u201cIt certainly presents challenges anytime you are a party like ours that has demographic challenges and is trying to overcome those demographic challenges,\u201d Madden said. \u201cThis will be an element in that conversation. What\u2019s important is that we address it head-on, and that we continue to promote an agenda that is going to attract more African-American voters, that\u2019s going to attract more Latino voters, that\u2019s going to attract more African-American candidates to run within our party.\u201d",

Asia seeing declining air quality as development brings more factories and cars to region, authors say Entrenched economic interests hurting growth in India and Indonesia, they write As 2015 comes to a close, it is worth looking back at the people and events that made headlines across Asia. And, inspired by Washington Post columnist Chris Cillizza\u2019s annual \u201cWorst Year in Washington\u201d award, we\u2019ve drawn up a list of some of the people and places whose 2015 were, for very different reasons, particularly challenging. Our choice for worst year in Asia for 2014 went to Myanmar\u2019s Muslim Rohingya minority \u2013 persecuted at home and increasingly ignored by business and political leaders hungry to engage with the new Burma. (Cillizza gave his 2014 worst year award to U.S. President Barack Obama \u201cfor losses at home and crises abroad.\u201d This year, U.S. presidential candidates dominated as Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton shared the dubious distinction). In Asia, elections, territorial disputes and trade deals provided fertile ground for our choices. So, on the final day of 2015, here are our choices, from bad to good. All too often in Asia, starting the day in 2015 meant donning a face mask or perhaps a hacking cough rather than a cup of tea or coffee. The culprit is the region\u2019s declining air quality as development brought more factories and cars to an increasingly urbanized region. India reported nearly 3.5 million cases of acute respiratory infection in 2014, a 30% increase since 2010.  The World Health Organization says 13 of the top 20 most polluted cities worldwide are in India. In China, Beijing has issued its first \u201cred alert\u201d smog days as the nation\u2019s notorious pollution has returned with a vengeance this winter. Indeed, the now banned-in-China online documentary \u201cUnder the Dome\u201d spoke of premature deaths of up to 500,000 people from cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory disease. And in Southeast Asia, a haze from fires used to clear forest land in Indonesia darkened the region, closing schools and businesses. Thousands sought care for respiratory ailments and at least 19 deaths were reported in Indonesia. Also important not to forget is Nepal, whose people suffered through two huge earthquakes that claimed more than 8,000 lives. It got even worse for the country with what has been described as an \u201cunofficial blockade\u201d of goods such as fuel and medicine along the border with India over demands by Madhesis communities calling for greater representation in Nepal\u2019s constitution. If an alleged extra $700 million shows up in your accounts, and you are Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak \u2013 or any prime minister for that matter \u2013 expect investigations and protests to follow. That was the state of affairs following The Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting earlier this year that money possibly linked to the financially troubled 1Malaysia Development Berhad might have found its way into Najib\u2019s personal accounts. The state-owned investment company had been founded in part by Najib to invest in property, infrastructure and energy projects. Najib has countered that the money was a donation from Middle East backers. Investigations into the case continue, with Swiss and U.S. authorities possibly involved after news that financial institutions from these countries were involved. Last year, we gave Asia\u2019s \u201cnew management\u201d \u2013 India\u2019s Narendra Modi and Indonesia\u2019s Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo along with China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe \u2013 the award for best year in Asia. Prime Minister Modi and President Jokowi were seen as pro-business and reform-minded with agendas that had the potential to kick into high gear their countries\u2019 economies. What difference a year makes.  Entrenched economic interests and a little \u201cbric\u201d \u2013 bureaucracy, regulation, interventionism and corruption \u2013 continue to impede the structural changes needed to attract more foreign direct investment and drive long-term job creation. Struggling Chinese and Japanese economies, Jokowi\u2019s declining approval ratings and the defeat of Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party in two regional elections signal that the honeymoon is over. Disagreements over \u201crule of origin\u201d and pharmaceutical and dairy products threatened to delay once again the conclusion of negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a major international trade pact. But on October 5 came news that negotiators had overcome all obstacles and reached agreement. Begun in 2007 as an exploratory services and investment negotiation between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore and the United States, the TPP now encompasses 12 Pacific Rim nations and covers almost 40% of world trade. TPP signatories must now ratify the deal. That is where the hard work truly begins \u2013 especially in the United States, where trade agreements don\u2019t fare well during an election year. When China first floated the idea of establishing a new development bank to help finance Asia\u2019s infrastructure, critics countered whether it was necessary. Others feared a new China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank would become an extension of Chinese power and a further challenge to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, led respectively by American and Japanese presidents. The United States and Japan in particular also raised questions about governance and project-lending \u201cstandards\u201d at the AIIB. But money talks. The United Kingdom was the first U.S. ally to break ranks with the Obama administration over joining the new AIIB. Nearly 60 nations ultimately signed on as founding members of the new $100 billion institution, including many in territorial disputes with China in the resource-rich South China Sea.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD party appears to have won big in Myanmar elections But Suu Kyi can't become president because of military-drafted law Robertson: The NLD must start by revoking rights-abusing laws After more than 50 years of military-backed government, the people of Myanmar said this past Sunday they have had enough. Voters provided what appears to be a landslide victory to long-time opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. While returns will likely trickle in for another several days, the NLD is on track to win as many as two-thirds of the seats in the upper and lower houses of parliament. But those asking when the inauguration day will be for \u201cAmay Suu\u201d (Mother Suu) are jumping the gun. This election victory is best seen as the start of a negotiation process between people power and the entrenched, constitutionally guaranteed power of the Tatmadaw, Myanmar\u2019s much-feared army. When drafting the 2008 Constitution, the army did their math, setting out that 25% of parliamentary seats must be appointed by the military, and then requiring that any constitutional amendment have 75% support. And then they added other constitutional assurances, including creating a coup mechanism in waiting that empowers the military-dominated National Defense and Security Council to seize power if it unilaterally declares a \u201cstate of emergency.\u201d Aung San Suu Kyi: The Nelson Mandela of Myanmar? The constitution also requires that only serving military officers can lead the three most powerful ministries \u2013 Defense, Home Affairs, and Border Affairs \u2013 and prevents legislative scrutiny of the military\u2019s budget. The military also added constitutional article 59(f), a special provision obviously crafted with Suu Kyi in mind.  That article prohibits from the presidency any person whose children are citizens of another country \u2013 both of Suu Kyi\u2019s adult sons have British citizenship. Suu Kyi has stated that she will be in charge anyway \u2013 \u201cabove the president\u201d as she put it in a pre-election press conference \u2013 but that is contrary to yet another constitutional article and sure to face opposition from the army and the military-aligned former ruling party, the Union and Solidarity Development Party. Myanmar\u2019s hidden war So once again, the NLD and the Burmese people are stuck in a box of the military\u2019s design that negates both human rights and respect for democratic principles.  The way forward is to chip away at the laws and institutions that entrench military rule and have protected the generals from accountability for decades. Myanmar's hidden war For too long, Burmese officials have had a full tool kit of laws to justify political repression and criminalize basic freedoms to express views, hold peaceful protests, and establish organizations. With its parliamentary majority, the NLD can start by revoking or reforming dozens of rights-abusing laws and provisions of the criminal code to bring them into compliance with international human rights standards. This won\u2019t do away with the military\u2019s constitutional straightjacket, but it will free the Burmese people to assert more basic rights over time, burnish the NLD\u2019s reform credentials, and ensure the people\u2019s support for the long struggle ahead against entrenched military power.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Andrew Finn is associate with the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. President Barack Obama on Friday rejected the proposed Keystone XL pipeline Andrew Finn: Pipeline became a magnet for lobbying dollars and media debate President Barack Obama\u2019s rejection Friday of an application to build a controversial pipeline closes a chapter on what has proven to be the most discussed energy issue during his administration. In a way, the controversy the Keystone XL pipeline generated is surprising. After all, while the merits of the project have been debated ad-nauseam, the pipeline\u2019s impact on greenhouse gas emissions would have been relatively minor compared to other proposed projects and regulations around the globe. But once KXL became a litmus test for environmental stewardship, the pipeline became a magnet for lobbying dollars and media debate. How did this relatively innocuous project generate such opposition? In part, the KXL application suffered from historically bad timing. The previous Alberta-to-United States pipeline, the Alberta Clipper, was quickly and quietly approved in 2009 by the Obama administration. But the Keystone XL application, submitted during the waning days of the Bush administration, rose to prominence shortly after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster; the spill of Canadian bitumen in Kalamazoo, Michigan, the same year; and the defeat of the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill in the Senate in 2009. Rebuffed within sight of its decades-long goal of accounting for fossil fuels\u2019 greenhouse gas externalities, and buoyed by large and visible accidents, many environmentalists sought to block projects that would increase emissions. Of course, one of the struggles for the environmental community has been the search for tangible targets upon which to focus their efforts. Global warming as a concept has proved a nebulous and ill-defined villain, and while man-made global warming seems to contribute to anomalous weather phenomena, the extent is difficult to measure and can be hard to comprehend. This has made raising awareness and promoting solutions to climate change more difficult to explain and act upon. Another challenge has been the long-term nature of climate change, which does not lend itself to short election cycles, and the short-term expectations of shareholders. With such factors in mind, it was easy to turn Keystone XL into a proxy for the fight \u2013 a tangible foe that could be vanquished in a relatively short time. Potent images of wildlife and property damage galvanize public attention and make the fight against climate change less academic and more emotional. And environmentalists opposed to the project had some strange bedfellows. Once the new route was proposed, Nebraska approved the project only to run headlong into a coalition of environmental activists and conservative groups concerned about eminent domain. On the other side, proponents included many labor and federal conservative lawmakers allied in support of the project. This dynamic created a confused and fluid political situation, which in turn made the project a magnet for lobbying dollars and media attention. As environmental groups learned during the cap-and-trade defeat, dealing with Congress can be a Byzantine process, with many different interests seemingly pulling in different directions. Indeed, even with a sympathetic president and majorities in the House and Senate, success was never guaranteed. Conversely, the power to approve cross-border infrastructure like KXL is vested in the president and the State Department. This simpler approval process was extremely attractive to both sides of the debate. So, after much huffing and puffing over KXL, where do we stand? America\u2019s climate commitments have advanced, but much of the impetus has been placed on the states through the Clean Power Plan, which still has a long and arduous fight ahead of it in the court system. The shale revolution, meanwhile, has added a massive competitor to the oil sands, while oil prices under $50 a barrel placed KXL on shakier economic footing. For its part, Canada has seen its other energy infrastructure projects thwarted, with only the TransMountain expansion and the Energy East pipeline still drawing breath. While a parade of Canadian cabinet ministers and an unprecedented lobbying campaign did persuade some Democrats to support the project, in the end they could not persuade the one man who ultimately mattered. Now that the project has been rejected, look for both the House and Senate energy committees to move legislation to take the authority for pipeline project approval away from the executive branch. With one major victory over the fossil fuel industry, both green and \u201cNot in My Backyard\u201d opposition to energy infrastructure projects will continue to grow throughout the continent. For Canadians, in particular the recently departed Conservative government, the rejection of the project will reverberate for some time. Now, however, the new Trudeau government, the Obama administration, and the next American administration will have the opportunity to create a more constructive dialogue about the fight against climate change and our shared energy infrastructure.

The United Nations and human rights groups say the case is politically motivated and comes against a backdrop of human rights abuses in the tiny nation. Current Vice-President Ahmed Adheeb attempts to answer these claims in the context of the numerous challenges facing the Indian Ocean island paradise. The views expressed are his own. Rights groups say President Mohamed Nasheed's conviction was political Nasheed has been in jail since March, serving a 13-year sentence He tried to impose a new bench of judges without parliamentary approval, says Adheeb As the Maldives celebrates 50 years since its independence from Britain, it\u2019s worth remembering that our small island nation was for centuries the plaything of colonial powers \u2013 fought over by the Portuguese, Dutch and finally the British, from whom we gained full control in 1965. Soon after the country became a global magnet for tourism as international air travel connected our remote archipelago with the world. It did not take long for our country to become synonymous with paradise on Earth. Maldivians are proud of the stunning atolls and islands that we call home. We are equally thankful for the visitors that provide the backbone to our small but burgeoning economy. Maldivians share the same desire to prosper as other peoples. But what has been lost amongst the images of idyllic beaches and azure waters is that this is a developing nation like any other \u2013 with its own economic challenges, social fissures and political sparring. Our transformation into multi-party democracy has not been without its challenges. Only this week, former President Mohamed Nasheed, who was defeated in the most recent 2013 election, attended a hearing in the Maldives High Court on the progress of an appeal \u2013 brought by the Prosecutor General himself \u2013 against charges that Nasheed unlawfully arrested a senior judge during his tenure. Nasheed is now serving a jail term for what many, even within his own political coalition, saw as a dangerous assault on the independence of the judiciary. Even before this incident, President Nasheed had padlocked the Supreme Court and attempted to impose a new bench of judges without parliamentary approval \u2013 something against the fundamental democratic principles of any nation. The Island President President Nasheed certainly gained notoriety for his underwater cabinet meeting to highlight climate change, as well as attracting several high profile friends in the United States. His current lawyer, Amal Clooney, is an example of his celebrity status amongst many. Yet this current case must look beyond carefully crafted public relations. It will be a test of the strength of Maldives institutions \u2013 of the judiciary and of parliament especially. That the Maldivian High Court, known for its fierce independence, is proceeding with the appeal process against the government\u2019s decision is a positive step. The government, for one, will look forward to participating in a legal process that we are determined will be free of interference on all sides \u2013 foreign or domestic. Yet the challenges facing the Maldives go far beyond the dispute over the conduct of a former President. And these matter to the world, not just to our small nation. This week, another Maldivian family was returned to us from Turkey as they attempted to cross the border into Syria to join Islamic State. It is estimated that 100 Maldivians are currently fighting for the extremist group, while five have already been killed fighting in Syria and Iraq. Maldives president 'forced to resign' As many western nations have themselves discovered, the answer to homegrown extremism is complex. In the Maldives we know that the lure of a life as a foreign fighter finds a fertile recruiting ground amongst the unemployed and dispossessed. Those that feel they have no part to play in a system that has pushed them to the periphery. We are proud of the economic advances that have been made so far \u2013 the Maldives is the highest ranking in South Asia in the Global Development Index, as well as ranked by the UN as an MDG+ country \u2013 but much hard work remains. The global response to extremism must be unified and coordinated, and we are ready to play our part in that conversation. History presents a litany of young states that have taken decades to build the democratic institutions to accommodate the often diverse and opposing views that emerged from the vacuum left by the withdrawal of the colonial powers. From Asia, to Africa, to South America, a period of one-party rule was not uncommon in the aftermath of independence. In the Maldives it was no different. Yet in this jubilee year, we can look back on the emergence of a true multiparty democracy over the last decade, with several successful and peaceful elections and a vibrant opposition party that has also recently served in government. Our political landscape continues to flourish, with party coalitions forming and shifting, and power-changing hands without blood being spilled on the streets. In recent years our media has grown bolder in its criticism of government policy. On social media, young activists have found a channel to hold politicians to account. While all of this often leads to uncomfortable reading for ministers and lawmakers, we all understand that a free press is a vital pillar to genuine democratic reform. For decades, our nation was rarely seen outside holiday brochures and picture postcards. Now in our 50th year Maldivians are becoming accustomed to their country appearing on international news channels. How we respond to the growing pains of a young democracy, as well as a dangerous and untested new security threat in the form of Islamic militancy, is of crucial importance. This struggle in paradise is new territory in a region of ever-shifting dynamics and dangers. How we meet those challenges will set the course for the next 50 years.",

Felix Sanchez: Donald Trump lambasted Mexico, Latinos in his presidential announcement He says Univision rightly cut ties with Trump; NBC and the GOP should do the same When Donald Trump began his historic quest for the Republican presidential nomination, he said:  \u201cWhen do we beat Mexico at the border? They\u2019re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. \u2026 When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They are bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime.  They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d The mainstream majority laughed off the bully\u2019s harsh rhetoric and hardly noticed the world stage humiliation of Mexican Americans and their brethren Latinos.  Despite all the \u201coutreach\u201d and reform talk by the GOP, it only took a few seconds for Latinos to once again become the Republican Party\u2019s favorite punching bag. Where was the reaction from the chair of the Republican National Committee, the Republican presidential contenders or Republican congressional or state leaders? A loud and public shaming of 54 million Latinos in the United States had occurred, but apparently, neither the GOP leadership nor the national media had completely understood the depth of the insult. It has been indelibly etched in the consciousness of U.S. Latinos, however, and in that of our \u201cgood\u201d neighbors across our southern border. The irreparable damage has been done. Donald Trump doubles down on calling Mexicans 'rapists' Following Trump\u2019s presidential bid announcement last week, a groundswell of Latino reaction to his blanket character defamation began bubbling up online and on social media. Trump\u2019s  repugnant charges were heard loud and clear, and Latino voters were outraged and incensed at both his audacity and the outright lies.  But the Latino community has also been deeply frustrated, not only by the depth of the insult but by the media\u2019s inadequate interpretation of Trump\u2019s remarks. Multi-generational Latinos who count Mexico as their heritage homeland have reached a tipping point and will no longer accept being a scapegoat for all America\u2019s woes. Univision understood the Latino dynamic and recognized its moral imperative to respond as a U. S. corporate citizen by standing up for the honor and rights of its viewers. The company said it would not air the Miss USA Pageant, partly owned by Trump. Univision\u2019s decision exemplified civil rights leadership in the digital age. Univision would not allow Latinos to be forced into the back of the bus by Trump. Univision would not allow Trump to profit from the Latino community. Univision would not allow its loyal audience to be disrespected one more time by the jingoistic slogans of a false prophet. Latinos have been galvanized by Trump\u2019s treacherous litany of alleged Latino sins. And the outlook is bleak for institutions that do not break with him. Donald Trump in the public eye Latino artists \u2014 from all ethnic stripes \u2014 have also withdrawn from their respective roles on the 2015 Miss USA Pageant, they include:  J Balvin, Cristi\u00e1n De La Fuente, Roselyn Sanchez and Zuleyka Rivera.  Latinos from all ethnicities have united to demand zero tolerance from institutions who would turn a blind eye and continue their business of political engagement with individuals, like Trump, who recklessly has sullied the national reputation of Latinos, solely to achieve power and profit. Has the Republican Party not learned anything from the 2012 presidential election, when Mitt Romney called for self-deportation, which resulted in a mass exodus of Latinos from the Republican column? The Republican Party has shredded its credibility, and its failure to shun Donald Trump and to demand his exit from the presidential race is proof positive that nothing substantive has changed, only the window dressing. The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), of which the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts (NHFA) is a member, represents 39 of the preeminent national Latino organizations. NHLA has called upon NBC Universal to follow Univision\u2019s lead and to both withdraw from the Miss USA telecast and terminate its financial relationship with Donald Trump. If both the Republican Party and NBCU turn a blind eye or tacitly continue to work with a person who espouses such bigoted rhetoric, it is clear that the Latino community will express its disgust and assert its power, not just through TV ratings but also at the polls.

Akhil Amar: Lincoln's two biggest legacies, keeping union together and abolishing slavery, had Midwestern roots Lincoln saw the federal government as pre-eminent and believed there was no logical border for dividing the U.S. As Americans mark the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s death this week, let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages, but also belongs, in a special way, to Illinois. Lincoln\u2019s two greatest legacies \u2013 indivisible union and irreversible emancipation \u2013 grew organically from his Midwestern roots. He knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton. The entire region from the Appalachians to the Rockies drained through the Mississippi River, enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through New Orleans and from there to the world. He thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular, or Dixie more generally. The U.S. landmass, he insisted, \u201cis  well adapted to be the home of one national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more\u201d because \u201cthere is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide.\u201d Lincoln supplemented his Midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly Midwestern claim about constitutional history: \u201cThe Union is older than any of the States; and in fact, it created them as States.\u201d Lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case, and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the Constitution\u2019s text clearly prohibits unilateral secession. The Constitution is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land \u2013 no matter what an individual state says. An actor, a president and the crime of the 19th century But Lincoln\u2019s additional assertion that the Union created the states, not vice versa, provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country. Most Virginians, including Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, insisted that of course Virginia had come first!  At the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Old Dominion was already a century and a half old. Generations of Lees had helped govern Virginia long before the United States was born. But if Lee was, first and always, a Virginian, Lincoln was an American. His father came from Virginia, his grandfather hailed from Pennsylvania, and before that, the family had probably lived in New England. Abe himself had been born in Kentucky and had moved as a boy to Indiana, and later, as a young man, to Illinois. These latter two Midwestern states had undeniably been formed by the Union itself. These places had begun as federal territory \u2013 the common inheritance of all Americans \u2013 and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life. If Lee was, first and always, a Virginian, Lincoln was an American. Akhil Reed Amar When young Abe moved to Indiana, it was just becoming a state, thanks to federal governmental action. It was a wise set of federal policies \u2013 proper land surveys and a commitment to public education \u2013 that had drawn the Lincolns and countless other Kentuckians to leave the Bluegrass State for a brighter future in the Midwest. Retracing Lincoln\u2019s assassination 150 years later That brighter future also involved freedom from slavery. The Old Northwest had always been free soil, as provided for by a Northwest Ordinance that predated the U.S. Constitution.  The words of the 13th  Amendment \u2013 the only constitutional amendment that Lincoln would live to sign \u2013 promised to end slavery everywhere in America and did so by borrowing verbatim from Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance. Then and now: Sites from Lincoln's assassination True, geography is not inexorable destiny. Many other Midwesterners in Lincoln\u2019s era embraced slavery and secession. Hugo Black, the Supreme Court justice who did the most to make Lincoln\u2019s constitutional vision a reality over the next century, was born and raised in Alabama. But geographic variation has always been a large part of America\u2019s constitutional saga. In the 1860 election that brought him to power, Lincoln swept almost all the Northern states, but did miserably in the slaveholding south. John Wilkes Booth, the dastard who ended Lincoln\u2019s life 150 years ago this week, was an embittered extremist from a slave state. So was Lincoln\u2019s nemesis on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger Taney. Taney\u2019s most infamous ruling, the pro-slavery Dred Scott decision in 1857, had emerged from a court dominated by the South; although slave states accounted for less a third of America\u2019s free population, this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court. Remembering Lincoln\u2019s murder Myths, mysteries and the Lincoln assassination In our era, given the fact that Republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years, the court has been rather moderate. Much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern Republicans on the Court \u2013 most notably, Minnesota\u2019s Harry Blackmun, Illinois\u2019 John Paul Stevens, and New Hampshire\u2019s David Souter. All nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal New England, at Harvard or Yale, and the Republican appointee most attentive to gay rights, Anthony Kennedy, grew up in northern California, a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles. Which takes us back to Lincoln. When Anthony Kennedy was a lad in California\u2019s state capital, the governor, a friend of the Kennedy family, was a Lincoln Republican named Earl Warren \u2013 a man who would later author the Court\u2019s iconic opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by Lincoln and his allies. Today, both parties at their best claim Lincoln. Jeb Bush aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and Rand Paul is a Kentuckian who professes interest in racial outreach. Hillary Clinton was born an Illinois Republican. And the leader of her adopted political party \u2013 who also happens to be president \u2013 is a lanky and brainy lawyer from Illinois who knows how to give a good speech, and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating Lincoln\u2019s geographic coalition, winning every state within a four-hour drive of Chicago. Today, both parties at their best claim Lincoln. Akhil Reed Amar In the largest sense, then, all Americans, of both parties and all regions \u2013 whether or not they have ever set foot in Illinois \u2013 are living in the Land of Lincoln.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. For the past century, screenwriters have created many great political characters imprinted in our minds Here are the 7 best fictional politicians from TV series -- who would you vote for? Politicians themselves may have their faults, but recently we\u2019ve been thinking that perhaps wickedly inventive screenwriters should shoulder some of the blame for disillusioned, apathetic voters. It\u2019s possible that they\u2019ve raised public expectations by creating characters that we prefer to watch \u2013 leaving us underwhelmed by the banal and predictable platitudes of the real life party mouthpieces. After all \u2013 who would you rather listen to in a political debate \u2013 Jed Bartlet (The West Wing) or Jeb Bush? Or in Number 10 would Ed Miliband or Hugh Grant (Love Actually) be more likely to get the public\u2019s attention? For the past century the entertainment industry has created political characters with guile and gusto, who speak their minds and damn the consequences. The more you think about it, the more you realize how many great charismatic, dramatic and sometimes hilarious characters have been created by top notch screenwriters. Think Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi) \u2013 the foul-mouthed spin-doctor and kingmaker in the BBC\u2019s The Thick of It or poor old Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington) of Yes Minister fame \u2013 bullied and cajoled by his manipulative permanent secretary Sir Humphrey (Nigel Hawthorne). Here are seven of the best \u2013 an election between these formidable opponents would certainly be something to sit up and pay attention to. Who would you vote for? This drama about Danish coalition politics features Birgitte Nyborg, a strong but conflicted female prime minister (Sidse Babett Knudsen). A 2013 survey by the Copenhagen Business School suggested that the show had helped viewers become more engaged with real life politics. With just the right amount of personal baggage to make her \u201crelatable\u201d to the public but with enough material to be \u201cmonstered\u201d by the tabloids on a daily basis, riding on her campaign bus would be a blast. Martin Sheen\u2019s performance as the Democratic White House incumbent Bartlet captured the hearts and minds of American and UK viewers. A poll saw the fictional president with a popularity rating of 81%, compared with that of the real life President Obama at 48%. Campaign in poetry, govern in prose is the adage. But Bartlet is so principled he wants to govern in poetry also. Such strong principles are certainly attractive in today\u2019s climate of rampant mistrust \u2013 he would never have to resort to erecting an 8ft stone tablet engraved with six \u201ccommandments\u201d in the rose garden to try to convince. Enough of these professional politicians. How about if an ordinary Northern housewife took it upon herself to be prime minister? Screenwriter Sally Wainwright imagines just this in The Amazing Mrs Pritchard, starring Jane Horrocks. Fed up with the same tired old party politics Mrs Pritchard\u2019s refreshingly honest no-nonsense talk grabs the public\u2019s imagination and projects her straight into Number 10. There\u2019s a great scene where she\u2019s confronted in the toilets prior to a crucial TV debate by Janet McTeer\u2019s hardened Tory MP who hopes to psych out her inexperienced opponent \u2013 but Mrs Pritchard manages to turn the tables and unsettles her rival just before they go on air (by offering her a top job in her new government). Great fun, and an appealing prospect, but I\u2019m not sure she\u2019d see such success amongst this formidable bunch. Ian Richardson plays the unscrupulous Francis Urquhart in this classic political tale. He\u2019s a silky, smooth, duplicitous civil servant who enters politics and climbs the greasy pole inch by murderous inch until he becomes prime minister. Adapted by the soon to be doyen of the TV adaptation Andrew Davies, this is politics as we dread it, decisions made behind doors, the public good subservient to individual political desires and ambitions. Urquhart \u2014 a devious, manipulative individual \u2013 addresses the audience directly and honestly, recognizing and relishing his own evil irresistible ambition. No thanks. Or what about the more recent reimagining of House of Cards for a U.S. audience? Starring Kevin Spacey as the ruthless president, he\u2019s a sophisticated and dangerous creation whose political double-dealings would put Machiavelli to shame. This is a brilliant show that reaches a new generation of potential voters, asking awkward questions about the motivation of politicians. The ultimate backstage, behind closed doors ruler-ship \u2013 somewhat reminiscent of Mandelson. It seems probable that Underwood would trample all these others underfoot \u2013 we\u2019d reach the ballot box and find that his was the only name there. Ed Miliband might now have his own fan club but he\u2019s unlikely to be able to compete with 1970s heart throb Robert Redford when it comes to attracting female followers. Redford stars as Bill McKay in The Candidate, a wet-behind-the-ears US senatorial contender for the Democrats who is expected to lose by a landslide and therefore feels free to speak his mind. He\u2019s funny and smart and resists the urges of his safety-first spin doctors \u2014 and in doing so convinces the electorate that there is another way. He\u2019s also wonderfully human, as illustrated in the scene where he gets the giggles half way through a vital political broadcast. None of these appeal? Then how about a Roman general, transposed into the modern world. Skillful, ruthless, slightly foolhardy soldier turned reluctant politician Caius Marcius Coriolanus won\u2019t bow down to his public any more than he would his enemies. The inner life of politician is so often hidden to voters that those who seem natural are anomalies. Coriolanus\u2019s explicit disdain for politicking separates him not only from other politicians, his mentor, his powerful mother, but ultimately from the people he seeks to rule. How he\u2019d react to the amplified political wrangling of our world is a scary thing to contemplate. So who\u2019d get your ballot paper cross? Birgitte would be a good bet for those favouring a coalition; Barlet if you like tough but fair; Pritchard for the romantic dreamers; Underwood and Urquhart for the ruthless pragmatists; Coriolanus for those in favour of the iron fist. But it\u2019s Redford\u2019s Bill McKay who would seem best to capture the mood of the moment \u2013 a population desperate for something fresh, honest and unscripted. So don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you that politics can\u2019t be invigorating and dramatic. It can: in the world of make-believe at least.
