            "article_content": "The Supreme Court says a 35-foot no-protest zone around clinics that perform abortions is unconstitutional. Left unsaid in the 30-page ruling issued Thursday in a Massachusetts case was that the court itself has tight restrictions on where those seeking to assert their free speech rights can and cannot go. And like the case they just decided, the rules at the marble-lined high court have also been the subject of lawsuits. The grounds outside the building \u2013 across the street from the U.S. Capitol \u2013 have long been a place for assemblies, rallies, and other \u201cexpressive events.\u201d But exactly just what can be said and where the public can assert its First Amendment rights have long been a source of contention. A year ago, after losing a federal lawsuit filed by a protester, high court officials issued new rule, clarifying a 60-year-old law blocking any demonstrations on court property, including the marbled plaza that serves as the dramatic gateway to the building itself. \u201cThe term demonstration includes demonstrations, picketing, speechmaking, marching, holding vigils or religious services and all other like forms of conduct that involve the communication or expression of views or grievances, engaged in by one or more persons, the conduct of which is reasonably likely to draw a crowd or onlookers,\u201d says the revised Regulation 7, which was effective June 13, 2013. \u201cThe term does not include casual use by visitors or tourists that is not reasonably likely to attract a crowd or onlookers.\u201d The comparison was not lost on several bloggers, legal analysts, and by some abortion rights groups. NARAL Pro Choice America had earlier showed an aerial shot of the Supreme Court, with a graphic revealing that the 35-foot buffer zone adopted by Massachusetts at clinics is but a fraction of the court\u2019s oval-shaped exterior plaza, where protests are also banned. The plaza extends about 250 feet from the base of the courthouse steps to the sidewalk, and is open 24 hours a day. The building itself keeps normal business hours, and is closed weekends to the public. \u201cThe justices didn\u2019t have to look too far for examples of other buffer zones raising constitutional concerns,\u201d said Stephen Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at American University. \u201cBut unlike Massachusetts, which will likely respond to today\u2019s decision simply by adopting a smaller buffer going forward, the justices\u2019 response was in the other direction \u2013 to prohibit all demonstrations of any kind on the Supreme Court\u2019s grounds other than those \u2018not reasonably likely to attract a crowd.\u2019 In other words, the justices are telling Massachusetts to prohibit less speech, when their reaction to the same problem on the court\u2019s own grounds was to prohibit more.\u201d But unlike the state case \u2013 where the buffer zone at the clinic in Boston included the entire sidewalk\u2013 the court\u2019s no-protest zone only includes the grounds itself. Demonstrations are freely allowed on the public sidewalk, and protesters of one sort or another gather on almost a daily basis. Several people were on hand Thursday, and more are expected Monday for the court\u2019s final public session before the summer recess. The court changes followed a federal judge\u2019s ruling tossing out as unconstitutional the previous anti-demonstration rules. Judge Beryl Howell said those laws were overly broad and vague, and could implicate any \u201cgroup activity\u201d on the grounds, including students wearing T-shirts with the name of their school, or tourists gathering on the plaza for a group photo. Federal law gives individual buildings and agencies, including courts, discretion to set their own security and access procedures. Harold Hodge, Jr., had challenged the regulations in court. The Maryland college student was arrested in February 2011 for silently carrying an anti-racism sign on the plaza, although court records show he did so peacefully. A court police officer approached Hodge and three times asked him to leave the plaza, but he refused. He was then handcuffed and taken into custody. The charges were dropped after Hodge agreed not to return to the court for six months. He later sued, claiming his free speech rights were being violated and that he had a right to protest on government property. A Virginia-based civil rights group, the Rutherford Institute, defended Hodge in his case. The group\u2019s president, John Whitehead, told CNN the high court\u2019s rules set by its marshal\u2019s office were \u201crepugnant\u201d to the guarantees enshrined in the Constitution. The government appealed the judge\u2019s ruling and a federal appeals court in Washington will hear oral arguments in the case in September. Protests, rallies, speeches, and marches in front of the court often number in the hundreds of people, and are traditionally held on the public sidewalk on First Street, NE, between the court and the Capitol. Demonstrators gathered for days during the 2000 Bush v. Gore case over the disputed outcome of the presidential election. And those on both sides of the abortion debate rally yearly in front of the court on the January anniversary of Roe v. Wade decision. The Supreme Court had no comment on how Thursday\u2019s ruling on abortion clinics would affect its own regulations.",

            "article_content": "The congressional spending bill blocks Washington, DC lawmakers from implementing marijuana legalization D.C. marijuana activists' worst fears were realized on Tuesday night with the agreed upon language Congress, under the district's Home Rule charter, is able to veto every law approved by either DC voters or government \"This House language sucks,\" said Adam Eidinger, chair of the DC Cannabis Campaign The congressional spending bill agreed to on Tuesday night blocks Washington, DC lawmakers from using federal or local funds to implement November\u2019s popularly passed referendum to legalize marijuana in the district. The legislation, according to a release from Republican Rep. Hal Rogers, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, \u201cprohibits both federal and local funds from being used to implement a referendum legalizing recreational marijuana use in the district.\u201d The language in the bill \u2013 found on page 660 of the 1,603 page document \u2013 is word-for-word what Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland proposed earlier in the year. \u201cNone of the funds contained in this act may be used to enact or carry out any law, rule or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or distribution of any schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act or any tetrhydrocannabinols derivative for recreational purposes,\u201d reads the bill. DC marijuana activists\u2019 worst fears were realized on Tuesday night with the agreed upon language. Earlier in the day, activists worried that Congress would thwart November\u2019s popular vote to legalize pot in the district. \u201cThis House language sucks,\u201d Adam Eidinger, chair of the DC Cannabis Campaign, said after the language was released. \u201cOnly the Senate can step up and do something or presidential veto. Otherwise our election has just been overturned and we will take it to the streets.\u201d In response to the Congress\u2019 decision, pro-marijuana groups are prepared to protest Wednesday night. Although the proposal needs to pass the House and Senate and get signed into law by the President, it appears unlikely the Democrats will risk shutting down the government to remove the marijuana language. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who believes that DC should be able to do what it wants, admitted to reporters earlier today that \u201cif they put it in there, it\u2019s going to be hard to take it out.\u201d And in announcing the deal, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-New York, said that although she \u201cstrongly oppose[s] several policy riders included in this final agreement \u2026 I am pleased Democrats were able to eliminate many of the most damaging provisions.\u201d By moving to stop legalization efforts in DC, Congress will have trumped the over 70 percent of district residents who voted to legalize marijuana in November. Congress, under DC\u2019s Home Rule charter, is able to veto every law approved by either DC voters or government. In the past, this power has been used to block everything from abortion spending to needle exchange. During the 2011 budget negotiations, President Barack Obama reportedly used the district\u2019s law of paying for low-income women\u2019s abortions as a bargaining chip with House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cJohn, I will give you DC abortion. I am not happy about it,\u201d Obama said, according to The Washington Post. This is your body on weed Can states afford NOT to legalize pot? Exclusive: Obama talks about pot \u201cThis was always a possibility but I think it is very, very disturbing that Democrats have given this away,\u201d said Michael Collins, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, a group that lobbied for the DC law. \u201cThis is really one of the final acts of Democratic leadership before Republicans control both sides and for them to give this away, it just seems to very tone deaf.\u201d The DC Cannabis Campaign, the group who introduced and passed the legalization ballot initiative, also blamed congressional Democrats for blocking the legislation. \u201cThis is a big issue and if you are going to overturn an election, you are going to demoralize young Democrats across the country,\u201d said Eidinger said. DC Mayor-elect Muriel Bowser has not yet commented on the possibility of Congress addressing the district\u2019s marijuana law. But her spokesman, Joaquin McPeek, before the language came out on Tuesday that Bowser \u201cwould hope that Congress would respect the will of the voters and reject any challenge to their rights.\u201d With Congress blocking marijuana funding, expect many DC residents to cry foul about what they calling living under the thump of Congress. \u201cThis is nothing new,\u201d said Mark Plotkin, a longtime figure in DC politics. \u201cWe are a colony. We are America\u2019s colony and anytime they want to screw around with us, they can do such things.\u201d What\u2019s more, while Congress is making decisions for the district, proponents of district autonomy were quick to point out that district residents still have no voting member of the House or Senate.

            "article_content": "Torture report was a powerful moment for Feinstein While some in California clamor for new leaders, Feinstein mum on plans Over her long career, Feinstein has defied labels The irony of Dianne Feinstein\u2019s center-stage moment this week was palpable. Just as she is leaving her coveted position as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, handing the reins to the incoming Republican majority \u2014 and as questions abound in her home state about whether she will retire \u2013 she seemed to reach the pinnacle of her power, once again showing willingness to buck members of her party and wave off critics. Facing few political consequences in California where her Senate seat is firmly in her grasp, Feinstein, 81, was defiant as she took the Senate floor Tuesday to announce the release of a 525-page summary of the Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on the CIA\u2019s treatment of detainees \u2014the product of five years of line-by-line scrutiny of some six million internal government documents. Congress spars over CIA torture report Feinstein outlines intel report on Senate floor Report details detainee death, neglect It was a scorching condemnation of the harsh interrogation techniques of the Bush era with the striking conclusion that those \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d tactics had failed to produce information that thwarted terrorist attacks or led to the apprehension of terrorist suspects. In fact, Feinstein said, torture often led to \u201cfalse information.\u201d Even in a post-Sept. 11th era, the techniques revealed \u2013 mock executions, waterboarding, detainees stripped and chained to a concrete floor, others deprived of sleep for up to 180 hours \u2013 were chilling. Arrows flew at Feinstein from many directions. She was under pressure from Secretary of State John Kerry to delay the release of the report until the New Year, but did not buckle. The CIA scoffed at the report\u2019s \u201cflawed analyses of the techniques\u201d and refuted its central conclusion that their procedures had failed to prevent attacks. The FBI issued a warning that the report could spark a reaction from violent extremists. READ: Takeaways from the torture report Republican critics like Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida took to Twitter deriding the document as \u201ca one-sided partisan Senate report that now places American lives in danger.\u201d Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn argued that the report had vilified operatives at the CIA who should be hailed as heroes for attempting to protect the American public. Unapologetic But the one-time mayor of San Francisco, who has held her Senate seat for 22 years, was unapologetic. While it was true, she said, that the report was going out in a \u201cperiod of turmoil and instability\u201d in many corners of the world: \u201cThat\u2019s going to continue for the foreseeable future whether this report is released or not.\u201d She added that she hoped the release would show the world that \u201cAmerica is big enough to admit when it\u2019s wrong and confident enough to learn from its mistakes.\u201d Feinstein also seemed to put a point on her own legacy: \u201cHistory will judge us by our commitment to a just society governed by law and the willingness to face an ugly truth and say: \u2018Never again.\u2019\u201d READ: Torture report\u2019s most shocking passages Unlike some Senate Democrats who were voted out of office last month, Feinstein faced her critics this week without any concern of political consequences in her home state. \u201cDianne Feinstein can serve in the United States Senate for as long as she wants,\u201d said Dan Schnur, who heads the University of Southern California\u2019s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine her facing a credible challenge if she did decide to run for re-election, which puts her in the relatively rare position of not having to worry about public opinion on this.  A senator facing a precarious re-election campaign might be a little more worried about taking on the country\u2019s national security leadership.\u201d Younger generation Still, there is intense speculation within California about whether Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Boxer, who are up for re-election in 2016 and 2018, respectively, will step aside after their current terms. That would create a game of musical chairs for the younger generation of California Democrats like Attorney General Kamala Harris, Lieutenant Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and his successor, Eric Garcetti. Many Californians would like to see that fight play out. In a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, 59% percent of registered voters said California would be better off with new candidates as the state\u2019s U.S. Senators. But that does not mean that Feinstein is in danger of being tossed from her seat. The Republican Party has been decimated in California \u2013 with no viable challengers on the horizon \u2013 and it is highly unlikely that the party\u2019s younger generation would take her on. Unlike Boxer, 73, who has hinted from time to time about the possibility of retirement, Feinstein has given no indication that she is thinking about leaving the Senate. Feinstein, known across California and Capitol Hill as \u201cDiFi,\u201d has reached her enviable position as an unapologetic but sometimes unpredictable progressive with centrist tendencies. Her memorable introduction to the statewide stage in California was when she was ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1990 and delivered a speech to the Democratic state party convention embracing the death penalty. \u201cYes, I support the death penalty. It is an issue that cannot be fudged or hedged,\u201d she told the crowd, which drowned her out with a loud chorus of boos. Seeking alliances When she and Boxer were elected to the Senate in \u201cthe year of the woman\u201d in 1992, they took markedly different paths. Both championed women\u2019s issues like abortion rights. But while Boxer became known as a shrill partisan, Feinstein earned a reputation as a hard worker who continually sought alliances with colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \u201cFeinstein has been known throughout her Senate career as conciliator, someone who can bring together warring parties to find common ground on difficult issues,\u201d said Schnur. \u201cBut there are certain issues on which she doesn\u2019t compromise and she digs in and fights.\u201d Those fights have sometimes surprised her supporters and made it difficult to slap her with the label of a California liberal. She has long championed the assault weapon ban, for example, but also supported the Iraq War and defended Bush administration surveillance practices that were anathema to liberals. She notably called Edward J. Snowden\u2019s leaks of classified information about U.S. intelligence \u201can act of treason.\u201d And she infuriated liberals with her backing of the NSA\u2019s broad-reaching and covert effort to collect data from the telephone calls of Americans. She felt compelled to do so out of a sense of obligation to \u201ckeep this country safe,\u201d she told the New York Times in a 2013 interview, \u201cSo put that in your pipe and smoke it.\u201d That long history of contradictions has given Feinstein more running room than other Democrats on issues like torture, said California Democratic Strategist Dan Newman, who recently helped manage Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s re-election campaign. \u201cShe\u2019s viewed as thorough, thoughtful, and as close to non-partisan on the issue of national security as is possible in today\u2019s politically polarized environment,\u201d Newman said.  \u201cIf it was a different Democrat, it would be easier for some to be dismissive of the questions she\u2019s raising, but she\u2019s built significant credibility as a trusted voice on national security, so she has to be taken seriously.  She\u2019s raising two critical issues which will define our debate about torture in the coming months: does it make us safer, and is it something we accept as consistent with our nation\u2019s moral code?\u201d As Senate Democrats transition to the minority, some have suggested that Feinstein is at the twilight of her career. Not so fast, her allies say. She\u2019s content to let others play that political parlor game, while she remains mum about her plans. Bill Carrick, Feinstein\u2019s longtime campaign consultant who began working with her in 1989, noted that her policy agenda is still lengthy, topped with complex issues like California\u2019s water woes. As for retirement? \u201cShe doesn\u2019t spend any time thinking about that,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Mary Landrieu needs black voters to turn out in high numbers to win her runoff battle with Rep. Bill Cassidy President Barack Obama made an under-the-radar call to Louisiana Democrats to gin up excitement The number of black voters casting early ballots declined from the primary to the runoff Facing the potential for a drop in turnout among African-American voters, Sen. Mary Landrieu and the Louisiana Democratic Party have turned to drastic measures to gin up enthusiasm among that pivotal voting bloc: On Monday they, quite literally, called in the President. President Barack Obama phoned in Monday for an under-the-radar call with Landrieu, party organizers, volunteers and other grassroots supporters across Louisiana, according to a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Democratic Party. Obama said Landrieu \u201chas been an outstanding advocate on behalf of Louisiana working families every step of the way,\u201d according to a state party tweet on Monday. The lack of publicity for the call \u2013 it wasn\u2019t advertised to press or the public outside of a few tweets that were picked up by the Washington Examiner \u2013 underscores just how toxic the President remains for Landrieu. A late-October poll from Democratic firm Public Policy Polling showed 56 percent of Louisiana registered voters disapproved of the President, a number that\u2019s likely grown since then. And the fact that they went through with the call anyway emphasizes just how desperately they need African-Americans to turn out on Saturday to win. During the first round of voting in the race African-Americans made up 30 percent of the electorate, and Landrieu won 94 percent of that voting bloc, according to exit polls. But she drew only 18 percent of the white vote \u2013 just a little more than half the percent of the white vote she received in 2008, when she won. Bob Mann, a veteran Louisiana political reporter and Louisiana State University professor, said with that level of white support she\u2019d need near historic levels of African-American voters to turn out in the runoff to win. \u201cUnless they have found some sort of secret sauce to generate a significantly greater white vote than they got last time \u2013 just replicating the turnout that they got on Nov. 4 is not going to do it,\u201d he said. And early voting suggests they may be struggling even with that, as the number of African-Americans voting early decreased from the primary to the runoff by 24 percent. Kirstin Alvanitakis, communications director for the Louisiana Democratic Party, chalked this up to the fact that the early voting period fell over the holiday, making it tougher to canvass and offering voters fewer days to turn in their ballots. She said they plan to make up the difference on Election Day. That\u2019s where Obama came in. \u201cHaving him on the call, talking to our grassroots supporters, these are people who have been working very hard all through the year \u2013 it was very motivating,\u201d Alvanitakis said. On Monday Landrieu also got a boost from another African-American star, singer Stevie Wonder, who performed at a fundraiser for her. She\u2019s also running a number of radio ads on stations aimed at primarily African-American audiences, with a message of support for the President \u2013 even as she\u2019s worked to distance herself from him in others, like a radio ad out from her campaign Monday in which a woman says, \u201cwe\u2019re not voting for Obama, we\u2019re voting for us and our future.\u201d In another ad, published on Monday by BuzzFeed, Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is African-American, warned that a vote for Cassidy might mean impeachment for the President. \u201cThey have shown our President so much disrespect,\u201d Richmond says. \u201cThey said he wasn\u2019t a U.S. citizen, they even sued him and, if Cassidy wins, they will impeach him \u2026The President needs you to have his back now more than ever.\u201d Still, Mann said, turning out enough African-American voters may be an impossible task. \u201cSo it appears they\u2019re really pouring all their efforts into turning out the base, but I don\u2019t see how they get enough African-Americans to offset the deficit she faced in the last election,\u201d he said. And despite the long odds for Landrieu, Republicans aren\u2019t taking the race for granted. The Cassidy campaign is also working to boost enthusiasm among his base, bringing in former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, a conservative darling, to the state on Wednesday for a rally. Anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List has also launched a canvassing effort for the congressman targeting voters sympathetic to their cause. Indeed, Republicans increased their early vote from the Nov. 4 primary to the runoff. John Cummins, Cassidy\u2019s spokesman, said there\u2019s enthusiasm among the GOP because they want to drive home the point they made in the midterms, where Democrats suffered devastating losses in both the Senate and House. \u201cRepublicans, I think, see this as an opportunity to put an exclamation mark on what happened on Nov. 4,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Several Republicans encountered scandals since the last election They were able to win re-election despite the bad headlines You know that Republican doctor who got one of his patients pregnant and then demanded that she get an abortion? Yeah, he won Tuesday night. How about the indicted guy who threatened to throw a reporter over a Capitol Hill balcony? Yep. Him too. Election Day was packed with surprises \u2014 and some of the biggest were in House races. Two Republican members of Congress managed to win despite federal investigations and bad behavior so far-fetched that even the writer\u2019s room at \u201cScandal\u201d would take a pass on their stories. Look at Tennessee\u2019s 4th Congressional District, where Rep. Scott Desjarlais cruised to re-election over token Democratic opposition. Desjarlais, a physician by trade, was first elected in 2010, but this election marked his first time on the ballot since a full accounting of his torrid personal life burst into view two years ago. His divorce proceedings, made public in late 2012, revealed that the pro-life Republican had slept with multiple patients and impregnated one of them before pressuring her to get an abortion. He also demanded that his ex-wife terminate two pregnancies. But never mind all that: Desjarlais, who has apologized for his past, represents a conservative district and has an R next to his name. He won easily. A more genuine shock occurred in the toss-up seat of New York\u2019s 11th District, where Rep. Michael Grimm, who represents Staten Island, narrowly pulled it out in a hotly-contested race against Democrat Domenic Recchia. Grimm, a hot-headed former FBI agent and U.S. Marine, is facing a 20-count indictment stemming from his management \u2013 or mismanagement \u2013 of a Manhattan health food eatery called \u201cHealthalicious.\u201d He also became cable news fodder earlier this year after he was caught on a hot mic threatening to throw a NY1 reporter over a balcony in the Capitol rotunda after the journalist asked him about the federal investigation. \u201cI will break you in half, like a boy,\u201d Grimm snarled at him. Democrats saw what looked like an easy target and poured money poured into the district. Though Recchia looked like he came straight out of New York City central casting, Grimm proved to be the more capable campaigner. Or maybe he was just better looking. The New York Daily News nabbed the quote of the year in October when a reporter asked a female voter why she was supporting Grimm. Her answer: \u201cHe\u2019s bang-able.\u201d Also, San Diego city councilman Carl DeMaio \u2013 who faced accusations of sexual misconduct before being cleared of wrongdoing \u2013 was holding on to a very slim lead in his quest to unseat incumbent Democratic Rep. Scott Peters. The race has still not been called as of Wednesday. However, Louisiana Republican Rep. Vance McAllister, whose notoriety was tied to a video released of him kissing a campaign staffer, did not win reelection Tuesday. He finished fourth.",

            "article_content": "The National Republican Senatorial Committee held a postmortem call Thursday The Executive Director said that Democrats shied away from economic issues The focus on single issues was using a 'tactic as a strategy,' Republicans said Republicans gained at least 7 seats in the U.S. Senate in Tuesday's midterms The strategist in charge of electing a Republican Senate majority thanked Democrats on Thursday for keeping President Barack Obama on the sidelines and building their campaigns around women\u2019s issues instead of making an economic argument. Rob Collins, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told reporters in a postmortem session that Democrats \u201csidelined their best messenger\u201d by running from Obama. Making sense of the U.S. midterm results Midterms create Congressional firsts GOP delivers big blow to Dems in midterms \u201cThey were so focused on independents that they forgot they had a base,\u201d Collins said of Democratic campaigns. \u201cThey left their base behind. They became Republican-lite.\u201d The \u201cwar on women\u201d message that permeated so many Democratic campaigns up and down the ballot \u201cwas a mistake,\u201d Collins said \u2014 it used \u201ca tactic as a strategy.\u201d He praised Republican candidates for being \u201cproactive and having something to say.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t remember a Democrat who spent any kind of money in a significant way talking about the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had a choice between talking about the number one issue we saw in every single poll, and talking about a single issue, I would be talking about the number one issue.\u201d Not all Democratic campaigns ran single-issue campaigns. A number of Democrats, especially those in the party\u2019s progressive and labor wings of the party, have highlighted Tuesday winners like Al Franken in Minnesota, Gary Peters in Michigan and Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire as candidates who talked about women\u2019s issues but also weaved the debate into a larger economic theme. But even those campaigns were careful to avoid being seen as too close to the president. Collins and NRSC communications director Brad Dayspring agreed that Obama was a political lightning rod for Democrats \u2014 especially late in the campaign. But they said they were baffled that their opponents didn\u2019t use him to rally the base throughout the year and make an argument about the economic successes of the Obama administration \u2013 particularly in the purple states of Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina. \u201cIf you are running to Mark Udall\u2019s campaign, there is an argument to be made that unemployment was higher when he took office,\u201d Dayspring said. \u201cThere is an argument that gas prices were higher when he took office. But they never made it. They stuck to a flawed strategy that talked about birth control and abortion through the election. That was something we never understood.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ann Romney is slamming a slur uttered by a Democratic candidate for South Carolina governor Romney to CNN: \"It hit me right in my gut: Romney didn't say whether her husband would run for president again Ann Romney, the wife of former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, condemned South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s Democratic challenger after he mistakenly called her a \u201cwhore\u201d \u2014 and then chuckled. \u201cWhen I first heard about it, it hit me right in my gut,\u201d Romney said in a Monday phone interview with CNN. \u201cMy nerve endings went haywire. It\u2019s so upsetting when you know someone can say something like that about a woman, and not have any kind of reaction. It\u2019s so unacceptable. Nikki is a great girl and has been a great governor.\u201d The Democrat, Vincent Sheheen, made the comment at a campaign event late last week in Florence. In the midst of attacking Haley\u2019s education record, Sheheen stumbled over his words and told the crowd, \u201cWe are going to escort whore out the door.\u201d READ: Jeb Bush back in the spotlight The slip-of-the-tongue was clearly accidental, and Sheheen immediately corrected himself, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to escort her out the door.\u201d But when some in the audience picked up on the verbal faux pas and started applauding, Sheheen grinned and laughed along with people in the crowd. Video of the event went viral. Sheheen apologized for the moment in a radio interview on Monday. \u201cBut if anybody heard, and certainly my words were garbled \u2026 I apologize because I don\u2019t want to send that message to anybody,\u201d he said, according to The State newspaper. Haley leads Sheheen by double digits in recent polling and is expected to win a second term next week. Romney, who came to know Haley during the 2012 presidential campaign when she was one of the Mitt Romney\u2019s top GOP supporters, said she spoke to the governor by phone about the flare-up. Romney said the incident is discouraging to women who want to be in the political arena. Haley, she noted, weathered attacks on her personal life and her Indian-American heritage in past campaigns. \u201cWe need to make sure we have a safe place so that other women can feel like they can do this and these kinds of things aren\u2019t going to happen to them,\u201d Romney said. \u201cYou get so sick of saying there is bias out there, but if a Republican had said this, it would be blowing up in their face like nobody\u2019s business. Where is EMILY\u2019s List? Where is N.O.W.? Where are they?\u201d Romney aides made her available for an interview on Sheheen\u2019s comments. Her remarks come amid heightened interest in whether her husband will launch a third bid for the White House. She said the family has no timeline for making a decision. \u201cA lot of people are talking about it, but honestly Mitt and I aren\u2019t,\u201d Romney said. \u201cMitt has been very clear. Events may change. We don\u2019t see them changing. But you are never going to say never. Right now we are looking to see these other candidates come forward.\u201d Ann Romney still done with 2016, but never say never She offered a larger critique of the so-called Republican \u201cwar on women\u201d \u2014 a campaign strategy that Democrats used to devastating effect against Romney in 2012. Romney argued that the message has lost its potency in 2014, though Democrats say women\u2019s issues have kept them in the hunt in several tight Senate races from Colorado to North Carolina. READ: How the war on women is changing \u201cPeople are saying, this isn\u2019t working anymore,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIt was a ploy in the last election. I think they thought it was effective, and they are trying again this cycle. But I hope the electorate is getting tired of these broad brush statements that work on people\u2019s emotions, that are inaccurate, that try to marginalize one candidate or another. I get even more upset when I see other women trying to use these tactics and approaches. We have to be better than that.\u201d Romney said women voters care about a broad array of issues \u2014 national security, the economy, education \u2014 beyond just social issues like abortion rights and access to contraception.",

            "article_content": "Democratic rhetoric aimed at women isn't resonating as well as it did in 2012 Republicans are avoiding the mistakes they made with women in 2012 The GOP is putting up strong female candidates in states like Iowa and Michigan The so-called war on women that Democrats love to talk about on the campaign trail may be losing some of its luster. The attack line \u2013 aimed at painting Republicans as out of sync with women on contraception, abortion and other issues \u2013 isn\u2019t resonating like in 2012, when Democrats hurled it at the GOP with a devastating effect. Instead, Republicans have improved their standing among women during this election cycle, narrowing the gender gap in key races that could decide control of the Senate. The dynamic reflects the painstaking efforts among Republicans to avoid the mistakes of 2012. This time around, there aren\u2019t any candidates talking about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d or \u201cbinders full of women.\u201d And the GOP put up strong female candidates in states like Iowa and Michigan, making it harder for Democrats to attack them as opposed to the interests of women. Is New Hampshire about to get nasty? Ernst on DC: 'It's a mess' Are fear politics dominating the midterms? Will talk of Ebola affect polls? NH senate candidates debate Ebola crisis The strategy seems to be paying off. READ: Will last minute strength be enough for Dems? \u201cThe gender gap is smaller when Republicans don\u2019t make mistakes,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University. \u201cRepublicans this time have managed to neutralize their deficiencies in this area so the war on women rhetoric does not resonate so much.\u201d Terry O\u2019Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said Republicans are riding a \u201cperfect storm\u201d in Senate races in red states as they enjoy the knock-on effect of national factors like Ebola and ISIS, which have overshadowed social issues. \u201cThey have learned their lessons from 2012,\u201d she said. Still, Democrats aren\u2019t toning down the rhetoric. An attack ad by Democratic Sen. Mark Udall warns that the only place his opponent Cory Gardner will take Colorado women is backwards, and accused him of waging an \u201ceight year crusade that would ban birth control.\u201d Another Udall spot features a female gynecologist and obstetrician complaining that Gardner sponsored harsh anti-abortion laws. The barrage has prompted Republicans backing Gardner to brand Udall \u201cSenator Uterus\u201d \u2014 a phrase that was even picked up by a moderator in a Colorado Senate debate this month. READ: Elizabeth Warren: Dems must \u2018stand up and fight\u2019 Despite the attacks, polls show abortion and contraception are not decisive issues in their tight race \u2014 reflecting data that shows the core Democratic constituency of young unmarried women often tune out the mid-terms. In a Quinnipiac University poll last week, women picked Udall by 45% to 41%. But men back Gardner by 51% to 38% giving the Republican a five point lead in the race overall. It\u2019s a similar story in Arkansas, where the incumbent Mark Pryor is tied or just behind among women with Republican Tom Cotton, but is down about 15 points or more among men. The Democrat launched a \u201cWomen for Pryor\u201d tour through the state this month, and has put up YouTube videos slamming Cotton for \u201cinsulting\u201d views on women. In June, a Pryor ad featured a woman identified as \u201cCourtney\u201dwho asked \u201cWho is this guy and what has he got against women?\u201d In Iowa, Republicans are savoring the strong showing of Joni Ernst, who leads Democrat Bruce Braley despite assaults on her position on abortion, which she opposes. Ernst, a Harley-Davidson riding Army veteran has built a tough political persona after turning around her campaign in an ad in which she spoke of castrating hogs on an Iowa farm. Recent polls reveal a \u201creverse gender gap\u201d as the male candidate Braley leads the female Ernst among women but trails further behind among men. READ: Democratic candidate doesn\u2019t want Harry Reid in charge Ernst knew what was coming: \u201csoon we\u2019ll be hearing about the war on women,\u201d she predicted after winning her primary, and warned Democrats she knows what real war is like. Terri Lynn Land, a Republican Senate candidate in Michigan, also went on the offensive. \u201cAs a woman, I might know a little bit more about women than Gary Peters,\u201d Land said in an ad, as she sat in a living room and sipped from a coffee cup. As a woman, I might know a little bit more about women than Gary Peters Terri Lynn Land, Michigan GOP Senate candidate In Kentucky, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell showcased his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao as he parried claims by Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes that he is anti-women. In a new McConnell ad this week, young women hammer Grimes with the message: \u201cShe thinks I will vote for the candidate who looks like me, rather than the one who represents me.\u201d In the latest Bluegrass Poll for the Courier-Journal, McConnell is in a statistical tie with Grimes among women voters while maintaining a one point lead overall. Republicans have not closed the gender gap everywhere. And where they are struggling, the Democratic focus on women\u2019s economic issues may be the reason. WATCH: These nerds can elect anyone In North Carolina, Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan slammed her Republican foe Thom Tillis for branding federal equal pay legislation a \u201cgimmick.\u201d  Her lead among women was 11 percent in a margin-of-error race, according to a Survey USA poll last week. Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential contender, hit women\u2019s issues hard when she campaigned with Hagan in Charlotte on Saturday, beseeching an 1,800 strong crowd to reach out to \u201cevery single woman.\u201d \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are the canary in the coal mine. If you don\u2019t protect women\u2019s rights here at home and around the world, everybody\u2019s rights are lost,\u201d Clinton said. In Georgia, Democrat Michelle Nunn highlighted workplace fairness to widen her attack on Republican David Perdue\u2019s business record.  A new CNN poll released Friday put her lead among women voters at a gaping 18 percent. In each of these races, the rhetoric aimed at women is often more focused on pocketbook issues as opposed to the more hot-button subjects of abortion and contraception. Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said women voters may simply not be seeing enough from Democrats to get them out to vote. There\u2019s a paradox here. Obama\u2019s low approval ratings are dragging down vulnerable Democrats. But the fact he\u2019s not in the national spotlight drawing a clear choice on women\u2019s issues with an opponent like Romney is making it more difficult to crystallize the arguments. \u201cThe bigger challenge that the Democrats are facing this time may or may not be about whether the Republicans are appealing more to women \u2014 but the Democrats are not inspiring or turning out the women,\u201d said Walsh. While Republicans may be doing better\u2014 it\u2019s too early to say that they are winning back what will be a decisive demographic in 2016. In the 2010 midterms. the gender gap was smaller than usual in many races but the party fell back again when the White House was on the ballot. Republican prospects may also suffer if Democrats nominate Clinton, a candidate with historic possibility even for some women who may otherwise balk at voting for Democrats. \u201cHer mere presence signifies the women\u2019s issue,\u201d said Lawless. And sometimes, Republican rhetoric towards women still seems a little dated. In a digital ad aimed at young women this month, the College National Republican Committee compared picking out a gubernatorial candidate to choosing a wedding gown. The Democratic Governors Association said that proved Republicans \u201cstill have no idea how to communicate with women voters.\u201d READ: Is this Clinton\u2019s new stump speech?",

            "article_content": "Larry Pressler, a former Republican, is running for the Senate as an independent The South Dakotan was voted out of office 18 years ago His readings at a cowboy poetry event underscore key campaign messages He is up against incumbent Republican Mike Rounds and Democrat Rick Weiland A dimly lit sports bar reading \u201ccowboy poetry\u201d is not exactly where you\u2019d expect to find a candidate for U.S. Senate. But this was a campaign event of Larry Pressler, a former Republican senator now running as an independent 18 years after he was voted out of office. He joined a meeting of the Badger Clark Poetry Society, of which is he a member, to get his campaign messages across with couplets and free verse. \u201cTake Care of Your Friends\u201d by the western poet Baxter Black was one of the poems he chose to read, saying it reflects what he is trying to do \u2013 bring civility back to a broken Senate. Among the apropos lines in Black\u2019s poem, read by Pressler: \u201cA hug or a shake or whatever seems right. It\u2019s a highpoint of giving, I\u2019ll tell you tonight. All worldly riches and tributes of men can\u2019t hold a candle to the worth of a friend.\u201d Just in case it was a bit too subtle, Pressler hit it home with an explanation. \u201cIn today\u2019s Washington you can hardly have a friend because you\u2019re categorized immediately. I\u2019ve said that I think our leaders should be able to visit together, more civility should be returned to Washington, D.C,\u201d Pressler told the crowd of a couple dozen people. He also read a poem called \u201cHomecoming Queen,\u201d written by South Dakota poet M.J. McMillan, who was in attendance. \u201cHomecoming Queen\u201d is about a beautiful young girl whose life didn\u2019t turn out the way she had hoped, becoming an embittered 40-year-old waitress: \u201cWaitin\u2019 tables and cryin\u2019 the blues. Don\u2019t judge her too harshly till you\u2019ve had the chance to walk a few miles in her shoes\u201d It was another campaign message \u2013 that the former Republican cares about the underdogs \u2013 those who need a second chance, or a second look. It was an off-beat event befitting an unusual candidacy. Pressler voted for President Barack Obama twice, yet he contributed to Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign. \u201cI want to work with both sides,\u201d Pressler said in an interview following his poetry reading. Suddenly what was supposed to be a slam-dunk for Republican candidate Mike Rounds is more competitive, thanks in part to an anemic campaign and a scandal from his time as governor. Pressler\u2019s presence in the race has made it even more unpredictable, since he is a well-known figure, especially for older voters. Strategists in both parties believe he pulls votes more from Rounds than the Democratic candidate, Rick Weiland \u2013 but both sides are going after him. \u201cI\u2019m bad to Republicans and Democrats. That\u2019s reflective of what is happening across the board in the United States. You can\u2019t be a friend with anybody else and admit to it,\u201d Pressler told CNN. He supports Obamacare (with some changes) and opposes the standard GOP promise to eliminate the Department of Education. On abortion, he insists he does not believe Roe vs. Wade should be overturned, despite what appeared to be contradictory statements on the issue. It\u2019s no wonder he says he stopped being a Republican because it went too far to the right in this state. He says he donated $100,000 of his own savings to his campaign, took out another $100,000 loan and raised about the same. He only has one full-time paid staffer, and two part timers and sends out his own press releases. Before he was defeated, Pressler served three Senate terms \u2013 18 years. This time around Pressler is vowing to only stay one term so that he is beholden to no outside special interests. \u201cToday\u2019s United States senators spend about 52% of their time raising money, either for themselves or their colleagues for the next election. I will not have a next election. This is my last campaign, win or lose, and if I were in the Senate it would be a glorious job because I wouldn\u2019t have to raise money,\u201d Pressler told us. He won\u2019t say which party he will caucus with if he does pull off a win \u2013 thanks to advice from Maine\u2019s Independent Senator Angus King. \u201cHe said it\u2019s a very appropriate thing for an independent not to say which side you\u2019re caucusing with. That\u2019s the approach he took, and the reason is then I would be running as just another Republican or Democrat,\u201d Pressler said. Since Pressler was defeated in 1996, he has spent a lot of time still in Washington \u2013 another line of attack from opponents, especially Republicans. But he makes no apologies for that, but also insists he spends \u201chalf to three quarters\u201d of his time in South Dakota. He is quite realistic about his chances for reelection, saying \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d But, he insists, it\u2019s about the \u201cjourney\u201d rather than the destination.",

            "article_content": "GOP media operations have lagged behind Democrats for the past two presidential elections Republicans are rebuilding their organization for the social media age RNC is holding \"Comms College\" to train operatives Night after night, Republicans are going back to school in an effort to build a new army of communications operatives for the Twitter age. The courses at \u201cComms College\u201d \u2013 the GOP\u2019s secret training ground for social media-savvy communications staffers \u2013 are taught in a sterile conference room on Capitol Hill. Students are instructed that the modern news cycle, fueled by the disruptive power of the web and constantly-filing reporters, has no patience for old political playbooks. That\u2019s an especially important lesson for Republicans heading into the next presidential election. President Barack Obama\u2019s press operation, digitally fluent and nimble, handily outpaced their GOP opponents in 2008 and 2012. Republicans \u2013 well aware of Hillary Clinton\u2019s ability to spark an Internet sensation with a single tweet \u2013 are determined to mount a modern media strategy to battle back in 2016. \u201cIf you are stubborn and fail to adapt to the environment and think that the strategy from 20 years ago is the way it is today, you are going to lose, it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said Rob Lockwood, the 27-year-old leader of the GOP boot camp, which is housed at the Republican National Committee in Washington. \u201cThis is about understanding the modern reality of the media.\u201d On a recent evening, two dozen operatives \u2013 most of them in their 20s and some in need of a shave \u2013 filed into the RNC conference room. Lockwood opened the lesson with a slideshow. It included a picture of boxer Mike Tyson in the ring, accompanied by his famous maxim: \u201cEverybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d Read: Republicans hit S.D. airwaves The message to students: It\u2019s critical for campaigns to be adaptive and resourceful in making their case to the media, and responding to a constant barrage of press inquires and negative headlines. Since the beginning of 2014, the RNC says it has graduated over 200 operatives and placed many of them as communications directors and press secretaries in Capitol Hill offices and federal campaigns nationwide, from Alaska to Arizona to New York and North Carolina. Lockwood has also conducted media training boot camps with nearly 1,000 candidates, staff and local political figures in a dozen states. Is New Hampshire about to get nasty? Could Rand Paul support gay marriage? The luckiest mustache in Iowa There\u2019s a session on opposition research and tracking, Facebook algorithms and Google metrics. There are also tips on dressing for television (no pocket squares, seersucker or dangly jewelry), and lessons on social media and partisan news sites that give campaigns the power to peddle their messages without the filter of \u201cmainstream\u201d reporters. Lockwood even has reading recommendations, including \u201cCollision 2012,\u201d \u201cThe Victory Lab\u201d and \u201cDouble Down.\u201d Above all else, Lockwood preaches how mobile devices and the social web, in just a matter of years, have dramatically altered media behavior. For click-hungry reporters in the digital ecosystem, their motives, competitiveness and editorial standards have all mutated \u2014 presenting all manner of opportunities and dangers. READ: Paul Ryan swings for the fences in new ad \u201cDoing a press conference just to do a press conference doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d Lockwood tells students. \u201cIt\u2019s an antiquated way of thinking. If you don\u2019t know what you want your headline to be, and think you can go out there and say what you want in five points, and answer none of the questions, that the news reports are going to be about your five points. Nope. The reports will probably be about the five things you didn\u2019t answer. The RNC runs other \u201ccolleges\u201d for young operatives or staff veterans looking to brush up on their skills, including a campaign management college run by Ohio GOP operative Jonathan Gormley, and a campaign finance school for Republican attorneys. But as Republicans surveyed their losses after the 2012 presidential campaign and looked at their roster of communications operatives, they realized they weren\u2019t able to field their best talent to compete with Obama\u2019s brigade of Chicago-based digital natives \u2014 in part because the GOP equivalent didn\u2019t exist. \u201cDuring the last campaign, we would sit around with the Romney campaign trying to identify potential press folks, either for Victory positions here at the RNC, or staff positions with the campaign, and we realized that that bench was not deep with people who had been trained or had significant campaign experience,\u201d says Sean Spicer, the RNC\u2019s communications director. \u201cWe would struggle to fill those positions with qualified people.\u201d Spicer and Reince Priebus, the RNC chairman, embarked on an overhaul of the organization\u2019s media operations, hiring web-fluent staffers, streamlining their surrogate database and stepping up their media-training operations to instill discipline over candidates. The latter move, Priebus said, became essential after witnessing Republican candidates up and down the ballot in 2012 ruin news cycles with offensive or tone-deaf comments on issues like abortion or rape. \u201cI\u2019d rather have candidates being careful to a fault than, you know, having a fountain of blabber coming out of their mouth that\u2019s not disciplined,\u201d Priebus says. \u201cWe are training candidates, training state parties, training operatives to appreciate that communicating isn\u2019t just a free-for-all, natural-born type of activity. People need to be trained and disciplined.\u201d Reeling from their demographic drubbing among Hispanics, African-Americans and women in 2012, they understood the need to present a fresher face to the American public, an ongoing process. Spicer said he recently met with the executive producer of a network Sunday show who begged him for \u201cnew hip conservatives\u201d to feature on the show\u2019s roundtable. Spicer said the committee is obliging, not just to aid the media, but to help campaigns tap into a database of Republican surrogates with ease. \u201cIt used to be, like, people would call the RNC and say, \u2018How do I get in touch with Rudy Giuliani?\u2019 And we\u2019d be like, \u2018Google!\u2019\u201d \u201cNow all of those things are catalogued,\u201d Spicer says. \u201cSomeone will call and say, \u2018We are doing a health care push next week, how many doctors or primary care physicians do you have? How many Asians do you have? How many Jews? You wanna do a Rosh Hashanah thing or something on Israel?\u2019 You name it.\u201d Ben LaBolt, who served as Obama\u2019s national press secretary during the 2012 campaign, says it\u2019s shrewd for Republicans to update their media strategy, even if they\u2019re starting from behind. \u201cCommunications tools and methods change each election cycle, sometimes rapidly,\u201d LaBolt says. \u201cWhile they were once siloed, by President Obama\u2019s re-election campaign, we had learned to fully integrate media relations with digital communications in order to reach all prospective supporters where there were. It might be catch-up, but the Republicans are smart to play it.\u201d READ: \u2018White boy\u2019 Biden calls tea party \u2018crazy\u2019 The RNC\u2019s post-election \u201cGrowth and Opportunity Project\u201d \u2014 unofficially known as the party\u2019s \u201cautopsy\u201d report \u2014 recommended much more than just cosmetic fixes. It called for overhauling the professional culture of the party and fixing rusted-over campaign mechanics so that Republicans could better compete with Democrats in the tactical realm. The Republican coalition has since worked to improve their data, digital and information-sharing programs. Still, the results are mixed. With free-spending outside groups taking on a greater role in campaigns and siphoning resources away from the RNC, Priebus figured staff training was something the committee could own. \u201cTraining has to be a cornerstone of what we do today and in the future,\u201d Priebus says. Lockwood, a veteran of the North Carolina Republican Party and the College Republican National Committee, was recruited in late 2013 to cultivate future communicators for the party. A brawny, 6\u20194\u201d Massachusetts native who rarely lets his iPhone out his clutches, Lockwood came of age in the digital era and knew instinctively that a single link circulated on Twitter could have more power in shaping a narrative than any newspaper front page or morning TV show. \u201cRob was the ideal choice for this,\u201d Spicer says. \u201cWe call him the dean.\u201d The \u201ccollege,\u201d a series of eight night classes, focuses on tactics, not policy. The presentations are heavy with do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s for Republicans who work with the press. His opening statement sets the tone. \u201cUnderstanding that the press is attracted to conflict is paramount to understanding the modern media,\u201d Lockwood says. Then, on his laptop, he ticks through his slideshow: \u201cDon\u2019t use jokes that you\u2019ve never told before \u2026 Jay Carney showed everyday that it\u2019s better to be dull than offensive,\u201d referring to the former White House press secretary who is now a CNN political commentator. \u201cDon\u2019t introduce new phrases, like Etch-a-sketch.\u201d Lockwood says the boot camp isn\u2019t just for up-and-comers. Comparing it to spring training, he says veteran GOP operatives are encouraged to take the course, too. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are not of this generation but are subject to the rules of it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we want everybody to get up to speed.\u201d READ: W.H. aims to show Obama at work As much as the classes focus on the capacity of the web to drive a message, students are urged not to chase every shiny object or micro-story that pops on Twitter. The seminars put an emphasis on breaking down the traditional barriers that exist between different segments of a campaign. Press staffers are given crash courses in polling and media-buying, for instance, so they can be conversant on those topics when a reporter calls. \u201cI really had very little exposure to polling or digital until then,\u201d says Charlotte Guyett, a former RNC intern who worked at a GOP consulting firm before enrolling in \u201cComms College.\u201d Guyett is now the press secretary for Elise Stefanik\u2019s House campaign in New York\u2019s 21st Congressional District. Guest speakers with recent, real world campaign experience, young and old, parade through and field questions. In one September session, Tim Miller, the executive director of America Rising, a GOP research firm, encouraged the students to engage with the media proactively instead of keeping them at arm\u2019s length. \u201cIf you treat reporters with hostility,\u201d Miller said, \u201cthere will be blood.\u201d Miller, himself a former RNC staffer, praised  the committee for changing its way of thinking. \u201cAs recently as 2008 and 2010, you would sit in these rooms and it would be somebody from the Lee Atwater era, talking about how the media is your enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy talk was about talking the ways to use the 24/7 news cycle and Twitter and social media to your advantage, as well as recognizing the pitfalls.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Lindsey Graham calls Sen. Marco Rubio camp to walk back \"not ready\" 2016 remarks Sen. Rand Paul is opening the door to a potential \"evolution\" on same-sex marriage White House concerns about former officials' tell-alls CNN\u2019s John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on \u2018Inside Politics\u2019 to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. Rand Paul\u2019s personal GOP rebranding effort, a couple of feuds in the GOP family, Democratic worries about voting restrictions and White House anger at a former Obama Cabinet member made for an action-packed trip around the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table. 1. Graham to Rubio: You aren\u2019t ready. And then, take two Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina tells The Weekly Standard he might run for president in 2016. OK, that hardly makes him unique. But he says one reason is because the GOP needs a hawkish voice in the mix, and he doesn\u2019t see Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as up to the challenge. Graham camp walks back Rubio remarks Read the interview, and it\u2019s clear Graham thinks his colleague from Florida is too young and too worried, Graham says, about offending the party\u2019s conservative base. It\u2019s all there in writing. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times tells us the story doesn\u2019t end there. Graham, a Southern gentleman after all, apparently felt compelled to call and explain. \u201cSen. Graham actually called Rubio World and suggested that he got a little bit over his skis and wasn\u2019t trying to diss Sen. Rubio and that he was taken out of context there,\u201d Martin said. \u201cSo I think this is one of those examples, John, when you say something to a reporter and you see it in print and then you want that one back.\u201d 2. Rand and the GOP brand Could Rand Paul support gay marriage? Sen. Rand Paul makes no secret of the fact he thinks the GOP needs an image makeover if it wants to be competitive in presidential politics. He is trying to build bridges to the African-American community and spends a lot of time on college campuses. The question is, will his views hurt him among social conservatives who have outsized influence in some early presidential battlegrounds? This past week, Paul said he did not oppose birth control, including the so-called Plan B morning after pill many Christian conservatives consider tantamount to abortion. And in an interview with CNN\u2019s Peter Hamby, Paul also opened the door to, like President Obama, evolving away from his opposition to same-sex marriage. \u201cI mean, people change their minds all the time on this issue, and even within the Republican Party, there are people whose child turns out to be gay, and they\u2019re like, \u2018oh, well, maybe I want to rethink this issue,\u2019 \u201d Paul said. \u201cSo it\u2019s been rethought. The President\u2019s rethought the issue. So I mean, a lot of people have rethought the issue.\u201d \u201cYou could rethink it at some point, too?\u201d Hamby asked him. He shrugged and gave a half-grimace. So stay tuned on this potential \u201cevolution.\u201d 3. Good for book sales but not so good for Obama Margaret Talev of Bloomberg News shared reporting on White House concerns about the latest insider account from a former Obama loyalist. Leon Panetta, the former defense secretary and CIA chief, writes in a new book that Obama didn\u2019t make much of an effort to overcome Iraqi resistance to leaving a residual U.S. military force in the country. Former White House officials tell all \u201cThose on our side viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests,\u201d Panetta said in an excerpt from his new book, \u201cWorthy Fights.\u201d And there is more. Veteran diplomat Chris Hill also has a new book that levels criticism at both Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. We know Vice President Joe Biden doesn\u2019t like this trend. \u201cI\u2019m finding that former administration officials, as soon as they leave, write books, which I think is inappropriate,\u201d Biden said Thursday. \u201cAt least give the guy a chance to get out of office.\u201d So after a couple of days touting good economic news, Talev notes, the White House will be forced to pivot back to a more controversial topic. \u201cWe\u2019ll see President Obama in the coming week really back on the defensive about his foreign policy,\u201d Talev said. \u201cThis is all happening at a time when President Obama is dealing with this nightmare on the Ebola crisis and does not want his (National Security Council) staff pulled off to the side to deal with this, but it really could be a problem for Obama\u2019s legacy, has the potential to hurt midterms and very interesting to see how Hillary handles it so that is not something that dogs her before 2016.\u201d 4. Turnout matters, and Democrats see obstacles in new restrictions Democrats know their best odds in this difficult midterm election year depend on getting their base voters \u2013 including African-Americans and Latinos \u2013 to turn out in percentages higher than the historical averages. But The Atlantic\u2019s Molly Ball says some Democrats are nervous because of voting restrictions that just happen to be in some of the key 2014 battlegrounds. \u201cThey\u2019ve put so much emphasis on the ground game, they\u2019ve put so much emphasis on trying to bring in new voters in a midterm year, but in a lot of states, there are new voting restrictions going into effect \u2013 in states like Kansas, which is suddenly in play, and North Carolina, the voter ID got thrown out of court, but they still restricted the voting hours,\u201d Ball said. \u201cAnd so Democrats are starting to worry that in these elections that are going to be so close, it\u2019s going to be a real problem for them.\u201d 5. In N.H., some Republicans see hardball unfolding after Boehner snub Just 10 days ago, House Speaker John Boehner went to New Hampshire and raised some money for GOP congressional candidate Marilinda Garcia, a state senator who is trailing but in a close race against a Democratic incumbent. In a radio interview a few days after the Boehner visit, Garcia refused to commit to voting for the speaker if, as promised, he seeks another term in January. Now, several New Hampshire Republicans say they are hearing the National Republican Congressional Committee, the GOP campaign arm run by Boehner deputies, is letting it be known it won\u2019t spend in the 2nd Congressional District in the final month of the campaign. Can we connect those dots? Is it just a tough resource decision? Or a misunderstanding? We\u2019ll keep an eye on it. Interesting, because the GOP does have a chance at a few race pickups in New England. POST-SHOW UPDATE: Camp Garcia reached out after the show Sunday to clear things up \u2013 and to give an unequivocal response to the question the candidate did not directly answer on the radio show. \u201cMarilinda is focused on running her race and talking about the issues relevant to New Hampshire voters, not inside-the-Beltway politics,\u201d Garcia campaign manager Tom Szold told CNN. \u201cBut she fully intends to support John Boehner for Speaker if she is elected to Congress in November.\u201d That should put to rest any understanding. Now we\u2019ll see if the NRCC helps out in the final month.",

            "article_content": "Rand Paul is visiting many college campuses to advance his libertarian agenda Paul faces a challenge in wooing young people without alienating other Republicans Paul is a potential 2016 Republican presidential contender Campus politics aren\u2019t always a clear winner for Rand Paul, as he discovered here this week during an appearance at the College of Charleston. The Kentucky Republican and potential 2016 contender opened with a familiar riff about government surveillance that won predictable applause \u2013 especially from the many students who represented Young Americans for Liberty, the libertarian outfit created from the ashes of his father Ron Paul\u2019s presidential campaigns. Then a young woman in the audience asked if Paul, who sponsored an anti-abortion bill in 2013 that defines life as beginning at fertilization, is opposed to Plan B, the emergency contraception commonly known as the morning-after pill. The luckiest mustache in Iowa 'Hambycast' goes behind grill in Iowa Hillary's madcap media mob A number of social conservatives \u2013 plenty of them in Iowa \u2013 have condemned the morning-after pill as an on-demand abortion drug, sometimes confusing the contraceptive with RU-486, which can be used to induce abortion. Noticeably uncomfortable with the question, Paul first gave a terse answer: \u201cI am not opposed to birth control,\u201d he said. After a pause, he elaborated. \u201cThat\u2019s basically what Plan B is. Plan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening, and I am not opposed to that.\u201d Rand Paul: \u2018I am not opposed to birth control\u2019 Next question. The exchange was notable because it happened on a college campus \u2013 a place where Paul has made inroads in building support for his libertarian agenda. And it underscored the challenge that lies ahead for him: burnishing the libertarian credentials that make him so appealing to young voters while making sure he doesn\u2019t stray so far from the Republican line that he won\u2019t be able to win the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Another student here pressed him on \u201cthe drug war,\u201d asking if Paul would support legalizing marijuana, cocaine and heroin. He said he wasn\u2019t supportive of drug use, explaining that pot \u201cis not that great,\u201d but said drug laws should be left up to states. Colorado and Washington are experimenting with legalized marijuana, he said, and we should be watching carefully. Paul has enjoyed plenty of success on the campus circuit. His visits to universities from Harvard to Howard have snagged flattering headlines and pats on the back from Republicans who want to modernize the party and broaden its national appeal. \u201cRand Paul, Republican presidential hopeful, finds support in Berkeley, of all places,\u201d the San Jose Mercury News announced after Paul visited in that den of Bay Area liberalism in March. Paul, reared in libertarian politics, found support there because he railed against the National Security Administration\u2019s invasive surveillance operations, calling them an absurd violation of privacy. It\u2019s his go-to topic when he talks to young people. Last March, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Paul blew his opponents away in a presidential straw poll after he brought a ballroom full of 20-somethings to their feet with cries of outrage over government prying into cell phones. Soon after, he packed a nearby restaurant with fawning college kids at an open bar sponsored by his political action committee. Paul and his wife, Kelley, danced and sang along to Chumbawamba, the 90s-era pop band with an anarchist streak. We tagged along to the event at the College of Charleston for the latest episode of \u201cHambycast.\u201d After the talk, standing in the sun-splashed campus courtyard, I asked Paul to elaborate on some of the issues that so often put his party at odds with young people \u2014 as well as the thorny topics that Paul confronts as he tries to square with small-government libertarian roots with a more dogmatic Republican Party. On the topic of drugs, I picked up where the student left off, wondering if Paul, as president, would allow a state to legalize a hard drug like cocaine or heroin. He hedged. \u201cMy position has not been for legalization, my position has been for less criminalization and more fair adjudication for people that are caught in this, and that kids who make youthful mistakes should get a second chance,\u201d he said. Then I asked about same-sex marriage, something Paul did not touch on in his remarks. Almost 80% of people under the age of 30 support same-sex marriage, according to a Gallup poll earlier this year. It\u2019s hard to think of an issue on which Republicans are more out of step with America\u2019s youth. And it\u2019s not just teenaged and 20-somethings: A clear majority of Americans, 55%, support same-sex marriage. Paul favors traditional marriage, but has said states should determine their own marriage laws. \u201cI don\u2019t want my guns registered in Washington or my marriage,\u201d he told me. \u201cFounding Fathers all got married by going down to the local courthouse. It is a local issue and always has been.\u201d But can Republicans win a national election if they aren\u2019t in tune with rapidly changing opinions on the matter? He took a soft tone. \u201cSociety\u2019s changing,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, people change their minds all the time on this issue, and even within the Republican Party, there are people whose child turns out to be gay and they\u2019re like, oh well maybe I want to rethink this issue. So it\u2019s been rethought. The President\u2019s rethought the issue. So I mean, a lot of people have rethought the issue.\u201d It sounded, for a moment, as if Paul was hinting that he, too, could change his thinking about marriage. \u201cThe bottom line is, I\u2019m old fashioned, I\u2019m a traditionalist,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in old-fashioned traditional marriage. But, I don\u2019t really think the government needs to be too involved with this, and I think that the Republican Party can have people on both sides of the issue.\u201d \u201cYou could rethink it at some point, too?\u201d I asked him. He shrugged, and gave me a half-grimace. It wasn\u2019t a yes or a no, but it revealed Paul\u2019s complicated dance as he tries to color outside the lines of the Republican Party.",

            "article_content": "At the annual Values Voter Summit, Ted Cruz won the straw poll The results were similar to a year ago Cruz got the most votes, followed by Dr. Ben Carson Cruz first. Carson second. Sound familiar? If it does, it\u2019s because for the second year in a row, the duo clinched the top two spots for the presidential choice vote in the buzzy Values Voter Summit straw poll. Last year, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas beat Dr. Ben Carson, a renowned neurosurgeon and Fox News contributor, by a whopping 29%. On Saturday, Cruz beat Carson just by 5%. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania rounded out the top four, while Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul tied for fifth place with 7% of the vote. Cruz: 'Photo-op' action won't stop ISIS Carson says Obamacare worse than 9/11 Sen. Cruz on Benghazi: 'We need answers' 'Rearranging priorities' on abortion To further the case that not much has changed, this year\u2019s results for the vice presidential choice also mimicked last year\u2019s, with Carson coming in first and Cruz coming in second. In a small twist, Jindal beat out Rep. Michelle Bachman for the third place title. She and Santorum took the fourth and fifth place spots in the race this year. Poll participants at the Values Voter Summit were also asked to rank their top three most important issues. To little surprise amongst the conservative crowd, protecting religious liberty was deemed the most important issue by an overwhelming margin, while abortion and national security followed as the next most important issues. Announcing the results, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative public policy and lobbying organization that sponsors the Summit, noted that participation was up this year from last, likely due to the upcoming midterm election. \u201cIt actually shows that there is more engagement of core conservatives in the process when they have a reason to be,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cThe evidence here is quite clear, that when conservatives have someone who will speak clearly, concisely \u2013 a conservative message that embraces all elements of conservatism \u2013 they gain enthusiastic support.\u201d Voters were also allowed to write-in candidates that they thought were deserving of a vote if they weren\u2019t included in the list of 24 elected officials selected. Notable write-ins included Christian evangelist and missionary Franklin Graham for President. The Values Voter Summit is holding its 9th annual political conference in Washington through Sunday. The meeting draws thousands of conservative politicians and activists nationwide to hear speeches from featured guests and vote in the annual straw poll.",

The Greg Abbott campaign\u2019s complaint comes just a day after Davis returned from a campaign-funded trip to New York, where she promoted her recently released book and attended a campaign fundraising event, the Houston Chronicle reported. Davis, a state senator, soared into the national spotlight in 2013 when she helped thwart the first effort to pass an anti-abortion bill after holding the Texas Senate floor during a 10-hour filibuster. Wayne Hamilton, Republican candidate Abbott\u2019s campaign manager, wrote that Davis \u201cconverted political contributions to her personal use\u201d in the complaint filed with the Texas Ethics Commission. Wendy Davis' Texas-sized battle But Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas fired back, asserting that the campaign funded the trip so Davis could attend a \u201ccampaign event\u201d in New York and did nothing illegal. \u201cAny other non-campaign activities were scheduled by and covered by the appropriate parties not affiliated with the campaign,\u201d Petkanas told the Houston Chronicle. Petkanas added: \u201cOne way you can tell this is a politically motivated and frivolous complaint is that the Abbott campaign filed it today without waiting for the legal opinion they requested on Monday.\u201d Matt Hirsch, Abbott\u2019s spokesman, accused Davis of violating state law and called her actions \u201coutright unlawful.\u201d \u201cFrom her history of profiteering at the expense of Texas taxpayers while in the Legislature to using campaign funds to promote a book that enriches her personally, Sen. Davis has demonstrated blatant disregard for ethical standards Texans expect from their candidates,\u201d Hirsch said, according to the Chronicle. Davis appeared on CNN, MSNBC and ABC this week from New York. Davis is the underdog in the Texas fight as Abbott, the state\u2019s attorney general, holds on to a lead of at least 8 points in polls from this summer.",

            "article_content": "Three women justices dissent against high court's latest Obamacare order Justice Sotomayor: Those bound by decisions can't take take us at our word The cases involve exceptions to a mandate to provide health coverage for contraceptives Supporters say the decisions uphold religious rights; foes say they hurt women's rights It was a disappointing week for the women of the Supreme Court. All three \u2013 Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor \u2013 were on the losing side of rulings involving women\u2019s reproductive health. First came the Hobby Lobby decision, in which the high court decided 5-4 that the government cannot force certain for-profit companies to offer contraception coverage under Obamacare. Supreme Court rules against Obama in contraception case Then another decision emerged late on Thursday in which a Chicago-area evangelical college won a temporary victory over the requirement in the 2010 health care law that religious non-profits provide contraception insurance to their workers. Wheaton College objected to potential fines if it refused to provide coverage or sign a release form, arguing that doing so would be morally wrong. The Supreme Court said the college didn\u2019t have to do either for now. How Hobby Lobby decision may affect you Supreme Court in favor of Hobby Lobby Birth control ruling sparks debate Strident dissent Coming after the Hobby Lobby decision, narrowly defined to the specifics of cases involving two businesses run by families with strong Christian beliefs, the Wheaton ruling rankled the three liberal women justices. Their unusually forceful dissent written by Sotomayor said the Wheaton injunction threatened the credibility of the Hobby Lobby decision. \u201cThose who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. \u201cNot so today.\u201d The point of the dissent? \u201cIt is not the business of this court to ensnare itself in the government\u2019s ministerial handling of its affairs in the manner it does here,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. Hobby Lobby ruling much more than abortion While the Wheaton College ruling only gives the school a pass until the matter is decided by lower courts, it represents an important victory for those objecting to the contraception coverage requirement. Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word. Not so today. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor The mandate was a negotiated compromise between the Obama administration and religious-based non-profits such as hospitals and faith-based universities that oppose birth control. It made contraceptives available under the Affordable Care Act with no co-pay, but gave those entities a work-around through health plans written by third parties. Legal challenges Since the law championed by President Barack Obama took effect, the contraceptive coverage requirement has faced several challenges, including a case last year by the religious charity Little Sisters of the Poor. As in Wheaton, the Supreme Court said the government couldn\u2019t enforce the contraceptive mandate. Religious-based groups sought delays in the requirement that took effect July 1, saying that signing the form would force them to choose between what the Little Sisters of the Poor\u2013 a Denver-based home for the elderly run by Catholic nuns \u2013 called \u201conerous penalties or becoming complicit in a grave moral wrong.\u201d The high court ruling in the Wheaton appeal said those who object only have to inform the government \u201cin writing that it is a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services,\u201d rather than sign government form. What the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision means The ruling also made clear the high court had yet to decide the larger legal and constitutional issues, but merely acted on the enforcement question. The issue could be presented to the justices in coming months for final review. \u201cWe are grateful to God that the Supreme Court has made a wise decision in protecting our religious liberty-at least until we have an opportunity to make our full case in court,\u201d said Wheaton College President Philip Ryken. \u201cWe continue to believe that a college community that affirms the sanctity of human life from conception to the grave should not be coerced by the government into facilitating the provision of abortion-inducing drugs.\u201d Wheaton is a private Christian liberal arts school located in a Chicago suburb, and is represented in court by the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty, which also represented Hobby Lobby \u2013 an Oklahoma chain of 572 retail outlets \u2013 and the Little Sisters of the Poor. The Hobby Lobby ruling Monday authored by Justice Samuel Alito suggested the two for-profit companies could sign the same government form as the religious non-profits. \u201cUnnecessary costs\u201d In the dissent of Thursday\u2019s ruling, Sotomayor expressed concern the court no longer required use of the form by any institution. \u201cThe court\u2019s actions in this case create unnecessary costs and layers of bureaucracy, and they ignore a simple truth: The government must be allowed to handle the basic tasks of public administration in a manner that comports with common sense,\u201d the dissent said. \u201cThe court\u2019s grant of an injunction in this case allows Wheaton\u2019s beliefs about the effects of its actions to trump the democratic interest in allowing the government to enforce the law,\u201d it continued. Hobby Lobby: the Bible verses behind the battle A Mennonite family\u2019s fight over Obamacare reaches Supreme Court The White House previously said the contraceptive coverage requirement in Obamacare was lawful and \u201cessential to a woman\u2019s health,\u201d and that its rules struck the right balance. There was no immediate reaction about the Thursday court order from the administration. Abortion rights groups expressed disappointment, with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund calling the court order \u201calarming\u201d because it confirmed \u201cthat many more women may lose access to birth control coverage in the coming months and years if Congress does not act soon.\u201d While Democratic members of Congress are proposing fixes to the health care law to address the issue, the chances of such legislation passing in an election year are considered low due to opposition by conservative House Republicans.

            "article_content": "The decision leaves a number of questions in its wake What is the impact on Obamacare, and for future legal challenges? What does it mean politically in a midterm year with control of the Senate at stake? And what now defines religion in business and what does it mean for workers? Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling giving certain companies a right to raise religious objections to providing some types of birth control insurance to their employees leaves a number of important questions in its wake. And it\u2019s unlikely any will be answered soon following the 5-4 decision that sparked enormous reaction and analysis around abortion, Obamacare, and the influence of religion in conducting business in a secular marketplace. Here are five questions from the decision that was the most closely watched of this term. 1) What does the decision mean for Obamacare? Obamacare took a hit, but it remains intact. How Hobby Lobby decision may affect you Pro-choice group: This is discriminatory Unlike the blockbuster decision two years ago when the Supreme Court allowed the Affordable Care Act to proceed, this case dealt only with one part of it. That is a regulation requiring private, for-profit companies \u2013 often family-owned businesses \u2013 to provide certain types of birth control coverage to their employees without a copay. Looking ahead, the decision could serve as a primer for other pending challenges to the health law that was approved by Congress in 2010 without Republican support. Is it the first chip in a long legal slugfest? Fights over Obamacare will no doubt continue on a range of issues, from other employer mandates to tax breaks for those in the state health benefit exchanges that offer the insurance plans to consumers. 2) What is the impact of the ruling on workers? The White House says women employed by companies like the two firms at the center of the appeal \u2013 arts-and-crafts retail giant Hobby Lobby and the much smaller Conestoga Wood Specialties \u2013 have been hurt. And while the legal challenge was narrow, the potential impact is broader. The appeal applied to Plan B contraception, which some have called the \u201cmorning after\u201d pill, and intrauterine devices or IUDs used by an estimated 2 million American women. In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision \u201csweeping.\u201d Jonathan Turley, law professor at George Washington University, agreed. \u201cPeople should not get lost in the reference to \u2018closely held corporations.\u2019 These types of businesses \u201care huge in this country and most of the businesses people relate with in their daily lives.\u201d 3) What does it mean politically? The decision no doubt will energize Republicans on the campaign trail ahead of November midterm elections when control of the Senate is at stake. Republicans have made Obamacare a giant campaign target, especially with the conservative base and we got a taste of the politics behind it all quickly after the justices weighed in. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a victory for religious freedom and another defeat for an administration that has repeatedly crossed constitutional lines in pursuit of\u201d big government, said House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cThe President\u2019s health care law remains an unworkable mess and a drag on our economy.\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who heads the Democratic National Committee, framed the ruling as a campaign issue for the fall. \u201cIt is no surprise that Republicans have sided against women on this issue as they have consistently opposed a woman\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions,\u201d she said, calling the ruling a \u201cdangerous precedent.\u201d But some Democrats say there may be a silver lining: It could motivate younger women and unmarried women to show up at the polls. Exit polls indicate that unmarried and younger women support Democrats over Republicans, but their numbers also traditionally drop from presidential elections to midterm contests. 4) What\u2019s a \u201creligious\u201d company? Liberals and conservatives on the Supreme Court agreed on this much: the families that own Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties are undoubtedly religious. But does that make their companies religious? That\u2019s where the justices sharply disagreed. Writing for the majority, Samuel Alito said the government has little problem acknowledging that non-profits, like churches and charities, can be religious \u2013 and exempting them from the contraception mandate if they have moral objections. So why should  companies be held to a different standard? \u201cAny suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercising religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in the face of modern corporate law,\u201d Alito writes. But there are big differences between charities and corporations, Ginsburg argued in her dissent. Religious organizations exist to further the interests of the faithful and usually employ workers or volunteers from their own community of believers. Companies, on the other hand, exist to make money, Ginsburg said, and by law are not allowed to discriminate in hiring based on religion. In fact, they often employ people of many faiths. So giving corporations religious rights opens a legal \u201cminefield,\u201d she argued. For instance, what\u2019s to stop employers from objecting to blood transfusions, as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses do? Or vaccinations, as some Christian Scientists do? Or benefits for same-sex couples, as many evangelicals and Catholics do? 5) So what\u2019s next? The Obama administration immediately said it would work with Congress to ensure female employees get reproductive health coverage provided in the Affordable Care Act. But congressional action isn\u2019t realistic, considering the sharply partisan politics involved in Obamacare, abortion rights, and interpretations of religious freedom. Officials also hint that the President may use his executive authority to get around lawmakers in an election year. The practical result will likely be an administrative fix by the administration that subsidizes the contraceptives at issue, said CNN political analyst Gloria Borger. So far, 9 million people have signed up for Obamacare health plans since last October. CNN\u2019s Bill Mears, Paul Steinhauser, Tom Cohen, and Daniel Burke contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Group challenged state law forbidding certain statements about a candidate during an election The case involved political ads that questioned votes taken by congressional lawmakers One congressman sued, saying the Constitution does not protect 'lies' Court decision permits continued challenge, but lower courts will have to decide the merits An anti-abortion group may continue challenging a state law that forbids certain false statements about a candidate during an election campaign, after the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in the organization\u2019s favor on Monday. The justices did not directly address whether the Ohio statute was a violation of free speech, but the 18-page ruling from the court suggested it was on shaky constitutional ground. The Susan B. Anthony List  had sought to air political ads during the 2010 congressional races, questioning the votes of some lawmakers on a controversial part of the healthcare reform law known as Obamacare. The group has insisted its commercials were truthful. The Ohio Elections Commission had issued a pre-election preliminary finding that \u201cprobable cause\u201d existed the ads violated the state law. SBA List then went to federal court for an immediate order allowing it to broadcast, but the election occurred before a final determination was made about the disputed content. The high court ultimately concluded the advocacy group had established a \u201csufficiently imminent injury\u201d from not being able to air those ads, allowing it to continue its ongoing lawsuit. \u201cThe burdens that (Election) Commission proceedings can impose on electoral speech are of particular concern here,\u201d said Justice Clarence Thomas for the court.\u201d And denying prompt judicial review would impose a substantial hardship on petitioners, forcing them to choose between refraining from core political speech on the one hand, or engaging in that speech and risking costly commission proceedings and criminal prosecution on the other.\u201d Then-Rep. Steve Driehaus, who was running for re-election in 2010, complained after the national, anti-abortion group sought to place a billboard saying, \u201cShame on Steve Driehaus! Driehaus voted for taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d He cited state law making it a crime to \u201cpost, publish, circulate, distribute, or otherwise disseminate a false statement concerning a candidate, either knowing the same to be false or with reckless disregard for whether it was false or not, if the statement is designed to promote the election, nomination, or defeat of the candidate.\u201d The Democrat, who served only one term before losing the race, claimed the ad from the Susan B. Anthony List was false because the healthcare reform law provided that abortions would be separately funded by the enrollees and insurers through a special series of accounts. But some anti-abortion activists said under the law, low-income women could have the procedure subsidized through the government. Driehaus also later sued SBAL for defamation, saying, \u201cA lie is a lie. The First Amendment is not and never has been an invitation to concoct falsehoods aimed at depriving a person of his livelihood.\u201d Although the initial complaint was ultimately dismissed, a federal court separately sided with him and the state on the law\u2019s continued enforcement, prompting the high court to get involved. The justices instructed the lower courts to allow the SBA lawsuit to proceed, where presumably the law\u2019s constitutionality will now be addressed. \u201cThe truth or falsity of political speech should be judged by voters, not government bureaucrats,\u201d said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, after the decision was announced. They and their supporters argued Ohio\u2019s law is unconstitutional because it creates a \u201ctruth commission,\u201d and singles out false or exaggerated statements about politicians for greater legal sanction than those said about other public figures. \u201cAllegations, insinuations, \u2018truthiness,\u2019 smears, and all that other rigmarole have been part and parcel of American political discourse since time immemorial,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian Cato Institute. But abortion rights organizations backing the Ohio law warned voters to be wary about what is said in future national election races, at least by SBA. Dannenfelser said in February that SBA List would target vulnerable Democrats in the fall midterm elections, spending up to $10 million, including on TV ads.",

            "article_content": "So far, there are no women's names on the GOP's 2016 presidential short list There are more GOP women governors, but fewer congresswomen than Democrats GOP trying to recruit and support women who could eventually mount presidential bids Rutgers study; senior GOP female lawmakers say party still has work to do on women front Former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison knew her window to run for president had closed. That moment passed when then-Gov. George W. Bush, a fellow Texas Republican, ran for and won the presidency in 2000 and served two terms, the lawmaker told CNN. She was a senator with aspirations to a higher office who was also in the process of adopting two children. \u201cThe timing wasn\u2019t right for me. Even if he served four years, then maybe. But eight years and Texas fatigue. Then I had children, so\u2026,\u201d she said, her voice trailing off. Wednesday marks the 95th anniversary of Congress\u2019 approval of the 19th amendment to the Constitution, guaranteeing women the right to vote.  But all these years later, no woman has ever been named a major party\u2019s presidential nominee. The path to the presidency is especially challenging for Republican women and it contrasts sharply with Democrats who \u2013 as buzz grows around Hillary Clinton \u2013 may be poised to nominate the first female presidential candidate of either major party. Primary problems: GOP women struggle to come out on top GOP pushes back on 'war on women' notion New strategy for the GOP GOP ad: What 'war on women'? Four of the five women who are currently governors are Republicans, and four of the past six presidents previously were governors. Still, GOP women\u2019s names are seldom mentioned among top-tier potential presidential hopefuls for 2016. Sure, nods are given to retiring Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann\u2019s failed 2012 presidential bid. And there\u2019s a perennial hope among some conservatives that former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will run, though she\u2019s said she has no interest in the position. But when mention is made of Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico, or New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, it\u2019s often couched as \u201cshe would make such a good running mate,\u201d not in a way that is on par with male candidates, former Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, told CNN. \u201cWomen should naturally be considered for the highest office in the land,\u201d Snowe said. \u201cThe bench is too small\u201d Democratic women in Congress far outnumber Republicans \u2013 16-4 in the 100-seat Senate and 62-17 in the 435-seat House of Representatives. In each of the past 10 election cycles, GOP women have won a smaller percentage of primary elections for U.S. House seats than have their Democratic counterparts, according to a study by Rutgers University\u2019s Center for American Women and Politics, and only twice \u2013 in 1994 and 2010 \u2013 have more Republican than Democratic women run in primaries. \u201cIt\u2019s the concept of the pipeline. If the women aren\u2019t in the offices we draw on for the presidency, the bench is too small to choose from,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Rutgers center. Even when they do seek office, studies have shown that conservative women in particular have had a tougher time getting the networking and financial support \u2013 either from within the party or from outside groups \u2013 needed to mount successful bids, Walsh said. While there are a number of well-heeled groups, such as EMILY\u2019s List, which back candidates with progressive stances, there are fewer such groups targeting conservative women, the Rutgers study found. SarahPAC, the political action committee of former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has supported a number of conservative women candidates, including New Hampshire\u2019s Ayotte in 2010. This year, the PAC is supporting Joni Ernst, a Senate candidate from Iowa who won her primary on Tuesday, among other women. SHE PAC, another conservative women\u2019s group, is supporting Mia Love, the former mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, in her second bid for the U.S. House.  Love narrowly lost in 2012 to incumbent Jim Matheson, who is not seeking re-election.  The group is also supporting Monica Wehby, an Oregon physician running for Senate, among other candidates. Both Love and Wehby won their primaries. CNN Poll: Majority say GOP out of touch with women The other challenge female candidates to federal office face is an \u201cideological shift to the far right among the Republican primary electorate,\u201d the study found. This shift has meant Republican women who might be moderate on such issues as abortion rights are less likely to survive primary fights in conservative districts. The results: fewer Republican women headed to Congress and a shallower pool of  presidential contenders down the road. The Republican Party is keenly aware of its problems in both recruiting and supporting female candidates and attracting women voters. The party performed an autopsy of sorts after huge losses among women, minorities and young voters in the 2012 presidential election. GOP\u2019s soul-searching leads conflicted party to double down Is the GOP playing the woman card? GOP backs equal pay for equal work GOP trains men how to run against women The party concluded it needed to beef up its outreach operations and has spent millions on efforts such as Project GROW, which seeks to identify and support more female candidates for the midterm elections, and \u201c14 in 14,\u201d a program aimed at wooing more women voters in key states. \u201cWe\u2019ve come together with the other GOP campaign committees \u2026 to set up programs to get more women involved in our party,\u201d said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. \u201cWe\u2019ve done things like recruit more women operatives to be involved and have a seat at the table with candidates, message-training and specific voter contact efforts.\u201d The proof is in the numbers But some senior Republican women say that despite plenty of lip service paid to elevating women within the party, representation at the federal level is paltry, and the performance trend in primaries shows fewer Republican women are winning in those races than just two decades ago. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that there\u2019s this attitude and perception within the Republican Party that are more aspirational when it comes to women,\u201d Snowe said. \u201cThe Republican Party hasn\u2019t done the groundwork to build a strong bench of Republican women to launch a presidential candidacy.\u201d \u201cWomen have to put a step forward\u201d as well, Snowe said, to better ensure that they are in the running for the nation\u2019s top political post. Senate balance of power could shift on women candidates However, doing so involves tough choices, Hutchison said. \u201cWe do end up with a great amount of responsibility for our families. Being out campaigning for weeks and months at a time is difficult. The women in the Senate struggle with this, with questions of, \u2018Do you move your children to be with you, or do you leave them back home?\u2019\u201d Hutchison said. \u201cThat makes it harder for us to say, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m going to run for president and go to New Hampshire, Iowa, and South Carolina for weeks on end\u2019 \u2013 especially if they are in office already and away from their families. To add that to it is very difficult.\u201d \u201cWhereas, no matter what we say, men have wives and they can leave more easily,\u201d she said. Though they may disagree with her political views, Republican women often give Hillary Clinton kudos for her political skill. \u201cRepublican women have to do what Hillary Clinton is doing. We have to steal the playbook of what she is doing,\u201d said Crystal Wright, an editor and blogger with ConservativeBlackChick.com. Winning requires building strong coalitions, fundraising and surrogates, Wright said. \u201cLook at what Hillary has done in each campaign she has run. \u2026 She\u2019s a good example of a case study for how women should model their efforts for running for office.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell faces tea party challenge Incumbent Idaho congressman is expected to fend off tea party challenge, too Tea party candidates might be splitting the vote in Georgia Senate primary Pennsylvania governor's race is a race to the left among Democrats It\u2019s one of the busiest days in this year\u2019s primary calendar. Six states from coast to coast hold primaries on Tuesday, and again anti-establishment candidates face long odds in high-profile Republican showdowns. Since its birth in 2009, the tea party has had a number of primary successes, with victorious challenges from the right producing major headlines for the movement. But they\u2019ve also given the party plenty of headaches and hurt its chances of winning back the Senate, effectively costing the GOP five winnable elections over the last two cycles. This year, the establishment learned to fight back, and so far has had the upper hand in most contests against tea party-backed challengers. Here are five key showdowns to watch how they play out on Tuesday. Inside Politics: $100 million Senate seat Rove clarifies; Tea Party; Obama's judge Tea party gets Nebraska victory 1. Big showdown in the Bluegrass State: Tuesday\u2019s marquee battle is in Kentucky, where Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell is challenged by businessman Matt Bevin, who enjoys strong support from many tea party groups and influential conservative anti-establishment organizations. While this race has seen big spending by the campaigns and outside groups, McConnell is expected to cruise to renomination for a sixth term. Anti-establishment Republicans feel McConnell represents everything wrong in Washington and thought he could be knocked off. The Senate Conservatives fund, a D.C.-based anti-establishment organization, spent around $1 million in support of Bevin and against McConnell. But it\u2019s been quiet recently, with McConnell\u2019s formidable lead in the polls. McConnell had two Kentucky-based super PACs supporting him as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association. \u201cIt was a vintage Mitch McConnell campaign. They found Bevin\u2019s weaknesses and used them against him. They boxed him in and he couldn\u2019t move,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the non-partisan Cook Political Report, a top campaign handicapper. She added that \u201cBevin suffered from new candidate syndrome.\u201d McConnell\u2019s ending his primary campaign by once again touting his endorsement from Kentucky\u2019s other Republican senator, Rand Paul. Paul was the upstart who beat McConnell\u2019s pick in the race. But Paul, who is very influential among tea party activists and libertarians, backed McConnell last year before Bevin got into the race. The narrator in one of McConnell\u2019s two closing statewide TV commercials says, \u201cOn Tuesday, join with Rand Paul and vote for Mitch McConnell.\u201d And the spot includes a clip of Paul saying last year that Kentucky \u201cought to be proud of having Senator McConnell.\u201d While McConnell should have an early night on Tuesday, he faces a serious challenge in November from rising Democratic star Alison Lundergan Grimes. Big-name Democrats are already campaigning for her. 2. Idaho \u2013 the other big event: The other high-profile, outsider vs. establishment battle of the night is in the House. Eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson faces a serious primary challenge from Bryan Smith, an attorney who claims that Simpson\u2019s not conservative enough and is soft on spending. GOP Candidates Balk at Sen. McConnell On Hillary 2016, Gov. Patrick: 'I worry' Does the United States lack direction? Democrats optimistic about \"The Marks\" Smith is backed by some tea party groups and by the D.C.-based anti-tax group Club for Growth, which has a history of backing conservative primary challengers. The group has spent some $700,000 to attack Simpson and support Smith. But their spending dwindled the past couple of weeks, as Simpson has held a sizable lead in recent polls. Simpson is backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has spent heavily in the race. \u201cYou can take it from me, the conservative choice for Congress is Mike Simpson,\u201d Mitt Romney says in one ad put out by the Chamber last month. Simpson, was an early backer of the Republican 2012 presidential nominee\u2019s campaign. And Romney returned the favor last year, endorsing Simpson. The winner of the primary will be the odds-on-favorite in November in the heavily Republican district, which covers the central and eastern parts of the state, from Boise to the borders with Utah and Wyoming. 3. Georgia \u2013 tea party splits vote: Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss\u2019 announcement last year that he wouldn\u2019t run for re-election triggered a free-for-all GOP primary battle. Reps. Phil Gingrey, Paul Broun and Jack Kingston, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, and businessman David Perdue are the major candidates and Kingston, Handel, and Perdue, rather than the more conservative Broun and Gingrey, are on top of public opinion polls. \u201cI think they (Broun and Gingrey) both ran terrible campaigns,\u201d said the Cook Report\u2019s Duffy. \u201cBecause both of them were in there, the tea party movement was divided.\u201d The primary campaign\u2019s closing days have seen near daily attacks between the candidates. An example of how ugly it\u2019s getting on the campaign trail: Gingrey\u2019s campaign sent out an email accusing Handel of \u201cpromoting teenage homosexuality,\u201d highlighting a vote she took in favor of funding for an LGBT youth program when she served on the Fulton County Commission. Since no candidate\u2019s expected to top 50%, this contest\u2019s all-but-certain to head to a July 22 runoff between the top two finishers. The eventual GOP nominee will face off against Michelle Nunn, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee and daughter of former longtime Sen. Sam Nunn, a household name in Georgia. 4. Oregon \u2013 a last-minute wildcard?: The race for the GOP Senate nomination in Oregon, a vote-by-mail state, has only recently grabbed some national attention, mostly due to some high-profile support for Portland pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Monica Wehby. She recently won endorsements from Romney and another 2012 GOP presidential candidate: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who\u2019s a co-host of CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire.\u201d More importantly, D.C.-based NewRepublican.org went up with major television, digital and radio spots in support of Wehby. The organization was formed early last year, following the 2012 GOP election defeats, by a group of Republican veterans to refocus its messaging and policy goals in an attempt to broaden the GOP\u2019s appeal beyond its traditional base. Wehby, who also enjoys the backing of several GOP senators including McConnell, grabbed some attention last month for a campaign ad of her own. The 60-second spot highlighted a woman who was advised to consider terminating her pregnancy because her unborn daughter had spinal problems. In the ad, the woman recalls how Wehby operated on her daughter shortly after she was born, and that the girl is now a healthy 12-year-old. But Wehby\u2019s support for abortion rights has fueled a six-figure spending push by anti-abortion groups in opposing Wehby. Polls show Wehby ahead of more conservative state Rep. Jason Conger, who was backed last week by former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a Republican presidential candidate last time who may run again for the White House in 2016. The wildcard: A last-minute story over the weekend revealed that after a breakup last year with the wealthy man she was dating, Wehby was accused of \u201cstalking\u201d him, according to a police report. The primary winner will run in November against first-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who Republicans think might be vulnerable if 2014 turns into a wave year for the GOP. 5. Pennsylvania \u2013 a race to the left: Republicans can\u2019t have all the fun. The Democratic gubernatorial primary contest in the Keystone State has been one long wild ride. In this race to the left, Rep. Allyson Schwartz has been touting her strong support for the health care law, better known as Obamacare, a rare sight this midterm election year, as she plays catchup with businessman Tom Wolf, who leads in the polls. Wolf was virtually unknown in Pennsylvania at the start of the year, but he spent big bucks to flood the airwaves with ads. Wolf has increasingly come under attack from Schwartz as well as state Treasurer Rob McCord, another contender in the field. The winner will face off in November against GOP Gov. Tom Corbett, who seems to be enjoying the food fight among the Democratic challengers. \u201cThe Democrat fight for governor is getting ugly,\u201d says the narrator in a new Corbett TV ad that uses a boxing theme. But Corbett has his own concerns, as he\u2019s considered one of the most vulnerable governors running for re-election this year.",

            "article_content": "Watch more of Gloria Borger\u2019s interview with Marjorie Margolies on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d at 7 p.m. ET. Former Rep. Marjorie Margolies lost her seat 20 years ago after backing Bill Clinton on budget Chelsea Clinton is her daughter-in-law, so she has a unique link to the former first family And Bill and Hillary are working to help her out in her political comeback bid But there's a fine line in gauging how much of the Clintons is enough in a political campaign It\u2019s a large district in and around Philadelphia. It\u2019s not a swing seat; it\u2019s a safe Democratic stronghold\u2014not a nailbiter. But in this midterm election, the 13th Congressional District race has attracted some national attention and some rock star fundraisers: Bill and Hillary Clinton. Why such attention and star power? Because the candidate is Marjorie Margolies: related by marriage to the Clintons and tied to the former President by history. Margolies first gained national attention 20 years ago. She lost her seat as a freshman House member after voting for Bill Clinton\u2019s 1993 signature economic plan. It was about to go down after multiple Democratic defections. He needed one vote; she was it. \u201cI don\u2019t regret my vote,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cNor do I apologize for it.\u201d Clinton remained in her considerable debt. Neither she nor the President could have known then that they would be bound in another way: Her son, Marc, married Chelsea Clinton, who is now expecting their first child. And while the Clintons have raised money for her campaign, they\u2019re not exactly campaign regulars. Is Clinton back in the campaign game? In memoir excerpts, Clinton honors her mom Inside Politics: Fundraiser-in-law Rove responds to Clinton comment backlash Smerconish on HRC, talk radio The political question: how much Clinton is enough? \u201cWe always knew that if they came in too much we would be blamed for their coming in too much. If they don\u2019t come in enough, then people would say they didn\u2019t come in enough. You\u2019re kind of damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t,\u201d Margolies told CNN. \u201cThey have done everything we\u2019ve asked them to do, and I am running on what I have accomplished in the last 20 years and not on my affiliation with the Clintons.\u201d But that\u2019s hardly something she can, or really wants to, escape. A campaign ad using Bill Clinton\u2019s appearance on her behalf went up on the air Wednesday with him saying \u201cIf you send Marjorie to Congress she will make you proud \u2026 and this district will be well-served if you elect her.\u201d Hillary Clinton is headlining a fundraiser in New York City for her Thursday evening. And her vote to pass Clinton\u2019s economic plan back in the day is a subject she does not shy away from as he campaigns in her old district that was once largely Republican, but is now largely Democratic. Predictably, she\u2019s come under some criticism about how her campaign has used the Clintons. One of her opponents, Daylin Leach, released an ad featuring some of Bill Clinton\u2019s remarks touting Margolies. Then Leach\u2019s daughter comes on the screen saying \u201cWhile some cling to the past, we just can\u2019t go backwards.\u201d How many pro-Clinton super PACs is too many? The campaign hopes the Clintons can gave Margolies a last minute boost in fundraising and turnout. \u201cI want to get one thing out of the way. I would be here if her son wasn\u2019t my son-in-law,\u201d President Clinton said at a campaign event for Margolies last month. \u201cI\u2019m not saying vote for her because 20 years ago she saved the economy.\u201d She also saved the Clinton presidency, according to a top former aide, Paul Begala\u2014and knowingly lost her job. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure he knew that that was a political death knell for somebody who had just won by the narrowest of margins. And he was very impressed by that,\u201d Begala said of the President\u2019s reaction. Margolies remembers the day of that vote in August of 1993. \u201cThe Republicans were high fiving, saying it\u2019s going down,\u201d Margolies recounted  in the interview. \u201cA lot of Democrats were talking about changing their vote.\u201d The President called her. \u201cHe said what would it take?\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said I will only be your last vote. I know how important it is.\u201d That point was not lost on the President. Clinton and senior White House staff huddled around a small television in an office just off the Oval Office. They watched Margolies walk the plank. Hillary Clinton steps further into politics with Margolies fundraiser \u201cRepublicans stood there and taunted her and said \u2018bye bye Marjorie,\u201d said Begala. They were right. Her deciding vote may have saved Clinton, but she would end up losing her seat the next year. In the book of isn\u2019t-this-a-small-world, Margolies is now part of the extended Clinton family. In fact, she and the Clintons are preparing to be co-grandparents. But as voluble as she is on politics, she\u2019s just as silent when it comes to the Clintons. When asked about family matters, she becomes downright monosyllabic. When asked if she has anything to say about her and Hillary Clinton being co-grandmothers she responded \u201cno.\u201d Asked if she and the Clintons are friends she said \u201cIt\u2019s an area that I will not get into,\u201d adding: \u201cThey are lovely. The Clintons couldn\u2019t be any nicer.\u201d And when asked what it was like for her son to marry into such a political dynasty, Margolies told CNN \u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly normal.\u201d That depends on how you define normal. As for the race itself, Margolies has a fight on her hands. She\u2019s locked in a tight four-way Democratic primary despite being the early frontrunner. The district is now solidly Democratic and runs from the affluent suburbs into the blue-collar area of North Philadelphia. She campaigns as an advocate for abortion rights and boosting the middle class. She has been attacked by opponents for misusing campaign funds which she denies. She also got hit for not campaigning aggressively in the early days. She has ramped up her schedule and participated in more debates. How strong is Hillary? Karl Rove is attacking her",

            "article_content": "North Carolina House speaker could be the best bet to unseat Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan Tom Tillis faces conservative opponents in Tuesday's primary Hagan's seat is one that Republicans think they have a good chance of flipping Establishment Republicans are bucking up Tillis' campaign For a Republican establishment still spooked by the ghosts of Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock \u2013 grassroots-backed conservatives who threw away winnable Senate races in recent elections with tone-deaf remarks about abortion \u2013 Tuesday can\u2019t come soon enough. In North Carolina, Republicans are watching closely to see if Thom Tillis, the state House speaker and maybe the party\u2019s best bet to unseat endangered Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan this November, can capture 40% of the vote in Tuesday\u2019s GOP Senate primary. If he does, Tillis will become the party\u2019s Senate nominee, and Washington Republicans will breathe a little easier knowing they\u2019ve dodged a long and expensive runoff battle between Tillis, the consensus frontrunner, and a flame-throwing conservative rival. Perhaps more importantly, Republicans will have picked a Senate candidate who doesn\u2019t immediately jeopardize their chances of defeating Hagan, whose approval ratings are dangerously low, and flipping a crucial swing state Senate seat into GOP hands. Six factors between now and the midterms There\u2019s been an absence of reliable primary polling, but in the last week, North Carolina Republicans have come around to the idea that Tillis, nourished by an onslaught of supportive television ads from outside groups, has surged to the brink of winning the nomination outright. If no candidate reaches the 40% threshold in the primary, a runoff election will be held on July 15. 2014: The Obama Drag Rand's gamble 'Humiliate' the Tea Party \u201cThis race is like that final putt that keeps moving slowly towards the hole,\u201d said Steven Law, the president of American Crossroads, one of several national Republican groups backing Tillis. \u201cIt\u2019s on the right path, but it\u2019s whether it actually falls in or not on Tuesday.\u201d The race has been cast as yet another skirmish in the ongoing GOP civil war, pitting the establishment-backed Tillis against seven tea party challengers. It\u2019s true that Tillis has the support of prominent national Republicans \u2013 including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 and the Chamber of Commerce. Opponents\u2019 campaigns have fizzled But it would be too easy to frame a Tuesday victory for Tillis, if it happens, as a clean win for the newly emboldened Republican establishment. Tillis hasn\u2019t been forced to beat back a tea party challenge, because his opponents haven\u2019t put up much of a fight. They\u2019ve also splintered conservative support. He has two serious rivals for the nomination: Greg Brannon, a staunch libertarian tea party activist who wants to put U.S. currency back on the gold standard, and Mark Harris, a prominent Baptist pastor from Charlotte who spearheaded the 2012 passage of a constitutional amendment that strengthened the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban. Like other insurgent Republican candidacies around the country this year, neither campaign has managed to stir the kind of grassroots passion that propelled so many tea party victories in 2010. Key races in the House, Senate and states \u201cI have been involved in serious Republican primary battles in North Carolina in the past, and this is not a serious battle,\u201d said Dee Stewart, a Raleigh-based GOP operative who is not working for any candidate in the race but has contributed money to Tillis.\u201dWe have only one credible campaign. If there were other credible campaigns, Thom Tillis might have a hard time getting to 40%. But there is only one credible campaign.\u201d The most recent campaign finance reports illustrate just how badly his opponents\u2019 campaigns have fizzled. Polls favor GOP in midterm showdown Tillis, a former IBM executive, has raised more than $3 million for his primary campaign and has about $1 million in the bank. Brannon, meanwhile, has the backing of national tea party outfits like the Tea Party Patriots and FreedomWorks, but the groups have provided little financial cover for the cash-strapped candidate. Brannon has just $206,000 on hand. Harris reported even less: Just $72,000, barely enough to fund a modest advertising campaign on cable news, let alone fund the final blitz of a credible statewide campaign. Senator starts the Hillary clock Smoking gun or partisan nonsense? 1984 McConnell vs. 2014 McConnell Counting on national figures to stir up some energy Brannon is hoping that a last-minute visit to the state Monday by his top national supporter, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, might provide a burst of media attention and activist energy to push him into a runoff. It\u2019s a risky gamble for Paul: Republicans inside and outside the state are privately questioning his last-minute decision to help Brannon, who was recently found liable by a Wake County jury for misleading investors in a failed tech startup. Brannon is appealing the decision. Harris, too, has national support. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has endorsed his fellow Baptist pastor. But Harris\u2019 in-state relationships are more valuable: The president of North Carolina\u2019s Baptist State Convention, Harris has in his corner a formidable network of evangelicals, still a powerful constituency in a Republican primary in the South. Tillis backers privately fret that Harris, polished and charismatic, would be a more dangerous opponent than the volatile Brannon in a runoff, but Harris has not marshaled the resources to broaden his name recognition beyond his Christian conservative base. In a pair of recent debates, Brannon and Harris tried to outflank Tillis from the right, questioning his commitment to gun rights and his opposition to same-sex marriage, but Tillis stayed above the fray and kept his focus squarely on Hagan. He has made electability a selling point in his pitch to Republicans. \u201cIf I thought any of the other candidates had as good a chance at beating Kay Hagan as me, I\u2019d be on their campaign committee,\u201d Tillis told CNN in a recent interview inside his Raleigh office. \u201cThis is about securing a majority in the U.S. Senate. None of the other candidates have the experience or have taken the time to build a foundation to have a credible campaign in November. If the Democratic establishment is going to rain down heavy on North Carolina to try to keep Hagan, we better have someone who has the track record and the campaign strategy to have the support to match that.\u201d With almost $5 million worth of ads, Democratic groups have spent heavily to bloody Tillis early. But pro-Republican organizations have been the ones raining down heavy on North Carolina. Americans for Prosperity, a group with close ties to the Koch fundraising network, has already spent more than $8 million attacking Hagan. Chamber, Crossroads seek \u2018electable\u2019 candidates The Chamber of Commerce and American Crossroads have also stepped in to prop up Tillis before the primary. The two groups have made it a mission in 2014 to seek out \u201celectable\u201d candidates in GOP primaries and help snuff out tea party insurgents in Senate and House races nationwide. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any margin for error this year, and that\u2019s why we are going to continue to be aggressive in Republican primaries and in general elections on behalf of candidates that are best positioned to accomplish that goal,\u201d said Rob Engstrom, the chamber\u2019s national political director. \u201cNo longer are we going to wait for a candidate to emerge. We are going to get in to pick the best person to help lead the economic recovery, and Thom Tillis is that guy.\u201d Outside groups are barred by law from coordinating with the campaigns, but they have worked methodically from a distance to support Tillis, a sign that independent GOP groups have learned from the failures of the 2012 presidential race, when super PACs and tax-exempt 501(c)(4) groups, which are not required to disclose their donors, ran TV ads and field operations that sometimes conflicted with the strategies of Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign and muddled the GOP message. Dude, where's my talking point? U.S. GDP; Benghazi; Clintons v. media Mixed signals from economy When Tillis recently went up with a television ad in every North Carolina market except for expensive Raleigh and Charlotte, strategists for outside groups saw a smoke signal asking for help. American Crossroads stepped in, later followed by the Chamber of Commerce. Chamber of Commerce ads back mainstream Republicans \u201cWe assumed, since he is a smart politician, that he wasn\u2019t certain he had the resources to cover the whole state during the primary, and he was inviting others to fill the gap,\u201d said Law, the American Crossroads president. \u201cSo we filled that gap and stayed on Raleigh and Charlotte TV during that time. We carefully measured our progress during that time, and made sure our message was having an impact. Rather than taking the shotgun approach, we have tried to be more surgical about when and how we engage, solving particular problems rather than running the whole campaign from 30,000 feet.\u201d Democrats already hitting Tillis with ads Democrats, who see Tillis as the toughest potential challenger to Hagan, have tried to scuff up the House speaker even before the primary. The Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic super PAC, has run an ad raising questions about two close Tillis aides who were caught having affairs with lobbyists and received payouts from the speaker\u2019s office after resigning. Hagan\u2019s campaign recently sent mailers to Republican voters citing Tillis\u2019 past support for a state health care exchange, which he now opposes, and showcasing a comment from a radio interview in which Tillis called the Affordable Care Act \u201ca great idea\u201d \u2013 though he actually called it a \u201cgreat idea that can\u2019t be paid for.\u201d Tillis says he supports a complete repeal of the health care law. \u201cWe have to repeal it, then we have to come up with solutions for legitimate issues that we need,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cYou have to take Obamacare as a whole. Not a fix. A repeal of Obamacare, and then implement responsible health care solutions.\u201d His unbending position on the health care law is a reminder that, despite the guff he\u2019s taken from the right during the primary, Tillis is far from some moderate squish \u2013 a fact that Democrats are seizing on as they brace for the general election. \u201cI am not running away from my conservative credentials,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cI am running on them.\u201d After Republicans seized control of the state legislature and governor\u2019s mansion in 2012, Tillis, as the leader of the House, helped engineer a dramatic conservative policy makeover in Raleigh, sparking the Moral Monday protests against GOP-backed budget cuts, voter ID laws and abortion restrictions. The National Rifle Association and the National Right to Life Committee have endorsed Tillis. He recently said he would eliminate the federal Department of Education. He\u2019s taken positions on women\u2019s issues \u2013 like stripping Planned Parenthood of state funding and opposing a federal equal pay law \u2013 that Democrats plan to use against him in a bid to win over independent suburbanites. And as much as Republicans in Washington view him as the most disciplined campaigner in the GOP field, his public comments are not always well-calibrated. He has dismissed criticism from Democratic opponents as \u201cwhining coming from losers.\u201d Tied to the fringe? \u201cThom Tillis is weighed down by a fringe, special interest agenda that he passed at the expense of middle-class families that goes hand in hand with his newest out-of-touch positions, his history of making divisive remarks, and his ethical baggage that ranges from pay-to-play politics to giving disgraced staffers taxpayer-funded severance packages,\u201d said Sadie Weiner, a spokesman for the Hagan campaign. As he nears what could be the Republican finish line Tuesday, there are signs that Tillis is becoming more cautious with the general election on the horizon. In 2012, Tillis eagerly embraced that year\u2019s version of the House Republican budget drafted by Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. Questioned about this year\u2019s budget plan \u2013 specifically if he supports Medicare vouchers \u2013 Tillis punted. \u201cI haven\u2019t studied it to the position where I can really give you a well-informed response,\u201d he said. He was also asked which senators he admires and hopes to emulate if he gets to Washington. The names he mentioned \u2013 \u201chigh-caliber\u201d members like Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso and Texas Sen. John Cornyn \u2013 aren\u2019t exactly tea party heartthrobs. Gesturing to a bust of Ronald Reagan on his desk, Tillis characterized his work in the state legislature as \u201cresponsible and balanced,\u201d and he punctuated the interview by questioning the effectiveness of conservative hard-liners like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. \u201cMr. Cruz is obviously a brilliant member,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cI think that he stands for a lot of things that we as conservatives stand for. But how do you mobilize that? How do you sell your colleagues and the American people on the things that are his priorities?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Tom Ervin was running as a Republican but withdrew and entered as an independent Incumbent Nikki Haley is one of the Republican Party's brightest stars Some Republicans think Democrats are behind Ervin's campagin to split GOP vote Some Democrats think Ervin could split the anti-Haley vote and assure her victory South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is one of the GOP\u2019s brightest stars, a 42-year-old Indian-American, a dynamo fundraiser and a favorite of national Republicans eager to showcase diversity in their ranks. Haley\u2019s road to re-election this November has looked smooth of late, thanks to Obamacare\u2019s unpopularity in South Carolina, a shrinking unemployment rate and the cautious approach of her Democratic challenger, state Sen. Vincent Sheheen. But Haley\u2019s path to victory might have just become more complicated. That\u2019s because a little-known attorney and former judge named Tom Ervin has joined the race for governor as an independent \u2013 and his campaign is threatening to raise at least $6 million in the process. \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend whatever it takes,\u201d Ervin told CNN. \u201cI am going to tell the truth to the people of South Carolina.\u201d Warren says 'no' ... again The Political Reality of Obamacare A new deportation policy? Ervin entered the race clumsily. In March, he filed to run against Haley in the Republican primary, loaning his campaign $420,000 as seed money. He promptly unleashed $65,000 worth of robocalls attacking the governor. But he soon dropped out of the primary and announced his independent bid, saying there wasn\u2019t enough to time to mount a credible GOP campaign before the June 10 primary. Haley\u2019s campaign was quick to diminish Ervin as a \u201cliberal trial lawyer.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate Mr. Ervin\u2019s desire for public service, but a trial lawyer and former Democratic lawmaker\u200e who wants to raise taxes and embrace Obamacare should probably be running as a Democrat,\u201d said Haley spokesman Rob Godfrey. \u201cGovernor Haley is focused on the legislative session, passing historic education and ethics reforms and keeping the fantastic economic and jobs momentum going. And we look forward to running against two liberal trial lawyers who support Obamacare instead of just one.\u201d Rumors of a shadow campaign Ervin\u2019s audacious, last-minute entry into the race has been met with eye-rolls by Republicans. A popular rumor in Columbia is that his candidacy is little more than a shadow campaign aided by trial attorneys who have long clashed with the pro-business governor and want a spoiler in the race. Haley defeated Sheheen by just four points when they first squared off in the 2010 race. Some Democrats are hopeful that Ervin, and his money, will help them open up a two-front war against Haley on the campaign trail, while siphoning Republican-leaning voters away from the incumbent. A libertarian candidate, Charleston businessman Steve French, could do the same. Others, though, are concerned that Ervin will hurt rather than help their cause by divvying up the existing anti-Haley vote, thereby hurting Sheheen, who needs to grow his support in a GOP-dominated state. \u201cI think it could hurt,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic Party chairman in the state. \u201cThere are a lot of moderate Democrats, a lot of people who would have voted for Vincent who may gravitate to Tom Ervin now if he throws a punch. It may Balkanize the anti-Haley vote. That may be in play now.\u201d Adding intrigue to Ervin\u2019s candidacy is the behind-the-curtain presence of Republican consultant John Weaver, the mercurial former John McCain and Jon Huntsman strategist who is consulting on the campaign. Weaver, a screwdriver-sipping Texan who tweets prolifically about the San Antonio Spurs, has never been shy about sticking his finger in the eye of his fellow Republicans. Inside Politics: Landrieu's Double take Inside Politics: Rebirth of Mitt Inside Politics: Landrieu's Rules After McCain lost his bid for the presidency in 2000, Weaver briefly dabbled in Democratic politics and feuded with Karl Rove during the Bush years. During the Huntsman campaign, he called Republicans \u201ca bunch of cranks\u201d in the pages of Esquire. Ervin\u2019s campaign is not the first time he\u2019s worked against the GOP on a governor\u2019s race: In 2010, he advised the ill-fated candidacy of Tim Cahill, a Democrat-turned-independent candidate for Massachusetts governor. \u2018A breath of fresh air\u2019 \u201cI was honored when Tom called me three weeks ago about being a member of his team,\u201d Weaver said in an email. \u201cWe tried to recruit him twice for Sen. McCain in our two primaries in South Carolina \u2013 and failed. I know Tom to be a social and economic conservative and also extremely straight forward and bold in his vision for the state. He\u2019ll be a breath of fresh air for sure as the next Republican governor.\u201d Ervin revealed his first ad on Monday, calling himself \u201can independent Republican\u201d and criticizing Haley on a number of issues, including the massive 2012 data breach at the South Carolina Department of Revenue that exposed nearly 4 million Social Security numbers. Ervin\u2019s chances of winning the race are slim. There\u2019s no modern precedent for a candidate without party support winning statewide in South Carolina. He first has to qualify to get on the November ballot by collecting at least 10,000 signatures needed to run as a \u201cpetition\u201d candidate. Meanwhile, Haley\u2019s campaign has raised nearly $6 million for her campaign, a hefty sum in a state where television ad time is relatively affordable, and she has been aided by a series of commercials paid for by the Republican Governors Association. In one hard-edged ad that began airing this week, the RGA blasts Sheheen, an attorney and state senator, for legal work defending a sex offender and domestic abusers. The South Carolina Democratic Party called the ad \u201cdesperate.\u201d Ervin sees an opening. Sitting for an interview inside the wood-paneled lobby of WRIX, an Anderson radio station he purchased out of bankruptcy last year, the soft-spoken Ervin said his decision to drop out of the Republican primary will give him time to raise money and get his message out. Had he remained in the GOP race, it would have allowed Haley to line her war chest by going back to her donors and soliciting even more money for the primary campaign. Questioning Haley\u2019s commitment Ervin served one term in the South Carolina legislature 30 years ago as a Democrat, and ran for a seat again in 2005 as a Republican, but lost. A practicing attorney involved with charitable work in the Greenville area, he said he has been active in local politics for years. He said he did not vote in the last gubernatorial election. \u201cWe have no leadership in Columbia right now,\u201d Ervin said. \u201cGovernor Haley has been a disaster. Every agency she has touched is in crisis mode. She is clearly focused on her own selfish political ambitions. If she is re-elected, I seriously doubt she will finish out her term. She has got her eyes on Washington. All she can talk about is federal issues, when our state is languishing.\u201d Inside Politics: Tea Party Primary Inside Politics: Still \"repeal\" Inside Politics: Brown gaining Ervin pointed to the state\u2019s \u201ccrumbling\u201d roads and bridges, education policy and government transparency as issues he plans to highlight. He said a gas tax is \u201con the table,\u201d and he\u2019d likely sign a budget increasing fees if it passed the state legislature, but his positions hew closer to conservative orthodoxy. Ervin wants to eliminate the personal income tax and says he opposes the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, although he previously told The State newspaper  he would not veto Medicaid expansion if the state balanced the budget. As a born-again Christian, he\u2019s against same-sex marriage and abortion. But mainly, he said he wants to make the race a referendum on Haley\u2019s first term. Ervin applied a lighter touch to Sheheen, calling him a \u201ccareer politician\u201d and \u201cfar to the left.\u201d But he also described the Democrat as a \u201cpolicy wonk\u201d with \u201ca good understanding of the issues.\u201d Sheheen\u2019s campaign had no comment on Ervin. Ervin\u2019s sudden appearance on the political scene, his blistering criticisms of Haley and his ties to the state\u2019s legal community \u2013 his wife is a prominent worker\u2019s compensation attorney \u2013 have fueled talk in the state capital that he was recruited into the race by Republican fundraiser John Rainey, a longtime Haley nemesis. A remarkable moment Rainey fiercely opposed Haley during her first gubernatorial campaign in 2010. After she won, he memorably filed a lawsuit and then an ethics complaint against the governor, claiming she profited from her office while serving in the state legislature. That complaint was dismissed, but not before Haley defended herself before the state\u2019s ethics panel and, in a remarkable moment, called Rainey \u201ca racist, sexist bigot who has tried everything in his power to hurt me and my family.\u201d Ervin acknowledged being friendly with Rainey\u2019s brother, but denied that he is a stalking horse for the legal community. \u201cSince I was a circuit court judge for 14 years, I do know a number of attorneys,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there will be some of my friends that will contribute to my campaign. But I don\u2019t expect to get the endorsement of the trial lawyers.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know John well enough to approach him,\u201d Ervin said of Rainey. \u201cI may, because he wants some change in state government as well. He may be motivated to give. But John has not contributed to my campaign.\u201d Rainey, too, denied any connection to Ervin\u2019s campaign. \u201cNo,\u201d he said flatly when asked if he recruited Ervin to run. \u201cThere is nothing else to say.\u201d Still, Rainey had harsh words for Haley, calling her \u201ccorrupt to the core of her being.\u201d In the next breath, he gamed out a scenario in which Ervin could open the door to a Sheheen victory. \u201cI think he appeals to centrist Republicans, some of whom don\u2019t want to vote for somebody with a D by their name, but who would vote for someone with Republican credentials,\u201d Rainey said. \u201cIf you can get somebody who can carve off 5% of the vote, Vincent can win. There is no question he can win.\u201d Katon Dawson, a former South Carolina GOP chairman, said Ervin and his wife \u201chave been very successful in the legal business.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t take it very seriously.\u201d \u201cThey are not going to shake a lot of votes loose from Republicans,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cIf they are going to spend a couple million, that\u2019s their choice. He can do what he wants with his money. If I was Tom and I was looking for some excitement, I wouldn\u2019t run as an independent for governor in a Republican state. He\u2019d be better off if he bought a new sports car and got a girlfriend and got it out of his system.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The equal pay fight has consumed the Texas gubernatorial race for almost a month Texas race points to key issue for Democratic candidates Equal pay issue used to galvanize base for expected low Democratic turnout Republicans tend to dismiss it as a non-issue On March 9, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, the state\u2019s Republican candidate for governor, appeared on a Dallas television station and was asked a straightforward question. Would he veto, as Gov. Rick Perry did last year, the Texas version of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, a bill that would allowed women to file equal pay claims in state courts? Abbott wouldn\u2019t say. Instead, he smiled and held forth for a few moments about the importance of women being paid the same wages as men. GOP backs equal pay for equal work Inside Politics: Obama Drag? GOP tutors men running against women Huckabee: Women don't need 'Uncle Sugar' The campaign of his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Wendy Davis, quickly roared to life. Davis, who shepherded the equal pay bill through the Texas legislature, accused Abbott of dodging the question and demanded a hard answer. Abbott equivocated for 10 days, then said he would veto the bill, handing Davis fresh ammo. \u201cWe need a governor who will fight for economic opportunity for all Texans,\u201d Davis said at a rally in Austin this week, where supporters waved campaign-sponsored signs reading #EqualPay. \u201cWe need a governor who will fight for that regardless of someone\u2019s gender or their race.\u201d The equal pay fight has consumed the Texas race for a better part of a month now, injecting the Davis campaign with fresh energy and a much-needed dose of optimism. For the first time in the race, Davis is playing offense on a policy issue. The flurry of activity in Texas has called attention to a key issue for Democratic candidates this midterm cycle as they try to change the subject from an unpopular President and thorny issues like the Affordable Care Act: wage fairness for women in the workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely potent,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. \u201cIt\u2019s the No. 1 issue that gets single women out to vote, but it also unites men and women.\u201d \u201cWe were recently conducting focus groups in Michigan with beefy, 50-year old, white auto workers, and one guy said, \u2018If the little lady doesn\u2019t get paid equally, I have to get overtime, and I can\u2019t get that anymore,\u2019\u201d Lake said. \u201cWhile that might not be the most feminist articulation of the policy, men are wildly in favor of equal pay.\u201d Meet 10 visionary women One equal pay statistic has become a well-worn talking point for Democrats: Women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. President Barack Obama slipped the data point into his 2014 State of the Union speech when he demanded that Congress pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen the 1963 Equal Pay Act signed by President John F. Kennedy. Obama called the income disparity between genders an \u201cembarrassment\u201d and proclaimed that \u201cwomen deserve equal pay for equal work.\u201d It was one of his biggest applause lines of the evening. Elizabeth Warren, PCCC back Braley for Senate seats Hardly new fodder for Democrats The gender pay gap is not attributable to discrimination alone. Studies show that women often take lower-paying jobs than men, and they work fewer hours. Still, while pay disparities vary depending on the occupation \u2013 female teachers make 91 cents on the male dollar, for instance \u2013 men generally take home bigger paychecks than women. The gender pay issue is hardly new fodder for Democrats, who have relied on women voters \u2013 especially unmarried women \u2013 to pull them over the finish line in recent elections. In the Virginia governor\u2019s race last fall, Democrat Terry McAuliffe unleashed a sustained assault on his Republican opponent\u2019s views on women\u2019s health issues. McAuliffe narrowly won the race \u2013 but he won the single women demographic by a staggering 42-point margin. The issue flared during the 2008 presidential campaign, when Obama hammered John McCain and Senate Republicans for blocking the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. After Obama\u2019s victory, the legislation became the first bill he signed as president. The fair pay debate surfaced again in 2012, when Obama\u2019s re-election campaign hammered Mitt Romney for dodging a question about whether he would have signed the Ledbetter Act. Like many Republicans, Romney said he supported the concept of equal pay but questioned whether federal legislation would solve the problem. But this year\u2019s midterm election is a different beast. With Democratic turnout expected to tumble in a non-presidential year, party strategists are seizing on equal pay as a way to galvanize the base, raise money and once again paint Republicans as tone deaf on women\u2019s issues. \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredibly important issue for women,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, the president of EMILY\u2019s List, a group that backs Democratic women candidates. \u201cWe see it in our polling, but also in everyday life, that it\u2019s an economic hurt for families. And right now we have a Republican party that is so disinterested in winning over women voters that they are floundering on no-brainer issues like supporting equal pay.\u201d Schriock pointed to a February survey by American Women, an EMILY\u2019s List partner, that showed wide majority support among both men and women for \u201cending gender discrimination\u201d in the workplace and passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. Poll: GOP has a 2014 enthusiasm advantage Others trying to make equal pay an issue Davis is the most famous Democrat to make equal pay a centerpiece of her campaign, but smaller-scale efforts are underway in campaigns up and down the ballot, in local and federal races. Democratic Senate candidates in Republican-leaning states, such as Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky, Natalie Tennant in West Virginia, and Michelle Nunn in Georgia, have raised the issue in campaign fundraising e-mails and list-building petitions. A volley of them were fired off in January, on the five-year anniversary of the Ledbetter Act signing. \u201cMitch McConnell had a chance to be a part of history five years ago, too,\u201d Lundergan Grimes wrote in one fundraising e-mail chiding her Republican opponent. \u201cInstead, he did what he\u2019s done for nearly 30 years when called upon to lead: he refused to answer \u2013 failing to stand for Kentucky\u2019s women and families by voting against the legislation.\u201d By keeping the issue in the news, Democrats hope to benefit in the long term by showcasing GOP presidential hopefuls who oppose equal pay protections. One of them, Rick Perry, vetoed the equal pay legislation that Davis has been touting in the governor\u2019s race. This week, Perry called the war of words over equal pay \u201cnonsense\u201d \u2013 a remark that Democrats will almost certainly use against him if he becomes the GOP presidential nominee in 2016. Several likely 2016 Republican candidates have come out against equal pay protections, mostly on the grounds that they would encourage lawsuits and cripple the ability of private businesses to set their own pay scales based on merit. Yet while Republicans in Washington have counseled candidates on how to speak more carefully about women\u2019s health issues like abortion and contraception, there seems to be no messaging playbook when it comes to equal pay. In the heat of the last presidential race, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio waved off the Ledbetter Act as \u201can effort to help trial lawyers collect their fees and file lawsuits.\u201d Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said the Paycheck Fairness Act would interfere with the free market, comparing it to the way the Soviet Politburo set the price of bread. On the local level, Republican governors like Perry have derided state equal pay laws as redundant given the federal protections already on the books. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker repealed a pay discrimination law in 2012 for much the same reason. Katie Packer Gage, a former Romney campaign adviser who co-founded Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that advises Republicans on how to appeal to women voters, said Democrats are using equal pay \u201cto distract women from real issues.\u201d But Gage urged Republican candidates to be more sensitive when rebutting the issue. \u201cLook, women view this as a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you talk to women, and you see this in focus groups, they feel it\u2019s a problem. They have anecdotal experience, they feel it, but they don\u2019t have very specific data. Our party\u2019s response has been to push back on it and say it\u2019s a not a problem. \u201cI have advised clients when you are asked your position on this, your response needs to be, \u2018Duh, of course men and women should be paid the same for equal work!,\u2019\u201d Gage added. \u201cThis was settled law back in 1963, and Republicans voted for it. Our party is not quick enough to push back on the fact that we already have a law in this country that requires equal pay for equal work.\u201d Democrats unveil agenda to keep Senate",

            "article_content": "The special election for Florida's 13th district is Tuesday and the GOP predicts defeat Republicans at CPAC had little to say to women, minority and young voters Chris Christie is to focus on his anti-abortion message Christie and Bobby Jindal have little to say to each other Here are six things you learned on \u201cInside Politics.\u201d 1. GOP jitters in Florida: The special House election in Florida\u2019s 13th Congressional District is Tuesday, but many plugged-in Republicans there are predicting defeat \u2013 and are already finger pointing. It\u2019s a competitive district, but the seat has been in GOP hands for decades, so a win by Democrat Alex Sink would sting the GOP, and no doubt set off a round of debate about the party\u2019s midterm election strategy \u2013 despite the fact history suggests the results of special elections often say very little about what will happen come November. King: GOP Jitters in FL Again, let\u2019s await the results. But already many Republicans involved in the race are complaining the party is falling short of its promise to make dramatic improvements in its use of data and technology to identify and turnout voters. 2. GOP outreach: Maeve Reston of the Los Angeles Times made note of another Republican promise being called into question. Remember after Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 loss, there was a pledge for much more aggressive GOP outreach to younger voters, women, African Americans and Latinos. Maeve noted that at this weekend\u2019s big Conservative Political Action Conference \u201cthere was strikingly a lack of a message still at this point to these voter groups that they have had such a tough time with\u2026They are going into all of these communities but they are still figuring out what they are going to say and so I think we need to watch very closely as to whether there is any evidence that they are making progress on that front.\u201d 3. Crushing his critics: Audie Cornish of National Public Radio noted the dramatic shift from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell: usually silent about his primary opponent and conservative groups that attack him, now suddenly he vows to \u201ccrush them everywhere.\u201d In a new radio ad, McConnell specifically attacks the Senate Conservative Fund, which had made a name for itself the last few cycles by supporting primary challenges to GOP establishment figures. \u201cSo the gloves are not just off, they are in another room, they are under the bed,\u201d is Audie\u2019s take on the McConnell shift. \u201cIt just seems that they are going to go hard.\u201d IP: NJ Gov. Chris Christie at CPAC 4. The right stuff?: Look for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to highlight his anti-abortion views as part of an effort to show the conservative GOP base it\u2019s unfair to dismiss him as just another Northeast moderate. Robert Costa of the Washington Post shares a conversation with Christie\u2019s top political operative. \u201cAll he was telling me about was Chris Christie\u2019s pro-life record and at CPAC we heard that from Chris Christie,\u201d Robert said. \u201cMy predictions is in the coming months as Christie continues to travel \u2026 he\u2019s going to emphasize that pro-life record, looking ahead to Iowa and South Caroline in the 2016 campaign.\u201d 5. Deep chill: One person Christie apparently isn\u2019t interested in persuading is fellow Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. And vice versa. CNN\u2019s Peter Hamby took us behind the CPAC curtain to show how the deep chill between the two 2016 prospects continues. Christie is chairman of the Republican Governors Association; Jindal is the vice chairman. Both spoke at CPAC. \u201cI\u2019m told that these two didn\u2019t even cross paths backstage, there was no time set up to meet - even say hello in this green room where all these stars were crossing paths,\u201d Peter reports. \u201cJindal spoke right after Chris Christie and they didn\u2019t even talk afterward.\u201d A flashback to Jindal\u2019s frosty defense of Christie over Bridgegate a month ago: King: Scott Brown 2014 6. Hamlet on the Merrimack? Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown and key allies are suddenly sending signals he intends to jump into the 2014 Senate race in New Hampshire. Brown has been debating for months about whether to challenge Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen, torn, friends say, about whether he should instead run for president in 2016, or just forgo running for elective office again. Well a number of GOP sources in New Hampshire report receiving calls in recent days from Brown or his top allies, and there\u2019s word from GOP operatives that there are conversations about building a Senate campaign staff. So all systems are go? Not so fast. Because Brown has been pondering this for months, the GOP activists I spoke to say they won\u2019t believe it until he makes a public statement or files candidacy papers. The wait for Brown\u2019s final answer may be short. \u201cI will make an announcement sooner, rather than later,\u201d he told Neil Cavuto of Fox News on Thursday. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a very, very big decision \u2013a very, very big decision for me and my family. And I\u2019m going to make sure that I cross all T\u2019s and dot all I\u2019s. So it will be sooner, rather than later, and I\u2019ll certainly let everyone know.",

            "article_content": "Confluence of big-name Republican speakers makes CPAC impossible to ignore Rand Paul's straw poll win raises profile and expectations Even as Clinton is scrutinized as 2016 contender, Obama still CPAC's top bogeyman It would be a mistake to read too much into the speeches, breakout sessions and late-night parties that took place at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. Thousands of right-leaning activists made the pilgrimage here this year, to a convention hall outside the nation\u2019s capital. They were greeted, as they are every year, by a bevy of candidates, bloggers, political operatives and more than a few hucksters out to make a buck. But it\u2019s tough to glean any sweeping insight into the state of the conservative movement just by hanging out at CPAC for a few days and talking to its most rock-ribbed and outspoken partisans. And yet: The confluence of big name Republican speakers \u2013 many of them potential White House contenders \u2013 makes the three-day event impossible to ignore. CPAC will name early GOP front-runner GOP national security policy rift? Begala: CPAC bans gay groups CPAC crowd chants, \u2018Run, Sarah, run!\u2019 Here are five big takeaways from CPAC 2014: 1. This is Rand\u2019s house: Rand Paul\u2019s blowout win in the presidential straw poll Saturday \u2013 he won more than a third of the vote, easily besting second-place finisher Ted Cruz \u2013 cemented his place as the King of CPAC. Rand Paul convincingly wins CPAC straw poll Paul\u2019s address here on Friday, unapologetically heavy with libertarian sentiment, was far and away the best-received speech of the weekend. The room was packed and Paul, wearing jeans, was interrupted repeatedly by standing ovations. After his appearance, he joined his wife, Kelley, across the street from the convention center at a packed restaurant for an open bar happy hour with fired-up supporters. Does his showing mean that Paul will be the GOP nominee in 2016? No. But it does affirm what reporters here had been saying all week: that CPAC is now, without question, his turf. CPAC crowd treats Paul like a rock star The face of CPAC has become younger in recent years \u2013 it feels a little like spring break for College Republicans \u2013 and more libertarian in the process. Paul also won the straw poll in 2013, and his father, Ron Paul, won in 2010 and 2011. The younger Paul was aided in his win this year by Young Americans for Liberty, which boasted that it recruited almost 500 activists to come to the event and cast ballots. Almost half of the straw poll vote came from 18- to 25-year-olds. Paul\u2019s showing this weekend will only add to the perception that he\u2019s a top-tier Republican presidential contender who should be taken much more seriously than his father if he runs (and no one thinks he isn\u2019t running). The downside? The dominant straw poll raises expectations for his performance next year, when the GOP race for the White House will be in full swing. 2. Obama still conservative enemy No. 1: The national political conversation is already drifting toward 2016. But at CPAC, President Barack Obama was anything but a lame duck. Begala: Cruz's CPAC comments appalling Roundtable:Paul, Perry, Santorum at CPAC Rick Santorum: Winning means losing Obama foreign policy target of opportunity at CPAC Speaker after speaker listed Obama\u2019s unforgivable sins: taxes, spending, Obamacare, the IRS scandal, NSA surveillance, and on and on. Strikingly, Hillary Clinton \u2013 the Democratic Party\u2019s apparent nominee-in-waiting for 2016 \u2013 went mostly unmentioned until Friday afternoon, the conference\u2019s second day. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee criticized the former secretary of state\u2019s handling of the 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. Her name popped up twice more from the main stage on Saturday. Rep. Michele Bachmann said Clinton will face \u201ctough questions\u201d if she runs in 2016. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called Clinton a \u201cprison guard\u201d of the past. But Obama was far and away the chief bogeyman of CPAC. Even as pundits scrutinize Clinton\u2019s every move in the context of the next presidential campaign, conservatives aren\u2019t yet ready to look beyond the man who still occupies the White House. Perry: Time for a little rebellion 3. Pragmatists vs. purists: There\u2019s always a lot of chatter at CPAC about the various wings of the Republican Party that seem at odds with one another: the free market adherents, the national security hawks, the social conservatives. The growing influence of libertarianism has scrambled how the conservative movement sees itself. But political parties in this country have always been uneasy coalitions of various interests and ideologies. Squabbling is to be expected. The biggest battle in the Republican Party is the one between its pragmatists and its purists. There were hints this year that the pragmatists were gaining ground. In the Obama era, CPAC has earned a reputation for fire-breathing rhetoric and divisive commentary, but some of this year\u2019s biggest speeches had a softer edge. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie led the charge in calling for party unity in pursuit of winning elections. He was well received. Perry hoping for a second chance from voters Sen. Paul slams NSA spying at CPAC Huckabee: Hillary part of 'conversation' Perry ignites audience at CPAC Paul has called on the party to reach out to minorities and has proposed policy ideas \u2013 including sentencing reform and economic \u201cfreedom zones\u201d for low-income areas \u2013 to achieve that goal. In a session about libertarianism, one panelist said children would be better raised by gay couples than single parents. No one booed. Even Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a tea party darling, urged the conservative faithful to be more open-minded. \u201cWe as conservatives have got to be far more engaged in finding converts than discarding heretics,\u201d Lee said on Thursday. But the happy talk couldn\u2019t paper over the fact that conservative hard-liners, including several eyeing a 2016 presidential run, don\u2019t want conservative ideology to take a back seat to anything. And CPAC still booked a number of divisive and provocative speakers like Donald Trump and Bachmann. Former Sen. Rick Santorum inveighed against win-at-all-costs Republicans \u2013 a comment widely seen as a jab at Christie. And Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas warned Republicans against compromise, painting former GOP presidential nominees Bob Dole, John McCain and Mitt Romney as moderate squishes who lost nationally because they veered from conservative principles. His words drew a stern rebuke from McCain \u2013 and a rare statement from Dole telling Cruz to check his facts. 4. Christie\u2019s move to the right has begun: We didn\u2019t learn anything new about Christie from his Thursday speech. But it was how he presented himself that mattered \u2013 and the Christie who showed up at CPAC was a far cry from the Christie who ran for re-election in blue-leaning New Jersey last year, winning in resounding fashion. Christie gets warm reception from gathering of the right That Christie was all about bipartisan legislative compromise, post-Sandy healing, and outreach to voters who don\u2019t traditionally feel comfortable with the GOP. His invitation to last year\u2019s CPAC was lost in the mail. Christie didn\u2019t mind. This year\u2019s Christie more resembled the tea party hero of 2009, when he first won the governorship, and 2010, when he traveled the country in rock star fashion campaigning for GOP candidates. Christie reminded the crowd of his opposition to abortion, calling himself \u201cproudly pro-life.\u201d He bashed unions and the media. He praised the Koch brothers. GOP preaches to the base at CPAC Chris Christie's big day at CPAC Competing visions at CPAC His speech should put to rest any doubts about his willingness to pivot to the right as he mounts a Republican presidential bid, even as he continues to be dogged by multiple controversies and investigations back home. Christie and his team took his CPAC showing seriously. His top political advisers made the trip with him \u2013 and they presumably left happy. Christie placed fourth in the CPAC straw poll, a finish that beat expectations and made for a nice talking point as he begins the work of repairing his tarnished relationship with conservatives. 5. What\u2019s wrong with CPAC? The question popped up again and again in conversations with veteran conference-goers: What\u2019s wrong with CPAC this year? The stakes at this year\u2019s event felt low \u2013 and so did the energy. There were, of course, the usual hordes of earnest, lanyard-wearing 20-somethings brimming with youthful enthusiasm. But the main ballroom at the Gaylord Convention Center in suburban Maryland was rarely full. Something felt off. CPAC \u2018Las Vegas\u2019 for young conservatives Maybe it\u2019s because the conference is at its most exciting during presidential campaign years, when GOP candidates are jostling for attention from the conservative base. Cruz\u2019s comments draw fire from Dole, McCain Or maybe it\u2019s because the tea party activists who arrived here in 2009 and 2010 as conquering insurgents are now just the regular cast of characters and movement hangers-on who show up every year, hawking their wares, snapping pictures with conservative celebrities, recording their podcasts and delivering a familiar litany of warmed-over attacks on Obama. Whatever the reason, there were still plenty of journalists on hand to drink it all in. Thanks to CPAC\u2019s proximity to Washington, there always are. But the diplomatic standoff in Ukraine snuffed out the event\u2019s usual ability to command the Beltway news cycle. And when Democrats tried to make hay of some of the wackier comments made by speakers, few reporters seemed to care. The headlines instead focused on the potential 2016 candidates who came here road-testing their messages. But aside from Paul, with his happy hour for young activists, the White House wannabes weren\u2019t doing much behind-the-scenes to court activists. \u201cThis year is more subdued and doesn\u2019t have the kind of vibrant atmosphere of past confabs \u2013 a result of conservatives being lost in the political wilderness for six years without a unifying conservative leader,\u201d said Dennis Lennox, a GOP activist and operative from Michigan who helped Mitt Romney line up support for the CPAC presidential straw polls in 2007 and 2008. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that there is not a concerted effort by a likely presidential candidate, especially a dark horse who needs a boost in their profile among the foot soldiers who would be critical to carrying their candidacy in a primary that will be fully under way a year from now,\u201d he added.",

            "article_content": "Man seated in courtroom began talking loudly about campaign finance reform Spectator outbursts are rare at Supreme Court The justices ignored the incident, and the man was led out by security The Supreme Court was the scene of an unusual disturbance during its public session on Wednesday, when a man interrupted an oral argument. The incident occurred near the end of debate between the nine justices on the bench and counsel, in a case over attorney fees in patent disputes. A man in a suit and dark tie rose from near the back of the marbled courtroom, and began loudly talking. Why Supreme Court video is important Witnesses said he spoke about the need to keep campaign finance reform laws in place to regulate election spending and contributions.

The court\u2019s official written transcript of the argument made no mention of the remarks. Such outbursts are rare. Court officials say the last time it happened was eight years ago, during an oral argument over a federal law restricting a certain type of later-term abortion procedure. A similar interruption occurred about two decades ago. The courtroom has about 330 seats available to the public.

            "article_content": "Advocacy group on campaign finance reform recorded video during an oral argument The recording was made as a spectator began talking loudly about campaign finance There was no explanation about how a camera was smuggled into the courtroom The video was posted on YouTube In an apparent first at the tradition-minded Supreme Court, an advocacy group surreptitiously recorded video of an oral argument that was interrupted by a spectator. The group 99Rise.org, which supports campaign finance reform, posted the video of Wednesday\u2019s proceedings on YouTube as part of a protest over the issue. No electronic devices, or still or video cameras are permitted in the court\u2019s public sessions. All spectators, including members of the media, are screened with magnetometers at the entrance to the ornate courtroom. First ever video inside Supreme Court? There was no immediate explanation of how a camera was smuggled past security. \u201cThe court became aware today of the video posted on YouTube,\u201d court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in a statement. \u201cCourt officials are in the process of reviewing the video and our courtroom screening procedures.\u201d The taping as well as an interruption by a spectator who witnesses said began talking loudly about campaign finance reform, apparently occurred near the end of arguments in a patent case. The video confirms what witnesses told CNN\u2013 that the well-dressed man spoke about the need to keep campaign finance reform laws in place to regulate election spending and contributions. \u201cMoney is not speech,\u201d he said. \u201cOverturn \u2018Citizens United!\u2019\u201d referring to a 2010 high court decision loosening a century of federal restrictions on corporate spending by \u201cindependent\u201d groups like businesses and unions.

A similar interruption occurred about two decades ago. There are only two photographs of the court in session \u2013 and those cameras were smuggled in \u2013 in the 1930s. CNN and other media outlets have been allowed to shoot video and still pictures of the empty courtroom. Sketch artists are allowed to portray the oral arguments and other public sessions of the court. There have been calls for years to allow cameras in the court, for public benefit. A new television ad released last week urged the justices to do just that saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time for a more open judiciary.\u201d The sponsor of the commercials is the Coalition for Court Transparency, not affiliated with the group that secretly recorded the oral argument Wednesday. The biggest concerns raised by the justices are that cameras would upset the personal dynamic between them that make oral arguments so unique and useful to their later deliberations and opinion-writing. The courtroom has about 330 seats available to the public. Court security instructs spectators before each public session to remain seated, not to speak, or demonstrate.",

            "article_content": "There are 36 gubernatorial races on tap in 2014 Twenty-nine Republicans are governors, giving them an edge over Democrats Being a state chief executive is often a springboard for higher office Florida and Ohio offer key races and are presidential battlegrounds The House and the Senate aren\u2019t going to have all of the fun this election year. Governors are sure to get a slice of the pie with 36 races on tap. While not as high-profile as many congressional races, gubernatorial campaigns are statewide races and can reveal political and policy trends that play out nationally. Woman to watch in 2014: Sen. Gillibrand Clintons using de Blasio inauguration? Best of politics 2013 Governors often drive legislative agendas in their states  and many possess broad authority to act unilaterally on policy and other matters that can impact millions of people. States enacted around 40,000 laws last year on issues that ranged from same-sex marriage to the use of teen tanning beds. 5 House races to watch in 2014 Governors have final say on funding for middle school computers as well as public safety programs. They can reject or approve new voter ID laws and limits on abortion. Additionally, the State House is often a spring board to the White House. Many Presidents \u2013 including four of the past six \u2013 were governors first. Here are five gubernatorial races to watch in 2014: Texas Gov. Rick Perry is retiring, opening the door for a newcomer. While Texas is a solidly Republican state, the liberal left is heavily involved as they see a winner in candidate Wendy Davis. A state Senator, Davis rose to prominence last June when she filibustered a bill that would make it much more difficult for Texas women to obtain an abortion. The left got behind her and helped propel  her candidacy for governor. Stuart Rothenberg of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report wrote that Davis faces an uphill battle with the still-to-be-determined Republican candidate holding an advantage in the reliably red state. Still, Democrats, he said, have incentive to push for her victory. \u201cDemocrats and liberals believe that long-term demographic trends will turn Texas purple, and Davis\u2019 effort could speed up that process, they hope. Moreover, she could well be a national fundraising machine for liberal groups, no matter how realistic her prospects,\u201d he wrote. Ohio The Buckeye State is a perennial battleground in presidential races, so anyone leading it factors into the bigger conversation. This year, Gov. John Kasich is asking voters for a second chance. Elected in 2010 with the support of the tea party, the former Congressman initially championed conservative agenda that included dramatic cuts to state  pensions. But he ran into trouble with fellow Republicans during the 2012 presidential election when he touted Ohio\u2019s vastly improved economy during his time in office, a talking point that did not mesh with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. His campaign focused heavily on U.S. economic difficulties. Mostly ignored, shifts emerge in the politics of poverty And as in any battleground state, the party not in power often has a shot. Polls show Kasich and the leading Democratic contender, Ed FitzGerald, in a close matchup. A tough general election fight, however, is not in the cards yet. Kasich must first win a primary sought by conservatives disappointed with Kasich\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid for the poor. The funding for that comes from federal money made available as part of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reforms that are detested by most Republicans and a centerpiece of their campaign overall to defeat Democrats in November. Kasich\u2019s Republican challenger: tea party leader Ted Stevenot. Florida The primary will be the first real test for the governor\u2019s race in one of the most populous and politically important states. Former Republican Gov. Charlie Crist is now Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist. Crist has a long political history in the Sunshine State. Instead of running for re-election in 2010, he aimed for the Senate. But he was bested in the GOP primary by tea party favorite Marco Rubio, which led Crist to change his  affiliation to Independent. He still lost that election. Now he\u2019s trying again for the post he once held. If he wins his primary against state Sen. Nan Rich, he\u2019ll face Republican incumbent Rick Scott, whose tenure has been tenuous. A recent Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 and AM 820 News poll in the vote-rich Tampa Bay area found that 44% of respondents said Scott is doing a \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d job. The non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report rates this race as a tossup and likely to be extremely expensive. A competitive statewide fight will be very closely noted by 2016 White House contenders \u2013 who may include Rubio \u2013 to detect campaign and voter trends in what\u2019s been a presidential battleground in the past. Wisconsin Republican incumbent Scott Walker is running for re-election \u2013 again. This will be his third election in four years. He was forced into a recall election in 2012 after Democrats successfully forced a vote in response to severe cuts in state pensions as a budget-cutting measure. Walker won his recall bid with 53% of the vote, 1% more than his 2010 election. While Cook rates this race as a likely win for Walker, Democrats are rallying behind Mary Burke, a member of the Madison school board and former Trek bike executive. This race is also notable because Walker could be making a play for a possible 2016 presidential run. Illinois Democrats don\u2019t hold that many gubernatorial seats, so keeping this one in Democratic hands is critical. It is a reliably Democratic state and home to the President, so a loss would be especially difficult for a party that has lost ground in state legislatures in recent years. Whether they like it or not, Democrats have incumbent Pat Quinn as their candidate. The race is considered a tossup by Cook even though Republicans don\u2019t yet have a strong candidate. Quinn has angered and pleased Democrats in the past month alone. He signed a bill that cut state pensions, angering unions, and approved a measure legalizing same-sex marriage, pleasing social liberals. The Chicago Tribune wrote that his actions could benefit him politically. If so, that\u2019s a stark shift from the just a couple months earlier when he tangled with the Democratic-controlled state Legislature. The Rothenberg Political Report wrote during Quinn\u2019s tumultuous fall, \u201cDemocrats\u2019 saving grace could be the ineptness of the state Republican Party.\u201d 5 Senate races to watch in 2014",

            "article_content": "House GOP will elect Boehner speaker on Thursday Boehner isn't facing a leadership challenge Conservatives worry about Boehner's priorities Nearly four years into his speakership, John Boehner is stronger than ever. Boehner will be elected to his third term as speaker on Thursday, a few days before his 66th birthday. He\u2019s already facing post-election grumbling from conservatives, but his position is remarkably secure for a speaker whose tenure has been marked by the drama of the debt ceiling standoff, the government shutdown and the battles within the GOP. The Ohio Republican will soon preside over the largest House GOP majority since World War II and have a new partner in the Senate when Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, becomes majority leader. Boehner, McConnell set new GOP agenda Boehner will still confront plenty of challenges as he shifts from being the face of the opposition party in Congress to a leader aiming to prove Republicans can govern ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Read: Top Republicans slam China climate agreement Conservatives say they are worried that Boehner and McConnell may put too much emphasis on proving they can make a dysfunctional Congress work without focusing enough on laying out an agenda that sets up a clear contrast with Democrats. Kansas GOP Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a frequent Boehner critic from the right, told CNN that the midterm elections were a mandate for change and \u201cchange wasn\u2019t compromise with the president.\u201d He said \u201cwhat won the election in 2014 was bold conservative principles and solutions.\u201d Obama adviser responds to Boehner Huelskamp said he agrees with Boehner\u2019s pledge to again pass a series of GOP economic measures next year that the Democratic-led Senate ignored. But he insisted that the GOP base also wants to see a Republican Congress take measures backed by social conservatives, and he cited \u201ctraditional marriage and pro-life bills.\u201d Boehner and McConnell, meanwhile, have largely stayed away from talking about social issues. Read: Pelosi: No GOP wave \u201cIf they define success as passing bills that the president signs, that is setting themselves up for failure over the next year,\u201d said Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action, a conservative group that has clashed with Boehner in the past. Holler said the list of economic items that the two Republican leaders listed in their op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal last week was on target, but viewed by conservatives as just \u201ca good start.\u201d The expanded GOP majority will give the speaker a bit of a cushion so he can push back against the band of House conservatives who thwarted his legislative strategy and pushed the House to shut down the government last fall. Over the last four years, the speaker has reminded his own members who wanted bolder action that he faced limits on what he could do because he only controlled \u201cone half of one third of the government.\u201d \u201cMost of us were tired of hearing \u2018this is all Harry Reid will agree to\u2019 - that\u2019s so 2014,\u201d Huelskamp said, referring to the current Senate majority leader. Working with the next Congress Other Boehner critics already plan to vote against him serving another term. A small group of GOP candidates who were elected last Tuesday night campaigned on the pledge they would oppose Boehner remaining speaker. But the movement isn\u2019t big enough or sufficiently organized to cause any serious trouble. Read: What to expect from the lame-duck Congress There is an effort, backed by Boehner allies, to get those who oppose him to do so behind closed doors on Thursday. This would avoid the embarrassment he endured in 2013 when live C-Span cameras showed a dozen House Republicans voting for someone else or skipping the vote on the House floor when Boehner began his second term. Huelskamp is one of those who publicly opposed Boehner two years ago.  Boehner stripped him of his seat on the Budget committee after a series of splits with GOP leaders in 2012.  Huelskamp told CNN \u201cthe speaker and I have our disagreements\u201d but that he planned to vote for him this time.  He said he spoke with the speaker recently, but declined to describe the \u201cprivate discussion.\u201d The problem for those in the anti-Boehner crowd is they don\u2019t have an alternative candidate. Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, who is popular among many conservatives and considered a leadership bid, decided he wanted to remain in his current post as the chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. It is true that some of the new House Republicans are just as conservative \u2013 if not more so \u2013 than the members they replaced. But several House Republicans and leadership aides all say that numerically \u201cit\u2019s a wash\u201d in terms of how big of a group of rabble rousers Boehner can expect to deal with in the next Congress. Many of those in the right wing of the GOP conference who split with Boehner were fueled by support and encouragement from outside groups.  But these groups lost a lot of their clout and credibility after the spending confrontation they demanded led to the shutdown, which Boehner warned would damage the GOP\u2019s message After the surprise defeat of Boehner\u2019s former number two - Eric Cantor - who many viewed as his only possible successor, Boehner has worked to solidify his power. Boehner spent most of the summer and fall months traversing the country campaigning for Republican candidates and collecting political chits.  He visited 175 cities and remained the top House GOP fundraiser - - bringing in a whopping $102 million for GOP candidates from his various political committees. Obama strikes climate deal; GOP reacts Boehner is \u201cin a strong position to persuade,\u201d Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole told CNN. As a 24 year veteran of the House who once served as the Chair of the House Education Committee, Boehner is an institutionalist. He and McConnell are both masters of the behind the scenes legislative maneuvering that is little noticed by the public, but can lead to important deals. It\u2019s still unclear how willing Boehner will be to give any major concessions and work with the president and Democrats to pass items like new infrastructure programs and new trade authority. There\u2019s a sense that corralling what can sometimes be a rambunctious House GOP conference is a job that no one else besides Boehner is prepared to take on at this point \u2013 or even wants. When Republicans gather this week, Boehner is likely to walk a fine line between telling his members what they want to hear about pushing conservative legislation next year, while starting to set some expectations.  Those who have split with the speaker say their disagreements have never been personal, and he\u2019s earned genuine respect.  Many enjoy it when he leads the infamous \u201cBoehner birthday song,\u201d a fun, very short ditty members use to mark birthdays and now share on Twitter. \u201cWho else has a birthday song that everyone sings? He\u2019s clearly endeared and ingrained himself in a way that\u2019s quite unprecedented,\u201d Cole told CNN.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton isn't saying whether she'll run for president But behind the scenes, Clinton associates are beginning to put together a campaign Hillary Clinton has spent the final moments of the midterm campaign season publicly deflecting the flurry of questions about her likely run for president. But behind the scenes, her campaign machine is quietly whirring to life. Clinton insiders have begun to approach Washington-based Democratic operatives who may play a role in a potential campaign and are soliciting their recommendations on other possible staffers, according to Democrats familiar with the conversations. A number Clinton associates are compiling staffing lists, according to multiple Democratic sources. Michael Whouley and Minyon Moore of the Democratic communications and consulting firm Dewey Square Group are one conduit to Clinton\u2019s inner circle and among the primary compilers of the campaign universe that will surround Clinton, should she run. The firm is led by veteran players in Clinton world. Whouley was an adviser to Vice President Al Gore and a Clinton campaign aide while Moore is a longtime Clinton confidante. Ginny Terzano, head of communications for Dewey Square, said the characterization is \u201cincorrect.\u201d \u201cDSG officials have no role\u201d in a potential Clinton campaign, she said. Operatives at the firm are reviewing possible Clinton staffers \u201cunder the guise of spitballing ideas,\u201d as one Democratic source put it. With a trio of pro-Hillary superPACs \u2013 Ready for Hillary, Priorities USA Action and Correct the Record \u2013 months into shoring up support, a Clinton campaign is already well underway outside of her inner circle. Clinton\u2019s midterm campaign schedule \u201cThe reality is that if you have a message and you\u2019re larger than life, the organization can come together pretty quickly,\u201d said Tom McMahon, who served as deputy campaign director for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign. \u201cIt can be a turnkey operation.\u201d As the Clinton campaign apparatus is constructed, those close to her are trying to shroud it from view, wary of the glaring political spotlight that amplifies every move the former secretary of state makes. \u201cThere are no formal talks, no one is being offered jobs,\u201d one source told CNN, dismissing the signs of campaign life as \u201ca lot of jockeying\u201d from Democrats who want to work on a Clinton campaign. In September, Clinton and her inner circle were dismayed by a leak to Politico that revealed the presence of John Podesta \u2013 former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, current top aide to President Barack Obama and the person favored to serve as chairman of a Hillary Clinton campaign \u2013 at meetings with pro-Clinton super PACs this summer. Huma Abedin, one of Clinton\u2019s closest aides, has told multiple Democrats to rein in chatter about 2016, saying Clinton wants to keep attention on the midterm elections and minimize attention on a presidential run, according to a Democratic source who spoke to Abedin. Clinton and the small team she employs are trying to keep her out of the tarnishing political spotlight until she is ready to make a run official, something Clinton will likely do by the end of winter, though she would like to put it off as late as possible. \u201cIf there\u2019s not a competitive primary, the general election starts as soon as she declares,\u201d said Katie Packer Gage, former deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential run, who says the challenge of a Clinton campaign will be more of what her current team is already struggling with \u2013 \u201dhow do they keep her fresh for the American people?\u201d Recent campaigns for viable Democratic or Republican presidential candidates were well into the preliminary phase of staffing up at this point in time, with top aides already getting in line ahead of an official announcement. In 2012, Matt Rhoades, at the time the executive director of Mitt Romney\u2019s Political Action Committee and later Romney\u2019s campaign manager, was already in early discussions with all of those who would become senior staff. Well before the 2006 midterms, then-Sen. Barack Obama had conducted preliminary discussions with and identified a number of top aides. His campaign effectively went into high gear after the elections, though he launched his exploratory committee in January 2007 and declared his candidacy in February. But some political operatives warn not to read too much into the beginning phase of a Clinton campaign currently underway. \u201cOf course the preliminary conversations should be going on,\u201d said Steve Elmendorf, Deputy Campaign Manager for John Kerry\u2019s 2004 campaign. \u201cBut there are a lot of people who have had those conversations - who thought about running for office, made plans to run for office, and didn\u2019t.\u201d Among those believed to be part of a potential Clinton campaign, Guy Cecil, the current executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, appears to be one of Clinton\u2019s most likely choices for campaign manager, according to interviews with more than two dozen Democrats. \u201cEven if Democrats don\u2019t hang onto the Senate, people respect the job that he\u2019s done,\u201d said one. Cecil\u2019s role is expected to fall under the oversight of Podesta, seen as a calming force who could squash much of the internal drama that plagued Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign. Podesta is expected to stay at the White House through the State of the Union, according to two sources familiar with his current plans, despite his initial commitment of one year service when Obama named him to his post in the West Wing last December. By last Spring, Robby Mook, who managed the campaign that propelled Clinton fundraising guru, Terry McAuliffe, into the Virginia governor\u2019s mansion, has \u201cbeen on ice\u201d - as one Democrat put it - since as early as the spring, according to two Democrats familiar with the discussion. He was told not to make long term plans by those close to Clinton, the sources say, and is widely expected to play a major role in running the campaign. Dennis Cheng, who manages fundraising for the Clinton Foundation and served as Hillary Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of protocol at the State Department, is the frontrunner for finance director, according to multiple Democrats. Huma Abedin, as well as longtime Clinton aide Philippe Reines and Nick Merrill, Clinton\u2019s current spokesperson, are expected to serve in influential roles in and around the campaign.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton, who regularly pitches female voters, got personal in her plea on Tuesday. The personal remarks resembled a message Clinton could use should she run for president. \"You have the same right to the American dream that I did,\" Clinton said Americans should be able to tell children This was Clinton's second trip to Colorado in a week. Hillary Clinton used her Tuesday appearance in Colorado, where experts see the female vote deciding a number of statewide races, to court women with a personal message about her life and her hopes for the future. Clinton usually targets women voters in her appearances. But in Colorado, the former secretary of state and likely presidential candidate in 2016, spoke about how fortunate she felt to be born in America and the message she hopes to be able to leave with children. The personal remarks, while focused on turning out voters for Democrats Mark Udall, John Hickenlooper and Andrew Romanoff, sounds a great deal like a presidential candidate and resembled a message Clinton could use should she run for president. \u201cI have had a great set of experiences. I have been very fortunate in my life, but the most fortunate thing besides the parents to whom I was born, is that I was born in America,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI, from the moment of my birth, was blessed because of that. And I grew up believing with all my heart that if I worked hard, if I did was I was supposed to do, go to school, get an education, that I would have opportunities that were never available to my mother.\u201d Clinton added, \u201cIndeed that came true for me. I don\u2019t want that ever to be lost. I want everyone in this room to be able to look at any baby, any child and truthfully say, \u2018You have the same right to the American dream that I did.\u2019\u201d Pro-Clinton group adds $2 million to its war chest When are political scandals not 'news'? Clinton: Is that a marijuana plant? Clinton's 2014 campaign kickoff This was Clinton\u2019s second trip to Colorado in a week. She spent a few hours with Udall last week at a private fundraiser and at a local coffee shop and market to meet voters. Udall is in a tight race with Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, who some polls have slightly ahead. \u201cThe only poll that counts is that poll on election day,\u201d Udall said, warming up the crowd for Clinton by using a tried-and-true campaign cliche. Democrats in the state and nationally see Clinton as someone who can turn out women in Colorado, a key demographic that some experts see the election turning on. \u201cThis election is important to everybody, but it is especially important to the women of Colorado,\u201d Clinton said, touching upon a woman\u2019s right to choose, personhood laws and availability of birth control - all topics the race between Udall and Gardner have focused on. \u201cWomen\u2019s rights here at home and around the world are clearly at risk,\u201d Clinton said, arguing those rights \u201care like the canaries in the mine.\u201d Is Hillary Clinton ready for marijuana\u2019s 2016 push? Although Clinton was there to endorse Democrats and increase excitement, her presidential aspirations weren\u2019t far from the minds of many. Before Clinton went on, Romanoff tried to pep up the crowd by asking, \u201cAre you ready to hear from the next president of the United States?\u201d Even Udall got into the hinting at 2016 action when he said, \u201cI think we hope she [Hillary Clinton] is going to come back over the next few years.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rand Paul wants to alter criminal sentencing rules that adversely affect minorities His National Urban League speech is part of his stepped-up outreach effort New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has sounded similar themes Sen. Rand Paul is proposing legislation aimed at eliminating criminal sentencing rules that adversely impact minorities, saying that \u201cwe need some fresh ideas to combat old and festering problems.\u201d The Republican from Kentucky described the measure Friday in a speech to the National Urban League. It\u2019s part of his aggressive outreach effort to African-Americans and other voting groups who don\u2019t traditionally back Republicans. Paul is trying to expand the GOP base and lay the groundwork for a potential 2016 campaign for the White House. Perry Vs. Paul: America the Isolationist? Paul works to help non-violent offenders Sen. Paul:  A civil war in Iraq Inside Politics: Rand Rising His address highlighted sentencing reform, expanded voting rights, and education reform. It came one day after two other possible Republican presidential hopefuls, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, also touted similar reforms. Sentencing reform is one of Paul\u2019s signature issues. As he\u2019s done in previous speeches, he told the audience gathered in Cincinnati that the nation\u2019s criminal justice system is still stacked against minorities. \u201cThree out of four people in prison right now for non-violent crimes are black or brown. Our prisons are bursting with young men of color and our communities are full of broken families,\u201d Paul said. Rand Paul fights for felon voting rights \u201cThere is a cycle of poverty that often leads to drugs, to debt, and to prison. In prison, child support can accumulate into the thousands of dollars. Release from prison then finds that employers don\u2019t want to hire a convicted felon. \u201cWith few options of real work, the cycle begins again. I say enough\u2019s enough. I won\u2019t sit idly by and watch our criminal justice system continue to consume, confine and define our young men. I say we take a stand and fight for justice now,\u201d Paul said. He then pointed out that the current legal distinctions between crack and powder cocaine have led to longer jail terms for the possession of crack. While he said that progress has been made in reducing those distinctions, Paul added that he was introducing legislation on Friday that \u201celiminates any disparity between crack and powder cocaine.\u201d Paul also touted that he\u2019s working with Democrats, like Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, on a bill that would expunge records, under certain circumstances, of non-violent and youth related crimes. And, he\u2019s rubbing shoulders with Attorney General Eric Holder on sentencing reform as well as some Republican governors. Rand Paul and his Democratic buds Paul\u2019s other pitches Paul also used his address in front of the National Urban League convention to make another pitch for expanding the voting rights of ex-cons. \u201cNationwide, five million people are prevented from voting because of their criminal record. It\u2019s the biggest impediment to voting in our country. I want more people to vote, not less,\u201d Paul said. He described himself as \u201ca Republican who wants to restore a federal role for the government in the Voting Rights Act.\u201d Paul twice quoted from Martin Luther King Jr. in his speech to the century-old civil rights organization. And Paul again mentioned King as he continued his crusade against the federal government\u2019s current surveillance activities. \u201cDr. King\u2019s \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019 speech inspired the world but it also prompted the FBI to tap his phone illegally and spy on tens of thousands of Americans. Today, all Americans should be concerned that the government is collecting the records of Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly I think what Americans do on their cell phone is none of the government\u2019s damn business.\u201d On education reform Paul attacked the status quo and proposed shifting the power away from government. \u201cWashington has no clue how to fix education. Washington doesn\u2019t know if whether you\u2019re a good teacher or a bad teacher. We should allow innovation to occur at the local level. I propose that we allow school charters, school choice, vouchers, competition. Competition breeds excellence,\u201d Paul said. And Paul also touted a plan to increase investment and job creation by moving control of some tax monies away from Washington and into state and local hands. \u201cI have a 10-year plan for areas of high unemployment and poverty, to lower taxes and promote employment,\u201d Paul said. Rand Paul: Will his star continue to rise? Christie and Ryan also make pitches Some of Paul\u2019s language sounds similar to what Christie is saying. Thursday night, he and the chairman of the Republican Governor\u2019s Association once again said that there\u2019s far too many people sitting in prisons for non-violent drug crimes and called on Republicans to focus on people not just before they\u2019re born but after as well. \u201cI\u2019m pro-life and if you\u2019re pro-life, you have to be pro-life when they get out of the womb also,\u201d Christie said in an appearance at the Aspen Institute in Colorado, repeating comments he made last month at a major social conservative gathering. Gov. Christie: \u2018You have to be pro-life when they get out of the womb\u2019 Christie said the justice system must stop stigmatizing the disease of drug addiction and focus more on rehabilitation. \u201cWe don\u2019t give them any kind of significant treatment, long-range treatment, and then we release them. And then we wonder why they go back and commit more crimes to support their habit,\u201d Christie said. The potential 2016 presidential candidate also said giving drug addicts treatment instead of prison time would help the economy too. Earlier Thursday, Ryan, spelled out his plan to fight poverty, a pilot program that would combine 11 federal programs into one pool of money for participating states. Paul Ryan lays out new poverty plan According to the plan, which the Wisconsin Republican detailed in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute, states would voluntarily submit their own anti-poverty proposals in order to get money. \u201cIf everything passed muster, the federal government would give the green light,\u201d the House Budget Committee chairman said in a speech to the Washington-based think tank. \u201cAnd the state would get more flexibility. It would get to combine into one funding stream 11 different programs, things like food stamps, housing assistance, child care, and cash welfare.\u201d The GOP, under the direction of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, last year released a report that acknowledged the party\u2019s problem in reaching out to younger and minority voters, who overwhelming went for President Barack Obama and the Democrats in the 2012 election. The report included hundreds of recommendations for the party.",

Cochran adviser: \"This is very much a tragic and sad situation\" Mississippi Tea Party laments loss of \"cheerleader\" with \"a patriot's soul\" Mayfield was charged in a picture-taking incident involving senator's wife A tea party leader tied to alleged political dirty tricks that rattled Republicans in Mississippi and beyond is dead \u2013 shot once in the head in an apparent suicide, according to police. Police officers in Ridgeland, Mississippi, found Mark Mayfield\u2019s body shortly after 9 a.m. Friday on the floor of a storage room in his garage. \u201cBecause all of the indications, it appears to be suicide, but we still got some things to look into,\u201d Ridgeland police Chief Jimmy Houston told CNN. \u201cHe left a suicide note, and we are verifying its validity.\u201d Authorities haven\u2019t disclosed the contents of that note or why Mayfield might have taken his life. Tea Party leader in election scandal dies McDaniel: Miss. election not fair Scandal hits Mississippi primary Yet the lawyer and Mississippi Tea Party leader has been under fire for the past month, having been charged with three others \u2013 according to The Clarion-Ledger newspaper \u2013 in connection to a blogger accused of taking a picture of Sen. Thad Cochran\u2019s wife in her nursing home bed. This came a week after the blogger, Clayton Kelly, was himself charged. All were apparent allies of conservative state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who was then engaged in an ugly primary battle to see who would be the GOP Senate candidate from Mississippi. The photo of Cochran\u2019s wife \u2013 who suffers from dementia and has lived in a nursing home for 14 years \u2013 surfaced in a political attack ad on YouTube that aimed to smear Cochran, The Clarion-Ledger reported. It\u2019s unclear how the photo was used because the ad was removed within hours of being posted, according to the newspaper. This episode and others further inflamed the rhetoric in the primary fight. Cochran\u2019s spokesman Jordan Russell, for example, said last month that Mayfield and the others\u2019 arrests \u201craises even more questions the McDaniel campaign needs to answer.\u201d But on Friday, Cochran \u2013 who narrowly edged McDaniel in Tuesday\u2019s primary \u2013 and his team showed only sympathy upon hearing about Mayfield\u2019s death. \u201cThis is very much a tragic and sad situation,\u201d said Austin Barbour, a senior adviser to Cochran\u2019s campaign. \u201cMark was a really good guy. On behalf of Sen. Cochran and all of us for the campaign, our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and his friends.\u201d Report: Mayfield faced conspiracy charges Mark Mayfield leaves behind his wife and two children. He also leaves a legacy in Mississippi in other ways, as a lawyer and a political leader. The Mississippi Tea Party remembered him as one of its founding members \u201cand one of our biggest cheerleaders.\u201d \u201cHe had a patriot\u2019s soul, and a smile that was as big as day,\u201d the group said on its website. Outside Mississippi, Mayfield became part of a bigger national story one week after authorities arrested political blogger Clayton Kelly  for allegedly exploiting a vulnerable adult and illegally and improperly obtaining a photo of her without her consent for his own benefit, according to the Madison, Mississippi, Police Department. Blogger\u2019s arrest shakes up Mississippi GOP primary Mayfield was later arrested along with Richard Sager, an elementary school P.E. teacher and high school coach, according to The Clarion-Ledger newspaper. Police also charged a third individual, John Beachman Mary, but did not take him into custody because of \u201cextensive medical conditions.\u201d All three face conspiracy charges, the newspaper reported. Mayfield\u2019s death came two days after the runoff to decide his state\u2019s GOP Senate nominee \u2013 an election necessitated since neither Cochran nor McDaniel cracked 50% in the June 3 primary. Cochran won the latest contest by fewer than 7,000 votes, aided by African-American Democrats who were actively courted during the runoff campaign by pro-Cochran forces. According to Mississippi law, voters are not required to register with a political party, and anyone who doesn\u2019t vote in a primary election can cast a ballot in either party\u2019s runoff. McDaniel repeated his vow to use every legal maneuver available to fight the runoff results. Lawyer, friend: \u2018My heart is completely broken\u2019 Still, while that political fight continues, the focus Thursday was on Mayfield and his family. His wife Robin was the only other person at the family\u2019s Ridgeland residence at the time, and also the one who alerted authorities. The 57-year-old Mayfield was found dead of a lone gunshot wound, alongside a large caliber revolver. Mayfield\u2019s attorney, Merrida Coxwell, said in a statement e-mailed to CNN that he was a client \u201cbut more importantly, he was a friend for almost 34 years. \u201cMy heart is completely broken. This is beyond tragic and the people of this community and state have lost a good man and citizen.\u201d In a phone call with CNN, Coxwell added, \u201cIt\u2019s not important to me how it happened. It happened today. Mark\u2019s wife called and texted me that Mark was deceased.\u201d And McDaniel posted a statement on his Facebook page saying that, \u201cregardless of recent allegations made against his character, Mark Mayfield was a fine Christian man who was always respectful and kind.\u201d \u201cHe was one of the most polite and humble men I\u2019ve ever met in politics,\u201d the state senator added. \u201cHe was a loving husband, father, a pillar of his community, and he will be missed.\u201d McDaniel says irregularities found Who is Thad Cochran?

            "article_content": "GOP Sen. Thad Cochran hopes African-American Democrats can help him keep his seat Cochran is in bitter runoff battle with tea party-backed challenger Chris McDaniel McDaniel says Cochran's long tenure in Washington makes him part of status quo Cochran is banking on that tenure, and the benefits it provides back home Lifelong Democrat Jackie Bland is doing something she never thought she\u2019d do: Urge people to vote for a Republican. Bland supports Thad Cochran, a six-term Mississippi senator who\u2019s trying to fend off a fierce tea party challenge to his seat from Chris McDaniel as voting got underway in Tuesday\u2019s primary runoff. Two weeks ago, Bland helped put up 5,000 pro-Cochran posters in black communities and talk to people about his record. \u201cWe wanted to raise the awareness to African-Americans that we do have a stake in this runoff election,\u201d she said. She pointed to Cochran\u2019s efforts to secure federal funds for jobs, Head Start programs and health centers relied upon by African-Americans in the state. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to move backwards,\u201d she said. Bland\u2019s efforts reflect the high stakes locally and nationally in the Cochran-McDaniel showdown and also illustrate the unscripted political realities of particular states that play out on Election Day. In this case, it\u2019s apparent that Cochran needs Democrats to keep his job, and some Democrats heed the fact that Democratic Senate nominee Travis Childers likely won\u2019t win in November, so they turn out for a Republican. In Mississippi, neither candidate secured 50% of the vote in the GOP primary this month, requiring a runoff election. And both sides over the past few weeks have relentlessly pursued get-out-the-vote efforts. Unheralded candidate believes he played spoiler in Cochran race Mississippi law allows anyone to vote in the runoff, meaning Democrats can go to the polls so long as they didn\u2019t vote in the Democratic primary and they don\u2019t plan to support their party candidate in the general election. The question is whether Cochran can shore up enough support to beat back the tea party wave against him. McDaniel got about 1,400 more votes than Cochran in the primary, and national conservative groups have actively rallied around the challenger. Mississippi primary spending spree pushes advertisers off the air Cochran is pushing his message that his experience makes him more influential in Congress, and his ties on Capitol Hill will better serve Mississippi if he\u2019s reelected. McDaniel and allies, however, say Cochran has been in office long enough, and his tenure only breathes more life to the status quo. For his part, McDaniel vows to bring change to the nation\u2019s capital and shake things up on Capitol Hill. \u201cThe people of this country are finally waking up again and recognizing that Washington\u2019s been broken for a long time,\u201d McDaniel said Monday, referring to tea party victories in recent years. \u201cAll the sudden you see a great awakening among all the people, particularly those who are very dissatisfied with the direction our country is going.\u201d Courting the African-American vote Mississippi Conservatives, a super PAC founded by former Gov. Haley Barbour and his nephew, Henry, has taken the lead in courting votes from Democrats, especially in the African-American community. Cochran\u2019s allies are arguing the case that he has long been there for the voting bloc and would better represent their interests than McDaniel. The issue is so complicated that even Bland can hardly stomach what she\u2019s doing. She attended an event Monday featuring Republican Sen. John McCain, who called on voters to keep Cochran in Washington but also spent much of his speech blasting President Barack Obama. Bland, a supporter of the President, got up and left. Senate candidate on contentious primary Attack ads, scandals rock GOP primary Scandal hits Mississippi primary Cochran acknowledged Monday he would likely benefit if a wide range of voters turn out for the runoff. \u201cI\u2019ve always reached out and benefited from support from the black community,\u201d he said. \u201cMy responsibility as a United States senator has been to represent the people of the state of Mississippi, not just one party or one race or a select group of friends.\u201d But another Mississippi political veteran labeled the vote courting a risky move. \u201cIt might get him some votes, but it might lose him some votes,\u201d said former Republican Sen. Trent Lott. The ex-Senate majority leader not only served with Cochran for many years, but the two were competitors for the leadership position in 1996. Lott now describes Cochran as \u201ca good friend\u201d and said he\u2019s \u201cvery nervous\u201d about the runoff.  It will be \u201cdifficult for Thad to overcome the momentum\u201d by McDaniel, he predicted. Vote underway Conservative groups are working with Christian Adams, a former Justice Department official, to train volunteers to monitor poll workers and make sure they check to see whether Democrats have already voted in their primary. Some critics question whether the effort might lead to voter intimidation. The Mississippi NAACP dispatched about 250 volunteers to watch poll stations and look for any signs of interference. They\u2019re supposed to call the state office if anyone is turned away, but enforcing the crossover primary rule may be hard to enforce. Wayne McDaniels, president the NAACP\u2019s Jackson City Branch, said the biggest concern is polling stations in rural areas. \u201cThere won\u2019t be much coverage as far as the news media out there, so those are the pockets where someone might figure they can get away with certain things,\u201d he said. McDaniels said the state office hadn\u2019t yet receive any calls or suspicious reports from any of the volunteers in the field. CNN saw three people turned away by poll workers in Jackson because they voted in the Democratic primary. Monitoring crossover voters Adams is overseeing the \u201celection integrity project\u201d for the conservative groups FreedomWorks, Tea Party Patriots and Senate Conservatives Fund, said Monday in a phone interview that volunteers won\u2019t be instructed to talk to voters or poll workers, but only monitor the process at polling stations across the state. \u201cThese are not negotiators,\u201d he told CNN, stressing that they\u2019re \u201cnot activists urging people\u201d to vote one way or the other. He said the volunteers will \u201cobserve what\u2019s going on and how to memorialize the events of the day in an observer report,\u201d which will be reviewed by lawyers. But he refused to elaborate on who the lawyers are and who they work for. He also declined to be more specific about where exactly the volunteers would be working, saying only that they will be stationed at polling locations \u201cacross the state.\u201d  Pressed on why he was providing few details about an effort that seeks transparency and honesty in an election process, Adams didn\u2019t give an answer. McDaniel, who chairs the elections committee in the state Senate, said Monday he approves of the monitoring effort and doubts intimidation will become an issue. \u201cThe issue is to make sure we have a fair process,\u201d he said. He argued that a high Democratic turnout for Cochran would reveal the senator\u2019s true colors. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about them being African-American. I\u2019m concerned about them being liberal,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s always been my concern. If Senator Cochran is going to court liberal Democrats to save his seat, that\u2019s a good indication that he\u2019s abandoned conservatism in Mississippi.\u201d Learning from last time Since Cochran failed to defeat McDaniel in the primary, the senator and his campaign have been more aggressive about their ground game. Sources familiar with Cochran\u2019s campaign strategy say they hope that a lot of Republicans who stayed home during the primary, thinking Cochran would be fine, will show up at the polls. The senator has had a more active schedule for the runoff and his overall operation is more finely tuned. On Monday, he campaigned with McCain, who reiterated the pitch that an experienced senator is more beneficial for a state. McDaniel doubled down on his attack line against Cochran, saying his partnership with McCain further proves how out of touch the senator is with conservatives. Former Sen. Lott has also helped out Cochran by cutting an ad for his former colleague. He said he didn\u2019t do much for Cochran in the  primary because \u201cI think they didn\u2019t think they needed me.\u201d But the runoff\u2019s been different. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also pitched in for Cochran and produced an ad featuring retired NFL star Brett Favre, a Mississippi native. But Cochran isn\u2019t the only one with a celebrity endorsement. Longtime game show host Chuck Woolery headlined a bus tour organized by the Tea Party Express. While Cochran has tried to make the case that his near-four decades in the Senate brings wisdom and power, he\u2019s fighting an uphill battle against a younger politician and former talk radio host who paints himself as the candidate more principled and eager to help lead a conservative movement in the Senate. Jeremiah Boddy, 20, a student at the University of Southern Mississippi and a McDaniel supporter, showed up to a Cochran event Monday. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s the same rhetoric, just washed and put in different clothes,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI mean he has no charisma, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, he couldn\u2019t sell you a brand new car, even if it was free.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kristin Wilson, Leigh Ann Caldwell, and John Bena contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Clinton starts the book with the end of her bruising 2008 campaign against Obama Clinton wanted to arm Syrian rebels, but lost that argument with the President She called the killing of Osama bin Laden her proudest moment at State Department Her thoughts on a 2016 presidential run? 'I haven't decided yet' Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cHard Choices\u201d \u2013 a memoir where the former secretary of state writes about her 2008 loss to President Barack Obama, her reaction to the terrorist attacks in Benghazi and her overarching vision of foreign policy decisions as America\u2019s top diplomat \u2013 is largely a safe retelling of Clinton\u2019s tenure. Clinton casts most diplomatic decisions as a problem with tradeoffs that require people to make hard choices. The Afghanistan surge, how Pakistan deals with terrorism and Benghazi are all hard choices, Clinton writes. But the fact that the book is safe and lacks any shocking details is possibly the most telling aspect of the book. A careful book that isn\u2019t looking to make waves is usually penned by someone with future plans and ambition, not someone with no more skin in the game. The book is seen as an important moment for Clinton, the current favorite to win the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination should she run. Critics have charged that her time as America\u2019s top diplomat was marked by a lack of a crowning achievement, while Clinton confidants have looked to frame those years as a success and see the book as the most potent way to do that. Has Clinton gone 'Mean Girls' on Obama? Clinton makes revelations about Obama Clinton tougher than Obama? While it lacks bombshells, \u201cHard Choices\u201d is chock full of interesting tidbits about the Clinton State Department. A handful of CNN writers and producers read the book and here are some of the most interesting passages. From campaign to cabinet Clinton starts the book by detailing how she and Obama \u2013 as well as their staffs \u2013 got over the bruising 2008 campaign. They first met, Clinton writes, at Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s house, a mutual friend. Clinton writes that she had to lay down in the back of a \u201cblue minivan\u201d to avoid the media on the way to the meeting. \u201cWe stared at each other like two teenagers on an awkward first date, taking a few sips of Chardonnay,\u201d she writes about the hour-and-a-half meeting. \u201cFinally Barack broke the ice by ribbing me a bit about the tough campaign I had run against him.\u201d Although Clinton describes the meeting as to-the-point and cordial, the former first lady also writes that one campaign charge stood in between them: The charge of racism against former President Bill Clinton. \u201cBarack made clear that neither he nor his team believed that accusation,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cThe candor of our conversation was reasserting and reinforced by my resolve to support him.\u201d Clinton would go on to back Obama\u2019s candidacy and delivered a speech backing him a few days after their meeting. In reflecting on the loss, Clinton writes that she was \u201clucky to have lost to a candidate whose views dovetailed closely with my own.\u201d Though Obama tapped Clinton to lead State, some of her supporters were upset she was not asked to be his vice president. In the book, Clinton writes that she was \u201cnever interested in being Vice President\u201d and was \u201clooking forward to retiring to the Senate.\u201d Hillary Clinton, Pres. Obama & 2016 Clinton: Benghazi a mistake, but ... Chaffetz rejects Clinton Benghazi claims In her support of Obama, the President\u2019s campaign would regularly call on Clinton to issue statements and make appearances during his general election fight with Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Clinton writes that a \u201ccollective \u2018Who?\u2019 echoed across the nation\u201d when McCain named then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate. The Obama campaign asked Clinton to issue a \u201cdismissive statement,\u201d but the then-senator from New York writes that she declined. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I was not going to attack Palin just for being a woman appealing for support from other women,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it made political sense, and it didn\u2019t feel right. So I said \u2018no.\u2019\u201d In reflecting on saying \u2018yes\u2019 to serving in Obama\u2019s cabinet, Clinton said \u201cthe President fully lived up to his promises\u201d and in total she visited the White House more than 700 times during her four years in the job. And in her epilogue, Clinton writes that Obama asked her to stay on as Secretary of State in 2012. \u201cOne term, that\u2019s it,\u201d she says she told the president. Mending fences Clinton writes that there were a number of people who helped mend fences between the Obama and Clinton campaigns. Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s close adviser, and Obama\u2019s body man Reggie Love were the first connection between the campaigns, she writes. The former Secretary of State also notes that Vice President Joe Biden was a close friend during her years at State. \u201cHis warmth and humor would be very welcome during long hours in the White House Situation Room,\u201d she notes. \u201cEvery week, Joe and I tried to meet for a private breakfast at the Naval Observatory, his official residence, which is near my home. Always the gentleman, he would meet me at the car and walk me to a sunny nook off the porch, where we would eat and talk. Sometimes we agreed, sometimes we disagree, but I always appreciated our frank and confidential conversations.\u201d Hillary Clinton takes on the GOP Officials: Clinton wanted tougher deal Clinton: Bill didn't know about bin Laden Clinton describes President Obama\u2019s first Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel \u2013 someone she notes was known for his \u201cforceful personality and vivid language (that\u2019s putting it politely)\u201d \u2013 as integral to mending relations between her and Obama. \u201cDuring the hard-fought primary campaign, Rahm had stayed neutral because of his strong ties to both me and then-Senator Obama,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cNow that we were all serving together, Rahm would provide some of the initial glue holding this \u2018team of rivals\u2019 together.\u201d Clinton also writes about those who had fervently supported Obama in the primary, including Susan Rice, the former U.N. Ambassador and current National Security Advisor who has since become a lightning rod for GOP criticism. \u201cI knew it was part of her job, and we put the past behind us and worked together closely,\u201d Clinton writes. Taking over at State In a chapter about taking the reins in Foggy Bottom, Clinton writes that she was wary of revealing any daylight between her and Obama, particularly following the long and hard-fought primary between the two former rivals. \u201cI intended to be a vigorous advocate for my positions within the administration,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut as I knew from history and my own experience, the sign on Harry Truman\u2019s desk in the Oval Office was correct: the buck did stop with the President. And because of the long primary battle, I also knew the press would be looking \u2013 even hoping \u2013 for any signs of discord between me and the White House. I intended to deprive them of that story.\u201d On then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Clinton writes that she and Gates \u201cbecame allies from the start.\u201d \u201cHe was also a convincing advocate for giving diplomacy and development more resources and a bigger role in our foreign policy,\u201d Clinton writes. During the transition process, Clinton recounts dining with outgoing Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice to discuss policy hurdles and personnel in Foggy Bottom. Clinton also recounts her meetings with the seven other living secretaries of state: from Henry Kissinger to Madeleine Albright, and from George Shultz to Colin Powell. Clinton: Putin and I disagree, publicly Clinton and Putin's war of words Inside Politics: A new Cold War? The most practical advice came from Warren Christopher, who was the first to serve under her husband, Clinton writes. \u201cDon\u2019t plan vacations in August because something always seems to happen that month, such as Russia invading Georgia in 2008,\u201d Clinton writes. Kissinger shared his impressions of foreign leaders and Colin Powell offered \u201ccandid assessments of individuals and ideas\u201d Clinton was considering. But the \u201cbest gift of all\u201d came from Ronald Reagan\u2019s Secretary of State, George Shultz: \u201cA teddy bear that sang \u2018Don\u2019t Worry, Be Happy\u2019 when its paw was squeezed.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s wedding Clinton concludes her chapter on Asia with a section about Chelsea Clinton\u2019s wedding. She writes that she and a senior Chinese leader had bonded over discussing how their work was really focused on their children and their children\u2019s children. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re in it for,\u201d he said to her, she writes. \u201cI felt lucky that my day job had prepared me for the elaborate diplomacy required to help plan a big wedding,\u201d she wrote. Not surprisingly the \u201cwedding was one of the happiest and proudest moments of my life,\u201d Clinton notes. And in one of the more reflective points of the chapter, Clinton notes her family\u2019s sometimes public and difficult past when thinking about her daughter\u2019s wedding. \u201cSo many thoughts went through my head,\u201d Clinton writes about the wedding. \u201cOur family had been through a lot together, good times and hard times, and now here we were, celebrating the best of times.\u201d Kindred spirits in Myanmar Clinton writes extensively about her work in Myanmar, and particularly about her interactions with Aung Suu Kyi, the activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner whose work to open the country to democracy has made her an international symbol. \u201cThe first time I met Aung San Suu Kyi, on December 1, 2011, we were both wearing white. It seems like an auspicious coincidence,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cAfter so many years of reading and thinking about this celebrated Burmese dissident, we were finally face-to-face\u2026.I felt as if we had known each other for a lifetime, even though we had just met.\u201d Describing their conversation, Clinton said she shared \u201clessons from other pro-democracy movements around the world\u201d and \u201cshared some memories of my first run for office. She asked me many questions about the preparation and process of becoming a candidate.\u201d Suu Kyi would later visit the United States in September 2012 where she met with Clinton. Throughout the chapter, Clinton notes similarities she sees with Suu Kyi. \u201cAs we ate, Suu Kyi described the district she now represented in Parliament. As much as she was focused on the high drama of national politics, she was also obsessed with the minutiae of constituency service and solving problems,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cI remembered feeling exactly the same way when the voters of New York elected me to the U.S. Senate. If you can\u2019t get the potholes fixed, nothing else matters.\u201d Outside groups who are touting Clinton\u2019s State record have focused on Myanmar as a success story for Clinton. An unlikely photo op Clinton describes, in a chapter about Asia, the events leading up to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s 2009 mission to North Korea to secure the release of two American journalists \u2013 Euna Lee and Laura Ling. She writes she was \u201csurprised\u201d to learn that former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il wanted the former President to personally make the trip and also describes some resistance inside the White House to sending President Clinton. \u201cSome may have harbored negative feelings toward Bill from the 2008 primary campaign, but most were simply reluctant to reward Kim\u2019s bad behavior with such a high-profile trip and potentially create concerns for our allies,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cThey had a good point.\u201d On the unusual photo-op taken by Clinton and Kim Jong-Ill, Clinton writes that her husband and his entourage were briefed not to express any emotion in any photographs. \u201cA humorous but important part of the preparation involved coaching them not to be smiling (or frowning) when the inevitable official photos with Kim were taken,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe official images released by the regime were appropriately stilted; no smiling by any of the Americans.\u201d The former President later joked \u201cthat he felt like he was auditioning for a James Bond movie.\u201d Gaza Clinton writes that her November 2012 trip to the Middle East was an \u201cemergency diplomatic mission\u201d to stop an outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas from escalating into all-out war. \u201cAfter four years of frustrating diplomacy in the Middle East,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthis would be a crucial test of America\u2019s leadership.\u201d With Hamas rockets raining on Israeli cities, even threatening Tel Aviv, the United States felt Israel had a right to defend itself. \u201cBut we also knew that a ground invasion could be catastrophic for all concerned,\u201d Clinton wrote about Israeli plans to call up reservists. President Obama was wary of the United States taking on a direct mediating role, Clinton notes, but ultimately agreed after several meetings with Clinton. She describes her role as negotiator in brokering a cease-fire in Gaza with the help of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, who as a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood had strong ties to Hamas. After Clinton helped secure a cease-fire, with Egypt\u2019s help, Clinton writes highly of her efforts, noting that \u201cone senior Israel official confided to me that his government had been 48 hours away from launching a ground invasion and that my diplomatic intervention was the only thing standing in the way of a much more explosive confrontation.\u201d Iraq regrets Clinton writes, with some candor, about her regret in voting for the 2002 Iraq War authorization. \u201cI thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.\u201d The issue was a key sticking point between Clinton and Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary, with many voters hammering Clinton for backing President George W. Bush\u2019s proposed war. \u201cI should have stated my regret sooner and in the plainest, most direct language possible,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cIn our political culture, saying you made a mistake is often taken as weakness when in fact it can be a sign of strength and growth for people and nations. That\u2019s another lesson I\u2019ve learned personally and experienced as Secretary of State.\u201d Losing on Syria In the book, Clinton describes the bloody three-year long civil war in Syria as \u201ca wicked problem.\u201d On whether to arm the Syrian rebels, a contentious issue, Clinton writes that \u201cI returned to Washington reasonably confident that if we decided to begin arming and training moderate Syrian rebels, we could put in place effective coordination with our regional partners.\u201d The United States, she wrote, did not want to send arms to the rebels that could wind up in the hands of extremists. But it was equally concerned about splitting the international coalition, where many nations were frustrated by the United States\u2019 cautious policy. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts were frustrated by Russia\u2019s efforts to block action at the United Nations Security Council. Clinton says there was no good policy action for the United States, and she highlights were she and Obama disagreed on the conflict. \u201c(T)he risks of both action and inaction were high. Both choices would bring unintended consequences. The President\u2019s inclination was to stay the present course and not take the significant further step of arming rebels. \u201cNo one likes to lose a debate, including me. But this was the President\u2019s call and I respected his deliberations and decision. From the beginning of our partnership, he had promised me that I would always get a fair hearing. And I always did. In this case, my position didn\u2019t prevail,\u201d Clinton writes. Although as Clinton backed Obama\u2019s Syria policy as Secretary of State \u2013 including negotiating with the international community on the civil war and criticizing countries like Russia and China, which stood in the way of toppling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u2013 Clinton\u2019s writings now show the level with which she split with Obama on arming the rebels. A tougher deal for Bergdahl When she was America\u2019s top diplomat, Hillary Clinton acknowledged that negotiating with the Taliban for Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s release \u201cwould be hard to swallow for many Americans.\u201d \u201cIn every discussion about prisoners, we demanded the release of Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who had been captured in 2009,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cThere would not be any agreement about prisoners without the sergeant coming home.\u201d She continues, \u201cI acknowledged, as I had many times before, that opening the door to negotiations with the Taliban would be hard to swallow for many Americans after so many years of war.\u201d Clinton\u2019s reflections on Bergdahl have become big news in light of the soldier\u2019s release from Taliban captivity in exchange for the United States releasing five terrorists. Clinton has offered a measured defense of the release in interviews and speeches, but her book shows how skeptical she was about the trade. In Clinton\u2019s chapter on Afghanistan, she writes extensively about the U.S. effort to forge peace among the Karzai government, the Taliban, and Pakistan. Clinton also touches on her insistence that the political progress made toward the benefit of Afghan women not be undermined moving forward. Terrorism and Osama bin Laden The search and eventual killing of Osama bin Laden is a story that Clinton regularly uses in speeches and interviews as a success story from her four years at State. And her book is no different. In a chapter about Pakistan \u2013 the country where bin Laden was found \u2013 Clinton writes at length about the search and the tensions that compounded after U.S. Navy SEALS entered the country to get the terrorist leader. \u201cI knew how offended they would be if we did not share this information with them,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cBut I also knew that elements in the Pakistani intelligence service, the ISI, maintained ties to the Taliban, al Qaeda, and other extremists. The risks of blowing the whole operation were just too great.\u201d Clinton has often heralded the raid that killed bid Laden as one of her proudest moments at State. She writes that she was an early and vocal supporter of the raid and watched with bated breath as the Navy SEALS entered his compound. And on drones, Clinton writes that every drone strike was subjected to \u201crigorous and legal policy review.\u201d She writes that she supported some proposed strikes but did oppose others, writing one time \u201cmy good friend Leon Panetta, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and I had a shouting match over one proposed strike.\u201d She did not provide details about the tiff. She says because the program was classified she could not talk publicly about it \u201cnor was I free to express America\u2019s sympathies for the loss of any innocent life or our course of action was the one least likely to harm civilians.\u201d All about the hair As Hillary Clinton has been touring the country giving paid speeches and preparing for the launch of her book, she is often found citing some of the suggested book titles offered up by Washington Post readers in a contest hosted by the newspaper last year when the publication of the book was announced. Clinton is fond of saying her favorite suggested title is \u201c112 Countries\u2026And It\u2019s Still All About My Hair.\u201d Apparently, that wasn\u2019t much of an exaggeration. In her book, Clinton depicts a scene in February 2012 of meeting the \u201cclearly nervous\u201d Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.  \u201cMadam Secretary, I was very worried when I saw television footage of you getting off the plane,\u201d Clinton quotes Borisov saying.  \u201cI was briefed by my chief of staff that when your hair is pulled back, it means you\u2019re in a bad mood,\u201d he continued according to Clinton\u2019s account. Clinton writes that she \u201clooked at the mostly bald Prime Minister, smiled, and said, \u2018It just takes me a little longer to do my hair than it takes you.\u2019\u201d The two laughed and went on to have a productive meeting, Clinton notes. Tough talk on Russia, Putin Clinton has made bashing Russia President Vladimir Putin a staple of her speaking tour. She compared his actions to Adolph Hitler earlier in the year and later compared his rule over Russia to that of late communist leaders. In her chapter on Russia, Clinton devotes a great deal of space to her relationship with Putin and the regression on relations with the country. \u201cHard men present hard choices \u2013 none more so than Vladimir Putin,\u201d the chapter\u2019s first sentence reads. \u201cPutin\u2019s worldview is shaped by his admiration for the powerful czars of Russian history, Russia\u2019s long-standing interest in controlling the nations on its borders, and his personal determination that his country never again appear weak or at the mercy of the West.\u201d She goes on to discuss Putin\u2019s ambitions of reducing the United States\u2019 role in Central and Eastern Europe and his efforts to \u201ccounter or at least mute\u201d U.S. efforts in Arab Spring countries \u2013 all in the chapter\u2019s first paragraph. Clinton writes that Putin proved to be \u201cthin-skinned and autocratic\u201d and that he grew to resent criticism and crack down on dissenting voices and the press. Clinton\u2019s final assessment of Putin\u2019s impact on his country? \u201cUnfortunately, as of now, Russia under Putin remains frozen between the past they can\u2019t let go of and the future they can\u2019t bring themselves to embrace,\u201d she writes. Cuba, Mexico and drugs At a 2009 press conference in Mexico, Clinton remarked that, \u201cthe U.S. recognizes that drug trafficking is not only Mexico\u2019s problem. It is also an American problem. And we in the U.S. have a responsibility to help you address it.\u201d Clinton writes that she anticipated the media \u201chysteria and talk of \u2018apologizing for America\u201d that would follow, but stood by the comment. \u201cPolitical concerns are not irrelevant in foreign policy; the United States is strongest when we face the world united, so building and maintaining public support for our politics at home is important,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cBut in this case I was prepared to absorb the criticism in order to do what was right and advance our agenda.\u201d On Cuba, Clinton writes that \u201cnear the end\u201d of her time at State, she \u201crecommended to President Obama that he take another look at our embargo\u201d against Cuba. The embargo has been in place since the 1960s and restricts the trade that can happen between the United States and Cuba. Clinton writes that the embargo \u201cwasn\u2019t achieving its goals and it was holding back our broader agenda across Latin America.\u201d \u201cAfter twenty years of observing and dealing with the U.S.-Cuba relationship, I thought we should shift the onus onto the Castros to explain why they remained undemocratic and abusive,\u201d she concludes. Defending Huma Clinton offered an outright defense of her close aide Huma Abedin after some congressional Republicans accused her of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood in 2012. \u201cPrivately I was furious at the attacks on Huma by several ignorant House members,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cSo I was grateful to Senator John McCain, who had gotten to know her over the years, when he went to the floor of the Senate and made his own disdain clear.\u201d Benghazi and those \u201cwho exploit\u201d it Hillary Clinton\u2019s Benghazi chapter was leaked to Politico over a week before \u201cHard Choices\u201d was set to hit bookshelves, largely as a way to get the most long-awaited news in the book out of the way. Clinton takes a defiant tone in the chapter, bashing those \u201cwho exploit\u201d the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack as \u201ca political tool.\u201d She later casts doubt about her participation in the House Republican select committee into the terrorist attack, writing that she will \u201cnot be a part of a political slugfest on the backs of dead Americans.\u201d Clinton uses the chapter to retell her recollection of how Benghazi unfolded, but devote a few pages to the background of the event, including how other diplomatic personnel have been killed in the line of duty before. For more on the Benghazi chapter. \u201cMemories of Benghazi will stay with me always, and they will shape the way America\u2019s diplomat do their jobs in the future,\u201d Clinton concludes. Nuance, regret on Iran Clinton dedicates a chapter in her memoir to how the United States should deal with Iran, particularly its enrichment of uranium. Parroting past statement she has made on Iran, Clinton supports leaving \u201call options\u201d on the table when deal with Iran \u2013 something she did in 2007 \u2013 while also noting that the United States \u201cshould not be afraid to talk with other adversaries such as Iran under appropriate conditions.\u201d But in reflecting on the 2009 Green Revolution in Iran, which saw middle class Iranians calling for democracy and the ouster of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Clinton writes in more direct, less nuanced, tones. \u201cIn retrospect I\u2019m not sure out restraint was the right choices,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt did not stop the regime from ruthlessly crushing the Green Movement, which was exceedingly painful to watch.\u201d She later adds: \u201cI came to regret that we did not speak out more forcefully and rally others to do the same.\u201d Clinton also gives a nod to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in her chapter about Iran. Some American Jews have expressed concern with how the Obama administration \u2013 and by extension Clinton \u2013 negotiated with Iran on slowing its nuclear program starting in 2012. Clinton writes in the chapter that she and Netanyahu saw eye to eye on a nuclear Iran and the importance that military options were on the table. They just, she wrote, disagreed on how vocal to be about it. She even writes that Netanyahu adopted one of her statements on Iran \u2013 \u201ccrippling sanctions\u201d \u2013 for himself. Overall, Clinton argues that relations with Iran and the prospect of limiting their nuclear program are the best they have ever been. \u201cThis is the most promising development in a longtime,\u201d she writes. \u201cAnd it is worth testing to see what could be achieved.\u201d Balancing Israel and Palestine Clinton balances her time between Israel and Palestine in a portion of the book about the Middle East. \u201cMany Americans admire Israel as a homeland for a people long oppressed and a democracy that has had to defend itself at every turn,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cIn Israel\u2019s story we see our own, and the story of all people who struggle for freedom and the right to chart their own destinies.\u201d The latter line is something Clinton said earlier this year in a speech to the American Jewish Committee in Washington. But Clinton also spends time advocating for the rights of Palestinians in the book. \u201cWhen we left the city and visited Jericho, in the West Bank, I got my first glimpse of life under occupation for Palestinians, who were denied the dignity and self-determination that Americans take for granted,\u201d Clinton writes about one visit. Clinton later describes East Jerusalem as something Israel \u201ccaptured\u201d in 1967, noting that \u201cPalestinians dreamed of one day establishing the capital of their future state there.\u201d \u201cThere has been nearly a decade of terror, arising from the second intifada, which started in September 2000,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cAbout a thousand Israelis were killed and eight thousand wounded in terrorist attacks from September 2000 to February 2005. Three times as many Palestinians were killed and thousands more were injured in the same period.\u201d Distance with Obama on Egypt, Arab Spring During the debate over how to handle the Arab Spring and the 2011 protests that raged and eventually toppled former President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, Clinton casts some doubt on how the Obama administration handled the situation. Clinton writes that like \u201cother young people around the world\u201d members of Obama\u2019s staff in the White House were \u201cswept up in the drama and idealism of the moment as they watched the pictures from Tahrir Square on television.\u201d She casts herself, by comparison, as more of a realist who was \u201cconcerned that we not be seen as pushing a longtime partner out the door.\u201d Clinton includes Vice President Joe Biden, then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, and then-National Security Advisor Tom Donilon in this group. Portraying the decision on Mubarak another hard choice \u2013 a theme and the title of the book \u2013 Clinton writes that Egypt \u201cserved as a linchpin of peace in a volatile region. Were we really ready to walk away from that relationship after thirty years of cooperation?\u201d Clinton writes that she told the president, \u201cit all may work out fine in twenty-five years, but I think the period between now and then will be quite rocky for the Egyptian people, for the region and for us.\u201d LGBT Rights Clinton devotes eight pages of her chapter on human rights to her work on LGBT rights while at the State Department. \u201cWhen I look back at my time as Secretary, I\u2019m proud of the work we did to extend the circle of human dignity and human rights to include people historically excluded,\u201d she writes. In particular, she notes she decided in 2009 to extend the \u201cfull range of legally available benefits and allowances to same-sex domestic partners of Foreign Service staff serving abroad.\u201d 2016: \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d The question on everyone\u2019s mind around Clinton\u2019s book is whether she will run for president in 2016. She has told audience after audience that she is considering it and has become more open in answering questions about the presidential race. In the book, Clinton poses the question to herself. And her answer: \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d \u201cHaving run for President before, I understand exactly how challenging it is on every front \u2013 not only on candidates but on their families as well,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cAfter having lost in 2008, I know that nothing is guaranteed, nothing can be taken for granted.\u201d Thank yous In the acknowledgments of portion of her book, Clinton thanks \u201ceveryone who help me through four years at the State Department and more than a year of writing and editing.\u201d She also thanks her \u201cbook team\u201d of Dan Schwerin, Ethan Gelber and Ted Widmer \u2013 all longtime aides. Her second-to-last thank you \u2013 just before Bill and Chelsea \u2013 goes to Obama for \u201cputting his trust in me and giving me the chance to represent our country, and to Vice President Biden and the National Security Council staff for their partnership.\u201d What\u2019s not in Hillary Clinton\u2019s memoir?

            "article_content": "NEW: Lawmakers have two bills tackling mental health in aftermath of Santa Barbara shooting Such efforts have failed before and political experts doubt there's much political will Since Congress has failed to act, states have enacted a number of gun reform laws Families of victims, advocates frustrated by lack of federal action It is a tale of tragedy meets election-year politics. As the nation reels from yet another mass murder, in which the killer shot some of his victims before taking his own life, two rival proposals aimed at improving mental health \u2013 and supporters hope curbing mass gun violence by extension \u2013 are before congressional lawmakers. A measure sponsored by Rep. Tim Murphy, a Pennsylvania Republican and clinical psychologist, seeks to get states to revise standards for committing the severely mentally ill to hospitals. His bill, which has bipartisan support, also includes a controversial proposal that seeks to empower families and judges to intervene on behalf of severely mentally ill adults and, in some cases, compel court-ordered therapy and medication. Murphy\u2019s effort would also significantly dial back federal funding to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which spends more than $3 billion annually on care and is an agency that Murphy does not think is effective. His bill has the backing of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, among other groups. On Thursday, he will also outline before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee the results of his yearlong look into federal mental health programs \u2013 an investigation sparked by the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Can Mental Health Bill Help Stop Mass Killings? Treading carefully on guns \u201cThe privacy laws were to prevent mistreatment from health care \u2026 not meant to keep people from being treated in health care,\u201d Murphy said on CNN\u2019s New Day on Wednesday He added that in many of the recent mass shootings, the parents were aware of the gunman\u2019s mental health issues but were legally powerless. A new chance to revisit gun laws Isla Vista victims Could UCSB shooting have been prevented? Red flags from California shooter's past \u201cPeople knew when something was going on. What about the rights of society? When someone says \u2018we don\u2019t want you forcing them into treatment,\u2019 look, I get that,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut society is saying when the signs are there, that someone is gravely disabled or gravely ill from mental illness, a brain illness, treat them. Denial is not a treatment.\u201d A competing measure from Rep. Ron Barber, a politically vulnerable Arizona Democrat struck by gunfire when his former boss, then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot and severely wounded in 2011, also takes a mental health approach. His legislation would more broadly improve mental health care through added federal financial assistance for counseling, research and education efforts. Stage set for partisan fight His measure has the seal of approval from a number of organizations, including the National Association of School Psychologists, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and Mental Health America. \u201cWe know that one of every four Americans will have a mental illness at least once in their lifetime. Investing in mental health services in our communities and early identification and prevention of mental illness will save both lives and money,\u201d Barber said in a statement on his Web page. The pending showdown over the two measures \u2013 neither of which directly addresses the type of mass gun violence that ended lives in Santa Barbara, Newtown and so many other cities \u2013 sets the stage for a partisan fight over overhauling the nation\u2019s mental health system. \u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s in their hands, it\u2019s what is in their mind and heart that we\u2019ve got to deal with,\u201d Murphy said on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cCalifornia has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation bar none. And so it didn\u2019t work there.\u201d Tackling mental health and gun policy is a thorny issue, but one that needs to be addressed, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told The Washington Post this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look at how we define mental illness, who is denied weapons and who is not, and focus the discussion,\u201d King, who has pushed for tougher firearms measures, told the paper. \u201cWe have to have this debate.\u201d Initiatives focusing on mental health were among the nearly two dozen executive actions put in place by the White House after Newtown. Young, angry and socially alienated The debate will unfold as the nation digests the actions of  Elliot Rodger, 22, a former Santa Barbara City College student who police say fatally stabbed three people and shot three others in that city before taking his own life, Friday. His parents had alerted authorities to their son\u2019s mental illness and signs, they say, pointed to the danger he might one day pose. And, as has happened after Columbine, Virginia Tech, Fort Hood, Tucson, Aurora, Newtown, Washington and other shootings in other places, the victims\u2019 families and neighbors plead for justice, for an end to gun violence, for a change in laws. \u201cWhat, what has changed? Have we learned nothing? Where the hell is the leadership,\u201d a weeping Richard Martinez, whose son, Christopher, a University of California Santa Barbara college student who was shot by Rodger, told CNN. \u201cMy kid died because nobody responded to what happened at Sandy Hook.\u201d Father of shooting victim chastises politicians, demands new gun laws CA Shooting: Crucial moments missed Shooting victim's dad: 'Not one more' Witness: Suspect slowed car to shoot Witness: Gunman was firing off shots In what has become part of a familiar ritual following mass shootings in America, advocates call for action and politicos, especially those in Washington, project solemnity before retreating to their respective corners of the intractable gun debate. \u201cShame on us for allowing this to continue,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who championed firearms reforms that failed in Congress following Newtown. Dems also weigh gun bill In another effort, House Democratic leaders said Wednesday they were weighing whether to push an amendment to a spending bill aimed at strengthening background checks for gun buyers. But they acknowledged it would likely prove unsuccessful. The White House is also pushing to fund gun violence prevention studies for the first time in roughly 20 years, an effort resisted by Republican critics who accuse the Obama administration of playing politics with taxpayer funds. Political experts say there\u2019s little visibility on the issue, even if the conversation centers on mental health, which has routinely presented itself in the roster of America\u2019s mass shootings. As details emerged over the weekend in California, Rodger\u2019s history of mental health issues apparently was no secret to his family. A family friend said he had seen therapists since childhood. The public push for reforms is fickle and is largely influenced by moment-to-moment tragedy, said Cedric Alexander, the chief of police for DeKalb County, Georgia, a clinical psychologist and adviser to the pro-gun rights group Independent Firearm Owners Association. \u201cOur attention span is so short we never focus on this complicated problem long enough to address the problem, let alone begin to fix it,\u201d Alexander said in a statement. Support for gun control has hit peaks and valleys since 1993. That\u2019s when the Brady Bill came about after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan and established a federal background check program for gun purchases. According to a  CNN/ORC International survey conducted in December, 49% of Americans said they supported stricter gun control laws, while 50% opposed them. That fell from the 55% who backed tougher measures a few weeks after the Newtown shootings. States take the lead Stymied federal legislative actions have sent advocates for stricter controls looking for new ways to have an impact. The gun control fights have now moved to the states where legislatures have weighed more than 1,000 proposals, according to an analysis by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The battle over gun policy: Old fight, new strategies And according to data collected for CNN by the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than half of the nation\u2019s legislatures \u2013 those dominated by Republicans \u2013 weighed bills that would have nullified any federal ban on military style assault weapons and limits on large magazines. Will states go where Congress hasn\u2019t on gun laws? A number of measures at the state level deal with mental health. In South Dakota, the GOP-controlled legislature passed a bill requiring that mental health records of \u201csomeone acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity\u201d be sent to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. According to data from the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, roughly 1% of gun permit applicants who failed to pass a background check over the past 14 years, or 10,180 people, were denied for reasons related to mental health.",

            "article_content": "Republicans step up efforts to define Hillary Clinton, who hasn't said whether she'll run for president A certain demographic doesn't likely know much about the Bill Clinton White House years Democrats charge the GOP campaign is 'dredging up\" old news In presidential politics, very little is random. And the recent questions about Hillary Clinton\u2019s age and health is anything but. National Republicans, as well as anti-Clinton outside groups and right-wing blogs, have stepped up efforts to redefine Clinton, despite her nearly 40 years on the political stage. At the heart of this effort is one group of voters: young people. Republicans think that young voters \u2013 particularly Americans who were in diapers or listening to N*SYNC during the eight years that Hillary Clinton lived in the White House \u2013 could use a refresher course on all things Clinton. Republicans feel young people could use their version of Clinton\u2019s history - and might be impressionable over what might seem like distant history. Clinton-in-law loses primary Clinton's \"inevitability\" problem Clinton under fire for age, health They have stepped up their message and research efforts to rehash the news of the \u201990s \u2013 including the policies and scandals that defined the years from 1992 to 2000 \u2013 as part of their wider campaign against her as she mulls another run for president. Democrats charge that the Republican campaign is just \u201cdredging up\u201d old news. Republicans describe it as \u201cciting\u201d recent history. Rove attack was clumsy but shrewd \u201cThere is a whole swath of voters out there who obviously know of Hillary Clinton and understand who the Clintons are, but they don\u2019t know of her as the politician, they don\u2019t know the specifics about her time in the White House,\u201d Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said. Details about the Clinton White House years is not old news for people who were in \u201cgrade school\u201d at the time, she said. The strategy has obvious pitfalls. Republicans risk looking petty by bringing up old scandals.  And it hinges on the assumption that young voters will be receptive to Republican views of Clinton, who is liked by nearly two thirds of those between 18-29 sampled in a recent Quinnipiac University Poll. \u201cRepublicans have been good lately at proving they are all about the past while Secretary Clinton is busy looking to the future,\u201d said Adrienne Elrod, communications director for Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton rapid response organization. \u201cBut, if Republicans want to spend money educating young voters about how strong the economy was under President Clinton\u2019s leadership in the 90s and how American broad-based prosperity was was at an all time high, who are we to stop them?\u201d Clinton under fire for age, health Clinton is also one of the most recognizable people in America. In recent polls. She has more than 95% name recognition with U.S. voters and is considered the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination, if she runs. Republicans, however, feel they can still define her on their terms. \u201cWhile a lot people assume everyone knows Hillary, people under 30 don\u2019t know specifics,\u201d Kukowski said. \u201cWe need to be out there framing her early.\u201d GOP: Clinton's health 'fair game' On Hillary 2016, Gov. Patrick: 'I worry' Could Rove's Clinton remarks backfire? Republicans pounce on Margolies\u2019 defeat \u201cWhat is Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest accomplishment?\u201d As Clinton weighs a White House run in 2016, Republicans want young voters to think about this: What is Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest accomplishment? \u201cI think that is going to be a big issue in framing the debate and framing who Hillary is to those voters,\u201d Kukowski said. Conservative blogs and publications have seemingly taken cues from the RNC on this question. Just last week, PJTV, a \u201ccenter-right online news and commentary\u201d website sent a reporter to George Washington University to question students about Clinton\u2019s record. In a three-minute video that has bounced around right wing blogs, students seem unable to answer the question and those who respond offer meager answers (one even cites Clinton\u2019s handling of Benghazi as an accomplishment). Other blogs and right-leaning outlets have sent reporters to Democratic National Committee meetings and college campuses to ask questions about Clinton\u2019s record and history of political positions. Kukowski said she didn\u2019t know if that format comes directly from the RNC, but did say, \u201cWe do have somebody here that works with conservative bloggers all day every day.\u201d The Republican strategy extends beyond the right wing blogosphere, too. Top Republican strategists, like Karl Rove, have shown how Republican might try to bring up Clinton\u2019s age and health in a campaign. Rove dropped questions about Clinton\u2019s health at an event that was picked up by a newspaper. He doubled down on the comments, drawing condemnation from Democrats. The strategy worked, however, as it dominated news about Clinton for two days. Patrick: All this attention could hurt Clinton Digging back into the \u201890s Although Democrats have called Rove \u201csleazy,\u201d the stepped up attacks have already had an impact on the early 2016 presidential wrangling by solidifying what Republicans have been saying for months: Hillary Clinton is who they see as the most formidable potential candidate. Feinstein: Hillary at \"political prime\" Rove suggests Hillary has brain injury Peter King tells Clinton: 'Get ready' Representatives from a handful of Republican groups said they plan to operate as if she is running or until she says otherwise. But the comments have also forced Clinton into the political fray. She had tried to stay above politics for months by giving high-profile paid speeches and traveling the country. But as Clinton began to raise her profile, Republicans began to step up their attacks and force a response. When she left the State Department, she joked with friends and confidants that she was looking forward to the \u201cspeeches and beaches\u201d time of her life. That time appears to be over. In the past two weeks, she has dipped her toes into domestic politics, including her first congressional fundraiser of the midterms \u2013 for a candidate who eventually lost, and has started to regularly tout her husband\u2019s record in the White House. \u201cThe 1990s taught us that even in the face of difficult long term economic trends, it is possible through smart policies and sound investments to enjoy broad-based growth and shared prosperity,\u201d Clinton said during a speech at the New America Foundation. She added that her husband\u2019s years in the White House showed that \u201ca rising tide really did raise all boats.\u201d Tim Miller, executive director of the anti-Clinton America Rising PAC, said comments like that are an acknowledgment that she knows their time in the White House from 1993-2001 will be an issue if she runs. \u201cWe are very conscious of the fact that there is a big slice of the electorate that does not have a full picture of Hillary Clintons record,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI think that with the Clintons would like to rely on is a nostalgic strategy with regards to their time in the White House in the \u201990s and don\u2019t want to get down into the details.\u201d Miller, whose super PAC has a cadre of researchers diving into the Clinton record, said there will be an obvious focus on what younger voters need to know about her time in the White House. Miller added that while he doesn\u2019t think the 2016 election will be won or lost on issues like Whitewater and other Clinton White House scandals, he does think  informing young voters, especially, about them is necessary. \u201cI do think that for the generation that didn\u2019t live through that, that there is some value having the discussion,\u201d he added. Right now, America Rising has roughly 60 full-time employees working for the organization, many of whom are primarily focused on cultivating research documents about Clinton\u2019s world in the \u201980s and \u201890s. Solidifying a definition Defining a candidate early is nothing new in presidential politics, either. President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign famously began to define Republican challenger Mitt Romney as out-of-touch early in the race.  His team went up with ads early and spent tons of cash, hoping that Romney would be defined on their terms to many voters by final months of the campaign. \u201cWhat happens is often times if you don\u2019t introduce yourself, then you are leaving that task to the opposition,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and Romney spokesman. \u201cWhat happens is when the oppositions provides a greater reservoir of information about you and it is negative then it is tough to turn around those perceptions.\u201d Obama prevailed in a campaign that many saw as perilous for him. But defining Clinton before she has said whether she will run or not is somewhat unprecedented. Republicans say that is only because of the unprecedented shadow campaign around Clinton right now. \u201cThe strategy is to force her out of the shadow campaign she is winning by acclimation,\u201d said Leslie Sanchez, a Republican strategist and the author of \u201cYou\u2019ve Come a Long Way, Maybe.\u201d \u201cThat is the undercurrent here in bringing out issues about health or legacy. (Republicans aren\u2019t) going to allow Hillary Clinton to be anointed without taking the heat.\u201d Opinion: Why I\u2019m ready for Hillary",

            "article_content": "The fight over gun law reform is being waged in the statehouses and through well-funded lobbying Forty states have enacted some type of gun legislation this year Guns and mental health is a hot-button issue following the latest Fort Hood shooting The Obama administration is trying to get gun violence research funded; some Republicans oppose it It was a bellwether election of sorts. Gun-control Democrats in Virginia running for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general all won despite poor reviews from the National Rifle Association, a politically powerful organization headquartered in the state. \u201cI don\u2019t care what grade I got from the NRA,\u201d Terry McAuliffe said in the gubernatorial campaign\u2019s final debate. He received an \u201cF\u201d from the group, which is holding its annual conference in Indianapolis starting on Friday. Gun-control advocates cheered when the three Democrats prevailed. The gun-rights lobby soldiered on. Although McAuliffe\u2019s first effort at tougher gun laws in Virginia was thwarted in the legislature not long after he took office, it illustrated where the battles are being fought now that the issue has effectively moved from Washington, where the Senate a year ago failed to advance new measures following the horrendous Newtown school massacre in Connecticut. Battlegrounds in the states Gun-control and gun-rights forces are now squaring off in the states and their efforts are funded by backers who are pouring millions into the fray. \u201cIt\u2019s mixed in many ways,\u201d economist and pro-gun advocate John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, said of the nation\u2019s newest slate of gun laws. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s some states that have been pushing for more gun control and others are moving in the other direction.\u201d Accused Kansas shooter has racist past Deal: We have the right to bear arms Chicagoland Episode 7 Trailer According to an analysis conducted for CNN by the National Conference of State Legislatures, states have enacted more than 40 new gun laws since the start of the year. Roughly half are those considered by such gun-control groups as the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence as having \u201cminimal impact\u201d on existing law. They include provisions in a measure passed by the Democrat-controlled Colorado legislature allowing people, under certain circumstances, to renew their concealed handgun permits in a county different from the one in which the gun was originally registered. Gun-law reform in Colorado also was a closely-watched topic  when tough new restrictions on expanded background checks on private sales and limits on ammunition magazines were signed into law. Several Democratic state lawmakers were recalled over their votes. Guns and mental health The crop of state laws also includes measures that touch on issues debated passionately on the national scene. The Republican-controlled South Dakota state legislature passed a measure requiring that mental health records of \u201csomeone acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity\u201d be sent to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Statistics from the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) show about 1 percent of applicants who failed a background check over the past 14 years, or 10,180 people, were turned down for reasons related to mental health. Questions of mental health and gun ownership again made headlines this month when a soldier opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, killing three and wounding more than a dozen others before taking his own life. Authorities say Spc. Ivan Lopez was an Iraq war veteran under evaluation for post-traumatic stress disorder. It\u2019s not clear if the second shooting of its kind on the sprawling military base will lead to changes in law. Mental illness and shootings Governors sound off on guns Giuliani: Obama has to make concessions This week, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed legislation \u2013 known by critics as the \u201cguns everywhere bill\u201d \u2013 that allows residents who have concealed carry permits to take guns into some bars, churches, school zones, government buildings and certain parts of airports. New money, old fight Shifts in direction are due in part to the influence of big money and organization. \u201cFor many years, the gun lobby has had an advantage both in terms of funding and a well-organized and committed grassroots which it has used to hold back efforts to strengthen gun laws that are supported by the vast majority of Americans, including the vast majority of gun owners,\u201d said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. \u201cFor years, politicians felt that there was more to lose than to gain by supporting much-needed reforms to keep guns from dangerous people.\u201d This month, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledged $50 million to try to combat what he and other gun-control advocates see as the NRA\u2019s outsized political influence. NRA gathers as gun debate cools, shifts focus His new group, Everytown for Gun Safety \u2014 an umbrella organization for his other groups: Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America \u2014 plans to borrow from the NRA playbook. Bloomberg\u2019s group hopes to build strong grassroots support, motivate membership and lobby effectively. But gun-control advocates say the playing field won\u2019t even out overnight. \u201cI think that at the federal level, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d said Robyn Thomas, executive director of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \u201cThe NRA and their allies have spent time entrenching themselves in Washington and it\u2019s going to take our national leaders time to recognize there are other players now.\u201d For its part, the NRA says it is not backing down. \u201cThe fight continues,\u201d said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that is over as the gun-control lobby and Mike Bloomberg have shown they lie in wait for the next tragedy to occur to try and push their agenda.\u201d Quietly studying the issue Quietly, the White House is preparing to fund gun violence prevention studies in some cases for the first time in nearly two decades. The effort, critics say, amounts to a politically-motivated use of taxpayer funds. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that money abused to promote politics and a gun-control agenda,\u201d Arulanandam said. The National Institute of Health previously announced it would award grants this fall. \u201cNIH has and will continue to fund research to inform prevention programs related to firearm violence,\u201d agency spokeswoman Renate Myles said. \u201cStudies designed to develop and evaluate firearm injury prevention activities are part of larger efforts to develop more effective public health education programs. \u201cThis includes research about parental roles in preventing injury - including injuries from firearms - in the home and in other settings.  NIH also supports research to understand the relationship between alcohol abuse and gun violence, as part of broader efforts to develop more effective interventions to help prevent violence,\u201d Myles said. Separately, Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee have vowed to block President Barack Obama\u2019s proposal to try to secure $10 million in federal funding to scientifically study gun violence through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has not received money to study the topic since the mid-1990s after the NRA lobbied to nix that type of funding following the agency\u2019s controversial study that found gun owners\u2019 homes had higher homicide rates.

            "article_content": "Republicans must pick up six seats to win control of the Senate Six Democratic races and two Republican races are key to the balance of power In the battle for the Senate, nine races will play a role in determining the balance of power. Democrats currently hold six of the seats while Republicans hold the other two, meaning that the Democrats must defend their territory \u2013 a difficult task in a midterm election with a Democratic president who has low approval ratings. Here\u2019s a short synopsis of the key races that Democrats are working to keep in their hands: Alaska: Sen. Mark Begich is another freshman senator who is facing a difficult road to reelection. He won his last race by fewer than 4,000 votes in the red state. He is distancing himself from President Barack Obama and touting his pro-energy credentials. He could face one of three Republicans. Their primary is August 19. Arkansas: This is one of the most Republican states in the country. President Barack Obama received only 37% of the vote in 2012 and Sen. Mark Pryor is locked in a race with Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican backed by both conservative and establishment elements of the Republican Party. Louisiana: Since her first Senate race in 1996, Sen. Mary Landrieu has had a tough road to election. Now running for her fourth term, Republicans are still trying to unseat the centrist Democrat. This year she will face off against one of several Republican challengers, including Rep. Bill Cassidy, who is considered her biggest threat. Louisiana runs its elections a little differently. November 4, Election Day for the rest of the country, is considered Louisiana\u2019s primary. And if no candidate receives 50% of the vote, a runoff takes place December 6. Michigan: Long-time Sen. Carl Levin is retiring, giving Republicans their first chance to take a seat in Michigan since 1994. Republican Terry Lynn Land is staging a competitive race against Democratic Rep. Gary Peters. House and Senate key races to watch Montana: Cook Political Report categorizes this race as \u201clean Republican.\u201d Sen. John Walsh is running as an incumbent, appointed to the seat after Max Baucus left to become ambassador to China, but that status is thin in the conservative state as he\u2019s only been in office since February. Rep. Steve Daines is the likely Republican candidate. North Carolina: Sen. Kay Hagan is running for her second term. It\u2019s still unclear who she will face in the November election as Republicans are battling it out for that party\u2019s nomination. But her likely challenger is state House Speaker Thom Tillis. While she will have to run against her Republican opponent, she also will have to run against her public perception as she faces approval ratings of only 35%, according to an April 8 High Point University/University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill poll. Iowa: Sen. Tom Harkin\u2019s retirement opens the seat up to a possible Republican win. Rep. Bruce Braley will be the Democratic candidate and the Republican field is crowded. But if no GOP candidate obtains 35% support in the primary, then the candidate is chosen by a conservative state convention. Republicans are also playing in Colorado and New Hampshire, which means they have multiple paths to retaking the Senate. But Republicans are defending two key seats that could make it more difficult for them to pick up the majority. Kentucky: Republican leader Mitch McConnell is in the race of his life. He is being attacked by the tea party wing of the party with a challenger, Matt Bevin, who he\u2019s likely to beat in the May 20 primary. Then Democrats have a legitimate chance in the red state with their candidate, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Georgia: The current Republican senator, Saxby Chambliss, is retiring, leaving his seat vulnerable. Michelle Nunn comes from a family steeped in Georgia politics and is proving to be a viable Democratic candidate in this red state. Over on the GOP side, the candidates are beating each other up in a contentious primary and pushing each other further to the right, which could leave the primary winner bruised and too extreme for a general election electorate. Additionally, primary candidates must win more than 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff. With the crowded field, a runoff is possible, adding another challenging element to Republican efforts to keep this seat. Complete 2014 midterms coverage",

            "article_content": "Rob Portman announced he won't run for president in 2016 Jeb Bush, however, said he's still \"thinking\" and will make a decision soon A new CNN poll shows Mitt Romney is still the top favorite, wtih Ben Carson in second Rand Paul and Chris Christie are also making moves toward 2016 The Republican 2016 presidential field is starting to come into focus with potential contenders making notable moves this week. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the latest headlines starting to shape the early race for the Republican nomination. Portman is out Pollsters can cross one name off their long list: Rob Portman. The Ohio Republican announced Tuesday he\u2019s running for re-election to his Senate seat. Portman was vetted, but ultimately not picked, to be Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012, and he would have been the first pro-same sex marriage Republican presidential candidate if he ran this cycle. He said as recently as two weeks ago that he was considering a presidential run, telling CNN\u2019s Erin McPike that he \u201cprobably (has) more experience than other people who are running or thinking about running.\u201d Sen. Portman's 2016 Plans Instead the senator will seek a second term in the Senate, where he thinks he can \u201cplay the most constructive role.\u201d Bush is \u201cthinking\u201d Jeb Bush reiterated that he\u2019s still considering a presidential run, revealing more details Monday about his decision-making process. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about running for president, and I\u2019ll make up my mind in short order,\u201d the former Florida governor said at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal. He said he\u2019s determining whether his candidacy could \u201clift people\u2019s spirits and not get sucked into the vortex,\u201d adding that he\u2019s also questioning if \u201cthe sacrifice for my family is tolerable.\u201d Son says Jeb Bush \u2018more than likely\u2019 eyeing 2016 run Jeb Bush says he's thinking about 2016 With Bush considered a potential frontrunner, the rest of the GOP field is eagerly awaiting his decision. Those perhaps most interested include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who was mentored by Bush, and other candidates who appeal to moderate Republicans, like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be a good candidate or a bad one,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI kind of know how a Republican can win.\u201d Ben Carson on the verge of becoming a political phenomenon A renowned neurosurgeon who\u2019s become popular in conservative circles, Ben Carson is still climbing up the charts, according to a new CNN/ORC International Poll. Carson came in second place behind Mitt Romney in the survey, which measure support for potential 2016 contenders. Carson rose to political fame after publicly chiding the direction the country was going during his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2013. President Barack Obama was sitting just a few feet away. Since then, he\u2019s been likened to a rockstar among conservatives, and he\u2019s become the only African-American Republican expressing interest in a 2016 presidential run. His abhorrence for political correctness has also made him a favorite among radio talk shows. \u201cI try to talk about what I actually see that\u2019s going on and this is what we need in America,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Mark Preston for a profile piece. \u201cWe need people who are not afraid to express themselves and who are not afraid to debate issues.\u201d In the interview, Carson said that if the right candidate emerges before May 1, he won\u2019t run for the White House. Rand Paul is definitely running in 2016 \u2026 for the Senate While Sen. Rand Paul has been saying for more than a year that he plans on running for a second term in the Senate, the Kentucky Republican made it official Tuesday. But he has a bumpy road ahead. Kentucky election law allows candidates to appear on a ballot only once at a time, making it difficult for Paul if he also runs for president \u2014 a decision he told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he\u2019s about \u201cfour to six months\u201d away from making. Is Obama's war against ISIS illegal? His allies in the state Senate tried to help him by passing a bill that tweaks the law, but the measure stalled in the Democratic-controlled state House. Still, Paul has other options, including a possible court challenge or convincing the state GOP to change its nominating system in 2016 from a primary to a caucus. That way, his name wouldn\u2019t appear on a ballot. Or, he could just not appear on the ballot at all and forego Kentucky\u2019s delegates. It\u2019s unclear which direction he\u2019ll take, but expect Democrats to seize on Paul\u2019s attempt to run for two offices. \u201cWhere I come from, people think if you can\u2019t make up your mind on which office you want to run for, then you ain\u2019t fit to serve in either one,\u201d Kentucky House Speaker Greg Stumbo told CNN. Chris Christie wins high praise from Iowa\u2019s top Republican In a bizarre 2016 storyline, Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a popular bill that would have banned gestation crates that severely limit the mobility of pigs in New Jersey. While his decision drew strong pushback from animal rights activists and other supporters, the veto kept Christie in high standing with Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa. The Hawkeye State is the nation\u2019s top pork producer. Christie: I'll decide on 2016 next year Branstad, who holds significant influence in Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest, said Monday that Christie\u2019s veto was a \u201cgood decision,\u201d adding that he personally lobbied Christie to reject the bill. Christie said he vetoed the bill because it was a \u201csolution in search of a problem\u201d and a \u201cpolitical movement masquerading as substantive policy.\u201d But his opponents say the decision was simply a political ploy with 2016 ambitions on his mind. Democratic state Sen. Ray Lesniak, a strong backer of the bill, pledged that the state legislature would attempt to override the veto, according to NJ.com. Mitt Romney\u2019s hair. Enough said. One can hardly write about 2016 without mentioning Romney and the latest earth-shattering news that his picture perfect hair is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 not always perfectly coiffed. The bombshell was revealed by his wife, Ann Romney, on Twitter during Thanksgiving weekend. Here\u2019s what @MittRomney looks like after a long Thanksgiving weekend with our grandkids in San Diego pic.twitter.com/Mprx1uecnM Disheveled or not, he\u2019s still the most favored potential Republican contender, carrying 20% support among Republican voters in CNN\u2019s latest poll, with other names getting 10% or less. He may have said a thousand times in the past two years that he\u2019s not running again, but until someone else emerges as a frontrunner, voters are poised to keep him as their top choice. What Mitt Romney learned running for president: Debating is \u2018sweaty business\u2019 Oh, right. And Newt Gingrich said this. Talking about the emerging field, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who ran for president in 2012, didn\u2019t rule out the idea of another run. \u201cI haven\u2019t totally closed the door, but I\u2019m certainly not opening it,\u201d he said Tuesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cWolf.\u201d He later added that it\u2019s actually \u201cvery implausible\u201d and that he \u201cdoubts very much\u201d he\u2019ll \u201cend up in that game.\u201d \u201cBut that tells you how early it is,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Sixty-two percent of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire support Clinton That is 49 percentage points higher than second place finisher Sen. Elizabeth Warren New Hampshire has long been supportive of the Clintons, Hillary Clinton won the primary in 2008 But even Clinton supporters in the Granite State caution against seeing the state as already in the bag New Hampshire remains Clinton country. Sixty-two percent of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire say that if the primary were held today, Hillary Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for the Democrats\u2019 2016 presidential nomination, would be their top choice, according to a Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm College poll released Monday. The number is a whopping 49 percentage points higher than second-place finisher Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont finishes in third with 6% and Vice President Joe Biden finishes in fourth with 5%. Although Clinton has not declared her second run at the presidency, the former secretary of state has admitted she is considering a run and many close aides see a campaign as all-but-certain at this point. New Hampshire has always been welcome ground for the Clinton family. Bill Clinton\u2019s surprising second place finish in the 1992 primary provided his campaign with a symbolic victory and re-energized the Arkansas governor as \u201cThe Comeback Kid.\u201d Likewise, in 2008, after finishing a disappointing third in the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton used her New Hampshire primary win to right her campaign. Despite her huge lead, even Clinton\u2019s most ardent New Hampshire supporters have cautioned her to not take the Granite State as already in the bag. \u201cInevitability is not a message, it is not something you can run on. And in New Hampshire, we have a long history of (frontrunner) train wrecks,\u201d Terry Shumaker, a longtime Clinton aide in New Hampshire, said last week during a meeting of pro-Clinton Democrats. Shumaker, who was with Bill Clinton when he filed his presidential bid papers in 1991, added: \u201cAs I caution all presidential candidates in New Hampshire, taking New Hampshire for granted is very dangerous. Last time I believe Hillary Clinton had an almost 30-point lead in the polls in our state in the summer and that lead melted like an ice sculpture on the mall in Washington in July.\u201d Monday\u2019s poll, however, is not all good news for Clinton. In a 2016 general election matchup between Clinton and Mitt Romney, the failed 2012 Republican nominee, Clinton\u2019s one point lead is within the polls margin of error. When matched up against Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor, or Rand Paul, the senator from Kentucky, Clinton enjoyed a 8 and 7 point lead, respectively. For Clinton Democrats, the end of the pre-campaign comes with concerns The poll also has good news for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. In a 10-person field that includes 2012 GOP Romney, Paul\u2019s the only other potential candidate to break double-digits, taking 11 percent support and coming in second to Romney\u2019s 30 percent support among GOP primary voters. With Romney out of the picture \u2014 though the former Massachusetts governor has left the door open, a third bid seems unlikely for him \u2014 Paul ties for first place with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Both take 16 percent support among GOP primary voters, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush comes in a close third, with 14 percent. The rest of the field takes single-digit support. Paul\u2019s strength in the state comes as no surprise, as its libertarian-leaning population drove his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, to a second-place finish in the 2012 GOP presidential primary there. Indeed, the results may be more heartening for Christie, who\u2019s considered Paul\u2019s main challenger in the state but has suffered significant damage over the past year due to the scandal surrounding the George Washington Bridge lane closures that cast a pall over his administration. The Bloomberg poll suggests, however, Christie remains competitive in his home region, and that the two will have a fierce fight for the all-important early primary state if they both decide to run, as expected.",

            "article_content": "Lawyering up for potential runoff contests in Louisiana and Georgia November 4 tea leaves -- GOP ahead in the Iowa early vote tally Obama goes to Wisconsin to help Dems try to unseat Walker CNN\u2019s John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on \u201cInside Politics\u201d to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. Some late chess moves in House races, a rush to lawyer up, and some early vote tallies that suggest Democratic struggles \u2013 those were part of our trip around the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table to close our Sunday conversation. 1. The candidates give way to the voters -- and then the lawyers Eight or nine Senate races are dead heats entering the final week, so can you predict with any certainty who will win? Lawyering up for runoff season Yes: the lawyers will. Politico\u2019s Manu Raju shared reporting that both parties, even as they make late spending and schedule decisions in the big races, are also looking past Election Day to the likelihood that so many close races will mean recounts and runoffs \u2013 and therefore a need for legal teams. \u201cHere in Washington, both the party committees are already talking to lawyers on the ground. They are already planning to send people into those close states \u2013 like potentially Alaska or Colorado or Iowa \u2013 if they go down to the wire, to have people ready to fight, because this is an Election Day that could last for potentially months.\u201d 2. Early voting is Democrats\u2019 ace in the hole \u2013 until it isn\u2019t Election Day isn\u2019t what it used to be. GOP winning Iowa early vote With more and more states adopting more liberal early and absentee voting rules, some of the closest races this year will actually be settled before poll closings a week from Tuesday. And throughout Campaign 2014, Democrats have told us that it is their not-so-secret weapon. As they see it, they won that battle in 2008 and 2012 and have the nuts-and-bolts infrastructure in place in the states where it could make a big difference in 2014. Colorado and Iowa, for example. Maybe New Hampshire and North Carolina, too. But The Atlantic\u2019s Molly Ball says the numbers, so far anyway, don\u2019t appear to be adding up the way the Democrats had hoped. \u201cThis past week, for the first time in history, Republicans returned more early votes than Democrats in Iowa,\u201d said Ball. \u201cThis is a big danger sign. Now Democrats are saying: \u2018Oh, those are just those people who would have voted on Election Day anyway.\u2019\u201d But she notes that in the past two elections, the GOP has won Election Day voting in Iowa by more than 9 percentage points, so for Republicans to also be leading in the early vote should be a warning to Democrats about what might happen on November 4. 3. The 2014 race with the most personal 2016 implications Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is a conservative favorite and could be a formidable GOP presidential contender. Former Gov. Scott Walker \u2013 well, not so much. So winning his tough 2014 re-election campaign is priority No. 1 for Walker, and Robert Costa of The Washington Post took a few moments to share his reporting about what could be the cycle\u2019s marquee gubernatorial race. \u201cThis week you\u2019re going to see President Obama go to Milwaukee,\u201d said Costa. \u201cDemocrats really think they have an opportunity there, if they can get the turnout in the state\u2019s biggest city, to put a Democrat, Mary Burke, over the top and take out one of the top candidates for the GOP in the next cycle.\u201d 4. The war for women: Democrats looking to widen the gender gap Democrats readily concede a giant gender gap is imperative if they are to win the big Senate races this year. Just look at Hillary Clinton\u2019s weekend appeal for Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina. So NPR\u2019s Juana Summers says gender politics \u2013 and the war for women\u2019s votes \u2013 are her big focus in the final full week of the midterm campaign. \u201cI saw this interesting poll last month that shows most women prefer a Republican-controlled House to a Democratic-controlled House,\u201d said Summers. \u201cI\u2019ll watch that trend in close states like in Colorado, where certainly reproductive choice issues and women have been a battleground, and in Iowa of course, while also looking to see whether or not Republicans are able to close the diversity gap in the House. And I think that will be a very important story as we are moving ahead to look forward to in 2016 as well.\u201d 5. The margin matters: plenty of late House chess Even most Democrats concede Republicans are likely to add to their House majority this year, but there\u2019s a big debate about how many seats are in play, and some fascinating final week chess being played. Democrats are mostly playing defense \u2013 feeling better, for example, about two Democratic seats in New Hampshire that remain competitive to the end. On the flip side, any seats Democrats can take away from Republicans would offset losses elsewhere; it\u2019s considered a bit of a long shot, but some Democrats believe they have a shot at one in the Denver suburbs, if Democrats can meet their early voting targets. Republicans currently control 233 seats. Democrats want to keep them below 240; GOP hopes are to get to 245 or more. Two Democratic-held seats where pro-GOP forces are making a late spending push: the 6th Congressional District in Massachusetts and the 26th in Florida.",

            "article_content": "Establishment GOP has big night after Cantor's shocking loss two weeks ago Who would thought a GOP-black Democrat coalition could win in the South Biggest winner Tuesday in Maryland wasn't even on the ballot The establishment struck back. Two weeks after House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s primary loss to a little-known and underfunded tea party challenger rocked the Republican Party, incumbent and mainstream GOP candidates came out on top in several high-profile primary showdowns. In Tuesday\u2019s marquee race, longtime Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi narrowly fended off a fierce primary challenge from state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who edged Cochran in the primary three weeks ago. Cochran\u2019s victory might have come  from crossover Democratic voters \u2013 courted by the senator \u2013 who cast ballots in the runoff. Longtime members of Congress survive scares Cochran was joined by Rep. James Lankford, who easily won the primary in Oklahoma over two other major candidates who enjoyed tea party support in the race to succeed a retiring senator. Former Rep. Bob Beauprez, considered the mainstream pick in Colorado\u2019s GOP gubernatorial primary, topped three other candidates. And former South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster, the ultimate insider, won a landslide victory in the state\u2019s Republican lieutenant governor runoff. In another high-profile showdown, Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York, who was first elected to Congress 44 years ago, claimed victory in what he says will be his last campaign. But Rangel\u2019s opponent, state Sen. Adriano Espaillat, who nearly ousted Rangel in the Democratic primary two years ago, wasn\u2019t conceding the tight race early Wednesday morning. And in Maryland, outgoing Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a potential 2016 Democratic presidential contender, wasn\u2019t on the ballot but might have been the biggest winner of the night. Here are five things we learned from Tuesday\u2019s primaries. 1. Creative coalition: Tuesday night\u2019s results  illustrate the unscripted political realities that play out in particular states on Election Day. Thad Cochran wins Mississippi primary Who is leading in primary races? Who is leading in primary races? So who would have thought that in today\u2019s political climate \u2013 and in a deeply red state like Mississippi \u2013 a 76-year-old long-time Republican incumbent could beat back a serious tea party challenge? And who would have thought that he could do it by courting the African-American vote while touting his longevity in Washington. Cochran\u2019s allies worked aggressively in recent weeks to reach out to Democrats, especially African-Americans who make up 37% of the state\u2019s population. But McDaniel argued the tactic was a stretch, saying in his election night speech that Cochran showed his willingness to win at any cost, even diluting the party if he needed to. \u201cThere is something a bit unusual about a Republican primary decided by liberal Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much for principles. I guess they can take some consolation that they did something tonight for once again compromising, for once again reaching across the aisle, for abandoning the conservative movement.\u201d The question is whether the strategy can be applied beyond Mississippi. McDaniel warned Tuesday night that it certainly could. \u201cToday the conservative movement took a backseat to liberal Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it can happen here, it can happen anywhere. And that\u2019s why we will never stop fighting.\u201d 2. Experience still counts: Along with Cochran, Rangel also used his experience in Washington to sell himself to voters. \u201cI think because of the confidence (the voters) had in me, with my service and their belief with the decision they had to make, that I was their best choice,\u201d Rangel told reporters. For Cochran\u2019s part, the senator actively reminded voters of his work to secure federal funds for programs used widely in the state. It\u2019s not the kind of message that Republicans tout in these days of fiscal conservatism. But in this case, it worked for Cochran. He also stressed his position and influence in the Senate, saying if Republicans win control of the chamber, he would likely become chairman of the appropriations committee, a seat that could help him get even more money for the state. Complete coverage of the 2014 midterm elections 3. Oklahoma blunder? Cochran\u2019s comeback was the big shocker of the night, but there was another surprise in Oklahoma, where Rep. James Lankford cleared 50% of the vote and skipped a runoff against his top rival, Oklahoma House Speaker T.W. Shannon, in the race to replace retiring Sen. Tom Coburn. Many observers figured the primary was surely headed to an August runoff. Shannon, an African-American who is a member of the Chickasaw Nation, had all kinds of national buzz. He was endorsed by a batch of tea party groups, and by Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Sarah Palin. Cruz even cut an ad for Shannon, but it wasn\u2019t enough. In fact, the help Shannon received from outside conservative groups, namely the Senate Conservatives Fund and Oklahomans for a Conservative Future, may have backfired. After Lankford, a member of the House Republican leadership who voted to raise the debt ceiling last year, was attacked in TV ads from the two pro-Shannon groups, Coburn weighed in with a pseudo-endorsement, praising Lankford as \u201ca man of absolute integrity.\u201d Lankford used the kind words in a television ad that ran late in the primary and may have helped push him over the top on Tuesday. 4. The O\u2019Malley effect: It\u2019s often the case that governors leave office on poor terms with the public. Luster fades, scandals creep, and finicky voters start to search for fresh faces. Sitting governors, too, often shy away from wading into primaries and endorsing candidates to succeed them. But none of that looked to be true on Tuesday night in Maryland, where outgoing Democratic Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a potential presidential candidate in 2016, had taken something of a gamble heading into Election Day. He endorsed a pair of statewide candidates who ultimately coasted to primary wins by embracing his progressive policies and his popularity with rank-and-file Democrats (His approval rating among Democrats reached almost 80% in a Washington Post poll earlier this year). In the state\u2019s attorney general primary, O\u2019Malley\u2019s preferred candidate, state Sen. Brian Frosh, defeated Jon Cardin, the nephew of Sen. Ben Cardin. And in the state\u2019s marquee gubernatorial primary, Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown thumped his main opponent, the gaffe-prone Attorney General Doug Gansler, by draping himself in the O\u2019Malley banner, happily boasting about the state\u2019s premier education rating among other policies. Gansler struggled to draw a contrast with Brown, O\u2019Malley\u2019s anointed successor. When Gansler raised questions about the state\u2019s troubled health care exchange rollout and tried to tie the problems to the lieutenant governor, Brown accused Gansler of attacking Obamacare. Running against O\u2019Malley in a Democratic primary was mostly futile. Fresh off a buzzy trip to Iowa last weekend, O\u2019Malley bolstered his political standing back home on Tuesday. All in all, a pretty strong week for one of the Democratic Party\u2019s leading alternatives to Hillary Clinton. 5. If at first you don\u2019t succeed\u2026: Twenty-four years after he first ran for lieutentant governor, South Carolina\u2019s Henry McMaster is a major step closer to finally winning the office. The former state attorney general easily won the GOP primary runoff, topping businessman Mike Campbell, the son of the late Caroll Campbell, a popular Republican governor. A former U.S. attorney, McMaster\u2019s the ultimate political insider, serving nearly a decade as chairman of the state\u2019s Republican Party. With a win in November, he\u2019ll be considered a contender for governor in 2018. What made this race interesting to a national audience was that two former Republican presidential candidates who may run for the White House again in 2016 took sides. In the closing days of the runoff campaign, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania stumped with McMaster while former Arkansas  Gov. Mike Huckabee campaigned for Campbell. South Carolina plays an important role in presidential politics \u2013 its primary is the first in the South each cycle. \u201cIt\u2019s a big win for McMaster but a big win for Santorum as well,\u201d GOP consultant Bruce Haynes, a South Carolina native, told CNN. \u201cSantorum already had bona fides with faith and values voters.  Now he\u2019s wisely allied himself with the dominant figure in South Carolina\u2019s GOP establishment.  Santorum is doing the quiet but important work of building an organization, and he had a very good night in the Palmetto State.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Billionaire's environmental group is targeting Senate, governors' races Focus is on races with contrast between pro-environment vs. \"anti-science\" candidates Critics accuse Tom Steyer of hypocrisy, saying he made his money on fossil fuels An environmental advocacy group backed by hedge fund tycoon Tom Steyer is set to unleash a seven-state, $100 million offensive against Republican \u201cscience deniers\u201d this year, a no-holds-barred campaign-style push from the green billionaire that could help decide which party controls the Senate and key statehouses come November. The Steyer-backed outside group, NextGen Climate, has billed itself as a progressive, pro-environment counterbalance to the wealthy oil and gas industry \u2013 as well as the primary foil to the pro-business Koch brothers and their well-funded conservative donor network. The outfit, launched last year by the San Francisco billionaire, has already pledged to spend heavily this midterm year in Iowa to assist the Democratic Senate nominee Bruce Braley, and in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott is facing a difficult re-election fight against Democrat Charlie Crist. Red news, blue news: Climate change Rubio: Scientists wrong on climate White House: Climate change to get worse Steyer\u2019s 2014 map now includes Senate races in Michigan, New Hampshire and Colorado as well as governor\u2019s races in Maine and Pennsylvania, home to two of the most endangered Republican governors in the country, Paul LePage and Tom Corbett. \u201cThis is the year, in our view, that we are able to demonstrate that you can use climate, you can do it well, you can do it in a smart way, to win political races,\u201d said Chris Lehane, the longtime Democratic consultant advising Steyer. Lehane and NextGen political strategist Sky Gallegos revealed their 2014 strategy Wednesday in a briefing with reporters in Washington. \u2018Pro-climate action\u2019 vs. \u2018anti-science\u2019 Absent from their list of 2014 targets: must-win Senate races for Democrats in conservative-leaning states such as Arkansas, Alaska, North Carolina, Louisiana and Kentucky. That\u2019s because Democrats on those ballots have expressed support for the Keystone XL pipeline, the coal industry, offshore drilling or hydraulic fracturing \u2013 all nonstarter issues for environmentalists. Instead, Lehane said the 501(c)4 group will play in races that feature a stark choice between \u201cpro-climate action\u201d candidates \u2013 all Democrats \u2013 and \u201canti-science\u201d Republicans who have questioned the veracity of climate change or supported the interests of the oil and gas industry. GOP candidates in the NextGen cross hairs \u2013 Scott in Florida, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan, Scott Brown in New Hampshire and Cory Gardner in Colorado \u2013 hew closely to the \u201cRepublican troglodyte brand,\u201d Lehane argued. \u201cThey are anti-immigrant, anti-women, anti-science,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough brand to win elections around.\u201d The group said that climate can be successfully used as a wedge issue \u2013 Lehane framed it as a moral clash between \u201cright and wrong\u201d \u2013 to boost turnout among Democratic voting groups that tend not to show up in midterm election years, specifically young voters, Hispanics and African-Americans. Cutter presses Graham on climate change Climate change is here Climate change in the Northeast As in the Virginia governor\u2019s race last year \u2013 when Steyer spent nearly $8 million on a campaign to disqualify GOP nominee Ken Cuccinelli with a combination of TV, mail and field operations \u2013 the efforts will extend beyond the TV airwaves and include what they call \u201cnano-targeting\u201d to tailor messaging to discrete voting groups. \u201cWe are not some super PAC that\u2019s going to come in, throw up some ads and leave,\u201d Lehane said. \u201cYou can come into these states and really run a total campaign.\u201d Focusing on hyper-local issues Lehane said the effort, which is budgeted at around $100 million but could grow, will focus attention on hyper-local issues \u2013 such as drought in Iowa or flood insurance costs in Florida \u2013 that could influence voter perceptions in key pockets of each state. Pollution-related health concerns such as asthma and clean drinking water hit home for lower-income voters, he said. It wasn\u2019t lost on reporters that the NextGen map featured multiple states that figure prominently in presidential races \u2013 Iowa, New Hampshire and Florida among them. Lehane said that was by design. \u201cAlmost all of these states align with being really important presidential states either in the primary process or the general election,\u201d he said, promising that Steyer will be active throughout the 2016 campaign. When the 2016 presidential primary campaigns lurch into overdrive next year, NextGen will continue to call attention to turnout-driving local issues \u2013 and on attacking Republican candidates. Steyer has already funded an ad in Florida attacking Sen. Marco Rubio, one of many possible GOP White House aspirants, as a tool of oil lobbyists. \u201cWe look forward to a conversation with the Rubios of the world,\u201d Lehane said of the group\u2019s 2016 plans, without revealing specifics. The outside air cover should come as welcome news to Democratic candidates in their target states who are drowning in a flood of TV ads from conservative groups such as the Koch-endorsed Americans for Prosperity. But the campaign may put some Democrats in a bind. In Colorado, for instance, Lehane said NextGen will attack Gardner by showcasing his support for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and the adverse health effects of natural gas extraction on suburban communities. But the strategy could force Democratic Sen. Mark Udall to take a definitive stand on a divisive state issue that pits the business community against environmentalists, an important slice of the Democratic base. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s Democrat governor, John Hickenlooper, has been cautiously supportive of the gas industry as a revenue and jobs creator. Charges of hypocrisy Ann Coulter defends Pat Sajak tweets Sajak climate change tweet causes stir Should fracking be legal in California? As the founder of the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, Steyer made part of his fortune from investments in fossil fuels, including foreign coal investments, which has prompted charges of hypocrisy from the Koch-affiliated groups he\u2019s fond of condemning. \u201cTom Steyer\u2019s investments at Farallon have lined his pockets with millions of dollars from the foreign coal industry,\u201d said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, the Koch-backed political network. \u201cNow he wants to burden the American people with new energy regulations to protect his current green energy investments. He\u2019s already attempting to buy the votes of Senate Democrats on Keystone, which will cost America thousands of good-paying jobs. Surely the media will call him out on the hypocrisy of his claims.\u201d Lehane said Steyer ordered his investments be diverted from coal and tar sands when he stepped down from Farallon in 2012 but was not aware if he had investments in other energy sectors. But the primary difference between Steyer and conservative mega-donors, Lehane said, is that Steyer is not personally profiting from his political efforts. \u201cHe is giving all the money away,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have stand to gain some economic benefit by spending money that translates into his own personal economics.\u201d Lehane added, \u201cWe are spending a drop in the big oil bucket as compared to the fossil fuel industry, especially the Koch brothers. All Tom is trying to do is try to balance and level the playing field. We are never going to have as much money as the other side.\u201d",

            "article_content": "An RNC committe referred to Hillary Clinton as \"she who should not be named\" RNC member: \"It is a party of one giant and a bunch of elves\" who might challenge her In a recent poll, 65% of Democrats said Clinton would be their choice for 2016 S.C. GOP chair: \"We are doing everything we can do to define her early\" Even though it was Republican party leaders meeting in Washington this week, Hillary Clinton might as well have been there. Does Obama secretly support Hillary Clinton for 2016? In the halls between Republican National Committee meetings, the former secretary of state\u2019s name came up in conversation regularly. At a rules committee meeting on Thursday night, Clinton \u2013 the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 \u2013 was referred to as \u201cshe who should not be named.\u201d And at the powwow\u2019s most-watched events, Republicans pledged a laser-like focus on winning back the White House in 2016. It seems as much as some Democrats are trying to fight the coronation of Clinton as their inevitable presidential candidate, most Republican bigwigs in Washington admitted they believe that all roads to the White House go through Clinton. \u201cI think it is the most realistic assessment,\u201d said Steve Duprey, national committeeman from New Hampshire. \u201cIt is a party of one giant and a bunch of elves who might be running against her.\u201d \u201cShe has a political organization, she has the history, she has respect from being a senator, first lady, secretary of state, I think it is just prudent for the Republicans to assume she is the nominee and frankly I think it helps focus people,\u201d he added. 'Being a planetary body seems respectful' Hillary, Benghazi and 2016 Hillary Clinton under fire for Benghazi Major Obama group will now push for Hillary Clinton And Republicans aren\u2019t wrong about Clinton\u2019s front-runner status \u2013 Clinton has topped every poll taken about Democrats for 2016. In the latest Quinnipiac University poll, 65% of Democrats said Clinton would be their choice for the nomination. Vice President Joe Biden was in second with 8%, a whopping 57 points lower. \u201cVirtually none of the other Democrats could beat her,\u201d said Saul Anuzis, the former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. \u201cNow, lots of things could happen, but I think most Republicans assume we are going to run against her.\u201d Since leaving the State Department in 2013, the former secretary of state kept up an active schedule, collecting paychecks on the corporate speaking circuit and picking up hardware at award ceremonies across the country. Hillary Clinton set for California swing in April Democratic groups have begun lining up behind her possible candidacy in 2016. In addition to groups like Ready for Hillary and Emily\u2019s List \u2013 two pro-Clinton fundraising machines \u2013 the liberal Priorities USA moved this week to get behind Clinton and announced they will begin raising big money to help elect Clinton to the White House. The one issue: Clinton has publicly said she is only mulling whether to run for president. Late last year, Clinton said she would decide whether to run or not by the end of this year. Clinton's Benghazi troubles aren't over Would Gates support Clinton for Pres.? Hamby: Iowa Dems not in love with Hillary In touting Clinton as the inevitable candidate, Republicans have both heaped praise on her \u2013 \u201cShe has a first-rate organization,\u201d Duprey said \u2013 and tested out attack lines. \u201cWe are doing everything we can do to define her early,\u201d Matt Moore, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, said about Clinton, who he described as the \u201cmother of Obamacare.\u201d \u201cShe is an opportunistic person who has been running for president for 20 years.\u201d Moore said the ability to focus on Clinton almost three years out from election day means that the narrative Republicans will push has more time to take hold. Moore sees a parallel between Clinton in 2016 and Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012. \u201cThe trouble we had in 2012 was that our nominee was defined really early over a five- or six-year period and it was hard to break through theses presuppositions,\u201d he said. He added, for that reason, Republicans \u201care preparing in South Carolina and elsewhere that she is the nominee.\u201d Clinton cover gets buzz, criticism Stop Hillary PAC asks for investigation into pro-Hillary group Adviser defends Clinton amid Benghazi criticism GOP turns new fire on Clinton after Benghazi report Hillary Clinton\u2019s Iowa problem",

            "article_content": "GOP is making gains in technology Democrats still have tech advantage and aren't worried about 2014 losses The nerds are all right. The technologists who built the Democratic Party\u2019s data-driven approach to campaigning are saddened by the results of the 2014 midterms, a political drubbing that not even even the sharpest get-out-the-vote operation could prevent. But they are taking heart in a durable truth: Even as Republicans made impressive strides in digital and data-driven campaigning in 2014, Democrats retain a culture of innovation and an army of campaign geeks that far outpaces their GOP foes. Hambycast: Louisiana Senate Runoff Look Who's Coming to Dinner Will these people pick your president? Could Rand Paul support gay marriage? The luckiest mustache in Iowa \u201cIt goes back to the Obama campaign of 2008, but even before that,\u201d said Tom Bonier, CEO of the Democratic data firm TargetSmart. \u201cSo many people came out of the woodwork in that campaign, people with PhDs, statisticians, programmers, developers, people who ran tech-start ups. A lot of them went back to their jobs, but so many of them stayed around. They created new companies, they worked on the 2012 campaign, they work at the party committees. They are everywhere.\u201d Republicans have gloated about their advancements in campaign science since being infamously outclassed by President Barack Obama\u2019s voter turnout operation in 2012. After a much better year in 2014, they point with pride to new data programs that allowed GOP campaigns to better identify and persuade voters. \u201cDemocrats were telling reporters all the way up to Election Day that their data would be the difference and they would keep the Senate,\u201d said Chuck DeFeo, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chief digital officer. \u201cAs a Republican, I\u2019m glad to hear that they still believe in their data advantage and look forward to 2016.\u201d But even the GOP\u2019s top digital strategists continue look with envy at the technological ecosystem that Democrats and their allies have constructed over the course of a decade. \u201cThey are a couple steps ahead in technology, but light years ahead in culture,\u201d said Wesley Donehue, the president of Push Digital, a Republican communications firm. \u201cDemocrats put a larger emphasis on digital and data and technology, they put more money into it, they are better at sharing it. Republicans are much more guarded in sharing their resources.\u201d Culture gap The culture gap on vivid display this month at RootsCamp, a two-day \u201cun-conference\u201d \u2014 their phrase \u2014 of more than 2,500 progressive activists and campaign pros who gather yearly in Washington to drink, talk shop and swap lessons from the election season that was. There is nothing like it on the right. One fearful Republican blogger called it \u201cThe Left\u2019s New Death Star.\u201d The gathering \u2014 run by the New Organizing Institute, a progressive outfit that trains activists and operatives in the fields of data, digital and organizing \u2014 has blossomed since its heady inception in 2006. Back then, when \u201cnetroots\u201d activists were demanding a seat at the Democratic Party table after John Kerry\u2019s presidential loss, the event was an amateurish meet-up of some 200 web-obsessed Democrats who convened in coffee shops and college classrooms in Washington, Brooklyn, and Denver to plot strategy. Today, RootsCamp feels like a Vegas tech expo for Democrats. Participants at the Washington Convention Center wandered through a job fair that showcased vendors, labor unions, data houses and political committees from across the progressive spectrum. AFSCME, SEIU, Emily\u2019s List, MoveOn.org, ActBlue, Civis Analytics, BlueState Digital, NGP VAN, Salsa Labs, Mobile Commons, the Analyst Institute, Catalist \u2014 all of them were eagerly swapping business cards with the next generation of Democratic whiz kids. Panels and training sessions starred political directors and digital gurus from the Democratic National Committee, Planned Parenthood, NextGen Climate, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee who walked audience members \u2014 many of them field organizers and young digital staffers from various midterm races \u2014 through the micro-tactics that worked in 2014 and the ones that didn\u2019t. One official from NextGen, the environmental group founded by Bay Area billionaire Tom Steyer, told a room that the group identified over 350,000 \u201cclimate action\u201d voters with the help of five in-house data staffers and a rigorous field program. The organization ran 21 field experiments this cycle, testing whether black-and-white mail worked better than color, or if combining messages (\u201cclimate and choice\u201d) in certain states made a bigger impact on voters than climate-messaging alone (it did). The unapologetically dorky breakout sessions had titles like \u201cOMG! SMS for GOTV\u201d and \u201cSimple tricks to up your A/B testing game.\u201d One pink-clad speaker took to a podium to recruit female attendees to the free \u201cwomen-only\u201d coding classes she was running. In the hallways between panels, conversations could seem downright exotic to the untrained ear, as conference-goers joked about \u201cROC curves\u201d and \u201csucky U.I.s.\u201d While Democrats on Capitol Hill were debating a controversial omnibus spending bill that threatened to keep Congress in town through Christmas, the Democrats at RootsCamp were still focused on the nitty-gritty of campaign life, trying to work out the bugs before 2016 and find the best ways to streamline the software platforms, user interfaces and voter data that campaigns now rely on. If anyone had hang-ups about revealing their hard-earned intel to potential competitors, they weren\u2019t talking. Information-sharing, the thinking at RootsCamp goes, isn\u2019t just good for Democrats at the ballot box \u2014 it\u2019s good for business. Annie Wang, a data scientist from Civis Analytics, a targeting firm born out of Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, was one of dozens of presenters at the conference promoting products that make campaigning easier and more efficient. \u2018Democratize data science\u2019 \u201cWe are trying to democratize data science, so that organizers throughout the progressive universe can have these data tools at their disposal,\u201d Wang told an eager crowd during a plenary session called \u201cDisrupt 2016.\u201d Across town at DNC Headquarters, national party officials tapped the assembled brain power for a day-long post-mortem with over thirty digital directors and data scientists from state Democratic parties and some of the year\u2019s biggest Senate and gubernatorial campaigns, including those of Wendy Davis, Charlie Crist, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Michelle Nunn. The election results were chastening for the Democratic tech community, said Matt Compton, the DNC\u2019s digital director. \u201cIt was a very strong reminder that even the best organizing in the world really only has an impact on the margins,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that atmospheres still matter, and the American people will have their say regardless of technology you are going to produce.\u201d But Compton said the party\u2019s geek squad won, in a sense, by losing. He gushed over the ability of Democrats to \u201cscale down\u201d the tactics of the 2012 presidential campaign to the statewide and congressional level without having the kind of big budget that Obama relied on. And importantly, Compton said, running from behind forces campaigns to re-think their strategies and test new tools and methods. \u201cIf you are behind, you are willing to take more risks, to do things you were not willing to try before,\u201d Compton said.  \u201cIf you are in a really tight race, that means that your budget constraints can be tighter and that sometimes forces you to bring more things in-house or to look for things that can be more efficient, or develop a tool that\u2019s going to help you save money.\u201d He pointed specifically to the campaigns of Nunn in Georgia, which polished their online fundraising practices by matching their email list against Facebook and testing how potential donors responded to various messages, and the Crist campaign in Florida, which invented a new tool that helped Democrats sign up online to vote by mail. The Crist campaign tool would check a voter\u2019s submission on CharlieCrist.com against the voter file at the DNC to make sure their address matched their voter registration. If it did, an email was sent from the voter\u2019s email to address to the local supervisor of elections to request a ballot. \u201cNo printing, no stamps, nada,\u201d said Amanda Litman, the campaign\u2019s digital director. In the end, nearly 20,000 Florida voters obtained ballots using the tool. Litman said their models showed most of them were sporadic voters. \u201cDemocrats this cycle may have lost, but we raised the bar on what statewide and down-ballot races can accomplish online,\u201d Litman said. \u201cWe worked together to innovate, test, share best practices, and build a stronger network and pipeline of talent.\u201d Kassia DeVorsey, an MIT-educated analytics specialist who was one of the \u201ccave dwellers\u201d in the Obama campaign\u2019s dimly-lit Chicago data office, estimated that Democratic campaigns around the country had about 100 data scientists working on their races, with another 100 doing work on independent expenditures and issue campaigns. None of them were rookies. \u201cThese are folks with rich experience with data tools,\u201d she said. But DeVorsey and others who came to Washington for RootsCamp stressed, over and over again, that nothing in campaign politics is static. Republicans continue to innovate, issues change, and the technology and data that campaigns rely on is always evolving \u2014 from Facebook\u2019s API to the information contained in the Democrats\u2019 national voter file. \u201cOur tools are only as good and useful as they can be used in practice,\u201d DeVorsey said. \u201cIf we spend a lot of time creating the most the awesome Phillips head screwdriver and what organizers really need is a flat-head, then we have completely failed at our mission \u2026 The ongoing commitment on the Democratic side to testing will really help optimize things going forward.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Democratic National Committee on Thursday announced the members of its panel tasked with reviewing the party\u2019s devastating midterm election losses and suggest improvements going forward. The 11-member Democratic Victory Task Force includes representatives from key Democratic constituencies, including union, Latino and women\u2019s rights groups, as well as operatives and elected officials from three of the states where Democrats their unexpected losses. Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and Naomi Aberly, a board member of Planned Parenthood Federation of America with ties to a number of women\u2019s rights groups, have both been appointed to the task force. Their appointments are a nod to the fact that Democrats drew slimmer-than-expected wins among female voters and lower enthusiasm among unions this cycle. It also includes Google head Eric Schmidt and Teddy Goff, the digital director for President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, hinting that the task force plans to investigate two traditional Democratic strengths that seemingly failed the party this cycle: Their data and digital operations. And Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, Colorado Democratic Party Chairman Rick Palacio and Donna Brazile, a Democratic strategist with Louisiana roots, are all bringing perspectives from states where Democrats unexpectedly lost, like Colorado, or suffered unexpectedly devastating defeats, like Kentucky and, if public polling holds through the Senate runoff there, Louisiana. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the committee hopes to work with the group \u201cto build on what we\u2019ve done that works, identify and prioritize challenges and ultimately improve our party\u2019s performance in future elections.\u201d \u201cThis diverse group of Democratic Party officials, strategists and advocates will each bring with them expertise from their fields to collaborate on a holistic review of the Party\u2019s past performance and present actionable areas for improvement moving forward,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton both spent Thursday campaigning Romney has left the door open to another presidential bid Foreign policy and women's issues could dominate a Clinton-Romney race Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton are back on the campaign trail. Romney was in Kentucky on Thursday stumping for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell while Clinton flew to Florida to campaign for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist. The trips come amid intense speculation over how the 2016 presidential ticket might shape up. While it\u2019s unlikely Romney will run, he\u2019s leaving the door open a tiny crack to a third campaign. Meanwhile, of course, everyone is watching Clinton for signs that she might join the race \u2013 and she\u2019s doing little to discourage the attention. Hillary's madcap media mob Live from New York: It's Baby Charlotte Romney: Obama 'busy doing other things' The 2016 contest is far from a lock. But if the race came down to two leaders who have already run for president, would there be any surprises? Luckily, with two figures who have spent so many years in the public view, we have an idea of what a Romney-Clinton match up might look like.  Here are some areas that would be interesting to watch: Russia Critics have faulted Clinton for failing as secretary of state to foresee growing tensions between the U.S. and Russia. As secretary, Clinton famously offered her Russian counterpart a \u201creset\u201d button meant to show the two countries were looking to cooperate more. But President Putin\u2019s incursion into Ukraine and his support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the country\u2019s bloody civil war, both of which occurred after Clinton stepped down, have chilled the relationship Clinton hoped would thaw. Enter Romney, who was mocked after calling Russia the United States\u2019 \u201cnumber one geopolitical foe\u201d during an interview with CNN in 2012. At the time, Clinton called his remarks \u201cdated.\u201d Romney struck back in an interview with Fox this summer, calling Clinton\u2019s reset button \u201cone of the most embarrassing incidents in American foreign policy.\u201d Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist who worked on Clinton\u2019s 2008 effort, underlined the former secretary of state\u2019s real world foreign policy experience. \u201cAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has a foreign policy record,\u201d Sefl said. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure what Mitt Romney has besides campaign positions.\u201d What about gaffes? Romney famously made his 2012 effort more difficult with a series of inopportune remarks that Democrats used to paint him as out-of-touch. From the \u201ccouple of Cadillacs\u201d he said his wife owned, to the 47 percent of Americans he said were dependent on government, to his offhand remark that \u201cI like being able to fire people\u201d who provide bad service, Romney handed opponents an opening. But while promoting her book \u201cHard Choices\u201d this summer, Clinton made some missteps of her own. The former first lady said she and her husband were \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left the White House in 2001. Earlier this year, she told an audience in New Orleans that she had not driven a car since 1996 because of Secret Service concerns. Were Romney to run again, Clinton\u2019s stumbles might help inoculate him against the same criticism he faced over his wealth during his two previous campaigns. A former Romney aide suggested Romney\u2019s more recent campaign trail experience would make him more comfortable on the stump. \u201cShe\u2019s rusty,\u201d former Romney 2012 spokesman Ryan Williams said of Clinton. \u201cGov. Romney has been through two campaigns at this point. He\u2019s been out on the campaign trail campaigning for midterm candidates. She certainly would have a steeper learning curve.\u201d Hillary Clinton talks about own mother Mitt Romney to the rescue? Mitt Romney says 'no' to 2016 Clinton has granted dozens of press interviews and given many speeches to public and private groups. But she hasn\u2019t crisscrossed the country campaigning with midterm candidates like Romney. That potential advantage could extend to presidential debates. Romney shot up in the polls after surprising President Obama in their first one-on-one debate in October 2012. Clinton hasn\u2019t gone through that grueling experience since 2008. But CNN Senior Political Analyst and National Journal Editorial Director Ron Brownstein said Romney would be hard pressed to shake the sense of some voters that he doesn\u2019t understand them. \u201cIt was really about him embodying the guy who came to your town and shut down the plant. I still think that\u2019s there,\u201d Brownstein said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Romney gets away from that no matter who he\u2019s running against.\u201d Women In 2008, Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign sparked tremendous enthusiasm among women voters and put 18 million cracks in the \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling.\u201d She continued her work on issues affecting women and girls at the State Department and through her family\u2019s philanthropic arm, the Clinton Foundation. Romney struggled with women voters in 2012, with 55% of women supporting President Obama. Clinton has the potential to grow Democratic support even among women who supported Romney during the last election. \u201cShe is just extremely well positioned to exploit the demographic vulnerabilities of the Republican Party,\u201d Brownstein said, pointing to GOP support for the Hobby Lobby case on employer funded birth control and state level funding cuts for Planned Parenthood programs. Clinton supporters point to her focus in public remarks on pocketbook issues such as equal pay and affordable childcare, saying those issues have already resonated with voters. \u201cI fail to see anyone in the GOP that has either articulated an alternative or that embodies remotely the same amount of excitement and enthusiasm as Hillary does today,\u201d Sefl said. Message Recent public remarks from Romney and Clinton give a few hints at how they might try to appeal to voters should they launch a presidential campaign. Clinton has spoken about creating more opportunities for women and girls at a variety of public and political events, in what some analysts have heard as a possible campaign theme. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone dismiss what you\u2019re doing here today as women\u2019s work,\u201d Clinton told an audience at the Democratic Women\u2019s Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C. in September. \u201cWe\u2019re here proud Democratic women and proud Democratic men, to stand up not just ourselves, not just for women but for all our people - for our families, our communities and our country.\u201d Clinton also would enjoy the support and enthusiasm of a handful of outside political groups like the super PAC Ready For Hillary that have sprouted up purely to fuel her potential candidacy. As for Romney, his message could be something like: \u201chaving second (or third) thoughts now?\u201d On that theme, he told an audience in Colorado this week that President Obama should have taken the terrorist group ISIS more seriously earlier. \u201cFor the president to say, \u2018Gee, we underestimated ISIS\u2019 suggests he wasn\u2019t looking at the kinds of ideas that were being brought to him,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI guess he was busy doing other things \u2013 vacations, golf, fundraising. He just hasn\u2019t done the job he promised to do.\u201d A CNN/ORC poll from July found that 53% of Americans would support Romney over President Obama if they could vote again today. (In a hypothetical match up with Clinton, however, 55% would have supported Clinton, with 42% for Romney.) Romney supporters argue the former candidate seemed prescient on a variety of issues. \u201cHe brings a proven track record of being forward thinking and having the ability to recognize problems and threats before they become a disaster,\u201d Williams, his former spokesman, said. But while the upcoming presidential election may center on change, both Clinton and Romney could find themselves talking a lot about their experience. \u201cYou\u2019ve also got to have people who\u2019ve actually run something,\u201d Romney told Fox News in September. \u201cI don\u2019t think Hillary Clinton has that experience.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ro Khanna wants to apply the power of technology to radically improve politics Khanna is running for Congress in a district that encompasses tech giants Fellow Democrat Mike Honda has represented district for seven terms Ro Khanna wants a show of hands. \u201cHow many of you have heard of LinkedIn?\u201d The 37-year-old Indian-American Democrat, the darling of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech elite and a vehicle for their budding engagement with Washington, is addressing a cafeteria full of advanced placement government students at Cupertino High School. Most of them are Indian or Asian-American, the sons and daughters of the programmers and tech company employees who populate this neatly manicured California town where Apple is based. What we learned from Florida-13 Khanna launches into a riff about LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and the power of technology to radically improve business and society. Khanna thinks he can apply similar lessons to politics. Sanders on Hillary Clinton 2016 Crist: Senate dems should back Obama Democrats push for minimum wage hike \u201cWe have to disrupt the system,\u201d Khanna says of Washington, criticizing that notoriously inefficient town on the other side of the country. The nod to innovation is typical of Khanna\u2019s stump speeches across California\u2019s 17th Congressional District, a majority Asian-American district that encompasses the heart of Silicon Valley and is home to some its most famous companies, including Cisco, Yahoo and Intel. Khanna, a lawyer, Stanford economics professor and former trade official under President Barack Obama, is an evangelist for the thriving tech economy based here. Consequently, he\u2019s also the favorite son of its wealthiest visionaries. Khanna\u2019s list of financial contributors reads like a Bay Area society magazine: Sheryl Sandberg, Shawn Parker, Marissa Mayer, Marc Andreessen and John Doerr are among the executives and venture capitalists backing his campaign. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt is on board. So is California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, himself an advocate for using technology to streamline government. Khanna has raised more than $3 million since announcing his bid last year. Democrats try to increase pressure on unemployment benefits \u2018It\u2019s like a startup!\u2019 \u201cWhat is the biggest difference between Silicon Valley and Washington?\u201d Khanna asks the Cupertino students. \u201cThe biggest difference is that here, there is a sense that failure is OK. Risk-taking is OK. It\u2019s only here in Silicon Valley where I said to different people, \u2018I am running against a seven-term incumbent, here is my plan and here is how I\u2019m going to win,\u2019 and they said, \u2018That makes perfect sense! It\u2019s like a startup!\u2019\u201d As with many of the conversations with entrepreneurs in and around San Francisco these days, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in Khanna\u2019s optimism and his faith in the promise of technology to change the world. It\u2019s also hard to miss their considerable self-regard. But one Cupertino student, Saul Fuhrmann, raises his hand and brings the conversation back down to earth with a seemingly simple question that will ultimately determine whether Silicon Valley can install one of its own in Washington. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Mike Honda?\u201d he asks. Does raising the minimum wage cost jobs? Cupp: \"Dems are playing small ball\" Is McConnell in trouble? Honda is the 72-year-old, seven-term incumbent Khanna is trying to unseat. He\u2019s also a widely admired fellow Democrat who has done next to nothing to offend voters here since his election in 2000, though the district was re-drawn in 2010 and includes plenty of Republicans and independents. With California\u2019s new \u201ctop-two\u201d nonpartisan primary system, Khanna and Honda are primed to face off, Democrat-on-Democrat, in the general election this November if both emerge, as expected, as the top finishers in June\u2019s primary. Unlike former California Rep. Pete Stark, the irascible Democratic congressman Khanna considered challenging in 2012 before shying away, Honda is almost universally regarded as a nice guy and a loyal party soldier. Clinton campaign could cost $1.7 billion Honda\u2019s allies are bewildered by Khanna\u2019s attempt to boot him from office. \u201cRo does not have a good reason against Mike,\u201d says Ben Field of the South Bay AFL-CIO Labor Council, a coalition of unions that is backing Honda. \u201cHis reason for running against Mike is that he wants to be in Congress. That\u2019s not a good enough reason.\u201d Money, youth and technology vs. old-school power structure Khanna\u2019s campaign is not just a test of Silicon Valley\u2019s nascent efforts to stake a claim on the American political process. It also presents a more basic political challenge: Are money, youth and technology enough to overcome the old-school power structures of the Democratic Party? Honda has the full-throated support of the region\u2019s Democratic infrastructure \u2013 a constellation of interest groups, labor organizations and local activists who look at Khanna and see a group of millionaire and billionaire business leaders trying to purchase a seat in Congress. Of particular worry are Khanna donors like Peter Thiel, the libertarian-leaning hedge fund manager, and JetBlue chairman Joel Peterson, who have given money to Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The financial muscle of Silicon Valley Democrats, socially liberal but staunchly pro-business and skeptical of institutions,  has been a growing source of anxiety for old-line party regulars in California. \u201cWe want labor Democrats, not business Democrats!\u201d San Francisco Labor Council chief Tim Paulson declared at last weekend\u2019s California Democratic Party convention. The remark drew noisy cheers from delegates, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Did GOP take wind out of Dems' sails? Rep. Ryan: The left is exhausted Obama: GOP scared of immigration blowback On Monday, the state party officially endorsed Honda. It joined a raft of other Democratic groups in doing so, including Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, Daily Kos, MoveOn.org, a range of labor unions and grass-roots liberal organizations like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and the Howard Dean-founded Democracy For America. \u201cWe don\u2019t need corporate Democrats,\u201d says Charles Chamberlain, Democracy For America\u2019s executive director.  \u201cThere is no reason to replace Mike. It\u2019s like the tech industry is trying to buy a seat in Congress with Ro, and that\u2019s unacceptable. Google has enough representation in Congress.\u201d The thought leader on technology for Congress Ask Khanna and his supporters what\u2019s wrong with Honda, and the answer is usually something along the lines of, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal.\u201d Khanna says Honda is \u201ca good person and a nice man with many years of public service that I respect.\u201d Khanna argues the face of the district has evolved dramatically since Honda\u2019s first election 14 years ago, and that it\u2019s time for a leader who understands that the fertile and hilly communities of Sunnyvale, Cupertino and Santa Clara have become ground zero for American economic innovation. The most important poll number in 2014 \u201cWhoever represents Silicon Valley should really be deeply knowledgeable on the technology and innovation agenda,\u201d said GRAMMY Foundation chairman Rusty Rueff, a startup investor and philanthropist backing Khanna.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand cars you shouldn\u2019t be representing Detroit or Michigan. Whoever sits in this seat instantly becomes the thought leader for all the rest of Congress as it relates to technology: the policy, the law, the strategy.\u201d Not all of Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurs are lining up behind Khanna. \u201cIt is not a monolithic community,\u201d says Dilawar Syed, the founder of a Menlo Park-based social media company who supports Honda. The congressman, he says, \u201chas stuck his neck out for people on the margins who are ignored.\u201d \u201cThe valley has an allure of innovation and wealth,\u201d Syed explains. \u201cWe are leading the charge globally in innovation. But we don\u2019t want an environment that is not a level playing field. Anybody can speak the language of Silicon Valley. So does Paul Ryan. But it\u2019s about getting things done and Mike has.\u201d Transportation, education and income inequality are dominant issues here. Cost of living and real estate prices have skyrocketed, fueled in large part by the tech boom. \u2018Holistic\u2019 differences in visions Khanna says his campaign is less about substantive policy disputes with Honda \u2014 \u201con specific votes, on minimum wage, we\u2019d probably vote the same way,\u201d he explains \u2014 than the \u201cholistic\u201d differences in their vision. \u201cI don\u2019t think Honda has thought through and put forward a coherent economic vision for the district,\u201d Khanna says. Should schools teach coding in the classroom? How do we grapple with globalization? How do you replace low-skill jobs lost to automation? Khanna says he has the answers. \u201cMike Honda has not really been part of the innovation economy,\u201d he explains. \u201cI don\u2019t think he senses the skills of what people are going to need.\u201d Khanna, who wrote a book about manufacturing after leaving Obama\u2019s Commerce Department in 2011, criticizes \u201cthe reflexive bashing of outsourcing and protectionist sentiment against embracing the global economy. We have to understand that\u2019s inevitable, and figure out out how we\u2019re going to transition into that global economy.\u201d This is the kind of pro-business rhetoric that worries the organized labor forces backing Honda\u2019s supporters. But Honda is also bothered personally by Khanna\u2019s challenge, which people around him describe as nothing short of betrayal. Khanna\u2019s ambition is no secret. In 2004, at age 27, he ran against the late Rep. Tom Lantos as an antiwar candidate but was thoroughly trounced by the congressional veteran. Khanna then considered challenging Stark in 2012, only to back away. Stark ended up losing to another Democrat, Eric Swalwell, leaving Khanna with no path up the political food chain. As he wrestled with his future, Khanna sought advice from Honda, who has counseled other young political leaders in the district.  He once e-mailed a Honda staffer after meeting with the congressman in 2010, calling Honda \u201cone of my closest mentors.\u201d \u201cYou both have been so encouraging and supportive for the past eight years in helping guide my career in public service,\u201d Khanna wrote in one e-mail obtained by CNN. If Honda is trying to diminish Khanna as a man-in-a-hurry, the Khanna campaign is happy to have the fight. It sees the race as a generational clash as much as a stylistic one. \u2018Now it\u2019s time for others to take a turn\u2019 \u201cIf you look around there are a hell of a lot of people from a certain generation in Congress who are saying, \u2018You know, I have done good things, I am proud of my record, and it\u2019s now time for others to take a turn,\u2019 \u201d says Larry Grisolano, Khanna\u2019s Chicago-based media consultant. \u201cWhether that\u2019s Henry Waxman or John Dingell, senior members are saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to move on.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that turnover is a bad thing at all. The electorate says we are interested in trying somebody new.\u201d Khanna, with his deep pockets and knack for creating media buzz, is setting the terms of the campaign conversation, most recently grabbing attention for his opposition to the proposed merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Honda came out against it after Khanna did. Khanna\u2019s ability to drive the narrative has been helped by the fact that Honda has so far refused to participate in media-sponsored debates. Nor is Honda keen on taking questions from reporters; his campaign passed on several of CNN\u2019s requests for an interview. Adding to the Khanna buzz: His core group of advisers is staffed with veterans of Obama\u2019s data-driven campaign organization, including Grisolano, who plans to leverage the same granular-level television ad targeting used during the 2012 presidential campaign, and field maestro Jeremy Bird. The metric-based campaign has built a staggering field operation for a House campaign, splitting the district into six regions with six regional vote directors. Almost 450 campaign volunteers have been identified. The campaign has hosted more than 120 meet-and-greets. It has in-language websites and phone banks in Chinese, Spanish and Vietnamese, aimed at the district\u2019s diverse population. And Khanna himself is a relentless canvasser, having knocked on more than 2,100 doors on his own. Honda\u2019s organized labor allies boast of their own turnout machinery. \u201cWe always have a large field operation as well as a mail program,\u201d said Field, the South Bay AFL-CIO officer. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest and most sophisticated field program around. We will contact well over 100,000 voters in the spring alone.\u201d Tony Alexander, a lifelong Silicon Valley resident and the political director of a local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, says he plans to walk precincts, raise money and \u201ctalk positively\u201d about Honda at every turn. \u201cI have met Ro, I\u2019ve talked to Ro, I like Ro,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cBut Mike is a progressive. We have worked with him. I am going to fight for Mike Honda because I believe in him.\u201d",
