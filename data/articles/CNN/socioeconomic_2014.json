            "article_content": "A small group of Obama supporters helped the president win re-election in Iowa Democrats have struggled to maintain grassroots enthusiasm since 2012 Democrats interested in 2016 campaigns have already courted Obamadale organizers For a small band of supercharged Democratic organizers, the pleasant Des Moines neighborhood of Beaverdale goes by another name: Obamadale. The moniker was bestowed three years ago by a motley crew of Democrats who first met as strangers over martinis at a local restaurant in the early days of President Obama\u2019s re-election bid, brought together under the aegis of the \u201cneighborhood team\u201d model that defined the campaign\u2019s bottom-up volunteer structure. Led by Kimberley Boggus, a bubbly 33-year-old nursing student, and Sam Reno, a 42-year-old no-nonsense construction crew supervisor, the platoon of volunteers eventually managed to turn out more than 700 Democrats to their local caucus precinct on a chilly January night in 2012 \u2013 and that was for an uncontested race overwhelmingly won by Obama. By November, in another show of force, \u201cwe turned out 87 percent of the Democratic voters in Beaverdale,\u201d Boggus recalled with evident pride. After the campaign, Obama\u2019s behemoth political organization became Organizing For America (OFA), but the group has struggled to maintain a coherent identity outside the president\u2019s campaigns. Obamadale, meanwhile, is a small, volunteer-run operation that learned their techniques from Obama campaign officials but has survived and flourished well past the president\u2019s re-election fight. Like a political sleeper cell, it is boosting candidates in city council and school board races and playing a key role in this year\u2019s closely-watched Iowa Senate race between Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst. Today, the tightly-knit group of about 20 organizers is one of a handful of Obama-inspired outfits like it across Iowa, an uplifting legacy point for a president who tapped the power of grassroots organizing to win the White House but now struggles with dismal approval ratings and a stalled agenda in Washington. Their talents are already sought out by Democrats thinking about running for president in 2016, and the group is considering whether to throw its weight behind one of them in the Iowa caucuses. Hillary's madcap media mob Want to be President? Convince this guy Up close with Rick Perry's Hail Mary For close watchers of the 2014 midterms, Obamadale is also an emblem of a fearsome and organic Democratic ground game in Iowa that keeps Republican strategists \u2013 who have struggled to keep pace with the Democratic Party\u2019s voter turnout machinery \u2013 awake at night. Related: Hillary Clinton 2016: Fresh start of deja vu? Though little-known outside Democratic campaign circles, Obamadale\u2019s reputation is so renowned in Iowa that several outside groups working in the state this cycle, including the Ready For Hillary super PAC and environmentalist Tom Steyer\u2019s NextGen Climate, have reached out to it for on-the-ground advice. It has also consulted on Democratic races in other parts of the state and worked on issue-based campaigns like a push to get Iowans to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThose guys know how to win elections,\u201d said Brad Anderson, the Democratic nominee for secretary of state and the Iowa state director for Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign. \u201cWhat\u2019s really impressive about Obamadale is they are deeply passionate about the issues and they have been for a long time now, but they understand more than most the strategy of political campaigns, and the importance of phone-calling and door-knocking and election law and person-to-person contact.\u201d A grassroots political force What\u2019s also remarkable about Obamadale is that it thrives independently of the state\u2019s Democratic Party infrastructure, even as it consults with the official party on strategy. It is as much a social club as a political operation, deeply embedded in the Beaverdale community and intensely loyal to one another. It IDs voters and secures early voting ballots, but Obamadale members also swap recipes, go to church together, help out when someone is sick and even take road trips together, including a 1,000-mile winter drive from Des Moines to Washington for the president\u2019s 2013 inauguration. \u201cOn a campaign you\u2019ll be in a phone bank, and it\u2019s a big room of people you don\u2019t know,\u201d Boggus said. \u201cHere, I know the person, I know their story. They are the reason I come back all the time. I miss them if they aren\u2019t around in some way. It\u2019s 100% because of Obama.\u201d Hillary Clinton: \"I'm thinking about it\" Clinton acknowledges what we all knew Sen. Bernie Sanders for President? Beaverdale is a working-class place, mostly white, heavily Catholic and rowed with picket fences and \u201cBeaverdale Bricks,\u201d small neo-Tudor homes that have made the community a draw for young families. Though only a short distance from bustling and resurgent downtown Des Moines, Beaverdale feels like its own quaint Midwestern hamlet, where neighbors chat after work in their front yards and gather in family-owned restaurants at night. The Obamadale members hail from different backgrounds and professions. One is a librarian, one a county health worker, one an office manager. Several are retired. \u201cWhat\u2019s great about them is they aren\u2019t just a bunch of 25-year-olds,\u201d said Scott Brennan, the Iowa Democratic Party chairman. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting mix of folks that crosses demographic lines and socioeconomic lines. But they are people who are completely committed to the President and committed to Democratic politics.\u201d With no defined budget, Obamadale members fund their operations out of their own pockets, work out of donated office space at a local law firm and rely on the owner of Tally\u2019s, a Beaverdale watering hole that serves a memorable ground-bacon-and-beef burger, to open up the restaurant for Democratic campaign rallies and volunteer meetings. Door-to-door canvasses are launched off the outdoor deck of Saints Bar and Grill, another Obamadale-friendly establishment in the neighborhood. Events and GOTV pushes are usually coordinated on Obamadale\u2019s Facebook group, or by phone or text. People pitch in when and where they can. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to call or canvass, but are more than willing to do postcard writing,\u201d said Tammy Keiter, a program manager at the Polk County Public Health Administration. John Judge, a mustachioed human resources director who has lived in Beaverdale for 26 years, said that his wife, also a Democrat, \u201cwas reluctant to be a part of it, but she got involved because she liked the people.\u201d Everybody's talking about... that? Harkin: 'It's a shame' \u201cWe have her doing data now,\u201d he said. Before a State of the Union watch party in January, amid below-freezing temperatures, Judge helped Reno haul a flat screen television and speakers from his basement across several icy streets into Tally\u2019s for the president\u2019s speech. It was barely 10 degrees outside, but over 110 people showed up. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have at least 100 people in attendance for an event, even at short notice, it\u2019s a failure,\u201d Reno said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of our performance standard.\u201d Their energy and loyalty to one other is admirable, but Obamadale\u2019s most prized asset, for ambitious candidates, is their impressive ability to identify and turn out voters in one of the state\u2019s biggest Democratic hubs. It\u2019s why then-congressman Braley wrote a personal letter to Boggus in 2012 thanking her for her work, and why Anderson held a rally inside Tally\u2019s on the day he announced his campaign, and why Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who is laying groundwork for a presidential campaign, stopped by Saints during a June visit to Iowa to make nice with the Obamadale crew. They gave him a bag of Iowa-shaped chocolates from Beaverdale Confectionary, and Boggus promptly posted a picture of the visit on Facebook. \u201cAny candidate running in Iowa would benefit from having them in their corner, no doubt,\u201d Anderson said. Building on Democratic campaign lists collected over the years, including some of the vaunted Obama campaign voter files obtained during the 2012 race, the Obamadale bunch runs its own data and field programs. Boggus and Reno won\u2019t put an exact number on how many voters are in their database from Polk County and other parts of the state, but they say it reaches well into the thousands. They are quick to attribute their tactical knowledge to the Obama campaign\u2019s volunteer training efforts, and the field marshals of the Obama campaign look at them, and similar groups nationwide that adopted the lessons of 2012, like proud parents would. \u201cWe invested in and trained the members of our grassroots movement on real skills,\u201d said Jeremy Bird, the Obama campaign\u2019s national field director and an original architect of their volunteer operations. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise they\u2019re now paying it forward and putting everything they learned about building people-focused, data-driven, digitally-savvy campaigns to work to support Democrats up and down the ticket in their home communities.\u201d But because of Obamadale\u2019s local relationships, its work on other races and the mom-and-pop nature of its outfit, the group says its voter intelligence in the Des Moines area is more granular and sophisticated than the larger-scale voter lists of the Obama campaign or the Iowa Democratic Party. \u201cI definitely think we learned a lot from the (Organizing For America) team model and it influenced our structure, but we went beyond it,\u201d says Reno. In addition to phone numbers, emails and voting history, Obamadale organizers know who has soccer practice on what day, who has health issues or who might have a pesky Republican whispering in their neighbor\u2019s ear \u2014 whatever factor might influence how and when a person might vote. Friends and work colleagues look to them for political tips as well. \u201cA woman on my street told me, \u2018I always wait for whatever sign you put in your front yard because I know who to vote for,\u2019\u201d Judge said. \u201cI mean, she is a college-educated, young professional. But most people are not obsessed with this stuff like we are.\u201d The Obamadale organizers have day jobs, but they sound like David Plouffe or Jim Messina when talking about the efficiencies of their political program. \u201cWhen you see these lists that come from the VAN\u201d \u2014 the Democratic Party\u2019s voter file software \u2014 \u201cthey are not the most accurate,\u201d Boggus said. \u201cSo we keep our own database of people. They are tiered up. Tier one is our core group of people, about 20 of us. Tier two, they were a little more sporadic with volunteering. Tier three, they will come to events only. Tier four, they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with volunteering, but they vote, and we make sure they do early vote.\u201d Early voting and vote-by-mail, which begins here on Thursday, was decisive in Obama\u2019s 8-point victory over Mitt Romney in Iowa in 2012. The campaign tapped their vast field organization to bank tens of thousands of Democratic votes before November, a bonanza that neutralized Republican turnout on Election Day. Schooled on the same principles, Obamadale is currently making an early vote push in Des Moines aimed at boosting Braley and other Democrats, like 3rd District congressional candidate Staci Appel and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jack Hatch. \u201cEvery good Democrat that we have ID\u2019d for our candidates, we\u2019re going to have their vote in the bank,\u201d Reno said. \u201cWe are only going to be worried about a very small number of our IDs on Election Day. And the people who traditionally have trouble getting to the polls, we are going to get them there.\u201d Want to be president? Talk to this guy Hillarydale? And other 2016 choices The next presidential race is on their minds, too. Over glasses of wine at Tally\u2019s last weekend, on the eve of Hillary Clinton\u2019s visit to the Harkin Steak Fry, members of Obamadale hashed out their opinions on the likely Democratic field. Clinton, they agreed, was the 2016 frontrunner, though they complained that she was miscast as cold and distant by the media. Clinton was somebody they all said they would consider supporting, but everyone wanted to see a competitive caucus campaign. \u201cI want to see as many people come through Iowa as possible,\u201d Boggus said. \u201cWe saw in 2008 that you can be a little-known guy with a funny name and not very much money and do amazing things because you have a ground game.\u201d They gushed over O\u2019Malley, who visited with the crew this summer. \u201cI love him,\u201d said Boggus, who was spotted at the steak fry the next day proudly waving a \u201cReady for Warren\u201d placard in support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive darling from Massachusetts. \u201cIf Elizabeth Warren and Hillary were sitting at different tables at a place like this, most people would go over and talk to Warren,\u201d said Ben Guise, a retired state employee. Reno would not rule out supporting one of the presidential candidates, though he said the decision \u201cwould have to respect everybody\u2019s ownership of the group.\u201d He said candidates would have to prove their grassroots credentials by stepping out of their comfort zones and listening to voters up close. Stopping by an Obamadale-run event or two wouldn\u2019t hurt their cause, he said. \u201cHonestly, we are doing this for free,\u201d Reno said. \u201cAnd so would have to decide who is worthy of our effort before we get behind them. We are all volunteers. Candidates need to justify the effort we give them, which includes being accessible and respecting how grassroots groups like ours can add some sanity to electoral process, by helping neighbors talk to neighbors in even-minded tones about the issues.\u201d As for the name, it seems like Obamadale is here to stay. Braleydale and Hillarydale, they said, don\u2019t roll off the tongue as easily. \u201cWe are deeply loyal to the President,\u201d Reno said.",

For local coverage of the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown and its aftermath, go to CNN affiliates KMOV, KSDK, KTVI and KPLR. Several leaders have tried to help ease tensions in the wake of the death of Michael Brown The list starts with the police chief whose officer shot Brown on August 8 On Wednesday, a prosecutor's team will seek to present the facts of the case to a grand jury Even the U.S. attorney general has stepped into the response effort As tensions in Ferguson, Missouri, have bubbled, one official after another has taken the lead, grappling to figure out how to stop it from coming to a boil. First, it was the police chief who took charge and stumbled. Then, the governor entered the picture and brought on a Ferguson son to head security. The feds have also stepped in, with Attorney General Eric Holder stopping by Wednesday to check up on their investigation. Here\u2019s a look at the players who have shaped the city\u2019s response to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, at the hands of a white police officer. WHO: Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson What he did: From the start the chief said his department \u2013 which handed off the local investigation to St. Louis County \u2013 would release information as it received it. It would be a slow process, he warned. How it played out: From the beginning the chief was slammed for just how slow that information came out. The big one was the identity of the officer. It took six days before the name \u2013 Darren Wilson \u2013 was revealed. Cops said it was because he received death threats. Critics denounced the delay as a PR stumble that coincided with another one \u2013 the release of a video that police said showed Brown robbing a store minutes before he was shot. Critics lambasted the disclosure of the video as character assassination. The chief said he had to do it. Jackson was also criticized for his department\u2019s response to the protests in the days immediately after Brown\u2019s death. As the demonstrations grew more heated, police used on the crowd tear gas, pepper bullets and what looked like stun grenades.  Some police rolled into action sitting on an armored personnel carrier. How it was received: \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble when your SWAT team is on the front line of dealing with a civil disturbance,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Russell Honor\u00e9, a CNN analyst. Jackson said police had to protect themselves and that some of the protesters were throwing fire bombs. WHO: Ferguson Mayor James Knowles What he did: The young mayor has tried to tell people unfamiliar with the town he has lived in his whole life that it\u2019s not the crucible of racial tensions it appears to be to those outside the city limits. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here 35 years. There\u2019s always been a strong African-American presence,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this kind of violence, never seen this kind of frustration or tension between the races.\u201d How it played out: The mayor has kept largely out of the spotlight, letting other officials take care of news conferences and major public appearances. Instead he\u2019s gone on one-on-one interviews and given updates on how his town reacted. How it was received: His low profile may be helping him to avert criticism over actions taken since Brown\u2019s shooting, but Knowles has been in the line of fire with other officials over the disproportionate number of white officers on the police force of his majority African-American town. He has defended the imbalance, telling the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that every time a position frees up for a new officer that the city rushes out to find an African-American to fill it. Ferguson is less successful at getting such recruits than neighboring departments, which are better at recruiting and offer higher salaries, he said. He has also come under criticism for a racial imbalance in the city council, where five of six members are white. Knowles, first elected in 2011, told the Post-Dispatch that he ran for election unopposed. WHO: Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon What he did: First he stayed out things, and when he did go, he visited the neighboring town of Florissant, not Ferguson. Then he made the decision to bring in the highway patrol. How it played out: Poorly. The violent protests were getting more violent and police were drawing more criticism for its tactics. And the media, local and national, was asking: Where\u2019s the governor? The Washington Post wrote: \u201cA week ago, Jay Nixon was a Democratic governor with a promising political future. Today, he\u2019s a guy with a rocky recent past.\u201d Once Nixon stepped into the fray, he didn\u2019t go to the shooting scene and was accused of avoiding ground zero. How it was received: Attendees interjected at a meeting Nixon held at a local church to announce a controversial curfew. They demanded he charge Wilson with murder. They accused law enforcement of triggering nightly violence with militaristic tactics. WHO: Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson What he did: When it seemed like the situation in Ferguson was doomed to grow out of control, the governor wrested oversight of the security force and gave it to Johnson, a Ferguson native. And at first it seemed the captain had turned the tide. He walked with protesters, turned a news conference into a community forum, seemed like a good guy who was a bridge between community and government. On Sunday, Johnson appeared at a church rally in support of the Johnson family. With a solemn and pained expression, he said he was sorry to the parents, and he explained that he, too, was the father of a black son who wears saggy pants and has tattoos. \u201cMy baby,\u201d he called his boy. How it played out: Johnson has been open with the public as he has been trying to calm the uneasiness in the air. And even as tension still permeates the town, residents feel a little better because they know the captain will be out there. He\u2019s one of them, and they can ask him their questions. How it was received: Well \u2013 except for minor hiccups. Johnson was welcomed with open arms last week. But security forces under his command have lobbed tear gas and stun grenades at rowdy protesters, who toss rocks and Molotov cocktails at them. That may have soured some of the initial sentiments. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper echoed the frustrations of many. \u201cAbsolutely there have been looters, absolutely over the last nine days there has been violence, but there is nothing going on in this street right now that merits this scene out of Bagram (Afghanistan). Nothing.\u201d WHO: Attorney Malik Shabazz What he did: He\u2019s the national president and founder of Black Lawyers for Justice. He has been trying to help the community stay away from rowdy elements, who he says are not from Ferguson. He told CNN on Tuesday that he came to Ferguson as a \u201cman and a father figure.\u201d He felt confident that he and others could have a good influence on young men. How it played out: Shabazz insists \u201cprovocateurs\u201d from outside the community have caused the problems. He accused them of being planted in the crowd to make demonstrators look bad and turn public opinion in favor of the police. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow this movement to be destroyed,\u201d he said. On Monday, when rocks and tear gas canisters flew, he was out with a bullhorn urging people to keep calm. How it was received: Despite Shabazz\u2019 efforts on behalf of Ferguson protesters, he has a very controversial past. The former leader of the New Black Panther Party is a black supremacist, with a history of anti-Semitic remarks, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group that guards the rights of minorities and monitors hate groups. Shabazz has often railed against white people, calling them inherently evil, the SPLC said. WHO: U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder What he did: The first black U.S. attorney general will visit Ferguson on Wednesday. He\u2019s checking up on the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights investigation into the shooting. He said he\u2019ll also meet with community leaders. The FBI has about 40 investigators in Ferguson, Holder wrote in a letter to the people of Ferguson. He says: \u201cWe hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm\u201d to the city. How it\u2019s playing out: Holder wrote that the investigation had already made good progress, but indicated it was not going to wrap up anytime soon. How it\u2019s being received: It\u2019s hard to tell yet. In civil rights issues, he is considered President Barack Obama\u2019s ambassador. Some people get nervous when they see him coming. Under Holder, the Justice Department has intensified its scrutiny of police departments, launching 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years. That\u2019s more than twice the number of such probes in the previous five years. WHO: St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch What he did: He\u2019s been the county\u2019s top prosecutor since 1991 and has been easily re-elected five times. This year, he actually had a challenger in his primary, which he handily won just a few days before Brown was killed. After Gov. Nixon replaced the St. Louis County Police with the Missouri State Highway Patrol for security last week, McCulloch said the initial law enforcement response to the shooting was excessive. McCulloch told CNN affiliate KMOV that the governor had \u201cno legal authority\u201d to make such a move. How it\u2019s playing out: McCulloch steps before a grand jury Wednesday with the assignment of making his case against Wilson. He has eyewitness accounts of Brown\u2019s shooting as well as Wilson\u2019s own account of what happened. Beyond that, much of the evidence is not yet ready, and a CNN legal analyst said it could take a long time for crime labs to process it. How it\u2019s being received: Critics have said he could be biased in favor of the man he is tasked with prosecuting. He\u2019s the son of a cop who was killed at work 50 years ago. His mother was a clerk for the St. Louis Police Department, and three relatives were also with SLMPD. He would have been an officer too, but cancer took one of his legs. Missouri State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed and 26,000 other people have signed a petition calling for McCulloch to be removed from the case \u2013 and a special prosecutor assigned. Governor Nixon has refused to do so.

            "article_content": "Republicans criticize Hillary Clinton's handling of Nigerian jihadist group Under Clinton, the State Department didn't add Boko Haram to the terror list It's not a cut-and-dried issue, argues a former State Department official The GOP attacks seek to weaken Clinton for her possible 2016 presidential run Hindsight is 20/20, they say, but some people may need backwards-looking glasses in debating whether the State Department under Hillary Clinton erred two years ago by not designating Boko Haram a terrorist group. The question arose Thursday as part of the international focus on last month\u2019s abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls by the jihadist group in northeast Nigeria that threatens to sell them into slavery. A Daily Beast article raised the issue. It quoted an anonymous U.S. official who criticized the Clinton State Department for rejecting calls in 2012 by some in Congress, the Department of Justice and others to add Boko Haram to the terror list as a threat to U.S. interests and homeland security. At the time, State Department officials argued such a move could cause more harm than good by enhancing the group\u2019s standing and making U.S. and Western interests a target of Boko Haram attacks. After Clinton stepped down and was succeeded by John Kerry, the State Department designated the group as a terrorist organization in November 2013. With global outrage and frustration over Boko Haram mounting, here are some questions and answers on what happened and why: Did Clinton drop ball with Boko Haram? Hillary Clinton's Boko Haram 'hypocrisy' Is Boko Haram a threat to U.S.? How did this all begin? In 2009, the small and scattered Boko Haram \u2013 an Islamic extremist group advocating Sharia law \u2013 killed two police officers and a soldier in an attack on a police station in Borno state. The Nigerian military responded with a brutal and indiscriminate crackdown that killed 700 people, including Boko Haram leader Mohammed Yusuf in what a congressional committee report described as an extrajudicial execution. Such violence hardened already bitter divisions between the remote and mostly Muslim northern regions of Nigeria and the southern and more Christian southern areas. A year later, Boko Haram re-emerged with a more violent profile, according to the report by the House Homeland Security Committee. The group\u2019s attacks escalated and spread beyond its northeast stronghold, including the August 2011 suicide bombing at the United Nations headquarters in Abuja, the capital, that killed 23 people. \u201cA number of factors have been attributed to fueling Boko Haram\u2019s violence and fanaticism, including a feeling of alienation from the wealthier, Christian, oil-producing southern Nigeria; pervasive poverty; rampant government corruption; heavy-handed security measures, and the belief that relations with the West are a corrupting influence,\u201d said the House panel\u2019s report compiled in November 2011. \u201cThese grievances have led to sympathy among the local Muslim population despite Boko Haram\u2019s violent tactics.\u201d What was the response? The Nigerian government continued to respond with brutal military repression, while voices in Congress warned that Boko Haram was getting support from al Qaeda affiliates elsewhere in Africa that could make it a threat beyond Nigeria. In its report, the Homeland Security Committee called for Clinton to \u201cconduct an investigation into whether Boko Haram should be designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization\u201d under federal law. Such a move \u201cmay be required to provide our intelligence and law enforcement communities the tools necessary to ensure Boko Haram does not attack U.S. interests and the U.S. homeland,\u201d the report said. A few months later, amid increasing violence by Boko Haram, the top Republicans on the panel wrote Clinton to urge its immediate terrorist designation. In a letter to the secretary, Reps. Peter King of New York and Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania cited support by the Department of Justice and military intelligence for such a step. State Department officials opposed the move, as did 24 academics with expertise in African affairs. Freed Nigerian girls speak about attack How do we track down abducted girls? 'Racing against a clock' to find girls What were the arguments? In their letter, King and Meehan said Boko Haram could be growing into an al Qaeda affiliate capable of attacking the United States. Other al Qaeda affiliates, such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb, had started as local or regional groups that became international threats, the legislators noted. Adding Boko Haram to the terror list would give U.S. intelligence, law enforcement and economic officials a wide range of tools against the group, according to King and Meehan. Opponents of the terrorist designation argued that Boko Haram posed no threat to the United States, while adding it to the terrorism list could make Washington and Western interests more of a target. A letter to Clinton by the 24 academics, including former U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria John Campbell of the Council on Foreign Relations, said a terrorist designation would raise Boko Haram\u2019s international profile and possibly link the United States to abuses by Nigerian forces cracking down on the group. \u201cSecretary Clinton\u2019s response was entirely consistent with the position of the government of Nigeria,\u201d which hired a Washington lobbying firm to oppose the foreign terrorist organization designation for Boko Haran in 2012, said Carl LeVan, an American University professor and among the academics who signed the letter. What did Clinton\u2019s State Department do? In June 2012, the State Department added three Boko Haram members to a terrorist blacklist, including Abubakar Shekau, who took over the group\u2019s leadership after Yusuf\u2019s death. Meanwhile, the Obama administration offered various types of assistance to Nigeria, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Thursday. \u201cDesignations are just one tool we use to fight terrorism,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cThere are a range of steps including under Secretary Clinton that Secretary Kerry has continued, stepping up counter-terrorism cooperation with not just the Nigerian government but other governments in Northern Africa.\u201d In a conference call with journalists Wednesday, former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson explained the thinking on whether to designate Boko Haram two years ago. \u201cThere was a concern that putting Boko Haram on the foreign terrorist list would in fact raise its profile, give it a greater publicity, give it greater credibility, help in its recruitment and also probably drive more assistance in its direction,\u201d Carson said. Such a designation provides greater access to a group\u2019s finances and more ability to limit its movements, \u201cbut none of their finances are here in the United States and none of them are coming here,\u201d he noted. Whether coincidence or not, Boko Haram has again increased its attacks since the State Department under Kerry added it to the list of terrorist organizations last November. Despite a multimillion-dollar bounty on his head, Shekau has avoided capture and Boko Haram operates with virtual impunity in northeast Nigeria and some parts of the northwest, as well as its incursions as far south as Abuja, Campbell told the Wednesday conference call. A videotape made public recently showed a man believed to be Shekau threatening to sell the recently abducted schoolgirls into slavery. Who's the man behind Nigerian kidnapping? Girls: The target for terrorists What\u2019s the fallout? The political right immediately embraced the Daily Beast story to enhance its attack line against Clinton, the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she decides to run. With Clinton polling well so far against possible GOP challengers, Republicans seek to exploit any political vulnerability they can find. They seek to use the Boko Haram case as well as the September 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, to depict Clinton as complicit in what they argue is a weakened U.S. foreign policy under President Barack Obama. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Thursday that it was \u201csad\u201d that Clinton \u201crefused calls to designate al Qaeda-linked Boko Haram as a terrorist organization.\u201d The conservative America Rising political action committee alerted journalists to the Daily Beast story when it was published, then featured it atop its website. Such attacks mimicked GOP tactics during Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign, when Republican nominee Mitt Romney criticized the administration\u2019s response to the Benghazi attack shortly after it occurred. On Boko Haram, the letter from King and Meehan to Clinton urging the group\u2019s terrorist designation came amid the campaign primaries in March 2012 as Republicans sought to weaken the President\u2019s perceived advantage over Romney on foreign policy \u2013 mostly due to the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on Obama\u2019s order. Democrats focused their comments Thursday on calls for the government to help Nigeria rescue the kidnapped schoolgirls. Clinton supporters referred journalists to the 2012 letter from the 24 academics but otherwise avoided commenting on State Department steps then. To Carson, who served under Clinton at that time, the convoluted socio-economic dynamics of Nigeria require a more holistic and nuanced approach than the security focus of anti-terrorism efforts. \u201cThis is a very complex situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know what has happened with the girls, what happened with the number of terrorist attacks that occurred, but this is being played out against a backdrop of domestic politics and lots of social and economic immiseration in the north.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jamie Crawford, Dan Merica, Elise Labott and Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: High-profile Republicans are turning their attention to poverty NEW: President Obama has shifted his attention to income inequality A low-income mother of three has worked for years to get politicians to discuss poverty Ignorance of poverty by politicians calculated to appeal to a more engaged voting bloc Tianna Gaines-Turner is so politically active, she gave 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney a questionnaire to answer on policy positions. When he failed to respond, she volunteered on President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign. She also encourages her neighbors to vote. Her activism is persistent despite feeling like she is an ignored component of the American electorate. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re not talking to me,\u201d Gaines-Turner said of politicians. That\u2019s because she is poor. Her life is not unlike those of millions of Americans who rely on a patchwork of government assistance and near-minimum wage jobs. The mother of a 9-year-old and 6-year-old twins, who was once homeless, finds herself unemployed again because her temporary job at a day care ended on December 2. Her husband makes $8.50 per hour working behind the food counter at a deli; they struggle to feed their family even with $160 per month in food stamp benefits. Opinion: Out of jobs, out of benefits, out of luck Even though she feels disconnected from the political process, Gaines-Turner is politically motivated. If politicians understood what life is like for her and her neighbors, she said, things could get better. \u201cIt\u2019s hurtful because they don\u2019t know what we go through every month,\u201d she said of politicians. Nearly 50 million live in poverty in the United States \u2013 about one out of every six people \u2013 matching or beating some of the highest poverty rates since the 1960s. But it is one of the least discussed topics in national politics. Correspondent\u2019s notebook: Hungry during the holidays An Obama pledge Well into his second term, President Barack Obama has turned his attention to poverty and income inequality. It\u2019s an issue he\u2019s rarely addressed up to this point. In key unemployment benefits vote, Democrats one vote short In his first presidential campaign, poverty was not a focus, but Obama pledged to end childhood hunger by 2015. He\u2019s far from achieving that. The year Obama made the pledge, a record 31.8 million people received supplemental food benefits. That record has been broken each year since, with more than 47 million people now in the food stamp program. While he has launched a campaign to address income inequality by urging Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and extend expired unemployment benefits, activists said Obama has done little that is substantive. But the issue was around long before Obama took office in 2008. Fifty years after President Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty, which was a central component of his 1964 campaign, poverty still affects millions of Americans. And the gap between the wealthy and the poor has grown steadily. The top 5% of households possessed 22.3% of income in 2012, compared with 16.3% in 1968, according to the Census Bureau. Moreover, a 2011 report by the Congressional Budget Office found that the top 1% of households have seen after-tax income grow by 275% since 1979, compared with 18% for the bottom 20%. Those at the low end did not keep up with inflation. The nonpartisan congressional analysts blamed unequal wage distribution and \u201cless redistributive\u201d government benefits and taxes for increased income inequality. Obama: Wage, income gap eroding American dream Just as problematic to hunger and poverty activists  \u2013 and to people like Gaines-Turner \u2013 there is almost no real discussion of issues important to them in Washington, except when they surface in periodic budget wrangling. New York mayor firm about taxing wealthy NYC mayor calls for progressive era De Blasio and return of progressivism? Crossfire: Minimum wage wars Dr. Mariana Chilton, an associate professor at Drexel University\u2019s School of Public Health and founder of the Witnesses to Hunger project focusing on \u201cmothers who know poverty first hand,\u201d said the lack of discussion is detrimental to the poor because winning candidates can\u2019t be held accountable for promises they never make. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a complete falling away of people in positions of leadership,\u201d she said. But that could change: Dealing with poverty appears to be trending like Miley Cyrus. Progressive candidates Liberals hope 2016 will be different as they push people like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president. A neophyte politician, Warren is a champion of liberal economic policies. And progressives believe the election of Democrat Bill de Blasio as mayor of New York, the world\u2019s financial capital, is a promising sign the nation may be more ready to discuss issues pertaining to poor people. A populist, de Blasio has stressed a tale of \u201ctwo cities\u201d theme that illustrated a division of rich and poor. De Blasio sworn in by Bill Clinton \u201cThe increasing interest on giving everyone in society a fair shake \u2026 could foreshadow the fact that we may be on the cusp of entering a new progressive era,\u201d said Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who worked for former President Bill Clinton and presidential candidate Al Gore. Conservatives, too But the push on poverty and income inequality might come from an unexpected corner of American politics: the conservative wing of the Republican Party. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a possible 2016 contender, is to address poverty Thursday at an event with NBC News\u2019 Brian Williams, which could be the advent of a public campaign on the issue. For the past year, he has quietly been exploring the theme. He embarked on a listening and learning tour of poor communities across the United States, according to several people who have either accompanied him or discussed it with him. Arthur Books, president of the American Enterprise Institute conservative think tank, said Ryan \u201crepresents a movement and a recognition that in the past five years, people in the bottom half have gone backwards.\u201d Brooks said he has spoken with Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, about poverty and the issue is something that he wants to tackle. Progress for Progressives in 2014? Granholm: Put min wage on state ballots Extended unemployment benefits expire Food stamp recipients see cuts It started less than a month before Romney and Ryan lost the election. While the standard bearer was largely seen as an aloof elitist, Ryan met with a group of low-income people at Cleveland State University. Bob Woodson, an acquaintance of Ryan who runs the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a national organization that works with low-income people, said the lawmaker reached out to him after the election, saying he wanted to learn more. Ryan meets with him one day a month in a different city and spends time with poor people, Woodson said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an eye-opener\u201d for Ryan, Woodson said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken him to places that few other representatives have been.\u201d Woodson thinks Ryan will eventually form a poverty agenda, \u201cbut before he does so, he needs to understand what the needs are.\u201d While Ryan is exploring the issue quietly, two other potential 2016 candidates are also highlighting the issue. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky delivered a speech on poverty in Detroit in recent weeks. Evidence that he might be looking to elevate the issue politically is that he chose the Motor City, which is bankrupt despite a resurgence in auto manufacturing. Michigan is also a traditional presidential battleground. Rand Paul: Extending jobless benefits a \u2018disservice\u2019 And Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is unveiling his anti-poverty agenda this week. The right\u2019s focus on the poor is a strict about-face. The Republican Party is considered unsympathetic to the poor. Current efforts in Congress to sharply cut food stamps and statewide efforts to drug-test welfare recipients exacerbate the perception. If politicians make poverty a central \u2013 or at least one \u2013 component of national campaigns, it would be a significant departure from modern-day politicking. Recent politics Medicare and Social Security often receive widespread attention on the campaign trail because the issues have political advantages. While both are credited for lifting and keeping seniors out of poverty, the programs are available to all seniors. Politicians covet senior voters. Welfare, unemployment benefits and food stamps \u2013 government programs intended to benefit those most in need \u2013 are spread throughout the population and traditionally don\u2019t get as much political exposure. While an expansion of government programs could be risky rhetoric in some political circles \u2013 especially Republican ones \u2013 innovative approaches to address the often-talked about gap between rich and poor and the shrinking middle class have been absent. The only major party candidate recently to make poverty a central theme was Democrat John Edwards, who did so at a time when the economy was perceived to be strong. The former senator fell short in the 2008 presidential primaries against Obama, who spoke in generic broad sweeps about a more just and prosperous citizenship that could simultaneously be appealing to the wealthiest and poorest. Instead, poverty becomes an issue only when a candidate\u2019s dismissal of the poor becomes public. Sutter: The most unequal place in America Romney\u2019s campaign faced a backlash when he said he was \u201cnot concerned\u201d about the very poor. His comment that 47% of Americans were \u201cdependent upon the government\u201d also became a political liability. But is political ignorance of poverty calculated? The middle class supplies the greatest percentage of votes. And if people truly vote their interest, the middle class wants to hear how it would benefit. One voter who was squarely in the middle class said during Edwards\u2019 campaign that she couldn\u2019t relate to what he was talking about. Lehane, the Democratic strategist, said the poor don\u2019t vote, \u201cwhich means their voices are not as loud in the political process as they should be \u2013 especially given the number of children near, at or below the poverty line.\u201d Statistics do show that lower-income people are less likely to vote. According to CNN exit polls, those who made less than $15,000 per year made up 6% of voters in 2008. More than 13% of the overall population fell below the poverty line that year. Fueled by a troubled economy, perhaps, politicians are looking to turn that philosophy on its head. Philosophical divide Deep philosophical divides on the best way to address the issue are likely, even if Republicans take it on. Democrats tend to support policies that involve more government and equitable wealth distribution, while Republicans tend to back a \u201ctrickle-down\u201d approach  in which stronger upper- and middle-class economies benefit the poor. Acknowledging the issue is the first step, said Woodson, who runs the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of dialogue that I\u2019m trying to get going,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get both conservatives and liberals to debate which interventions improve the lives of poor people.\u201d CNNMoney: $15 minimum wage supporters vow to fight on",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: How well do you know the \u201960s? Take our quiz and find out. This week's episode of \"The Sixties\" explores the Vietnam War U.S. involvement escalated in the '60s LBJ: \"A man can fight if he can see daylight ... but there ain't no daylight in Vietnam\" The Vietnam War began in the decade before, but the conflict, and especially U.S. involvement, escalated in the 1960s. For the first time, Americans witnessed the horrors of war, played out on television screens in their living rooms. This week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Sixties\u201d explores the war and its impact on American culture, then and now. Here are five facts from the episode that may surprise those too young to remember the Vietnam War: 1. U.S. involvement in Vietnam began with Eisenhower. In the late 1950s, during the Eisenhower administration, Vietnam had split into North Vietnam, which was communist, and South Vietnam. Cold War anxieties dictated that if the North Vietnamese communists prevailed, the rest of Southeast Asia would fall like dominoes. When he took office in 1961, President John F. Kennedy vowed not to allow South Vietnam fall to communism. The Sixties: How music shaped a decade The Sixties: The War in Vietnam trailer Is Iraq War today's Vietnam? Chuck Hagel reflects on Vietnam service 2. The United States and South Vietnam had Catholic presidents who were shot to death in November 1963. By the early 1960s, South Vietnam\u2019s conventionally trained army was no match for the Vietcong\u2019s guerrilla-style tactics. In addition, South Vietnam\u2019s Buddhist majority revolted against their president, Ngo Dinh Diem. They saw the Catholic ruler as a tyrant. The Western-educated Diem, however, wielded absolute power and rose to dictator level by the summer of 1963. The CIA discussed toppling the regime. With U.S. knowledge, Diem was killed by South Vietnamese generals on November 2, 1963. Kennedy immediately regretted Diem\u2019s death and U.S. support for the coup. Less than three weeks later, on November 22, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office aboard Air Force One later that day. Soon after, Johnson told a grieving nation, \u201cJohn Kennedy\u2019s death commands what his life conveyed, that America must move forward.\u201d 3. TV forever changed the way Americans viewed war As casualties rose, the country increasingly turned against the war. The official line was that Americans were winning in Vietnam, but the evening news told a different story. \u201cWhat Vietnam did to America via television was introduce us to a new kind of America,\u201d said author Lawrence Wright. \u201cOne that was not pure, one that committed the same kinds of atrocities that are always committed in war, but we had never allowed ourselves to see them.\u201d Reporter Morley Safer recalled the shock of witnessing Marines burn down 150 houses on the outskirts of the village of Cam Ne. An officer told the newsman that he had been ordered to level the area. Three women were wounded in the attack, one baby was killed, and four people were taken prisoner. Safer asked a soldier if he had regrets about leaving people homeless, and the soldier replied, \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to do your job and feel pity for these people.\u201d Another soldier told Safer, \u201cI think it\u2019s sad in a way, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other way you can get around it in this kind of a war.\u201d Americans back home were stunned when the CBS report about the Cam Ne village hit the news. After the broadcast, Johnson reportedly called then-CBS president, Frank Stanton, and said, \u201cFrank, this is your President, your boys just s\u2013t on the flag of the United States.\u201d 60 iconic moments from the 1960s 1963: From \"General Hospital,\" to the death of a pope The history of the Cold War Moments in 1960s television 4. Some Americans resorted to self-mutilation to avoid the draft. When the choices were Vietnam, jail or draft-dodging by going to Canada, some young men panicked and devised ways to fail the military\u2019s physical exam, including mutilating themselves, starving or pretending to be gay. The compulsory draft, which had been initiated during World War II, meant registration for young men was mandatory at 18. Working-class men were more likely to get drafted over those in the middle class because college students could get deferments. In January 1965, 5,400 young men were called for the draft. By December of that year, more than 45,000 young men were called. When the monthly draft call rose from 17,000 to 35,000 per month, young people across the nation began engaging in civil disobedience. On November 27, 1965, the March on Washington for Peace in Vietnam took place, attracting tens of thousands of protesters. 5. U.S. troops endured 120-degree temperatures while sitting in swamps. Facing temperatures sometimes of up to 120 degrees F in the wet jungle terrain, soldiers regularly became afflicted with infections such as ringworm. Author and Vietnam veteran Karl Marlantes recalled the difficulty of dealing with losing his friends on the battlefield. \u201cYou\u2019d throw them on a chopper and that\u2019d be the last you\u2019d see of them,\u201d he said, \u201cand so you were constantly shoving it down because if you didn\u2019t you couldn\u2019t function.\u201d Bonus: LBJ feared being remembered for his handling of Vietnam Johnson, who made great strides with civil rights legislation at home, did not want to be remembered as the American president who lost Southeast Asia. In a taped 1965 conversation, Sen. Richard Russell told Johnson that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t have inherited a worse mess.\u201d \u201cWell, if they say I inherited it, I\u2019d be lucky,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cbut they\u2019ll all say I created it. Dick, the trouble is, the great trouble I\u2019m under, a man can fight if he can see daylight down the road somewhere, but there ain\u2019t no daylight in Vietnam. There\u2019s not a bit.\u201d Luci Baines Johnson on her father\u2019s legacy When CBS anchor Walter Cronkite, who was called the most trusted man in America, traveled to Vietnam in 1968 and announced it was time for America to pull out, Johnson reportedly old an aide, \u201cIf I\u2019ve lost Cronkite, I\u2019ve lost middle America.\u201d Journalist Marvin Kalb noted that Johnson \u201crealized he was no longer in charge of the war. The war was in charge of him.\u201d In 1968, Johnson announced that he would not be running for re-election.",

            "article_content": "Inspired by Maya Angelou? Read your favorite Angelou quote on video and send it to CNN iReport. Maya Angelou had an illustrious career as a poet, singer, dancer and director She died at home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, her literary agent said One of her most famous works was \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" A literary voice revered globally for her poetic command and her commitment to civil rights has fallen silent. Maya Angelou died at her home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on Wednesday, said her literary agent, Helen Brann. Angelou had been \u201cfrail\u201d and suffering from heart problems, the agent said. The words Maya Angelou left behind Angelou\u2019s legacy is twofold. She leaves behind a body of important artistic work that influenced several generations. But the 86-year-old was praised by those who knew her as a good person, a woman who pushed for justice and education and equality. In her full life, she wrote staggeringly beautiful poetry. She also wrote a cookbook and was nominated for a Tony. She delivered a poem at a presidential inauguration. In 2010, President Barack Obama named her a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country\u2019s highest civilian honor. She was friends with Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and inspired young adults and world celebrities. 2013: Maya Angelou discusses MLK's dream Maya Angelou: Poet, novelist and actress Maya Angelou: In her own words She sang calypso. She lived through horrors. Her lasting contribution to literature, \u201cI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\u201d bore witness to the brutality of a Jim Crow South, portraying racism in stark language. Readers learned of the life of Marguerite Ann Johnson (Angelou\u2019s birth name) up to the age of 16: how she was abandoned by her parents and raped by her mother\u2019s boyfriend. She was homeless and became a teen mother. Its publication was both daring and historic, given the era of its debut in 1969. \u201cAll of the writers of my generation must honor the ground broken by Dr. Maya Angelou,\u201d author Tayari Jones posted on her Facebook page Wednesday. \u201cShe told a story that wasn\u2019t allowed to be told,\u201d Jones said. \u201cNow, people tell all sorts of things in memoir, but when she told the truth, she challenged a taboo \u2013 not for shock value, but to heal us all.\u201d Black American novelist Julian Mayfield is said to have described the autobiography as \u201ca work of art which eludes description.\u201d \u201cI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\u201d was an international bestseller and nominated for a National Book Award in 1970. \u201cIf you want to know what it was like to live at the bottom of the heap before, during and after the American Depression, this exceptional book will tell you,\u201d hailed British critic Paul Bailey. The book became a mainstay of student reading lists, much to the chagrin of some authorities. The book has reportedly been banned numerous times. Angelou\u2019s mastery of literature trumped those who tried to keep her down. She knew that storytelling always won in the end. \u201cI want to write so well that a person is 30 or 40 pages in a book of mine \u2026  before she realizes she\u2019s reading,\u201d Angelou once said. Opinion: How Maya Angelou gave me life On Wednesday, people of all ages and backgrounds took to social media to say what her life\u2019s work meant to them. Adrian Sean of Detroit posted a CNN iReport tribute, saying, \u201cI cannot describe the feeling I had when I read \u2018I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\u2019 for the first time, and knew someone else in the world had been through extreme hardships just as I had. \u201cShe not only survived, but she thrived just by being herself,\u201d she said. \u201cMaya Angelou was and still is a teacher, a mentor, and a friend to me. Her impact on my life will always have a special place in my heart.\u201d 1993:  Angelou at Clinton's inauguration Anderson and Dr. Maya Angelou Part 1 Anderson and Dr. Maya Angelou Part 2 From dropout to Dr. Angelou Angelou spent her early years studying dance and drama in San Francisco, but dropped out of school at age 14. When she was 16, Angelou became San Francisco\u2019s first female streetcar driver. Angelou later returned to high school to get her diploma. She gave birth a few weeks after graduation.  While the 17-year-old single mother waited tables to support her son, she developed a passion for music and dance, and toured Europe in the mid-1950s in the opera production \u201cPorgy and Bess.\u201d In 1957, she recorded her first album, \u201cMiss Calypso.\u201d In 1958, Angelou become a part of the Harlem Writers Guild in New York and played a queen in \u201cThe Blacks,\u201d an off-Broadway production by French dramatist Jean Genet. \u201cI created myself,\u201d Angelou once said. \u201cI have taught myself so much.\u201d Angelou spoke at least six languages and worked as a newspaper editor in Egypt and Ghana. Opinion: Food, friends and freedom: Nikki Giovanni remembers Maya Angelou Affectionately referred to as Dr. Angelou, the writer never went to college. But she has more than 30 honorary degrees and taught American studies for years at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem. \u201cMaya Angelou has been a towering figure \u2013 at Wake Forest and in American culture. She had a profound influence in civil rights and racial reconciliation,\u201d Wake Forest University President Nathan O. Hatch said Wednesday. \u201cWe will miss profoundly her lyrical voice and always keen insights.\u201d The university published a tribute site which features her last speaking engagement at Wake Forest. Angelou was a proud woman, which occasionally made problems for her hosts and students. One observer, escorting her to a speech, remembers greeting her casually, only to be told to address her as \u201cMs. Angelou.\u201d Her students at Wake Forest could be as blistering as they were complimentary. \u201cA fantastic motivator and I hope to have more of her classes in the future,\u201d wrote one anonymous commenter on RateMyProfessors.com, while another assessed her as a \u201cwonderful writer, but fame does not imply a right to insult or demean others.\u201d Angelou talked about her approach to teaching on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s \u201cOprah\u2019s Master Class.\u201d \u201cI teach all the time, as you do and as all of you do\u2014whether we know it or not, whether we take responsibility for it or not,\u201d she said. \u201cI hold nothing back because I want to see that light go off. I like to see the children say, \u2018I never thought of that before.\u2019 And I think, \u2018I\u2019ve got them!\u2019\u201d Winfrey released a statement Wednesday calling Angelou her mentor, \u201cmother/sister\u201d and friend. \u201cShe was there for me always, guiding me through some of the most important years of my life. The world knows her as a poet but at the heart of her, she was a teacher.  \u2018When you learn, teach.  When you get, give\u2019 is one of my best lessons from her,\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cBut what stands out to me most about Maya Angelou is not what she has done or written or spoken, it\u2019s how she lived her life.  She moved through the world with unshakeable calm, confidence and a fierce grace.  I loved her and I know she loved me. I will profoundly miss her. She will always be the rainbow in my clouds.\u201d Maya Angelou remembered by those she inspired Poetry after childhood tragedy Angelou was born April 4, 1928, in St. Louis. She grew up between St. Louis and the then-racially segregated town of Stamps, Arkansas. The famous poet got into writing after a childhood tragedy that stunned her into silence for years. When she was 7, her mother\u2019s boyfriend raped her. He was beaten to death by a mob after she testified against him. \u201cMy 7-and-a-half-year-old logic deduced that my voice had killed him, so I stopped speaking for almost six years,\u201d she said. From the silence, a louder voice was born. In her poem \u201cCaged Bird,\u201d Angelou wrote: \u201cA free bird leaps on the back of the wind and floats downstream till the current ends and dips his wing in the orange sun rays and dares to claim the sky. But a bird that stalks down his narrow cage can seldom see through his bars of rage his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing.\u201d Food, friends and freedom: Nikki Giovanni remembers Angelou Surrounded by greats Angelou\u2019s list of friends is as impressive as her illustrious career. She counted Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Winfrey and King, with whom she worked during the civil rights movement, among her friends. King was assassinated on her 40th birthday. In an interview with CNN in January 2009, just days before President Obama was inaugurated for his first term, Angelou gave her thoughts about the United States\u2019 election of its first black president. \u201cIt was as if someone in the outer sphere said, \u2018What can we do to really show how important Martin Luther King was?\u2019\u201d Seeing Obama about to take office made her feel proud, she said. \u201cI\u2019m excited. I\u2019m hopeful. I\u2019m talking all the time to people, and sometimes I\u2019ve really said it so many times I wonder if I\u2019m coming off like a piece of tape recording, but I\u2019m very proud to be an American. \u201cIn 30 or 40 years, (the election) will not be considered so incredibly important. \u2026 There will be other people in those next three or four decades who will run for the presidency \u2013 some women, some native American, some Spanish-speaking, some Asian. We\u2019re about to grow up in this country.\u201d Obama remembered Angelou on Wednesday, saying she was \u201cone of the brightest lights of our time \u2013 a brilliant writer, a fierce friend, and a truly phenomenal woman.\u201d He noted that she expressed her talents in many ways, but \u201cabove all, she was a storyteller\u201d and \u201cher greatest stories were true.\u201d The president said his own mother was so inspired by Angelou that she named his sister Maya. In Los Angeles, iconic music producer Quincy Jones said he was saddened to have lost a \u201cdear friend, colleague and sister.\u201d The two collaborated on two songs on Jones\u2019 soundtrack for \u201cFor Love of Ivy\u201d in 1968, he said, and working with her always \u201cbrought joy and love.\u201d Opinion: Maya Angelou: The definition of a phenomenal woman A poem before Clinton\u2019s inauguration Author Tananarive Due, the Cosby Endowed Chair for the Humanities at Spelman College in Atlanta, remembered Angelou\u2019s reading at President Bill Clinton\u2019s first inauguration in 1993. She was the first poet to do so since Robert Frost in 1961. More notably, she was the first black woman to have such a prominent role. The poem, \u201cOn the Pulse of Morning,\u201d celebrates diversity of all people in America. Again, Angelou was influencing popular culture. Her reading probably introduced a younger generation to her and her pivotal body of work. \u201cI felt like I belonged in my own nation \u2013 at last,\u201d recalled Due. \u201cShe had a tremendous gift for choosing the right language to give us peace and power.\u201d The poem reads in part: \u201cA Rock, A River, A Tree Hosts to species long since departed, Marked the mastodon. The dinosaur, who left dry tokens Of their sojourn here On our planet floor, Any broad alarm of their hastening doom Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages. But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully, Come, you may stand upon my Back and face your distant destiny, But seek no haven in my shadow. I will give you no more hiding place down here.\u201d \u2018A long journey\u2019 In CNN\u2019s 2009 interview, Angelou spoke in the way that she came to be famous for, each sentence a crescendo of emotion, a call to everyone to act and to be better. \u201cOur country needs us all right now to stand up and be counted. We need to try to be great citizens. We are necessary in this country, and we need to give something \u2013 that is to say, go to a local hospital, go to the children\u2019s ward and offer to the nurse in charge an hour twice a month that you can give them reading children\u2019s stories or poetry,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd go to an old folks\u2019 home and read the newspaper to somebody. Go to your church or your synagogue or your mosque, and say, \u2018I\u2019d like to be of service. I have one hour twice a month.\u2019 \u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised at how much better you will feel,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd good done anywhere is good done everywhere.\u201d Some of Angelou\u2019s most powerful speeches \u201cLook where we\u2019ve all come from \u2026 coming out of darkness, moving toward the light,\u201d Angelou once said. \u201cIt is a long journey, but a sweet one, bittersweet.\u201d Angelou reads her poem \u2018And Still I Rise\u2019 2013: Anderson Cooper\u2019s conversation with Angelou People we\u2019ve lost in 2014 CNN\u2019s Eliott C.

Watch the CNN Original Series \u201cChicagoland\u201d on Thursday nights, starting March 6 at 10 ET. Illinois' governor introduced anti-gang violence program ahead of 2010 election A 2012 CNN investigation found the program paid teens to pass out fliers, attend yoga class An audit said the $54.5 million program failed to account for how the money was spent Check out CNN's original series \"Chicagoland,\" premiering Thursday night, March 6 A $54.5 million program meant to cut gang violence in Chicago left out some of the most violent communities and failed to account for how the money was spent, according to a critical audit report released this week. The Neighborhood Recovery Initiative, or NRI, which was highly touted by Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, suffered from what the state auditor general\u2019s report calls \u201cpervasive deficiencies\u201d in \u201cplanning, implementation and management\u201d of the program. The NRI was supposed to be overseen by the Illinois Violence Prevention Authority, or IVPA. The report, which was publicly released Tuesday, criticized the state agency for poor oversight and said the program was rolled out too soon. Teens work to save Chicago's south side Chicagoland: Where politics meets reality Rahm Emanuel: I don't miss D.C. Chicago gangs hold peace tournament \u201cWe noted a significant number of internal control weaknesses and instances of noncompliance related to grant awarding, administration and monitoring including missing documentation, incomplete and untimely application review or approvals \u2026 untimely and incomplete monitoring reports lacking approval dates, lack of site visits, unapproved budget reallocations and untimely recovery of unspent grant funds,\u201d the audit report said. Illinois set up the NRI program with 23 lead agencies, which contracted with smaller community groups to provide services. As of January, the audit had found $2 million in unspent funds that the state could not explain. Examining a sample of the agencies participating in the program, state auditors \u201cquestioned 40 percent of the NRI expenses,\u201d the report said. In many cases, there was missing documentation and receipts that did not match the amounts submitted by the state for reimbursement. A CNN investigation in December 2012 found that the NRI program paid at-risk teens to hand out fliers promoting inner peace, take field trips to museums, march in a parade with the governor and even attend a yoga class to learn how to handle stress. Critics said the program was a way for Quinn to boost his gubernatorial race in 2010 since he announced the anti-violence initiative just one month before the election. Two years after the program was implemented, there was a 20% increase in murders in Chicago. The number of murders went down last year. Supporters said the program kept teens off the streets of Chicago\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods. But the audit found that the communities selected by the program \u201cwere not all the most violent in terms of total crime in the Chicago area.\u201d Of the 20 most violent neighborhoods in Chicago, seven were excluded from the program, the report found. Judge rules Chicago gun ban is unconstitutional In an e-mail to CNN, a spokesman for the Illinois governor wrote that the issues raised in the audit were resolved more than a year ago. \u201cWhen the governor\u2019s office became aware of the issues with IVPA in 2012, the administration acted quickly and, working with the Attorney General\u2019s Office and the General Assembly, passed legislation to have ICJIA (the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority) take over the authority,\u201d the e-mail said. \u201cThe ICJIA has taken major steps to ensure responsible management of this critical violence prevention program and this issue has since been resolved. We are committed to providing effective work and educational opportunities for our youth to help prevent violence in communities across Illinois.\u201d But that isn\u2019t enough for some Republican lawmakers. They have asked for further review of the NRI program as well as freezing any unspent money, which they said could be as much as $33 million. \u201cI\u2019ve spent 32 years in law enforcement, and the information I\u2019m looking at is the kind of information indictments are made of,\u201d said Illinois state Sen. Tim Bivins, R-Dixon. \u201cThis warrants, in my estimation, a criminal investigation.\u201d Calling the NRI program a \u201cshameful waste of taxpayers\u2019 dollars,\u201d state Sen. Matt Murphy said there was \u201cno documentation, no monitoring, no attempt to recover funds. We need to get this information to the appropriate law enforcement authorities and freeze the spending.\u201d Most of the funding for the program was from the governor\u2019s discretionary fund, with the remainder from general reserve funds. Quinn told CNN in a 2012 interview that he had to do something because of the crime rate. \u201cIt does work when you intervene when you keep people on a positive path, doing good things for their community instead of getting involved with gangbangers and drug dealers that afflict many communities, and use violence to kill children in particular,\u201d Quinn said.",

            "article_content": "The civil rights leader discusses Kennedy's role in getting him freed from prison The recording was found in a Tennessee attic after five decades Illusionist David Copperfield bought the tape and gave it to a museum \"It gave me chills,\" Copperfield says A previously unheard recording of Martin Luther King Jr. discussing John F. Kennedy will be played Monday in the place where the civil rights leader was assassinated. King\u2019s comments are on a 53-year-old reel-to-reel tape discovered in a Tennessee attic several years ago. But the last several minutes are only now being made public. The civil rights leader is heard discussing Kennedy\u2019s role in securing his release from a Georgia prison after he was sentenced to four months of hard labor for a traffic violation two weeks before the election that sent Kennedy to the White House. Then-Sen. Kennedy placed a call to Coretta Scott King against the advice of close advisers, expressing his concern to King\u2019s wife.  His brother, Robert Kennedy also called the Georgia judge who had sentenced King to the chain gang and denied him bond.  King was freed the next day. Photos: The legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. MLK Jr. interview found in Tennessee attic The interviewer asked Dr. King if he thought Kennedy had any influence on his release. \u201cWell, I would say first that many forces worked together to bring about my release,\u201d King said.  \u201cI don\u2019t think any one force brought it about, but you had a plurality of forces working together.  I\u2019m sure that the interest of the public, in general, all over America had something, a great deal to do with it.\u201d In fact, Atlanta Mayor William Hartsfield was working to negotiate King\u2019s release from incarceration, which began with his arrest during a protest eight days earlier, according to Taylor Branch\u2019s historical account in his book, \u201cParting the Waters.\u201d \u201cNow, it is true that Sen. Kennedy did take a specific step,\u201d King said.  \u201cHe was in contact with officials in Georgia during my arrest and he called my wife, made a personal call and expressed his concern and said to her that he was working and trying to do something to make my release possible.\u201d John F. Kennedy made the call to King\u2019s wife at the urging of his brother-in-law Sargent Shriver, but out of the presence of campaigns aides who were concerned it could cost him southern support in the election 13 days away, Branch wrote. A special class with MLK Robert Kennedy, who was initially upset when he found out about the call, reversed himself later that day and placed his own call to the judge, Branch wrote.  King told the interviewer he thought it had \u201csome part\u201d in his release. \u201cHis brother, who at that time was his campaign manager, also made direct contact with officials and even a judge in Georgia, so  the Kennedy family did have some part, at least they expressed a concern and they did have some part in the release, but I must make it clear that many other forces worked to bring it about also.\u201d The Kennedys\u2019 intervention is credited with shifting support of Black voters in crucial northern states to the Kennedy side and away from Richard Nixon, whose campaign only offered a \u201cno comment\u201d when asked about the civil rights leader\u2019s imprisonment. The recording is from an interview conducted on December 21, 1960, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by a man who intended to write a book about the civil rights movement.  He never finished the book and the tape was lost until the man\u2019s son rediscovered it five decades later while rummaging through dilapidated boxes left there by his father. The first five minutes, in which King discusses his definition of nonviolence and its importance in the civil rights movement, was made public in 2012. \u201cI would \u2026 say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral end through moral means,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it grows out of the whole concept of love, because if one is truly nonviolent that person has a loving spirit, he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent because he loves the opponent.\u201d King continued, \u201cI am convinced that when the history books are written in future years, historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epics of our heritage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt represents struggle on the highest level of dignity and discipline.\u201d In another part of the recording, King describes his visit to Nigeria and the importance of the civil rights movement in the United States and abroad. Kennedy White House had jitters ahead of 1963 March on Washington \u201cThere is quite a bit of interest and concern in Africa for the situation in the United States. African leaders in general, and African people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and familiar with what has taken place,\u201d he said, \u201cWe must solve this problem of racial injustice if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world, and if we expect to maintain a moral voice in a world that is two-thirds color.\u201d Keya Morgan, a collector and expert on rare historical artifacts, brokered its sale to illusionist David Copperfield, who then donated the tape to the National Civil Rights Museum, which is housed in the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. King was shot to death standing on a balcony of the Memphis, Tennessee, motel on April 4, 1968.  The entire recording will be played Monday in the last room where the civil rights leader slept. \u201cWhen I heard it, I got goose bumps all over,\u201d Morgan said, \u201cIt feels like he\u2019s sitting in your living room and talking to you.\u201d \u201cIt gave me chills,\u201d Copperfield told CNN in September 2012, when he bought the tape for an undisclosed amount.  It was striking because the recording revealed King in a relaxed mood, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard Dr. King talk about peaceful change in the public forum, but this is an audio tape of him talking conversationally,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m certainly no expert, but it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever heard him in that context and I was very moved by it.\u201d Copperfield said he gave the recording to the museum because it \u201cis just the right thing to do.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s certainly one of the great inspirational figures in history,\u201d Copperfield said. \u201cSo much of what I do, in my own little way, is making people dream, transporting them, making them think differently. That\u2019s what magic does. His dream was far greater than any entertainer can provide.\u201d The greatest MLK speeches you never heard",

            "article_content": "Fort Lee mayor accepts Christie's apology; resident says, \"I don't buy it\" Official: Four medical emergencies were delayed help because of snarl on bridge Lane closures tied up traffic on busy bridge in September E-mails and texts emerged this week suggesting that Christie aide was involved in closures For several days in September, there was one experience that united motorists in New Jersey: Together they felt the total despair, rage and frustration that came with trying to drive near or on the George Washington Bridge. It meant a commute from hell for thousands. Parents couldn\u2019t get their kids to school. \u201cIt was utter chaos those days. People were pouring into the store, complaining,\u201d Debbie Minuto recalled Thursday in her shop, Binghamton Bagel Cafe, in the town of Fort Lee. \u201cThe bridge is a lifeline here. You take away the bridge, you take away our livelihood.\u201d She had just finished watching Gov. Chris Christie apologize on national television, saying he was \u201cembarrassed and humiliated\u201d by the conduct of \u201csome people\u201d on his \u201cteam\u201d but that he knew nothing about it. He said he fired a senior aide at the center of the uproar involving the alleged abuse of authority behind the lane closures that snarled traffic. Who's who in Christie bridge scandal Photos: Political dirty tricks Quotes from Christie apology Christie\u2019s apology wasn\u2019t enough, Minuto said. \u201cHe hurt a lot of people. You can\u2019t play with our bridge.\u201d J.J. Jata wasn\u2019t far away, smoking cigars with friends and playing dominoes at the Cigar Room. They too had just watched the governor\u2019s mea culpa. \u201cI was on the bridge those days,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a disaster. It was worse than a disaster. I had to get up four hours earlier just to get into the city.\u201d Normally, his commute takes one hour. \u201cHe hurt the people of this community,\u201d Jata said. \u201cIt was all about politics without regard for the people.\u201d Christie capped Thursday by visiting Fort Lee to personally apologize to the mayor, Mark Sokolich. Christie arrived at the municipal building shortly after 4 p.m., stepping out of a black SUV to a smattering of boos and applause from locals gathered outside, along with one man who barked like a dog. Miriam Hernandez, a school crossing  guard, was among those waiting. She said she voted for Christie in the last election. She\u2019s not so sure she\u2019ll vote for him again and cast doubt on his explanation that he was in the dark. \u201cI don\u2019t buy it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big coincidence.\u201d On those September days, Hernandez said, her husband\u2019s 45-minute commute took three hours. \u201cHe kept calling me. He was so upset,\u201d she said. But Sokolich, who met with Christie for about 45 minutes, said he accepted the governor\u2019s apology and called the session \u201cvery productive\u201d and \u201ccordial.\u201d He said borough officials wanted to make sure \u201cthis never, ever happens again in the future.\u201d \u201cWe were unconditionally, unequivocally provided with that assurance,\u201d Sokolich said. Christie\u2019s visit was \u201ca big step in regaining the trust of our community.\u201d \u201cI take him for his word, which is he had nothing to do with it,\u201d Sokolich said. For his part, Christie said he had \u201ca very good, productive meeting\u201d with the mayor, \u201cand I look forward to working with him in the future.\u201d Back at the Cigar Room, however, owner Jose Perez called the governor\u2019s explanation \u201cbull.\u201d \u201cThis is the usual state of politics in New Jersey. In the end, who pays? The people. We\u2019re the ones who pay for the political gains.\u201d And Claude Lewin, who was among those stuck trying to get onto the bridge in September, said he didn\u2019t believe Christie \u201cwas telling us us 100% of the truth today.\u201d \u201cLike any political scandal, it\u2019s only afterward that these politicians show remorse or contrition and acknowledge that something possibly happened,\u201d Lewin said. \u201cThis was an incident that lasted four days, and after the first day, the governor should have gotten on the phone and called his staff and people at the Port Authority to figure out what was going on.\u201d Phil Belgiovine, 82, has been walking for exercise along Fort Lee\u2019s Main Street for decades. Motorists have always tried to leave the New Jersey Turnpike and cut through the street. \u201cNow, our traffic problem has become a political scandal,\u201d the retired electric company worker said. \u201cWe\u2019re amused by all this.\u201d Lorraine Vorchheimer, a Realtor, sits at a desk facing the bumper-to-bumper bridge-bound traffic on Main Street. A resident of Fort Lee nearly 40 years, Vorchheimer said, she never saw anything like the traffic in September. \u201cIt was horrific,\u201d she said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get to work.\u201d \u201cA parking lot,\u201d a co-worker interjected. Vorchheimer believes Christie. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would be that small-minded,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he knew, he should not be governor for all the harm that was caused.\u201d Tweets in traffic Tweets tell the story of those days of stagnation on the bridge. Mick Duch tweeted \u201cHelloooooo (@ George Washington Bridge w/ 5 others)\u201d on September 9 at 8:38 a.m.; Shawn Bonneau tweeted \u201cI\u2019m at George Washington Bridge (New York, NY) w/ 2 others\u201d at 7:29 a.m.; and at 11:48 a.m., a person named Ali tweeted, \u201cThis traffic on the George Washington bridge is cray crazy.\u201d Paramedics faced much more serious dilemmas, of course, and according to a letter written at the time by an emergency official, responders were delayed in getting to at least four scenes. In one instance, they had trouble reaching a 91-year-old woman who was unconscious and later died. At the three-story Fort Lee Memorial Municipal Building, business went on as usual even though reporters were everywhere. The City Council chambers also serve as the local courthouse, where on Thursday, a municipal judge handled dozens of misdemeanors and traffic violations \u2013 many stemming from traffic around the bridge. The emergency official who wrote a letter detailing paramedics\u2019 problems in traffic, Paul Favia, was at the city building and tried to avoid the press. \u201cWelcome to my world,\u201d he told a co-worker as he dodged reporters. Hours in traffic Claude Lewin was doing his usual rush-hour commute on September 13 when his typically slow-going ride ground to a halt. His commute went from 30 minutes to two hours and 15 minutes, according to the Bergen Record. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the bridge connecting the two states, reduced the number of tollbooths from three to one and narrowed traffic patterns toward two Fort Lee streets, and that reduced three lanes to one, the newspaper said. \u201cOther than after the 9/11 attacks, I\u2019ve never seen such a fiasco of delays at the inbound, upper-level part of the bridge,\u201d Mildred Van Zwaren of Ridgefield told the paper. \u201cLudicrous!\u201d Chuck Ciocco said. \u201cChronic delays like these destroy one of the two main reasons that most of us moved to this area \u2013 great schools and a short commute.\u201d Keith Bendul, the Fort Lee police chief, told the paper that the department first heard about the traffic change on a Monday morning, the first day of school. \u201cOur parents now have to get up an hour and a half early to get their kids to class. We couldn\u2019t clear all the residual traffic until 11:30,\u201d he said. On September 10, Favia, the head of the Office of Emergency Medical Services of Fort Lee, wrote a letter to Sokolich detailing instances in which paramedics had trouble reaching people who needed them. The 91-year-old woman went into cardiac arrest, he wrote, but the paramedics were in such a bind that they had to meet the ambulance on its way to the hospital instead of going to the scene, he wrote. The Bergen Record, which cited borough records, reported that the woman later died. In another instance, emergency responders were dispatched to a motorcycle crash with injuries, according to the letter. It took nine minutes for the responders to get to the scene when it should have taken four, Favia wrote. New Jersey politician wants investigation into bridge controversy Favia actually joined EMS on that call on September 9 despite being stuck in traffic, which he managed to get out of by jumping a curb and cutting up another street, he wrote. Later that evening, because all ambulances were dispatched elsewhere, he responded to a call about someone having chest pains. It took Favia eight minutes to get to the scene because of standstill traffic, he wrote. He was eventually joined by another ambulance that was also delayed due to traffic tie-ups. \u2018Time for some traffic problems\u2019 Christie denied for months that anyone in his administration or campaign played any role in the closures. On Wednesday, e-mails and texts emerged, suggesting that appointees of Christie\u2019s orchestrated the closures to punish Sokolich, a Democrat who wouldn\u2019t support Christie at the polls. Christie and his staff originally blamed the closures and the traffic delays on a mishandled traffic study. \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\u201d Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie\u2019s deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, said in an e-mail to David Wildstein, then the highest-level appointee representing the state at the Port Authority. \u201cGot it,\u201d Wildstein replied. In another message about school buses with students on board caught in the traffic jams, Wildstein wrote, \u201cthey are the children of Buono voters,\u201d apparently referring to Barbara Buono, Christie\u2019s Democratic opponent in November\u2019s gubernatorial election. Those cited in the messages did not respond to requests for comment or to verify the communications. Wildstein invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when called before a state legislative committee on Thursday, with lawmakers citing him for contempt for refusing to answer questions. As for Sokolich, Christie said Thursday that the mayor \u201cwas never on my radar screen\u201d before the controversy. Sokolich said he raised the comment with the governor during their meeting in the afternoon, asking, \u201cGovernor, am I now on your radar?\u201d \u201cHis response was something along the lines that Fort Lee now has its own screen,\u201d Sokolich told CNN\u2019s The Situation Room. CNN\u2019s Ray Sanchez reported from Fort Lee, New Jersey, and Ashley Fantz reported from Atlanta. CNN\u2019s Matt Smith and Toby Lyles contributed to this report.",

Jeb Bush is the top Republican with 18% With a more populist Democratic Party, this might not be a badge of honor for Hillary Clinton Millionaires are ready for Hillary. According to a CNBC survey, Hillary Clinton \u2013 with 31% support \u2013 would be the top choice for people with \u201cinvestable assets of $1 million or more\u201d if the 2016 election were held today. Clinton is followed by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush with 18%, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie with 14% and Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders  with 11%. In the poll, CNBC notes that \u201cpeople with investable assets of $1 million or more\u201d make up the top 8% of American households and their poll was \u201cevenly split between Democrats, Republicans and Independents.\u201d Among Democrats, Clinton\u2019s lead is massive, with 72% of the 500 people polled stating they support the former first lady. Bush, likewise, is the top choice for Republican millionaires with 36% support. Despite the fact that millionaire supporters have outsized influence because of campaign contributions and donations to super PACS, this distinction could be one Clinton doesn\u2019t want. Since she last ran 0for president, the Democratic Party has become more populist and in order to win in 2016, many political experts see her needed to reconnect with middle and working class voters. The party has also been overtaken by skepticism of Wall Street and, in some cases, wealth, meaning having the backing of a majority of millionaires may not be a badge of honor in 2016. What\u2019s more, the support of more millionaires has not always been indicative of electoral success. In 2008 and 2012, Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney had support of most millionaires in their respective elections. Both went on to lose to President Barack Obama, who had the support of most people with $30 million or more.",

            "article_content": "Supporters met to discuss the past year with nod to future Hillary Clinton presidential run They spoke in hypotheticals, but acknowledged all signs point to Clinton run While hopeful, many expressed concerns that Clinton could face in a presidential race The stated purpose for a meeting of pro-Hillary Clinton Democrats in New York on Friday was simple: Recap the last year and discuss 2014 lessons that will apply in 2016\u2019s presidential election. The much-talked about and more interesting purpose, however, was the realization that the pre-campaign that has existed around a likely Clinton candidacy for the better part of two years is soon coming to an end. In the hallway, ballroom and press briefing room of the Ready for Hillary National Finance Council meeting, dozens of top flight Democrats, many of whom would make up the roster of a Clinton campaign, came together to discuss the future of what appears to be a likely run. \u201cThey are pretty certain,\u201d Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily\u2019s List and a possible Clinton campaign manager in 2016, said when asked whether session attendees thought Clinton would run. Though many of the speakers at the strategy session regularly inserted caveats like \u201cif she runs\u201d or \u201chypothetically\u201d into conversations with the press, the feeling of nearly everyone in the room was that Clinton is almost certainly running for president and will likely declare early in 2016. \u201cYou can derive that by looking at what she has been doing,\u201d said Chris Lehane, the political director of Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign and a longtime Hillary Clinton adviser. \u201cI think she has been doing everything you would do if you were going to give a serious look to running.\u201d Did 2014 election help or hurt Hillary? Should voters on left 'Stop Hillary'? Paul: Midterms 'a repudiation of Clinton' Lehane added that the reason many of the Democrats were in a New York City ballroom on Friday was because of those movements by Clinton, who for the last year has headlined high profile speeches, stumped for Democrats across the country and written a much ballyhooed book. \u201cA lot of people are taking their signals from that,\u201d the California-based political consultant said. \u201cThat is one of the reasons this gathering is taking place.\u201d But just as certain as the attendees were that Clinton would be running in the near future, many were equally as certain that her campaign would face challenges and would have free reign of the Democratic field. Democrats openly worried about Clinton\u2019s campaign finding a message in a changing political landscape and holding on to a Democratic electorate that was burned by stinging defeats in 2014. \u201cIf 2016 happens with a 2014 electorate, we are not going to be successful,\u201d said Mitch Stewart, a senior Ready for Hillary adviser and former Obama campaign aide. \u201cI think the big pitfall for Democrats is we have not yet figured out a message on the economy that resonates with working class voters. \u2026 That is, for me, at least the biggest concern out there.\u201d Strategists from important presidential states like Iowa and New Hampshire also raised concerns about her frontrunner status and their respective states\u2019 tendency to gravitate to fringe, dark horse candidates. \u201cIowa has a very healthy contrarian spirit. It has a very healthy underdog spirit,\u201d said Jerry Crawford, a Clinton organizer in the Hawkeye State who joked that he sometimes has dreams (read: nightmares) of (independent Vermont Sen.) Bernie Sanders toying with a presidential bid. \u201cThat is what we have to keep our eye on,\u201d he added. Similar concerns were raised by Terry Shumaker, a longtime Clinton confidant and aide from New Hampshire. Inevitability is not a message, it is not something you can run on Terry Shumaker, the 2008 co-chair of Hillary Clinton's New Hampshire campaign \u201cInevitability is not a message, it is not something you can run on. And in New Hampshire, we have a long history of (frontrunner) train wrecks,\u201d Shumaker said, noting that despite the Clinton\u2019s long history with New Hampshire, many young voters don\u2019t remember that. Shumaker, a longtime Clinton supporter who was with Bill Clinton when he filed his presidential bid papers in 1991, added: \u201cAs I caution all presidential candidate in New Hampshire, taking New Hampshire for granted is very dangerous. Last time I believe Hillary Clinton had an almost 30-point lead in the polls in our state in the summer and that lead melted like an ice sculpture on the mall in Washington in July.\u201d Clinton went on to win the New Hampshire primary in 2008, but by a slim 3%. But Clinton supporters were also buoyed on Friday by that fact that the Democratic field has been partially frozen for the last year because of their actions. Prospective candidates like former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and Sanders have been entertaining bids, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb declared this week he was launching an exploratory committee. Hillary Clinton out-campaigns Obama Hillary battles hecklers in Maryland Democrats' 2016 Bench But other than that, very few Democrats are lining up to take on Clinton and that was evident in the fact that many Clinton advisers on Friday looked more towards the general election than they did a Democratic primary. \u201cA tough thematic will be, \u2018a time for change,\u2019 and you can shove a lot under that thematic,\u201d said Harold Ickes, a Clinton friend who elevated Ready for Hillary when he signed on as an adviser. \u201cIf (the Republicans) put up the right ticket \u2013 and they\u2019ve been known not to \u2013 but if they put up the right ticket, it could come down to be very, very hotly contested.\u201d Potential Clinton campaign staffers also lined the speakers list and hallways of Friday\u2019s event. Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; Schriock, the president of EMILY\u2019s List; and Ace Smith, a political operative who worked for Clinton in 2008, have all been rumored as likely picks for Clinton\u2019s top campaign job. Cecil and Smith avoided the press room altogether but sat on a panel in the closed press main ballroom, while Schriock spoke with reporters but wouldn\u2019t entertain questions about her future with a Clinton campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about any conversations I may or may not be having with a candidate who may or may not be running,\u201d the women\u2019s group leader stated emphatically to reporters. Not everyone was talking about future jobs, though. Craig Smith, a friend of Bill Clinton from his days in Arkansas, was quite gleeful when he thought about not working on another campaign. \u201cIf she decided to run, and she wants me to do something, I will do what I can,\u201d Smith said with a smile. \u201cIf she wants me to go to the beach and work on my garden, I will go do that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, is still considering a 2016 bid He thinks the low voter turnout in the midterms helps boost his case He made that argument on two shows Monday Independent senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont argued Monday that the low voter turnout in the midterm elections reflected widespread negative opinions about both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. \u201cWhat I think really happened is about 64 percent of the American people rejected the two-party system,\u201d Sanders said on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cColbert Report.\u201d \u201cThey rejected Washington as it now functioned. They rejected a political system and a Congress which spends more time representing the wealthy and the powerful than ordinary Americans.\u201d Sanders is headed back to Iowa, New Hampshire Only about 36% of voters cast their ballots in this month\u2019s elections, marking the lowest midterm turnout in decades, according to the United States Election Project. A self-described Democratic socialist, Sanders also continued to keep the door open to a 2016 presidential bid. \u201cThe news is I am thinking about running for president,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we have to ascertain is whether or not in this country there is the appetite and the willingness to put together a strong grassroots movement to take on the billionaire class.\u201d Bernie Sanders calls for \u2018political revolution\u2019 in Iowa Sanders made similar comments earlier Monday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d and it\u2019s a message he\u2019s carried to key earlier primary states this fall. Pressed by co-host Chris Cuomo on how he plans to get elected if he wants to run against the wealthy donor class, Sanders said it\u2019s \u201cnot an easy task.\u201d \u201cWe may have reached a tipping point, where candidates who are fighting for the working class and the middle class of this country may not be able to do it anymore, because of the power of the billionaire class,\u201d he said. Sanders said his agenda would focus on enacting a jobs program, raising the minimum wage, fighting for pay equity for women, and dealing with climate change. \u201cIf I do it, I want to do it well,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I do it, I know that I will need millions of people engaged in a grassroots campaign to take on big money.\u201d",

Carolina CNN projects GOP will keep the House and Senate Mitch McConnell beat Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky Obama to make a statement Wednesday afternoon A Republican tide ripped the Senate away from Democrats Tuesday, giving the GOP full control of Congress and the power to pin down President Barack Obama during his last two years in office. The thumping win upends the balance of power between the White House and Capitol Hill only six years after Obama\u2019s Democrats swept to power and marginalized Republicans in a rush to reform health care, Wall Street and pass a huge stimulus package. Now, it\u2019s Democrats who will take the back seat on Capitol Hill, relying mostly on the power of the filibuster to stymie Republicans and keep Obama\u2019s legacy intact. Republicans take control of U.S. Senate The new GOP power players Iowa elects first female Senator McConnell: 'I will not let you down' \u201cFor too long, this administration has tried to tell the American people what is good for them and then blame somebody else when their policies didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Mitch McConnell, who is expected to become the next Senate majority leader, said in a victory speech. In the House, CNN projected the GOP will have at least 246 seats, its largest majority since World War II. Speaker John Boehner, celebrating a widened majority, said he is \u201chumbled by the responsibility the American people have placed with us.\u201d \u201cBut this is not a time for celebration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for government to start getting results and implementing solutions to the challenges facing our country, starting with our still-struggling economy. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has controlled the Senate since 2007, congratulated Republicans on their victory. \u201cThe message from voters is clear: they want us to work together,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI look forward to working with Senator McConnell to get things done for the middle class.\u201d Obama will make a statement Wednesday afternoon on an election many will see as a repudiation of his presidency, and he will host bipartisan leaders Friday to try to chart a way forward. GOP governors win blue states Maryland, Massachusetts, Illinois Democratic losses pile up Democratic fears of a rout came true, as party candidates struggled to defend seats won in the 2008 Obama wave in conservative territory, and couldn\u2019t get out from under an unpopular president limping through his second term. The losses in Colorado and Iowa will sting especially hard, as those two states enjoyed a fabled place in Obama\u2019s world, as drivers of the president\u2019s unlikely bid for the White House in 2008. The GOP also piled up wins in Montana, South Dakota, Arkansas, West Virginia and North Carolina \u2014 all seats that had been in Democratic hands \u2014 to surpass their magic number of six net gains. With seats still to be decided in Virginia, Alaska and Louisiana \u2013 where there will be a runoff in December \u2013 the GOP currently has 52 seats in the Senate. GOP nabs first Senate pickup in W. Va. Clay Aiken loses bid for House seat 'Huge' pickup for GOP in Colorado Obama: Worst group of states for Dems Republican numbers stood up when the GOP managed to hold on to seats in Kansas and Georgia which had threatened to fall from their grasp and complicate the Senate math. It was a night of almost unrelenting misery for Democrats: \u2022 In Iowa, Iraq war veteran Joni Ernst became the first woman elected to Congress from her state, after turning around her Republican campaign with an ad in which she boasted about castrating hogs. \u2022 In North Carolina, Democrat Kay Hagan was felled by Thom Tillis, who repeatedly pummeled her for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Obama. \u2022 Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor lost to Tom Cotton, who, like Ernst, is an Iraq war veteran. Pryor\u2019s loss comes despite former president Bill Clinton\u2019s efforts to save him in his beloved home state. \u2022 Democrats thought they had Colorado, with its mix of young voters, Hispanics and students locked down for a generation. But Sen. Mark Udall tumbled to charismatic challenger Cory Gardner who shook off claims he was anti-women. \u2022 Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner is having a tougher ride than expected against Republican challenger Ed Gillespie in a state Democrats had thought was reliably theirs after Obama won it twice. A rare ray of hope for Democrats came in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen bested challenger Scott Brown. And Pennsylvania\u2019s governor\u2019s mansion reverted to Democrats when Tom Wolf unseated Republican Gov. Tom Corbett in a marquee race. New superstars, new villains and other takeaways Governors Two other Republican governors meanwhile won reelection and stirred buzz for their own 2016 White House prospects \u2014 John Kasich in swing state Ohio, and conservative Republican Scott Walker in Wisconsin. In New Mexico, Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, often mentioned as a possible GOP vice presidential pick, strolled to reelection. The places America votes Who are the midterm spoilers? Maryland \u2013 a traditionally Democratic state \u2013 elected Republican Larry Hogan as governor. And Illinois, Obama\u2019s home state, ousted its Democratic governor. Republicans will now look with some optimism on the 2016 presidential election. But Democrats will console themselves with a more favorable Senate map in two years\u2019 time and the belief that shifting demographics and an unresolved war between the Republican grassroots and the party establishment will make the next presidential race a tough climb for the GOP.

            "article_content": "AFL-CIO political director Mike Podhorzer is worried about Democrats' standing with working class voters Podhorzer: \"Democratic victories are powered by the votes of the people who are more financially stressed\" The number making Mike Podhorzer anxious these days is 15. That\u2019s the lead Democrats have over Republicans among working class voters in the final days of the 2014 midterm elections, according to his polling at the AFL-CIO, the nation\u2019s largest labor federation. That might seem good for Democrats, but in modern times, the party always wins voters making $50,000 or less. For Podhorzer, the AFL-CIO\u2019s political director and one of the Democratic party\u2019s top thinkers on voter turnout, it\u2019s the spread that matters. \u201cDemocratic victories are powered by the votes of the people who are more financially stressed,\u201d Podhorzer said in an interview with CNN at the labor federation\u2019s Washington offices, just up the street from the White House.  \u201cThat\u2019s been the case going back to the New Deal. When working class people turn out and vote Democratic, that more than compensates for the advantage that Republicans have among upper income voters.\u201d READ: CNN poll: Voters are angry In other words, with GOP dependably winning upper-income Americans, it\u2019s up to Democrats to run up the numbers with downscale voters, who made up about 40% of the electorate in the last election. When Democrats clobber Republicans nationally among working class voters \u2014 as they did by 22 points in 2012 \u2014 they win. When the margin is tighter \u2014 it was only an 11-point win for Democrats in 2010 \u2014 they lose. The 55-40 lead Democrats are clinging to among people making under $50,000 is wider than the 50-39 lead they had earlier this summer, making this year\u2019s outcome harder to predict. Podhorzer said it does explain why Democrats are still in the hunt heading into next Tuesday, suggesting that next week\u2019s election won\u2019t resemble the GOP tidal wave of 2010. But it still makes him nervous. Too many Democratic campaigns have failed to rally their working class base, Podhorzer said, choosing instead to run on wedge issues \u2013 like Sen. Mark Udall\u2019s relentless opposition to a personhood amendment in Colorad \u2013 rather than broader economic populism. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that picking niche issues and trying to run on a collection of issues and contrasts in this environment is less effective than mobilizing the voters they need to turn out.\u201d \u201cThroughout this cycle, polls have shown Republican voters to be more enthusiastic, because Democrats have been taking an approach in general that\u2019s more about slicing into independent voters and into the middle, and has left the base fairly unmotivated,\u201d he said. READ: CNN poll: Americans confident in Ebola response The Democrats who have nurtured working class voters with an economic message \u2014 like Gary Peters in Michigan and Al Franken in Minnesota \u2014 aren\u2019t getting much national attention, he said, because they have pulled away from their opponents and aren\u2019t being covered by the horse-race-obsessed media. Tight races are not breaking open in the final days, an indicator of \u201cthe cynicism and apathy that people have.\u201d But even with a motivated base, Podhorzer said Republicans are still not where they would like to be heading into Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable how many close races there are right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unlike 2010, Republicans are not making inroads into blue territory. In 2010, they were able to win Senate races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and so forth. This time around they may be able to win races like Colorado or others, but they are not changing the presidential map at all. They have their work to do to figure out how to get the map from the way it looks now to a winning map in 2016.\u201d Podhorzer, an engineer of the progressive movement\u2019s superior voter turnout machinery, said the battle on election day will be about get-out-the-vote mechanics. He framed the contest as a test of the GOP\u2019s \u201cwholesale GOTV\u201d \u2014 paid media and base enthusiasm in a good Republican year \u2014 versus the \u201cretail GOTV\u201d of the Democratic coalition that relies on the party\u2019s technological advantages and focuses on person-to-person contact and. WATCH: Hillary Clinton clarifies \u2018jobs\u2019 remarks The AFL-CIO\u2019s super PAC, Worker\u2019s Voice, is part of the field program Democrats are counting on in tough Senate and gubernatorial races in place like North Carolina, Iowa, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 retail GOTV has gotten much, much stronger than in 2010, when the base was even more disillusioned,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats will do a better job on retail GOTV, and have more of the personal networks on the ground to pull people out. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how effective that can be.\u201d",

Biden, who is known for being folksy and prides himself on relating to working class voters, attacked Republicans for what he called attempts to roll back Medicaid, privatize social security and stop any raise of the minimum wage. \u201cWhat are these guys,\u201d Biden questioned at one point during the speech. 'I'm Joe Biden and I don't like Twitter' Best of the vice president's 'Bidenisms' \u201cThis is a different breed,\u201d the vice president said of Republicans. \u201cThey aren\u2019t bad or good, they are just different. They are just really, really different.\u201d Biden endorsed Braley as the right choice for Iowa voters and, at times, attacked Republican Joni Ernst, Braley\u2019s opponent. Biden, however, didn\u2019t refer to her by name, instead calling her \u201cBruce\u2019s opponent.\u201d The vice president also nationalized the race, saying that, \u201cThis election in Iowa is more important than Iowa.\u201d \u201cThis election in Iowa is about sending a message to the entire country and to our Republican colleagues who know better,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf Bruce wins and I believe he will\u2026 it is going to break the back of the hard right.\u201d Biden has been a strong supporter for Braley, both in this senate race and his previous races for Congress. The senate hopeful said the vice president \u2013 who is considering a run at president in 2016 \u2013 has been in Iowa so much that \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need a GPS\u201d in the state, \u201che just needs to know where he is going.\u201d The Braley-Ernst race has remained close throughout and looks like it will come down to the last eight days of campaigning. Polls have each campaign within striking distance of one another, a fact that \u2013 coupled with Iowa being the crucial first-in-the-nation caucus state for the presidency \u2013 has drawn out a number of big name Democrats and Republicans. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio will be in Scott County on Tuesday, while Hillary Clinton, who\u2019s polling ahead of any other Democrat considering a 2016 presidential bid, will visit Davenport on Wednesday. Speaker of the House John Boehner will also visit Davenport on Monday night, a fact that was not lost on the vice president. \u201cMy friend, John Boehner, and he is my friend,\u201d will be here later, Biden said. \u201cI hope he talks about what the Republicans are for.\u201d Then Biden turned to one camera on the riser next to him and acted like he was talking directly to Boehner: \u201cTalk about what the Republicans are for John, it is your buddy Joe.\u201d After the speech, which included Rep. David Loebsack, Biden and Braley shook hands with supporters as Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cShake It Off\u201d played in the background. At one point, a women presented Biden with her baby. The vice president showed surprise and chatted with the mother. When someone asked them to pose for a photo, the vice president obliged. After the photo, instead of kissing the baby \u2013 which is an old political cliche \u2013 Biden turned to his right and laid a kiss on the woman\u2019s temple.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are on defense in seven key senate races They are all but sure to lose three seats where Democrats are retiring Some Democrats privately admit it is going to be very difficult for them to keep control of the Senate Four weeks away from the 2014 midterm elections and even some Democratic operatives struggle to imagine a scenario where they retain control of the U.S. Senate. The terrain and current momentum seem all but overwhelming and against them. A new CNN/ORC poll out Thursday morning suggests a Republican lead over a Democratic incumbent, this time in Alaska, and does nothing to calm Democrats\u2019 nerves. \u201cIf you put a gun to my head, I guess I\u2019d say that we\u2019re going to lose the Senate,\u201d one Democratic consultant told me in a moment of anonymous candor. It\u2019s not even so much that President Obama is an Ancient Mariner-esque Albatross around their necks, though he is. \u201cI love the guy and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything he could do to fix it,\u201d the Democratic operative says, \u201cbut he\u2019s a real drag. But the bigger drag is the economy overall \u2013 even though the economy is getting better, people aren\u2019t feeling it because wages are stagnant.\u201d Related: GOP challenger leads in Alaska The other issue is that many of the Democrats defending their seats in GOP-leaning states had a fresh new Obama in 2008 helping to sweep them into office \u2013 and often then, just barely. The class of 2008 were a bunch of Obama babies \u2013 and now that\u2019s working against them. It\u2019s hard to explain to youngsters, but in 2008 then-Sen. Obama won Indiana and North Carolina and almost even won Montana and Missouri. Millions of Americans turned out to vote for him and in doing so in red states boosted Democrats like Sen. Mark Begich in Alaska. If you put a gun to my head, I guess I\u2019d say that we\u2019re going to lose the Senate Democratic consultant Begich only beat then-Sen. Ted Stevens, 47.9% to 46.7% six years ago. Begich has hovered in the low 40s in recent polling; he trails his GOP opponent Dan Sullivan by six percentage points among likely voters in the CNN / ORC poll out Thursday morning. Senate math is hard for Democrats The basic math, for those of you not as fixated as the rest of us, is the following: The GOP needs to win at least six seats (though the number may end up being seven given the weirdness in Kansas \u2013 more on that later.) Republicans start off basically half way there. Montana, West Virginia and South Dakota \u2013 where three incumbent Democrats have said farewell \u2013 are considered easy GOP pickups, with the GOP candidates ahead in polls by double digits. That leaves seven competitive Senate races where Democrats are playing defense: solid red states Alaska, Arkansas, and Louisiana; and blue-ish Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, and purple-ish North Carolina. Democrats are feeling cautiously bullish about exactly two of these races, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, and Sen. Kay Hagan, D-NC. Kansas incumbent faces fierce challenge Tea party favorite trying to win in Iowa Hagan is instructive in this way, she currently polls at 44% against her GOP opponent Thom Tillis, with 40%. As Obama squeaked in a 49.9%-49.5% victory against Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for North Carolina in 2008, Hagan defeated then-Sen. Elizabeth Dole, R-NC, 52.7% to 44.2%, and North Carolina elected a Democratic governor and handed Democrats victories in eight out of 13 House races. Four years later, North Carolinians opted for Mitt Romney, a GOP governor, and Democrats were down to four out of 13 U.S. House seats.  Hagan could certainly pull out a win this November, but it won\u2019t be because she\u2019s riding a wave \u2013 it will be because she successfully fought against it. Related: Key senate races Here is the obligatory \u201cto be sure\u201d paragraph: each race is its own individual microcosm, incumbents have advantages challengers do not, four weeks is a lifetime in politics, Dewey Defeats Truman, insert clich\u00e9 here. The Senate GOP Leader, Mitch McConnell, has a competitive race in Kentucky , though I know few Democrats who think he won\u2019t eke it out at the end of the day. And Kansas is a weird one, with the Democratic candidate having withdrawn, and Republican Sen. Pat Roberts facing an independent challenger who hasn\u2019t said with which party he\u2019ll caucus. Democrats are hoping if the final vote comes down to Independent Greg Orman, he\u2019ll remember that Democrats cleared the field for him. A CNN/ORC poll out Wednesday showed the race in a virtual tie with Roberts just one percentage point ahead. Related: Roberts rebounds in Kansas poll The Democratic operative noted that his party was benefiting from some GOP struggles, namely the Republican party\u2019s inability to raise as much money as it had wanted to, infighting among GOP Super-PACs, and general infighting among conservatives.\u201d But midterm elections are generally more difficult for the party that holds the White House. And opposition to Washington appears to be a motivating factor for a lot of voters. \u201cA lot of these races are tight right now, but this isn\u2019t the sort of environment where late-deciding voters are going to break for Democrats,\u201d the Democratic consultant said, adding that with Democrats in tight races but under 50% right now, it\u2019s tough to imagine all of them breaking in favor of the party that holds the White House. Those Democrats include the ones fighting for their jobs in all seven of these toss-ups. Remember that the GOP only need win three of these and the most recent polling, which could clearly change between now and election day, suggests extremely close margins or a Republican advantage in all of them: \u00b7         Alaska (Republican up 50-44 in CNN / ORC poll) \u00b7         Arkansas (Republican up 45-41 in CBS / NYT / YouGov poll) \u00b7         Louisiana (Republican up 47-41 in CBS / NYT YouGov poll) \u00b7         Colorado (Democrat up 48-45 in CBS / NYT / YouGov poll) \u00b7         Iowa (42-42 draw in Loras College poll) \u00b7         New Hampshire (Democrat up 48-41 in CBS / NYT / YouGov poll) \u00b7         North Carolina (Democrat up 47-45 in USA Today / Suffolk poll) \u201cIt\u2019s going to be bad,\u201d the consultant said. \u201cNot 2010 bad, but bad.\u201d Even hapless House GOP candidates running against popular incumbents are proving competitive, the consultant reports. \u201cYou can see why Eric Cantor went down \u2013 people are just so anti-Washington, and that\u2019s particularly a problem with Democrats because of ties\u201d to the president. \u201cPeople feel hopeless and think that Washington isn\u2019t doing anything.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama says economy is doing better despite remaining hardships NEW: In speech in Illinois, he slams Republicans for blocking agenda A majority of Americans still disapprove of how Obama has handled economy Democrats hope to win midterm voters with their economic message Eager to highlight signs of an economy on the rebound, President Barack Obama launched a midterm election effort Thursday designed to convince voters of a vigorous recovery that a majority still doubts. At stake: the power to get anything done in Washington during the final quarter of his presidency. \u201cI want people the know there are some really good things happening in America,\u201d Obama declared at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management in Chicago, both summarizing his election-year pitch and capturing the political problem inherent in having to describe an economic recovery that many Americans still aren\u2019t feeling. \u201cSometimes the noise clutters and I think confuses the nature of the reality out there,\u201d he said before listing his economic achievements, including bailing out the American automobile sector and reducing the rolls of people without health insurance. Fire diverts Air Force One to Indiana Obama's new image: wartime president And despite his assertion that Thursday\u2019s remarks didn\u2019t amount to a \u201cpolitical speech,\u201d Obama took sharp aim at Republicans who have blocked his economic agenda on Capitol Hill. \u201cA true opposition party should have the courage to lay out their agenda,\u201d he said, slamming GOP efforts to cut taxes for top earners. \u201cNearly all the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1%, so I find that a little hard to swallow,\u201d he said, in one stroke jabbing Republicans while highlighting the problems he faces in selling an economic recovery that millions of Americans have yet to feel. Although Obama can cite statistics that show a renewed U.S. economy, many Americans are still feeling battered by the downturn\u2019s legacy: stagnant wages and not enough full-time work. In a CNN/ORC survey released Thursday, 57% of those polled said the nation\u2019s economy was poor, compared with 42% who described conditions as good. While still underwater, those numbers reflect an improvement in the economic mood of the nation. A year ago, only 29% of Americans thought the economy was good, and polls taken between then and now show a steady rise in the number of people who are feeling better about the country\u2019s economic state. The question is whether Obama gets any credit: A CNN/ORC poll conducted in late September showed that 56% of respondents didn\u2019t approve of how the president is handling the economy. Key Midterm races to watch Part of his challenge is explaining why the economic recovery has been so good to the coastal rich while leaving poor and middle-class Americans struggling. The poll released Thursday showed Americans who earn north of $100,000 per year, and those living in the Northeast and West, far more likely to describe economic conditions as good. \u201cOur broader economy in the aggregate has come a long way, but the gains of recovery aren\u2019t yet broadly shared or at least not broadly shared enough,\u201d Obama said Thursday. \u201cThe stress that families feel \u2013 that\u2019s real. It\u2019s still harder than it should be to pay the bills and put away some money. Even when you\u2019re working your tail off, it\u2019s harder than it should be to get ahead.\u201d As long as Americans keep citing the economy as their top issue, as they did by a wide margin in CNN\u2019s latest survey, the White House will attempt to drive home the message that things are a lot better than they were six years ago. \u201cMost people this fall are going to vote on economic issues,\u201d said Jay Carney, Obama\u2019s former press secretary, now a CNN contributor. \u201cLike they often do, except in those circumstances like post-9/11 where they perceive an existential threat to the United States.\u201d With a little more than a month to go before November\u2019s vote, Obama has spent the bulk of his political energy delivering the economic message to Democratic donors at high-dollar fundraisers. He has yet to make an appearance at a campaign rally for a Democrats, though he\u2019s expected to appear with candidates as Election Day nears.",

            "article_content": "CNN's Kate Bolduan sits down with the President to talk about working families President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama are hosting a summit on the issue The President wants to see paid parental leave and more flexibility for working parents Amid growing foreign policy crises, President Barack Obama is encouraging Congress and the country to focus on issues here at home \u2013 namely how to improve the livelihoods of working families. On Monday, the President and first lady Michelle Obama will hold a Working Families Summit in Washington, which highlights economic issues affecting American families at home and in the workplace. Obama gives advice on parenting Obama advocates for paid family leave \u201cEvery single day, there are conversations around the kitchen table where people are trying to figure out, this child care is costing so much, I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be able to make our mortgage at the end of the month,\u201d the President said to Kate Bolduan of CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cThere are folks who are saying, \u2018Little Johnny is sick, but if I don\u2019t show up at my job, because I don\u2019t have paid family leave, we\u2019re not going to be able to pay the electricity bill.\u2019 \u201c Bolduan sat down with the President on Friday to discuss how he plans to achieve his administration\u2019s goal of a \u201c21st-century workplace that works for all Americans.\u201d Here are the five things we learned from our sitdown with the President: 1. The goal of the summit is \u2026 \u201c\u2026 to lift up the conversation that everybody is already having individually and let people know you\u2019re not alone out here,\u201d Obama said. The President said he believes \u201cgood, strong, healthy families\u201d are the foundation of our society. But today, according to Obama, those working families are struggling to get by as parents are having difficulty juggling their obligations at home and work. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s not just about giving lip service to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to reduce the stresses on families. And I think if you ask most families around the country, \u2018What\u2019s the biggest stress?\u2019 It has to do with financial pressures and time pressures that are constantly encroaching on them.\u201d 2. President Obama\u2019s three priorities at the Working Families Summit: Priority one: Paid family leave According to a survey from the United Nations\u2019 labor agency, of the 185 countries and territories with readily available information, only three do not provide paid maternity leave. And, you guessed it, the United States made that list. The other two countries are Oman and Papua New Guinea. \u201cPaid family leave, we\u2019re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn\u2019t have it,\u201d the President said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense. There are a lot of countries that are a lot poorer than we are that also have it.\u201d But the President said paid family leave isn\u2019t just a women\u2019s issue, as he reflected on his days of becoming a new working dad. \u201cOne of the most precious memories that I\u2019ll ever have is when my first daughter, Malia, was born,\u201d he said. \u201cI was lucky enough that my schedule allowed me to take that first month off. And staying up until 2 in the morning and feeding her and burping her creates a bond that is irreplaceable.\u201d Right now in the United States, employees can take 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Employers can choose to provide paid leave, but less than half do. According to a 2012 survey from the Department of Labor, 48% of employees who went on leave received full pay, while 17% received only partial pay. \u201cWe have unpaid family leave right now, but for a whole lot of families, it means they can\u2019t use it because they just can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Obama said. Lerner: Is paid family leave bad for business? Priority two: Workplace flexibility The President said he\u2019s pushing for workplace flexibility to give parents the opportunity to become more involved in their children\u2019s lives and education. \u201cWe always say that we want parents involved in our kids\u2019 education,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are millions of families out there who can\u2019t even imagine taking time off to go to a parent-teacher conference.\u201d This type of workplace flexibility is a practice that he and the first lady believe will improve employee morale and motivation. \u201cWhen we knew that employers had our backs and were willing to give us flexibility to look after family, that made us want to work harder for that employer,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it meant taking work home with us, if it meant coming in on Saturday to replace the time we had taken off on Tuesday. And that, I think, has been the experience of a lot of employers.\u201d Priority three: Child care Obama administration officials say they are focusing on the issue of child care at Monday\u2019s summit. White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett cited a survey that found that over a three-month stretch, 29% of working parents had a child care emergency. \u201cWhat happens if you\u2019ve got to leave in the middle of the day? If you are a low-wage worker and you leave, you could lose your job,\u201d Jarrett said in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t do a very good job providing high-quality, affordable child care, and there are a lot of countries, a lot of our competitors do it,\u201d Obama told Bolduan. \u201cThat means that it\u2019s a lot easier for women to be in the workforce and not have to make choices that ultimately mean they\u2019re, in some cases, getting paid less or having less opportunities. And it also means, by the way, that our kids are more likely to thrive.\u201d 3. Add to that list: Equal pay for equal work. Women now make up more than half of the country\u2019s primary or co-breadwinners. But the Obama administration says those women are still earning less than their male counterparts. A 2013 Pew Research Center study said women earned 84% of what men earned, according to an analysis of hourly wages of all workers. \u201cWe\u2019ve done some things administratively on that front. I always say that shouldn\u2019t be a women\u2019s issue because I always wanted Michelle to make sure that she was getting paid fairly because when she brought her paycheck home, that went into the overall pot to help us pay our bills,\u201d the President said. 4. What the President is going to do about it: Obama says he has full faith that these best practices of offering paid family leave and workplace flexibility will garner a more productive and competitive economic landscape. \u201cFor companies who are offering paid family leave, who are offering flexibility, their workers are more productive, more loyal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s lower turnover and ultimately, they\u2019re going to be more profitable.\u201d Monday\u2019s summit is just one step toward his second-term agenda of improving these domestic issues. \u201cI\u2019m going to be taking some action, a presidential memorandum directing every federal agency to be very clear to their employees that it is my view that offering flexibility where possible is the right thing to do. We don\u2019t want people having to choose between family and work when you\u2019ve got an emergency situation,\u201d Obama said. But Republicans have been critical of what they perceive as initiatives that are derived solely from the President\u2019s midterm election strategy of mobilizing women to turn out to vote. With Democrats holding the upper hand on women\u2019s issues, the Working Families Summit plays into the party\u2019s strength, leading administration critics to wonder if this is just about playing politics. \u201cI\u2019ve got a strong, successful wife, who I remember being reduced to tears sometimes because she couldn\u2019t figure out how to juggle everything that she was doing. And I\u2019ve got two daughters that I care about more than anything in the world,\u201d the President said. \u201cAnd so this is personal for me. And I think it\u2019s personal for a lot of people.\u201d \u201cThis is not just a women\u2019s issue. This is a middle-class issue and an American issue,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd to the extent that we want to have this conversation outside of politics, I\u2019d welcome a bipartisan effort with ideas coming from the private sector and from Republicans, from Democrats and from nonprofits and the faith community about how we make sure that we\u2019re supporting families and reducing their stress.\u201d 5. His tips on parenting: With Bolduan\u2019s first baby on the way, she asked the President for some parenting advice. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re going to do great,\u201d Obama said. \u201cMichelle and I talk about this. And kids are more resilient than you realize. You give them unconditional love and then you give them some structure and some rules. And they usually turn out really, really well. And they\u2019ll bring you a lot of joy.\u201d Some of those structures and rules fall directly in line with the President\u2019s second-term agenda, by homing in on the issue of minimum wage. Both the President and the first lady told Parade magazine that they worked minimum-wage jobs \u2013 an experience they want for their daughters, Malia, 15, and Sasha, 13. \u201cI think every kid needs to get a taste of what it\u2019s like to do that real hard work,\u201d Michelle Obama told Parade. \u201cWe are looking for opportunities for them to feel as if going to work and getting a paycheck is not always fun, not always stimulating, not always fair. But that\u2019s what most folks go through every single day,\u201d President Obama added. Malia Obama is turning 16 on July 4, a milestone marked by her getting her first job on a Steven Spielberg set as a production assistant and soon prepping for her driver\u2019s license. Obama reflects on the years gone by, raising his girls in the White House. \u201cWe were pretty big believers in, as soon as they could understand words, you start giving them some assignments: Eat your peas, pick up the toys off the floor. And by the time they\u2019re 16, they turn out pretty good, although they don\u2019t always give you as much time with them as you want,\u201d he said. Offenheiser: Why raise minimum wage?",

            "article_content": "Tune in Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET as CNN\u2019s Bill Weir welcomes Sen. Gillibrand for a prime-time interview detailing the story surrounding 55 colleges under investigation for Title IX violations. A historic number of women were elected to Congress in 2012 They spoke with one voice decrying the Nigerian schoolgirl kidnappings Their clout is being felt more frequently on hot-button issues Studies find women are more bipartisan, but get more done when in the minority party The women talked about it at the gym, caring for their children, over drinks and dinner and in the hallways of Congress. More than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls were gone, kidnapped from their beds by an armed terrorist group, Boko Haram, who vowed to sell them into forced child marriages \u2014 all because the young women had dared to seek an education. So, just a few days before Mother\u2019s Day, every single woman lawmaker in Congress signed letters urging President Barack Obama to push the U.N. Security Council to add Boko Haram to the al Qaeda Sanctions List. It was a move Rep. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, said would send \u201ca strong message to the administration and the U.N.\u201d The sanctions would require all member nations to freeze the assets of those affiliated with Boko Haram, an Islamic militant group, and prevent travel through their borders. \u201cWe are mothers, sisters and daughters and we were all feeling helpless and wanted to do something,\u201d said Rep. Ann Kuster, a New Hampshire Democrat. She worked across the aisle with Wagner over the course of two days last week to get the 79 women in the House to sign the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re going to do this without men, but we are going to speak up and not be silenced,\u201d Kuster said. They were inspired by the example set earlier that week by Sen. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, two veteran lawmakers who got the 20 women in their chamber to sign a similar letter. Witnesses to Terror Mother of missing girl: 'Our hearts hurt' Nigerians take security into own hands Should we negotiate with terrorists? 1 in 5 girls raped before graduation The message, the women said, was to give voice to the voiceless. And, as female lawmakers, they say their perspective lends a different take on this and other policy issues. \u201cSymbolically, it is very important that all the women in the House and Senate came together to get the U.S. government to push the U.N. Council on the sanction issue,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to come up with a better mix to push this forward. It highlights issues that cut across party lines that affect women and girls.\u201d We will not be silenced Their election to Congress in 2012, with a historic number of women elected to the Senate, made them the largest class of female lawmakers to ever walk the halls of the Hill. Ever since then, the 99 women of the 113th Congress have pushed for changes that political experts say have had an impact both in terms of perception and policy on women and girls. The list of key initiatives is long. \u2022 Female lawmakers, such as Wagner, have bills poised to come to the floor next week designed to end what the United Nations estimates is the $9.5 billion human trafficking industry in the United States and also are working on measures aimed at addressing campus sexual assaults. \u2022 Mikulski sponsored a paycheck fairness measure in the Senate and when it was blocked last month by Republicans, she lashed out at those who say women are \u201ctoo emotional when we talk.\u201d \u2022 Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, have a measure that would create a bipartisan commission to study using private funds to create a National Women\u2019s History Museum in Washington. \u2022 The women of the Black Congressional Caucus recently pressured the Pentagon to re-examine grooming rules they felt were discriminatory to female troops of color. \u2022 Women in both chambers last year helped lead the fight to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and ensured that language expanded protections to immigrants, Native Americans, gays, lesbians, and transgender individuals. \u2022 That same year, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California and more than a dozen other Democrats put forth a House resolution asking Congress to recognize the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and children in poor nations. \u2022 Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Claire McCaskill of Missouri worked for most of 2013 on competing measures to reform the process for prosecuting military sex assaults. Though  headlines tended to focus on fractures within the Senate women\u2019s caucus over the two competing measures, the very fact that the two lawmakers were able to raise the profile of the issue is noteworthy, Lawless said. Political fight over military sex assaults divides women senators \u2022 And it was the actions of women, in particular Collins and Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, as a chief budget negotiator, that helped end last year\u2019s government shutdown and helped craft a debt deal. Breaking bread and stalemates Collins said she remembered sitting in her office one Saturday watching C-SPAN in disgust as lawmakers bickered over the details of a spending plan and whether that plan should, as some in the GOP wanted, defund or whittle away at Obamacare. She pounded out a three-point plan to end the shutdown and went to the Senate floor to plead with fellow lawmakers to let go of partisanship and start negotiating. When she left the floor, her cell phone rang. It was Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, offering to help. When the phone rang again, it was Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican. Part of that plan would help form the framework that ended the government shutdown. \u201cThere have been definite strides and we\u2019re pleased at seeing progress,\u201d said Linda Young, president of the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus, a nonprofit group which seeks to improve female participation in politics. \u201cWhen there are more women at the decision-making table there is a different perspective expressed.\u201d At a gathering hosted by Senate women every six weeks, Mikulski has three rules: no staff, no press and no leaks. The get-togethers, which are often held at a lawmaker\u2019s home, are a time for the women to bond outside of the halls of Congress and get to know one another on a personal level. Recently, Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, hosted the women. Over on the House side, the women try to get to know each other on a personal level. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our softball team, the gym, we get together for dinner or a cocktail,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cWe talk about our families and who are as wives, daughters and mothers. You have to reach a humanity level to realize that end of the day we need to come together.\u201d All of that bonding might have an effect on policy, according to research by the University of Virginia. \u201cBased on scoring all lawmaking activities in the House of Representatives, women in the minority party are one third more effective than men in the minority party,\u201d said Craig Volden, a public policy and politics professor at the University of Virginia who, along with his team, examined the sponsorship of bills from 1973 to 2008. Volden and his team of researchers have also found that female lawmakers tend to sponsor bills on broader range of policy areas than their male counterpart, and that the \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d areas tend to face more gridlock than the \u201c\u2018men\u2019s issue\u201d areas. \u2018No room for gridlock\u2019 When it comes to the issue of helping rescue the kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls, female lawmakers say there is no room for gridlock. \u201cI knew the 20 women of the Senate, standing united and speaking in unison, were in a position to send a very powerful message, one that not only condemns this crime but that also helps spur action to bring these girls back home safely to their families,\u201d Collins told CNN in a statement. And they will not take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. \u201cWe may make some additional calls to the White House,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cJust to make sure they understand our position on this going forward.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama blasts Republicans over minimum wage vote The issue is a priority for Democrats trying to keep control of the Senate in November Republicans cite various reasons for opposing the $10.10 per-hour proposal Polls show Americans favor an increase An election-year showdown over a Democratic priority \u2013 raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour \u2013 saw Senate Republicans block the measure on Wednesday, unleashing a torrent of criticism from President Barack Obama and his party. The measure failed to get the 60 votes needed to open debate in the 100-seat Senate, with only one Republican joining majority Democrats in an unsuccessful effort to overcome the GOP filibuster. While another vote on the proposal is possible, Obama and Democrats quickly sought to exploit the measure\u2019s initial stumble into political capital for November\u2019s congressional elections. \u201cIf your member of Congress doesn\u2019t support raising the minimum wage, you have to let them know they are out of step and if they keep putting politics ahead of working Americans, you will put them out of office,\u201d the President told a White House event that focused on the matter. Minimum wage state by state Push for $10.10 min. wage Buffett not sure on minimum wage Governors spar over minimum wage Jones attacks red states, Perry defends Republicans argue raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would damage the nation\u2019s fragile economic recovery.  Several GOP lawmakers took note of fresh data released Wednesday indicating the economy grew at a sluggish 0.1% in the first quarter of 2014. \u201cThey seem to think they can coast on talking points and stale ideas \u2014 and that the American people haven\u2019t been paying attention to their recent dismal record at actually helping the people they claim to care about,\u201d said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. However, Senate Democrats argued the GOP position hurt American workers struggling to make ends meet. \u201cTheir vote today defines their priorities,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said of Republicans. \u201cIt is the equivalent of looking American women in the eye and telling them they don\u2019t deserve a living wage. It is telling our middle-class families they don\u2019t deserve a fair shot.\u201d Minimum wage: Congress stalls, states act Even if the Senate moved ahead with the legislation, there was little chance the House, which is led by Republicans, would take it up. Obama and Democrats noted that polls show a strong majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage, which currently stands at $7.25. At the same time, polls indicate Democrats have little chance of winning back control of the House in November and could lose their majority in the Senate. After Wednesday\u2019s vote, Democratic senators sought to use the defeat as a rallying cry for November. \u201cLow-income people tend not to vote, but on this, this would be one that they come out on because it\u2019s a pocketbook issue for them,\u201d said liberal Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York noted that traditionally conservative states like Arkansas and Alaska have put a minimum-wage increase on their ballots \u201cto help bring out the vote.\u201d 2014: What\u2019s at stake Republican senators this week telegraphed their opposition to the minimum wage proposal, with some saying the Democratic plan was too expensive and would lead to significant job losses if businesses were forced to adopt it. Perry: Not govt's business to set min. wage Ralph Nader on the minimum wage wars Dean: Not gambling with 16.5M people Who will win the battle for the Senate? \u201cIt\u2019s too high, too fast,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who favors a smaller increase like the one adopted in his state. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, also said she supports a reasonable increase and complained that Democrats sought to force the higher figure through without compromise or debate. \u201cI think it speaks to what\u2019s wrong with Washington today \u2013 that we\u2019re placed in a situation where it was \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 rather than trying to come together and offer amendments and offer a level that might be acceptable,\u201d Collins said after the vote. Harkin, however, said the $10.10 figure sought by Democrats was needed to lift people out of poverty. \u201cWe will not compromise on $10.10. That just gets us above the poverty level,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who wants to go below that is saying that a hard-working American who works full-time all year long still will live in poverty. It\u2019s time to get beyond that.\u201d 2014: The battle for the Senate In February, Obama signed an executive order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour for federal contractors beginning in 2015. The measure voted on Wednesday sought to make that figure the federal minimum wage. The lone Republican to vote with Democrats was Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who said he wants changes in the measure even though he supported bringing it up for debate. Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, who is facing a challenging re-election in conservative Arkansas, supports a smaller increase that is under consideration in his state. Pryor missed Wednesday\u2019s vote because he was back in Arkansas dealing with this week\u2019s storm damage. Key races to watch Republicans argued the liberal agenda pushed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada could hurt centrist Democrats this fall. \u201cFor the Democrats here in the Senate, particularly the vulnerable ones who are in tough competitive races, they\u2019ve got to be particularly sensitive to the agenda the Democrats are driving,\u201d Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a GOP leader, said this week. \u201cI think there are a lot of Democrats, on minimum wage even, that are concerned about its impact on the economy.\u201d Recent national polls indicated that a strong majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. The most recent survey, conducted early last month by Bloomberg, put that support at 69%. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday indicated that by a 49%-33% margin, Americans say that the Democratic Party is closer to their views on the issue than the GOP. And by a two-to-one margin, voters nationwide questioned earlier this month in a Quinnipiac University poll said they would be more likely than less likely to vote for a candidate who supports raising the minimum wage. Meanwhile, national polls suggested Republicans have an enthusiasm edge over Democrats six months before the November vote. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday, 45% of registered voters say they want the November elections to result in a Republican-controlled Congress, with an equal amount saying they\u2019d like to see Democrats in control on Capitol Hill. But among voters with the highest interest in the midterms, the GOP holds a 15-percentage point lead (53%-38%) over the Democrats on the question of which party should control Congress. A CBS News poll conducted late last month showed that 75% of registered Republican voters questioned said they were very or somewhat excited about voting in November, compared to 58% of Democrats. Also, 81% of registered Republicans said they\u2019ll definitely vote in November, compared to 68% of registered Democrats. The surveys seem to back up the conventional wisdom that the GOP has an advantage over the Democrats in midterm contests. White voters and older voters, key to the Republican base, tend to cast ballots in bigger percentages in midterms than younger voters and minorities, who are an important part of the Democrats\u2019 base. Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, including two independents who caucus with the party, but are defending 21 of the 36 seats contested in November. Half of those Democratic-held seats are in traditionally conservative states or those considered purple \u2013 leaning neither right or left. In the House, Democrats need to pick up 17 GOP-held seats to win back control of the Republican-led chamber, a feat political handicappers say is unlikely considering the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts.

            "article_content": "Democrats opt for procedural maneuver to try to get House vote on the issue They want to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour Democrats want debate over a wage hike to be a key part of their campaign strategy Democrats know their push to try to force a vote in the Republican-led House isn\u2019t going anywhere. But that\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s an election year and Democrats believe blaming Republicans for failing to address the issue will put them on the defensive in November. House Democrats filed what is known as a \u201cdischarge petition\u201d on Wednesday.  If they get a majority of members to sign it, Republican leaders must put the Democratic bill increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour on the floor. Even if all 199 House Democrats signed the petition, it would take roughly 18 Republicans to defy their leaders and press for a vote. Aides from both parties \u2013 and even some Republicans who say they could support some increase to the minimum wage - acknowledge that isn\u2019t going to happen. But with most the heavy legislative lifting essentially done for the year, Democrats want the debate over whether to raise the minimum wage to be a key part of their strategy to defeat GOP members. At a retreat earlier this month to map out plans for the year, the House Democratic campaign chief, Rep. Steve Israel of New York, said the November election will come down to voters deciding on the question, \u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d Democrats believe fighting for a higher minimum wage demonstrates they care about working Americans. Republicans argue a wage hike would  lead to fewer jobs and actually hurt America. GOP lawmakers and aides say so far the issue hasn\u2019t been a top concern of voters, and they insist the November elections will hinge on the sluggish economy and problems their constituents are having dealing with the implementation of the new health care law known as Obamacare. But the minimum wage issue could prove tricky for Republicans in the fall. Even though Congress isn\u2019t likely to pass anything this year, a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that nearly two thirds of those Americans surveyed support boosting the minimum wage. The same poll found 77% of Democrats backed increasing the federal minimum wage level to $10.10 per hour and nearly half of Republicans surveyed also supported raising it to that level. Israel says Republicans are on the wrong side of public opinion. \u201cMiddle class security is the fundamental issue of this election and House Republicans are going to have to go home to their districts and explain to voters why they protected billions in subsidies for big oil companies but they won\u2019t give America\u2019s middle class a raise,\u201d Israel said in a statement to CNN. Both sides are pointing to a report released earlier this month by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Republicans emphasize that it found that mandating a federal minimum wage of $10.10 in the next two years would cost the economy 500,000 jobs. Democrats are highlighting the part of the report that said increasing the pay rate would help lift 900,000 Americans out of poverty. Any momentum House Democrats hoped to generate could be blunted by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s decision this week to delay a vote on the issue until later this spring. But an event inside the Capitol on Wednesday with business leaders and advocates pushing for a higher wage rate was aimed at voters around the country, not at lawmakers. It\u2019s a continuation of the political message President Barack Obama has been pushing \u2013 that Democrats are committed to eliminating income inequality. Obama recently signed an executive order upping the minimum rate for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour. \u201cNot to have this vote is to abdicate our responsibility that we have to the middle class, the backbone of our democracy. Mr. Speaker, give us a vote!\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said at the rally. At their weekly Democratic caucus meeting, two top White House aides huddled with House Democrats to provide statistics and fact sheets they could use at home to demonstrate the economic impact of raising the minimum wage. Over the coming months, members are planning events in their districts to highlight their efforts to push GOP leaders for a vote. Democratic candidates will point to the discharge petition in Washington and accuse House Republicans of blocking a vote on a higher minimum wage. One moderate Republican, Pennsylvania Rep .Charlie Dent, who has been targeted by Democrats in the last several election cycles, told CNN he was open to raising the minimum wage. He pointed out that he voted in favor the last time Congress upped it in 2007. But he said if Congress acts again, any increase should be paired with other measures that boost job creation. Another GOP member, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, says he\u2019s willing to debate whether it makes sense to raise the minimum wage. But \u201cI also really recognize that all the Democrats are trying to do is go like look the shiny red ball - look over here while we have a terrible economy,\u201d he said. Kinzinger said he won\u2019t sign the discharge petition and dismissed it as a political move, telling CNN that \u201cit\u2019s an attempt to create a pressure point.\u201d Republicans argue the Democratic focus on the minimum wage proves their point \u2013 that the President\u2019s domestic program has kept the economy in a stalled state. \u201cThe Democrats policies are keeping people in minimum wage jobs, or worse, costing our economy jobs as Obamacare is doing,\u201d House GOP campaign chief Greg Walden said in a written statement to CNN. He said Republicans will respond to Democratic attacks by talking about their proposals to shift people into better paying jobs that lead to greater opportunities and long term stability. Pressed on whether using the discharge petition was simply to make a political point, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra told CNN said it comes down to a question a fairness. \u201cIf you work in America you should be paid decently and if you work for the minimum wage you deserve a pay raise.  We\u2019re interested in having a jobs agenda it would be great if Republicans would join us in that,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Neel Kashkari wants to unseat Democratic incumbent Gov. Jerry Brown in California Kashkari helped shape the Wall Street bailout, better known as TARP Kashkari's election theme is fairly simple: \"Jobs and Education. That's it!\" In late 2012, when Neel Kashkari first pondered the idea of running for governor of California, one of the first people he sought out for advice was another Republican who once faced long odds in a big state gubernatorial bid: George W. Bush. Bush was an underdog when he tried to unseat Texas Gov. Ann Richards in 1994, and he ended up winning in that year\u2019s GOP landslide. He went on to the White House, of course, and was in the waning days of his presidency in 2008 when the world\u2019s financial markets were teetering on the brink of collapse. It was then that Bush looked to the Treasury Department \u2014 and Kashkari \u2014 for help. Kashkari was the 30-something whiz kid engineer-turned-banker-turned-bureaucrat working under Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to shape the Troubled Asset Relief Program, better known as TARP, the $700 billion Wall Street bailout that helped avert a global financial calamity. Kashkari then left Washington with his wife, engaged in some emotional detox in a rural northern California cabin, and later joined the investment firm Pimco. Toobin: HIgh court gives rich more say in elections High court rules on money in campaigns Inside Politics: Obamacare's 7.1 million Obamacare \"the\" issue of 2014? Four years on, the markets humming, Kashkari traveled to Dallas and sat down with the ex-president. He asked Bush why he had the confidence to run against the tough-to-beat Richards. \u201cHe said, \u2018The facts were on our side.\u2019 He thought that she was light on the subject of issues. He was going to focus on the real issues facing Texas as the time,\u201d Kashkari recalled. Bush had some other convenient facts on his side, mainly a famous last name and a state that was trending politically in his direction. Kashkari can\u2019t say the same. A smurf against Gargamel As he mounts a long-shot bid against California Gov. Jerry Brown, barely anyone believes he can win in the deep blue state, even in a midterm year that looks more and more hostile toward Democrats. Kashkari himself expresses some honest skepticism about the enterprise. He recently compared himself to a smurf, and Brown to the evil wizard Gargamel. After announcing his campaign in January, Kashkari is polling at a paltry 2%. Not only is he trailing Brown by 45 points, but he\u2019s also trailing Tim Donnelly, a tea party Republican who was once a member of the Minuteman movement, by 7 points. Second place matters in California\u2019s nonpartisan primary system, in which the top two finishers square off in the general election. Republicans hit a nerve when it comes to Obamacare Plenty of candidates embark on long-shot campaigns against powerful incumbents, but many of them are small-timers, amateurs, ideologues or hucksters. Kashkari is none of those things, which makes his upstart candidacy all the more perplexing. Today, Kashkari is 40, still youthful and brimming with restless energy. As a candidate, his profile is appealing: A Midwest native and the son of Indian immigrants, he has a degree from Wharton and worked for Goldman Sachs before joining Paulson at Treasury. In 2008, People magazine named him one of the sexiest men alive. \u201cI play to win at everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI always talk about having two goals. Goal number one is to win. Goal number two is help rebuild the Republican Party in a positive, inclusive direction.\u201d Inside Politics: Ryan's utopia Arizona's Jan Brewer won't run again GOP win in Florida has national impact The simple theme of Kashkari\u2019s campaign is typed out on his Twitter bio. \u201cJobs and Education. That\u2019s it! I\u2019m Neel Kashkari and I\u2019m running for Governor of California.\u201d If Kashkari somehow pulls off a miracle and topples Brown in November, it would bring an end to one of the most storied, unlikely careers in American politics. An ambitious legal and policy wonk, Brown was just 32 years old when he was elected California secretary of state in 1970. He went on to serve as governor (1975-1983), mayor of Oakland (1999-2007), attorney general (2007-2011) and now governor once again \u2014 with one losing Senate campaign, a stint in Japan studying Buddhism, and three ill-fated presidential bids sprinkled throughout his lengthy career in public life. Using Brown\u2019s record against him, kind of Kashkari is trying to use this long record against Brown, employing a questionable rhetorical trick in the process. \u201cThis guy has had his hands on California for the most part of 40 years,\u201d he says. \u201cIn 1980, California had the 11th most educated population in America. We\u2019re 48th today. You couldn\u2019t engineer that decline if you tried. In 1980, we were about 25th for jobs. As I said earlier, we\u2019re 47th today. In 1980, we were around 25th for poverty, today we\u2019re No. 1 in poverty. Literally, the last 35 years have seen the destruction of the middle class in California.\u201d Left unsaid: Since Brown ended his first tenure as the state\u2019s chief executive in 1983, Republicans have governed California for 23 of the last 30 years. Brown\u2019s GOP predecessor, the cigar-chomping Arnold Schwarzenegger, left him with a $25.4 billion deficit when he returned to office in 2011. Democrats seize on equal pay as midterm issue With the help of a 2012 ballot measure that increased taxes on the rich, Brown transformed the budget hole into a more than $4 billion surplus. It\u2019s a centerpiece of his \u201cCalifornia Comeback\u201d story. Brown\u2019s record is not spotless. Unemployment has dropped, but at 8%, it\u2019s still the fourth worst in the country. A Census Bureau report last year showed that nearly a quarter of California\u2019s 38 million residents live in poverty: the highest rate in the country. Rep. Ryan: The left is exhausted Obama celebrates, but ACA fight not done Justices strike down donor limit With pension obligations and a huge public employee sector, California still faces enormous debts. And the governor has been relentless in pushing for the construction of an increasingly expensive bullet train from Los Angeles to San Francisco.  Kashkari has dubbed the high-speed rail project, which is opposed by a majority of Californians, \u201cthe crazy train.\u201d Canceling the train is one plank of Kashkari\u2019s economic plan. He also wants to give tax breaks to companies moving to California, implement a suite of regulatory reforms, and open the state\u2019s untapped oil and gas reserves to hydraulic fracturing, which he says is a surefire way to create jobs. Education is the other policy issue that motivates him. He has solicited input on the matter from Jeb Bush, the Republican Party\u2019s reigning wise man on education policy. \u201cA growing economy combined with a failed education system means people who get that lousy education are falling behind and those of us who are getting that good education ride that growing economy to the top and income inequality expands,\u201d he says. Yet to air a television ad Before Kashkari can have an honest hearing on the issues, voters have to know he actually exists. That\u2019s a daunting task for an underfunded candidate in a state so vast and expensive as California. Running a respectable statewide television ad campaign for one week, spanning media markets from Sacramento to San Diego, can cost as much as $2.5 million at a minimum. With two months to go before the June 3 primary, in which the top two finishers advance to the general election, he has yet to air a television ad. With his ties to Wall Street and Washington, Kashkari has something of a built-in fundraising network. He has collected campaign checks from Hank Paulson and top tier GOP donors like former Univision chairman Jerry Perenchio and cell phone pioneer Craig McCaw. Kashkari has raised $1.3 million since joining the race in January, a respectable sum. But this is California, and his opponent is an incumbent governor. Brown is sitting on $20 million. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do this on the cheap, so we\u2019re looking at a lot of different ways of reaching our audience,\u201d Kashkari says, plugging his digital operation. Inside Politics: Two state Brown Obamacare game changer for White House? Inside Politics: Ryan's Dilemma A Boehner bypass? House conservatives have own midterm agenda Brown\u2019s advisers, more than comfortable with their position in the race, chuckle when asked about Kashkari. Brown is not only an incumbent, after all, he\u2019s a Democrat in a state President Obama won by more than 20 points in the 2012 election. After reminding a reporter that Kashkari still trails tea party candidate Donnelly in primary polls, it doesn\u2019t take long for Brown\u2019s aides to bring up the disastrous 2010 candidacies of Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina, a pair of credible, business-minded Republicans who got thumped in their respective gubernatorial and Senate campaigns after they underestimated the state\u2019s Democratic bent. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d said Brown adviser Dan Newman. \u201cThere\u2019s a sad history we have in California with these wealthy first-time candidates who run self-indulgent, ego-fueled, vanity campaigns.\u201d Running on TARP? Then there\u2019s the whole TARP thing. \u201cBailout Architect Runs For California Governor; World Laughs,\u201d read one Rolling Stone headline after Kashkari launched his campaign. \u201cHis whole reputation is based on the one policy act of handing out hundreds of millions, sorry billions, of dollars to Wall Street banks,\u201d Newman says, his glee barely concealed. Kashkari has gamely tried to transform his experience during the financial crisis, memorably captured in the book and HBO film \u201cToo Big To Fail,\u201d into an asset. \u201cNot only did we protect the taxpayers and make a $13 billion profit, which has never been done in American history, we did it in a completely bipartisan manner,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo we got all the leaders of the Republicans and Democrats to work together, put their country before their political careers. Honestly, that\u2019s the foundation for why I\u2019m doing this. I feel like if we can get them to work together in Washington, though they\u2019re not right now, but they did at that moment, then we can get them to work together in Sacramento.\u201d Michele Davis, a senior Treasury Department official who worked alongside Kashkari during the drama, said the experience showcased his type-A determination. \u201cNeel was the one who was willing to go up to Congress and take all the slings and arrows,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wanted to do that. That took a lot of backbone, to be the face of it.\u201d Davis, though, said she and her colleagues from the Bush administration were more than a little surprised by Kashkari\u2019s decision to leave Pimco and run for an almost unwinnable office. \u201cAfter the first initial \u2018What in the heck?\u2019 reaction, it\u2019s like, good for him that he\u2019s found something he\u2019s passionate about it and he\u2019s going after it,\u201d she says. \u201cNot everyone is willing to drop everything on a long shot, and that\u2019s really admirable.\u201d Kashkari is unusually candid about his chances. With Democrats outnumbering Republicans in California by a wide margin, Kashkari admits he has to count on winning pretty much every Republican vote as well as a big  majority of independents while peeling off a healthy chunk of Democrats. In short, Brown will have to flame out in spectacular fashion. \u201cI will sleep well at night if I run the campaign that we are running, which is a campaign that I\u2019m proud of, because we are focusing on issues that matter and we run an honest, authentic campaign,\u201d he says when asked if he\u2019s comfortable with the long odds he faces. A thought experiment This is where the thought experiment aspect of Kashkari\u2019s campaign comes in. Last year, before he formally declared his candidacy, he spent the year visiting low-income neighborhoods, churches, homeless shelters and Latino communities. \u201cI\u2019d go by myself,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were no cameras, no staff. I\u2019d say, \u2018I want to learn what your life is like. I want to learn what the challenges are.\u2019 Two things amazed me. Number one, people couldn\u2019t care less that I was a Republican. It never came up. Utterly irrelevant. Number two, people didn\u2019t want welfare, they just wanted a job. What\u2019s exciting to me is that I think that I can reach a very diverse group of voters in a way that few Republicans have done in recent years.\u201d Kashkari and his advisers have been upfront about the fact that win or lose, he is running, in part, to help repair the party\u2019s tarnished image among young people and minorities. He boasts that the first television interview he did was with Univision. \u201cNeel turns the perception of Republicans on its head,\u201d says his consultant Aaron McLear. \u201cNow we\u2019re the inclusive party running a young minority candidate fighting for the middle class.\u201d Even though it might alienate some of the state\u2019s conservative voters \u2014 and there are still plenty in California, where the state Republican Party has become dominated by tea party hardliners in recent years \u2014 he\u2019s wiped social issues from the agenda, a political necessity on the culturally liberal Pacific Coast. \u201c\u2018Im socially libertarian,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m pro-choice, no problem with same-sex marriage. \u2026 A 35-year-old Google engineer looks at you like you\u2019re from another planet if you don\u2019t share their views socially.\u201d Kashkari has sought counsel from a variety of prominent Republican leaders who don\u2019t share those views, including the Bush brothers. He has huddled with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, talked budgets with Mitch Daniels, and named Chris Christie and Scott Walker as two GOP governors he admires. After an interview with CNN in Washington, he made his way across town to meet with House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan. \u201cI think my candidacy is viable in California, but I recognize this is not a model that, today, would play nationally,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying something in California, and I\u2019m hoping that we can show that California can lead the country in a positive way by showing there\u2019s an interesting new profile of a young Republican leader.\u201d",

Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a key congressional voice on national security, announced Friday that he will not run for reelection this year. The Michigan Republican made the announcement on Detroit\u2019s WJR radio station, saying he will host a syndicated radio program that will talk about national security issues and other news of the day. \u201cI had a career before politics and always planned to have one after,\u201d Rogers said in a statement. \u201cThe genius of our institutions is they are not dependent on the individual temporary occupants privileged to serve.

Rogers: Russia cooperation not 100% Rogers, who has held a seat in Congress for more than a decade and is close to House Speaker John Boehner, has been a staunch supporter of National Security Agency surveillance programs, which came under fire after leaks by Edward Snowden publicly disclosed their sweeping nature. This week, he and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland \u2013 the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee \u2013 came up with a plan for ending the NSA\u2019s sweeping collection of bulk telephone records. Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA Rogers has said in the past that the phone and electronic surveillance programs were not abused and has stridently criticized Snowden, a former NSA contractor. He also has acknowledged public worries about government storage of surveillance data. \u201cThat\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to do here is alleviate that concern that there could be abuse in the future of these programs,\u201d Rogers said recently. Authorization for those programs expires on Friday, but President Barack Obama is expected to seek their temporarily renewal while Congress works on reform legislation, a senior administration official said. Rogers is also a favorite of Sunday public affairs programming on which he frequently criticizes Obama. He joins a cadre of House members not seeking reelection in November, but his seat in the 8th Congressional District is still considered relatively safe for Republicans. But the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report shifted their analysis of the district from \u201clikely Republican\u201d to \u201clean Republican\u201d for the November election following Rogers\u2019 announcement. Democrats sought to tie together Rogers and Boehner. \u201cSenior Republican committee chairmen continue to flee John Boehner\u2019s broken Congress rather than defend their indefensible record of siding with special interests over middle class families that has earned them record low approval ratings,\u201d Rep.

And that\u2019s before they hit the casinos. They hope the political payoff will come in appearances before some of the party\u2019s most influential donors attending the Republican Jewish Coalition annual spring meeting. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and current Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and John Kasich of Ohio will speak before the group, which seeks to promote Jewish causes among Republicans. Many of the nation\u2019s leading Republican fundraisers and donors are part of the organization.  Some donors estimate about a third of the party\u2019s most important fundraisers are active in the coalition, so it\u2019s a major audience for the possible presidential candidates attending. Bush is getting a lot of attention because he has been tapped to speak at a private, VIP dinner with major financiers on Thursday night \u2013 giving him top billing for the event and a major platform as he considers whether to seek the party\u2019s nomination.  While he has said he won\u2019t make a decision until the end of this year and won\u2019t engage in further talk about the subject, Bush has recently picked up the pace with his political schedule, appearing in the past two weeks at fundraisers for Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee,  and Govs. Susana Martinez, R-New Mexico, and Brian Sandoval, R-Nevada, both running for re-election, as well as at an event for House Republicans helping him build a network of supporters if he needs one. Jindal, Paul, Christie make NH '16 Moves Rand Paul, popular and provocative Inside Politics: Rand Rising \u201cJeb has something to prove at this meeting,\u201d one influential Republican donor who will be attending  told CNN. \u201cIt is pretty significant\u201d for him to come to the event because he has refused to tip his hand any more about his intentions, the donor said. \u201cJeb has to do a good job of handling that issue.\u201d Another party money man said the event is a \u201cgreat opportunity for him\u201d with decision-makers. \u201cShowing up and speaking is showing \u2018I am taking this seriously,\u2019 \u201d is how he put it to CNN. Bush, who served as Florida\u2019s governor from 1999 to 2007, is liked by many in this key group. During his tenure, and his father\u2019s and brother\u2019s time in the White House,  they built  good relations with the American Jewish community. Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton together again to talk education Many eyes on Christie as well Christie, who speaks on Saturday, is also known to many in this group. \u201cMost of the people will be making a judgment on Christie\u201d during his appearance, one of the donors told CNN. \u201cWe are not absent \u2018Bridgegate,\u2019 \u201d referring to the scandal over the closing of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge last year in an apparent act of political retaliation by some of his aides. Christie has said he was not aware of the closings until they happened. \u201cPeople are going to want to have the hallway conversations \u2026 private meetings\u201d to discuss where the controversy stands, the donor said. A different major party fundraiser said that Christie so far has emerged fine among many of the donors, who like his political accomplishments and policies. \u201cI don\u2019t think in the long term this will harm him,\u201d the fundraiser said. As Christie travels around the country raising millions as head of the Republican Governors Association, he is building up support among the donor class. Besides their public appearances at the meeting, Christie, Kasich and Walker all can be expected to have smaller individual sessions with some influential  attendees. Christie: Bridge scandal doesn\u2019t change anything about 2016 Will Adelson tip his hand? The host for the weekend activities is Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, owner of the Venetian Casino where the meeting is taking place, and active in the Republican Jewish Coalition. Adelson and his wife gave $93 million to various groups and candidates in the 2012 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, making them the biggest individuals financiers of outside groups. The Thursday dinner will be at the airport hangar Adelson uses. While candidates and groups would love to have his support, several GOP donors said they doubt Adelson will tip his hand any time soon. One said he is \u201cvery hard to uncover \u2026 he likes to support existing groups with real structure.\u201d Adelson did support the super PAC Winning Our Future that backed former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 2012 because of his pro-Israel stance, a majority priority for Adelson. Besides Adelson, some of the more influential Republican fundraisers include businessman Lewis Eisenberg,  former ambassador Sam Fox, former Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman, and former ambassador Mel Sembler. Santorum \u2018very open\u2019 to another presidential run All over the place Unlike four years ago where most of these donors ended up supporting Mitt Romney, this go-around is expected to be much different. \u201cYou still have the donor groups all over the place,\u201d said one of the fundraisers while also emphasizing just how early in this process things stand. The amount of activity by the field of possible 2016 contenders reaching out to prospective financial backers is at about the same pace it was four years ago, several of those interviewed said. What is different, they said, is that the field at this stage appears to be shaping up to be much stronger than last time around \u2013 meaning the battle for support among these key supporters will likely be intense. \u201cI think the difference is in the quality of the candidates,\u201d the fundraiser said. CNN has learned Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who have been traveling the country as part of their official duties, met recently with some prominent Republican donors, but did not indicate their future plans. One of the most active Republicans considering a White House bid has been Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has met with donors and who has been working to broaden his appeal beyond his father\u2019s libertarian base.

Kim Guadagno publicly denied an assertion by Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer that she conditioned Superstorm Sandy recovery money last year on Zimmer\u2019s support for a redevelopment project backed by Christie. Zimmer said the ultimatum came down in a parking lot and involved a project proposed by a real estate developer, the Rockefeller Group, with ties to Christie. She said Guadagno invoked Christie\u2019s name in laying out the condition for storm relief and has relayed her story to federal prosecutors. \u201cMayor Zimmer\u2019s version of our conversation in May of 2013 is not only false but is illogical and does not withstand scrutiny when all of the facts are examined,\u201d Guadagno said at a Martin Luther King Jr. event in Union Beach. Hoboken mayor reveals new documents Hoboken mayor: DNC didn't make me do it Barbour: 'Lady mayor' request 'absurd' Zimmer, a Democrat, also said Community Affairs Commissioner Richard Constable made a similar demand regarding storm aid and the real estate plan. He called the allegations \u201cpatently false and absurd on their face.\u201d Constable added that he welcomes a \u201cfull and thorough law enforcement review of her libelous claims.\u201d Zimmer said she stands by her account, remains \u201cwilling to testify under oath,\u201d and will answer any questions from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. \u201cThe bottom line is, Anderson, I mean, she came and she said this to me, you know, and I stand by my word,\u201d Zimmer told CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d on Monday night, referring to her conversation with the lieutenant governor. \u201cShe said she would deny it and she\u2019s denying it,\u201d the mayor said. Fuel on the fire The accusations over the weekend added fuel to a political and legal firestorm that has consumed the Christie administration in recent weeks, mainly over suggestions top aides and advisers to the governor orchestrated traffic jams around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee last year to punish that town\u2019s mayor for not endorsing Christie for re-election. A state legislative committee investigating that matter issued subpoenas last week to key Christie appointees, some of them still in their jobs and others who have recently left. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman\u2019s office is also looking into the matter. Christie has denied knowledge of the alleged bridge scheme that gained steam this month with the release of explosive e-mails between Christie appointees before, during and after the September traffic fiasco. Having made his mark as a brash politician with cross-party appeal, Christie is viewed as a potential front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, if he decides to run. But the unfolding scandals have raised questions about his political and management style in a state where Democrats dominate at the local level. Despite the unfolding political turmoil at home, Christie remains popular out of state. He spent the weekend in Florida raising money for Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for re-election. Zimmer\u2019s accusation Hoboken, a historically working-class town on the banks of the Hudson River made famous by favorite son Frank Sinatra, has experienced a resurgence in recent years. New development, cleaned up parks and neighborhood charm marketing nostalgia have boosted its image and attracted new residents and business. Zimmer, elected in 2009 as the city\u2019s first female mayor, said Guadagno approached her and told her that supporting the development project by the Rockefeller Group was critical for Hoboken receiving Sandy aid. Guadango said her dispatch was \u201ca direct message from the governor,\u201d Zimmer told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. It\u2019s \u201cstunning\u201d and \u201coutrageous,\u201d but true, Zimmer said. \u201cI stand by my word.\u201d Zimmer told MSNBC on Saturday that three days after her run-in with Guadango, Constable delivered a similar message, that \u201cmoney would start flowing\u201d if she supported the project. Christie scandals: What you need to know Zimmer met with Fishman\u2019s office for several hours at its request Sunday and provided prosecutors  with her journal, which contained information about the parking lot episode. Guadango said she recalled having a conversation with Zimmer that day, but she remembered Zimmer arguing that Sandy recovery aid and redevelopment were the same issue, according to a source close to Guadagno who was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cKim remembers in their conversation that she was talking about redevelopment and making investments in Hoboken. She remembers Zimmer pressing Kim for money for Sandy. Kim remembers saying you can\u2019t tie the two together,\u201d the source said. \u201cAnd she remembers Zimmer continuing to press and showing her a map of the city and pressing for aid for Sandy.\u201d Zimmer disputes that account and provided CNN with letters that she said back up her case. On April 23, she sent a letter to Christie\u2019s office that she argued says development and Sandy aid should not be connected. \u201cJust as shore towns are not being asked for development in exchange for protecting them from future storms, the solution to Hoboken\u2019s flooding challenges cannot be dependent on future development,\u201d the letter read. She sent another letter to his office on May 8  asking for help with funding pumps. Zimmer\u2019s conversation with Guadango happened just days later and the mayor said she believes the two events are related. \u201cWhen you look at all of the events together, you can see that it was a progression. It was a progression of pressure and she was sent in to really make that final message to me,\u201d Zimmer told CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d Guadagno spoke Monday before mayors whose towns were also affected by Sandy, a storm of historic proportions that heavily damaged shore and waterfront areas up and down the mid-Atlantic coastline. The federal government authorized billions in aid. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m surprised that Mayor Zimmer has chosen to mischaracterize a conversation I had with her about development and job creation in Hoboken,\u201d Guadagno said in remarks that appeared carefully planned to discredit Zimmer\u2019s allegations. Christie aides push back Mayor lashes out at Christie Mayor: Sandy funds held hostage Journal entries on Gov. Christie released Spotlights and scandal Christie spokesman Colin Reed said it was \u201ccategorically false\u201d that Sandy funds were withheld. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear partisan politics are at play here as Democratic mayors with a political ax to grind come out of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television,\u201d Reed said in a statement. Building their case against Zimmer, Christie\u2019s administration hosted a conference call for reporters Monday defending how Sandy funds were allocated. Marc Ferzan, executive director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Recovery and Rebuilding, said that her accounting is \u201ca mischaracterisation.\u201d After Sandy, Hoboken was 80% underwater. Zimmer said it received about $300,000 of the roughly $100 million in state funds the city requested for flood prevention. Ferzan said Hoboken has been approved for nearly $70 million in aid. But that aid was given mostly to individual residents and small businesses, not the city of Hoboken. The Hoboken allegation is the second to surface regarding Sandy money. A federal watchdog, the inspector general for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is looking at protocols around state spending for a marketing ad for Sandy recovery featuring Christie and his family. The Christie administration went with a firm that charged twice as much to produce the spot as another bidder. Christie marches on as controversy at home unfolds Ad firm head: We were asked about using Christie in post-Sandy campaign A different account The governor\u2019s spokesman also said the mayor and Christie have had a \u201cproductive relationship,\u201d noting an August tweet by Zimmer saying she\u2019s \u201cvery glad Gov. Christie has been our governor.\u201d Zimmer admitted to supporting Christie in the past, saying she is not a part of \u201cthe Democratic machine.\u201d But her comments over the weekend are a change from what she told CNN last week. She said then that she didn\u2019t think Sandy funds for her city were tied to any instance of political retribution. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was retaliation, and I don\u2019t have any reason to think it\u2019s retaliation, but I\u2019m not satisfied with the amount of money I\u2019ve gotten so far,\u201d Zimmer said. She did not mention her concerns about the redevelopment project. But Sunday morning, Zimmer told CNN she didn\u2019t speak out before because she didn\u2019t think anyone would believe her. CNN received images of journal entries that Zimmer said she wrote at the time. In one, Zimmer writes that the conversation with Guadagno left her upset and shattered the image she had of Christie. \u201cI thought he was honest, I thought he was moral \u2013 I thought he was something very different,\u201d the journal entry says. \u201cI am so disappointed \u2013 it literally brings tears to my eyes.\u201d See the journal entries CNN exclusive: Port Authority job created for Christie ally, source says Debate about redevelopment Zimmer\u2019s allegations center on a property owned by the Rockefeller Group, which had a plan for redevelopment of a three-block area of Hoboken that was rejected by the city\u2019s planning board. Instead, the panel voted to classify the area owned by the company as available for \u201crehabilitation,\u201d which results in fewer tax incentives. Aides and advisers to Christie have ties to Wolff & Samson, the law firm representing The Rockefeller Group. Wolff & Samson lobbyist Lori Grifa was a former commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, and Wolff & Samson\u2019s David Samson is chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and was appointed by Christie. Samson was recently served with a subpoena in the George Washington Bridge case by an investigative committee seeking relevant documents. Another investigation? The chairman of the Democratic-led investigative committee tasked with looking into the George Washington Bridge scandal weighed in as news of the Hoboken allegations spread. New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski said in a statement that the allegations were serious and have \u201ccertainly attracted our attention.\u201d \u201cI think what we\u2019re going to do first is have a conversation with her to make sure that we understand all of the accusations being made,\u201d Wisniewski told CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the first one to make a specific allegation about a specific event with somebody in particular in the governor\u2019s administration. I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for the committee to rush to any conclusions,\u201d he said. CNN\u2019s Chris Frates, Steve Kastenbaum and Dana Davidsen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "New Jersey state assembly releasing 907 pages of lane closure scandal documents Christie's Republican political allies may have created traffic mayhem to spite a Democrat A group of citizens has filed a class-action lawsuit against Christie Analyst: There may have been a crime, as a woman died amid the chaos This may turn into much more than just a political scandal. It may have seemed like a teenage prank at the time, but the blockage of bridge traffic as a possible act of partisan political revenge has put New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the middle of a serious legal stew. And the fire underneath it is just beginning to heat up for the Republican presidential hopeful, as the state assembly plans to post online 907 pages of documents related to the case Friday. State lawmakers questioned one of Christie\u2019s allies on Thursday, a former state official implicated in the scandal. So far, David Wildstein has repeatedly refused to answer, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Who's who in Christie bridge scandal Photos: Political dirty tricks Quotes from Christie apology Christie: I fired Kelly because she lied The legislators charged him with contempt for his lack of cooperation. But the dam could eventually break as lawmakers dig in their heels, analysts say. As long as Christie was telling the truth at a marathon press conference he held on Thursday, he should be able to step out of the caldron, analysts who spoke with CNN say. For nearly two hours the high-profile governor, who gained national recognition for his response to superstorm Sandy, answered questions from journalists, divulging many details. \u201cHe was pretty specific about what he knew and when he knew it,\u201d said CNN analyst Gloria Borger on The Lead with Jake Tapper. But if any of it doesn\u2019t jibe with other peoples\u2019 stories, information provided in documents or clues that pop up, experts say Christie could get dragged into civil and criminal lawsuits. One thing is certain.  The legislative inquiry into the alleged misdeeds that led to the traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge is just getting into gear. What happened to begin with? It was September and Christie was full steam into his re-election bid \u2013 which he won two months later.  Wildstein, who Christie appointed to a high position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, ordered the closing of two of the three lanes of traffic leading to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee. It held up motorists trying to make it into Manhattan and caused days of massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, where the Democratic mayor Mark Sokolich had declined to endorse Christie for re-election. Democrats speculated that the mayhem was political retaliation against Sokolich. Hearings ensued, and Wildstein resigned under pressure.  Then came Wednesday\u2019s revelation that a top Christie aide, Bridget Anne Kelly had e-mailed Wildstein before the closures, telling him, \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d \u201cGot it,\u201d Wildstein replied back. He e-mailed a comment that the parents of children stuck in school buses in the traffic jams were Democratic voters. Christie fired Kelly after the scandal broke. Possible prank, sure, but something to sue over? This was no fun and games for people who sat tormented for hours in traffic and missed important appointments, legal analyst Alan Dershowitz told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin. It did real damage. \u201cIt was utter chaos those days. People were pouring into the store, complaining,\u201d Debbie Minuto recalled Thursday in her shop, Binghamton Bagel Cafe, in the town of Fort Lee. \u201cThe bridge is a lifeline here. You take away the bridge, you take away our livelihood.\u201d What did Christie's press conf. accomplish? Fort Lee Mayor on Christie's apology Gov. Chris Christie's style: A bully? Can Christie survive the bridge scandal? That makes it a legal matter, Dershowitz said. \u201cThe law looks backwards and says: What causes these harms?\u201d he said. One group of residents from Bergen County, where Fort Lee is located, has already filed a class-action civil lawsuit against Christie. They want to be compensated for alleged wages lost, when they arrived late at work. Was a crime committed? A woman died at the time of the mayhem, and emergency workers trying to get to her to save her complained that the traffic jams slowed them down. Sokolich thinks there should be a criminal investigation into the incident, saying it put \u201cfolks in absolute danger.\u201d His Democratic colleague, New Jersey state Sen. Ray Lesniak, agrees but takes it a step further. He called for federal prosecutors to open an investigation into whether the lane closures were a factor in the woman\u2019s death. \u201cEndangering people\u2019s lives \u2013 that\u2019s not politics. That\u2019s why the U.S. attorneys have to get involved,\u201d he said. U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office spokeswoman Rebekah Carmichael, said it\u2019s \u201creviewing\u201d whether federal laws were violated. But Florence Genova\u2019s family doesn\u2019t seem to want to press charges. She was 91 when she went into cardiac arrest, and her daughter Vilma Oleri told CNN affiliate WABC that she didn\u2019t think the traffic was to blame. \u201cI really don\u2019t think so, no, I really don\u2019t. I think she was 91 and really believe in my heart that she was already gone when the ambulance got (to her house),\u201d she said. But Genova was not alone.  Paramedics red-flagged \u201cunnecessary delays for emergency services\u201d to the mayor on the second day of the lane closures. The traffic increased their reaction time in at least four cases. Legal analyst Dershowitz thinks a crime may have indeed been committed and prosecutors could land convictions against Wildstein, Kelly and anyone else implicated, \u201cparticularly if they can demonstrate if the woman died as a result of the traffic jam.\u201d Christie says he didn\u2019t know anything about this. How could this get him? If Christie\u2019s close associates are prosecuted or convicted, it could lead them to turn on Christie, Dershowitz said. Thursday\u2019s press conference was the longest and most candid in Christie\u2019s career, New Jersey public radio reporter told Jake Tapper. \u201cThis is absolutely extraordinary,\u201d he said.  Christie offered a lot of information to back up his claim that he knew nothing. At the same time, he may have given investigators fodder to work with, but also a lot for Wildstein and Kelly to contradict, should they open up to lawmakers who questioning them. \u201cThey may very well want to save themselves and say, \u2018Wait a minute; don\u2019t believe what the governor said,\u2019\u201d Dershowitz told Baldwin. Wildstein may have pleaded the Fifth initially, but that\u2019s normal in the beginning, Jeffrey Toobin told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your client testifying until he has seen all the documents available.\u201d But things could change. If lawmakers decide to go after Christie, they could offer Wildstein \u2013 or Kelly, if they question her \u2013 immunity. They could decide to save themselves at his expense, Toobin said. Anyone Christie fired may also try to get revenge. And if Christie really didn\u2019t know about alleged misdeeds, he could still be in hot water, Dershowitz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a concept in law called willful blindness,\u201d he said. It\u2019s enough to just suggest to people working for him to commit illegal actions on his behalf or to create an atmosphere that promotes such actions. Dershowitz said that it would be enough for the governor to say: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me; I don\u2019t want to know; just do what you have to do to take revenge. I don\u2019t want to know the details.\u201d CNN\u2019s Matt Smith contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Documents to be released are from a former Christie ally, an official says More than 1,000 pages of documents are to be released Friday morning, official says Fort Lee mayor tells CNN that he believes more still to come in scandal Governor says he is \"embarrassed and humiliated\" by conduct of aides New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s usual swagger and bluster were gone. In its place Thursday was an apologetic and contrite Christie trying to control an unfolding political scandal that has upended his administration over news one of his top aides and a political ally targeted a mayor with a scheme to tie up traffic in his town as punishment for not supporting their boss for re-election. \u201cI am who I am, but I am not a bully,\u201d Christie said during a nearly two-hour press conference where he distanced himself from the actions, saying \u201cI knew nothing about this\u201d and he had \u201cnothing to hide.\u201d But even as Christie worked to minimize the damage that could mean big problems should he run for President, the fallout could mount with word the New Jersey State Assembly committee looking into the scandal plans on Friday to release nearly 1,000 pages of documents collected in its investigation. Who's who in Christie bridge scandal Fort Lee Mayor accepts Christie apology Christie: I'm not a bully Quotes from Christie apology Photos: Political dirty tricks What is in those documents may add to the growing legal questions now facing the governor\u2019s administration, which is under scrutiny by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office, with the help of FBI investigators, to see if any federal laws were broken, a law enforcement source tells CNN. Christie\u2019s first stop after holding a news conference in Trenton was to the town that was targeted. \u201cI take him for his word,\u201d Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich said on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d about his talk with Christie, who he described as \u201cgracious and apologetic.\u201d One political analyst said the governor checked all the boxes an embattled national political figure must address if he wants to demonstrate credibility in a crisis. \u201cHe stood there and took it,\u201d said John King, CNN\u2019s chief national correspondent, who noted that Christie was uncharacteristically low key as he appeared to understand the gravity of the moment. \u201cIt was a very different Chris Christie.\u201d Christie \u201cstunned\u201d Hailed as a star within the Republican Party for his direct style that resonates with voters and considered someone with potential White House timber, the no-nonsense Christie is embroiled in an episode worthy of a bad Hollywood script. Top aides captured in e-mails swearing and talking tough about a small town mayor who didn\u2019t endorse the boss for re-election. Their response: use the authority of a transportation agency to alter traffic patterns at the head of the George Washington Bridge, creating days of gridlock in Fort Lee. It might\u2019ve been shaken off as an embarrassing political stunt, but officials say the tie-ups impacted public safety. Read the e-mails Christie\u2019s tone and message represented a valiant attempt to disconnect himself from the embarrassing events that have attracted the attention of federal prosecutors, simultaneously pleading ignorance and accepting responsibility. He said the buck stops with him but emphatically intoned that he had no knowledge of any aspect of the bridge controversy. \u201cI am stunned by the abject stupidity that was shown here regardless of what the facts ultimately uncover. This was handled in a callous and indifferent way,\u201d he said. Sen. Lesniak: 'This crosses a line' Mayor: This won't be good for Christie Chris Christie: Brash or a bully? Cupp: Christie already known as a bully He said he was \u201cdigging in\u201d and asking questions to find out what occurred. Legal questions Some of those answers may rest with the documents to be released by the New Jersey State Assembly committee. Among the documents expected to be posted online are 907 pages collected in response to the subpoena of former state official David Wildstein, then the highest-level appointee representing the state at the Port Authority, which operates the George Washington Bridge connecting New York and New Jersey, the committee spokesman said. CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said there was a lot still to unravel regarding communications between the parties and how the decision to disrupt traffic was made. \u201cThat question will be very important for Paul Fishman,\u201d Toobin said of the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. But Paul Callan, a CNN legal analyst, said he\u2019d bet a criminal case wouldn\u2019t materialize from the basic facts of the incident. But, one could be brought, if there\u2019s any attempt at a cover-up, he said. Fishman\u2019s office is working with the FBI\u2019s public corruption unit to see if any federal laws were broken, a law enforcement source told CNN. Does this mean Christie\u2019s presidential ambitions are dashed? \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Oxford University historian Timothy Stanley wrote in an opinion piece for CNN.com. \u201cHe\u2019s a resourceful politician and it\u2019s still many months before campaigning starts in earnest. But now, his opponents have a stick to beat him with.\u201d Christie, meanwhile, is facing legal action from Bergen County residents, who filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday against the governor and his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, as well as former Port Authority official Bill Baroni and Wildstein, claiming that because of the lane closure of the George Washington Bridge they were stuck in traffic and arrived late to work resulting in loss of wages. \u201cTo find out that the residents and the plaintiffs in this case were pawns in a political game is just disgraceful,\u201d Rosemarie Arnold, the attorney representing the six plaintiffs, told CNN. The plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages but the lawsuit did not state a specific dollar amount. Christie \u2018blindsided\u2019 by e-mails Christie said he was \u201cblindsided\u201d by the release of the e-mails and text messages on Wednesday that bolstered claims by Democrats that the traffic jams between September 9-13 were meant to punish Sokolich. Christie and his staff originally blamed the closures and the traffic delays on a mishandled traffic study, something he reiterated at his news conference. He said he didn\u2019t know if it was \u201ca traffic study that morphed into a political vendetta or a political vendetta that morphed into a traffic study.\u201d On the bridge: \u2018Those days\u2026 like a disaster\u2019 The incident inconvenienced motorists but also affected public safety, Fort Lee officials said. The emergency services chief in the town referred to one case in a letter to the mayor obtained by CNN involving paramedics who were delayed in reaching an elderly woman who had suffered a heart attack and died. She was, however, reached by an ambulance. Traffic snarl delayed EMS, official says Further details of the woman\u2019s death haven\u2019t been released and the mayor told CNN he hopes the traffic tie-ups weren\u2019t ultimately a factor. \u2018Time for some traffic problems\u2019 The correspondence subpoenaed by Democrats investigating the matter is the most damaging evidence so far supporting their assertions that the move was orchestrated because Sokolich didn\u2019t endorse Christie\u2019s candidacy in November. The exchanges began three weeks before access lanes to the bridge were closed, two months before Election Day. \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\u201d Kelly, Christie\u2019s deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, said in an e-mail to Wildstein. \u201cGot it,\u201d Wildstein replied. In another message about school buses with students on board caught in the traffic jams, Wildstein writes, \u201cthey are the children of Buono voters,\u201d apparently referring to Barbara Buono, Christie\u2019s Democratic opponent in the election that he won handily. Those cited in the series of e-mails and text messages did not respond to requests for comment or to verify the communications. Christie said he found out for the first time Wednesday that a member of his staff had been connected to the scandal and immediately fired Kelly. Wildstein, who left his job in December as the Christie administration\u2019s top appointee on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, refused to answer questions about the matter before a New Jersey Assembly committee that later held in him contempt. Christie said Sokolich \u201cwas never on my radar screen\u201d as someone whose endorsement he was seeking and expressed dismay at why anyone would try to retaliate against him. \u201cThis can\u2019t have anything to do with politics. I don\u2019t even know this guy,\u201d Christie said, adding that he would not be able to pick him out if he walked in the room. Sokolich called his meeting with Christie productive and took no satisfaction from the fallout now pummeling the governor and his administration. Sokolich said during \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d interview that \u201cwe\u2019re concerned there is more stuff and more issues to deal with\u201d regarding the scandal. Furious in Fort Lee In Fort Lee, Debbie Minuto watched Christie\u2019s apology and said the disruption hurt a lot of people. \u201cYou can\u2019t play with our bridge,\u201d she said. Jose Perez said the controversy illustrates the usual state of politics in the Garden State. \u201cIn the end, who pays? he asked \u201cThe people. We\u2019re the ones who pay for the political gains.\u201d Christie political woes Bridge firestorm could have bigger impact on Christie S.E Cupp, a Republican political strategist and CNN \u201cCrossfire\u201d host, said that Christie was \u201cvery believable\u201d and \u201chumble and contrite\u201d during his lengthy appearance that she noted would satisfy some people. \u201cHe\u2019s not completely out of the woods,\u201d Cupp said, noting that there are more questions to be asked. CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger said Christie did well, expressing humiliation and apologizing. But she said he did not answer why one of his top aides thought apparent retribution was a good thing to do. \u201cThe reasoning behind this still remains an issue,\u201d she said. Rep. Bill Pascrell, a Democrat whose congressional district includes Fort Lee, said the scandal goes beyond e-mails. \u201cWe went from joking about cones in the road to a very sad day,\u201d he said. \u201cI can assure you that this is only the beginning on what\u2019s going to be a long investigation into behavior that\u2019s reprehensible,\u201d Pascrell told CNN in an interview. As criticisms of Christie\u2019s management style of being heavy handed and petty come to the forefront, Christie said, \u201cI am not a bully.\u201d But he added that he is \u201csoul searching\u201d about why he created an environment in which his staff felt they had to lie to him. Ron Brownstein, CNN\u2019s senior political analyst and the editorial director for the National Journal, said the scandal doesn\u2019t necessarily disqualify Christie from running for President. But, he said \u201cthis is something that\u2019s going to go on.\u201d Democrats swarm Christie is now campaigning for fellow GOP governors as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and is seen as a prime political target for national Democrats. Christie said the scandal would not impact his role with the group. While Christie blamed his staff and accepted responsibility, he also praised his own response to the fallout, noting that he asked Bill Stepien, a sharp-elbowed strategist who managed Christie\u2019s two gubernatorial campaigns, to leave his organization and that he fired Kelly. In exchanges with Wildstein in the notorious e-mail chain, Stepien described the Fort Lee mayor as an \u201cidiot.\u201d The e-mails also suggested that Stepien was aware of the maneuvering by that led to the lane closures. \u201cThis is a huge, huge deal,\u201d said one Trenton insider. \u201cThis was the governor\u2019s guy.\u201d When asked about possible White House aspirations, Christie said that is the last thing on his mind. \u201cI am not preoccupied with that job,\u201d he said. Other documents raise questions, too Opinion: Controversy tarnishes Christie\u2019s image CNN\u2019s Chelsea J.

            "article_content": "Why racial conflict may be good for America Ferguson protests are ultimately about power, scholar says Some say protests produce \"racial grifters\" Nation may abandon democracy in the future, some say The protests in Ferguson, Missouri, have been described as a mirror into contemporary America, but they are also something else: A crystal ball. Look past the headlines \u2013 the debates over race and police militarization that have surfaced after the killing of an unarmed black youth by a white police officer \u2013 and one can glimpse America\u2019s future, some historians and political scientists say. Talking to your kids about race Race relations a focus in ferguson 'Are you afraid to talk about race?' No one is talking about an impending race war or a police state, but something more subtle. Unless Americans re-examine some assumptions they\u2019ve made about themselves, they argue, Ferguson could be the future. Assumption No. 1: Tiger Woods is going to save us It\u2019s called the \u201cbrowning of America.\u201d Google the phrase and you\u2019ll get 18 million hits. By 2050, most of the nation\u2019s citizens are expected to be people of color, according to the Pew Research Center. Dig beneath the Google links and one can detect an emerging assumption: Racial flashpoints like Ferguson will fade in the future because no single race will be dominant. You could call it the Tiger Woods effect. The New American will claim multiple racial origins like Woods, the pro golfer. Demographic change will accomplish what a thousand national conversations on race could never do: lessen the sting of racial conflict. A dramatic increase in interracial marriages will change the racial landscape as more people cross racial and ethnic lines to marry. But that change won\u2019t be a cure-all, says Rory Kramer, a sociology and criminology professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. He says racial progress is not inevitable with the browning of America. \u201cI don\u2019t want to deny the optimism,\u201d Kramer says. \u201cI deny the assumption that it will happen without effort.\u201d So does research from a prominent American sociologist. Robert Putnam, author of \u201cBowling Alone,\u201d says his studies of multiracial neighborhoods in America show that more diversity initially erodes community. There\u2019s too much profit in it for the racial grifters and the media for anyone to try to heal us. We never talk about how far we\u2019ve come. John Nolte, a conservative columnist for Breitbart.com, on the prospect of racial harmony. In his 2007 paper, \u201cE Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-first Century,\u201d  Putnam says members of multiracial communities initially tend to expect the worst, distrust neighbors and withdraw. \u201cResidents of all races tend to \u2018hunker down,\u2019 \u201d Putnam writes. \u201cTrust (even of one\u2019s own race) is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friends fewer.\u201d If Americans want to live in a tranquil country that\u2019s free of racial conflict they would have to change their character and history, another scholar says. They would have to become like Iceland. There are no Fergusons there. The United Nations commissioned a report last year that concluded its citizens are among the most contented in the world. Iceland is so free of conflict that the nation was shocked last year when a police officer shot a man to death. It was the first time police had killed anyone in Iceland in 70 years. Most police in Iceland don\u2019t carry guns. But that happiness comes at a price, says Lisa Corrigan, director of the Gender Studies Program at the University of Arkansas, who cites the Iceland comparison. Iceland has one of the most homogeneous populations in the world \u2013 everyone looks the same.  And they deliberately keep it that way. \u201cIceland is one of the happiest places in the world,\u201d Corrigan says. Corrigan doesn\u2019t accept the notion that most white people will welcome the browning of a country that she says was built on white male supremacy. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause power is shifting and white people think that their whiteness is property to be defended.\u201d Assumption No. 2: We\u2019ll always have democracy Some observers have reduced the events in Ferguson to race and class divisions, but there are others who say the protests are ultimately a question about whether democracy can work. The political makeup of Ferguson has been well-documented. Two-thirds of the city\u2019s population is black. The mayor and police chief are white; as are five of the six city council members. There are three blacks out of 53 people in its police department. Many Americans love the concept of the melting pot, the notion that every ethnic group eventually becomes a part of the country\u2019s mainstream. Yet some scholars say you can\u2019t have harmony in a multiracial community until hard choices are made about power: what group gets what and how. Kramer, the Villanova professor, quotes the 19th century abolitionist Frederick Douglass to make his point. \u201cPower concedes nothing without demand. It never has and it never will.\u201d Because people tend not to share power, there will be more Fergusons in America\u2019s future: isolated communities ignored by leaders and harassed by heavily armed police forces, says Charles Gallagher, a sociology professor at LaSalle University in Pennsylvania. The nation won\u2019t have a vibrant middle class because of persistent income inequality; it will primarily be the rich and poor, he says. The poor won\u2019t vote because they\u2019re too disenchanted, and politicians will ignore the concerns of most Americans because wealthy people control politics, Gallagher says. \u201cI see us looking more and more like Latin America,\u201d he says. The courts could intervene on behalf of racial minorities and the poor. The citizens of Ferguson could, for example pressure their city leaders to place more blacks in their police force. Yet the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court has changed the legal landscape to make such efforts more difficult, Gallagher says. The court has consistently ruled against any diversity efforts hinting at racial preferences. \u201cThis particular court is hostile to the idea of using race in any situation to honestly address ongoing inequalities,\u201d Gallagher says. Racial minorities who feel like they\u2019re excluded won\u2019t find much empathy from ordinary white Americans either, says Kramer, the Villanova professor. He says many whites operate under this assumption: If they gain, I lose. That assumption, he says, is played out in Southern states that refuse to accept Obamacare, in the rise of voter ID laws and in the political version of white flight \u2013 where predominantly white communities break away from their counties to incorporate their own cities when too many minorities move into nearby neighborhoods. There are two ways to change a democracy. One is to change its leaders and the other is its people. And the people are changing. Anthony P. Carnevale, director of Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce He says American democracy was called a \u201cnoble experiment\u201d for a reason: People didn\u2019t know if democracy, let alone a multiethnic democracy, would work. Democracy in America could look more like how protesters describe Ferguson: a place where government maintains the fa\u00e7ade of a democracy, but doesn\u2019t function like one. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that we\u2019re still in the experimental stage,\u201d Kramer says. \u201cMy fear is that we\u2019re not going to actually gain true democracy.\u201d Assumption No. 3: It\u2019s always about race Some see another type of frightening scenario for America based on Ferguson. To them, it\u2019s premature to say that Darren Wilson, the Ferguson officer who shot Michael Brown to death, was motivated by racism. They see Ferguson as a stage for the rise of \u201cracial grifters.\u201d That\u2019s the term John Nolte, a columnist for Breitbart.com, uses to describe leaders who rallied to the side of black protesters in Ferguson. \u201cThey go into these areas and scream racism before the facts are out and all of a sudden, there\u2019s a racial issue,\u201d he says. \u201cThey grift on race to profit from it, like Al Sharpton.\u201d Nolte rejects the notion that some white Americans fear the nation becoming a majority brown country. He says he was one of a handful of whites who lived in a Latino community in Los Angeles for years, and he never had a problem. His wife is Latina, and his extended family has people of all races. He says he\u2019s \u201cpro-miscegenation,\u201d a term he borrows from his late friend, Andrew Breitbart, because ultimately \u201cpeople are people.\u201d \u201cThe American people get along very well,\u201d Nolte says. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you have situations like you have in Ferguson \u2013 and the racial grifters move in and the media moves to back them up \u2013 that things turn into what they do.\u201d Nolte says there\u2019s a hidden motive behind the furor in racial flashpoints like Ferguson, and that media organizations like CNN are complicit. He says the furor over the black teenager Trayvon Martin\u2019s death in Florida took place just before the last presidential election. The uproar over Ferguson is taking place just before this year\u2019s midterm elections. \u201cIf these things aren\u2019t happening every few months, if we start to heal and look past racial divisions, the Democrats lose 25% of the black or Hispanic vote and they\u2019re done as a national party.\u201d The country won\u2019t get past its racial divisions anytime soon because it\u2019s the only way Democrats can win, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s too much profit in it for the racial grifters and the media for anyone to try to heal us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe never talk about how far we\u2019ve come.\u201d Racial divisions will remain a permanent part of America\u2019s future as long as the media tells black people that the criminal justice system is stacked against them, says Ben Shapiro, author of  \u201cBullies: How the Left\u2019s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America.\u201d According to a 2013 report released by the Missouri attorney general, African-Americans are highly over-represented in crime statistics. They accounted for 93% of arrests after traffic stops, 92% of searches and 86% of traffic stops in Ferguson. \u201cThe cure is not to tell people that the criminal justice system is stacked against them; the cure is to minimize criminal activity and identify lawbreaking officers and prosecute them,\u201d says Shaprio, who is also editor-in-chief at the online magazine TruthRevolt. Shapiro says he is more concerned about another way America may decline in the future: the erosion of values like hard work, marriage and education. \u201cThe reality is that if you want to escape poverty, you only have to make a couple of decisions: Finish school, don\u2019t have a baby out of wedlock and get a job \u2013 that\u2019s it,\u201d he says. Assumption No. 4: We need to get past our racial differences Whenever a racial flashpoint erupts in America, weary people on both sides of the issue tend to ask the same questions: When are we going to get past race? Why can\u2019t we all just be Americans? Can\u2019t we all just get along? But what if we shouldn\u2019t just get along? What if the constant conflict among different races and points of view is, in some ways, good for America? That\u2019s the perspective of Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Carnevale is an authority on affirmative action in higher education and an economist. He says society can\u2019t have diversity without disruption and that scholars know from research that \u201cfrom that tension comes great creativity.\u201d The trick is to harness that tension for good, Carnevale says. \u201cIf you have only white men sitting in a room making decisions, you get low-quality decisions and very little change,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you include a woman and a minority in that room, the whole process changes. You get more quality and innovation.\u201d He says America is a successful country partly because its citizens never stop arguing. Those clashes force people to think, abandon what no longer works and innovate. \u201cQuiet, peaceful communities rarely invent things,\u201d Carnevale says. \u201cThe Romans failed because they kept marrying each other and they all looked the same. Their habits became set. There was no challenge to the elites.\u201d Protests like those in Ferguson will continue because many whites still believe that \u201cwhat happens to somebody is about them, and is not about the circumstances in which they live.\u201d Yet eventually there will be a \u201cthird wave\u201d of racial minorities, Carnevale says. And those people will bring a different sensibility to the way we regard race and class. \u201cThere are two ways to change a democracy,\u201d he says. One is to change its leaders and the other is to change its people. \u201cAnd the people are changing.\u201d",

            "article_content": "New Jersey state assembly releases 907 pages of documents Friday on lane closure scandal Christie's Republican political allies may have created traffic mayhem to spite a Democrat A group of citizens has filed a class action lawsuit against Christie Analyst: There may have been a crime, as woman died during the chaos This may turn into much more than just a political scandal. It may have seemed like a teenage prank at the time, but the blockage of bridge traffic as a possible act of partisan political revenge has put New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the middle of a serious legal stew. And the fire underneath it is just beginning to heat up for the Republican presidential hopeful, as the state assembly plans to post online 907 pages of documents related to the case Friday. State lawmakers questioned one of Christie\u2019s allies on Thursday, a former state official implicated in the scandal. So far, David Wildstein has repeatedly refused to answer, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. What we\u2019ve learned from document released Who's who in Christie bridge scandal Photos: Political dirty tricks Quotes from Christie apology Christie: I fired Kelly because she lied The legislators charged him with contempt for his lack of cooperation. But the dam could eventually break as lawmakers dig in their heels, analysts say. As long as Christie was telling the truth at a marathon press conference he held on Thursday, he should be able to step out of the caldron, analysts who spoke with CNN say. For nearly two hours the high-profile governor, who gained national recognition for his response to superstorm Sandy, answered questions from journalists, divulging many details. \u201cHe was pretty specific about what he knew and when he knew it,\u201d said CNN analyst Gloria Borger on The Lead with Jake Tapper. But if any of it doesn\u2019t jibe with other peoples\u2019 stories, information provided in documents or clues that pop up, experts say Christie could get dragged into civil and criminal lawsuits. One thing is certain.  The legislative inquiry into the alleged misdeeds that led to the traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge is just getting into gear. What happened to begin with? It was September and Christie was full steam into his re-election bid \u2013 which he won two months later.  Wildstein, who Christie appointed to a high position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, ordered the closing of two of the three lanes of traffic leading to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee. It held up motorists trying to make it into Manhattan and caused days of massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, where the Democratic mayor Mark Sokolich had declined to endorse Christie for re-election. Democrats speculated that the mayhem was political retaliation against Sokolich. Hearings ensued, and Wildstein resigned under pressure.  Then came Wednesday\u2019s revelation that a top Christie aide, Bridget Anne Kelly had e-mailed Wildstein before the closures, telling him, \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d \u201cGot it,\u201d Wildstein replied back. He e-mailed a comment that the parents of children stuck in school buses in the traffic jams were Democratic voters. Christie fired Kelly after the scandal broke. Possible prank, sure, but something to sue over? This was no fun and games for people who sat tormented for hours in traffic and missed important appointments, legal analyst Alan Dershowitz told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin. It did real damage. What did Christie's press conf. accomplish? \u201cIt was utter chaos those days. People were pouring into the store, complaining,\u201d Debbie Minuto recalled Thursday in her shop, Binghamton Bagel Cafe, in the town of Fort Lee. \u201cThe bridge is a lifeline here. You take away the bridge, you take away our livelihood.\u201d Fort Lee Mayor on Christie's apology Gov. Chris Christie's style: A bully? Can Christie survive the bridge scandal? That makes it a legal matter, Dershowitz said. \u201cThe law looks backwards and says: What causes these harms?\u201d he said. One group of residents from Bergen County, where Fort Lee is located, has already filed a class-action civil lawsuit against Christie. They want to be compensated for alleged wages lost, when they arrived late at work. Was a crime committed? A woman died at the time of the mayhem, and emergency workers trying to get to her to save her complained that the traffic jams slowed them down. Sokolich thinks there should be a criminal investigation into the incident, saying it put \u201cfolks in absolute danger.\u201d His Democratic colleague, New Jersey state Sen. Ray Lesniak, agrees but takes it a step further. He called for federal prosecutors to open an investigation into whether the lane closures were a factor in the woman\u2019s death. \u201cEndangering people\u2019s lives \u2013 that\u2019s not politics. That\u2019s why the U.S. attorneys have to get involved,\u201d he said. U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office spokeswoman Rebekah Carmichael, said it\u2019s \u201creviewing\u201d whether federal laws were violated. But Florence Genova\u2019s family doesn\u2019t seem to want to press charges. She was 91 when she went into cardiac arrest, and her daughter Vilma Oleri told CNN affiliate WABC that she didn\u2019t think the traffic was to blame. \u201cI really don\u2019t think so, no, I really don\u2019t. I think she was 91 and really believe in my heart that she was already gone when the ambulance got (to her house),\u201d she said. But Genova was not alone.  Paramedics red-flagged \u201cunnecessary delays for emergency services\u201d to the mayor on the second day of the lane closures. Legal analyst Dershowitz thinks a crime may have indeed been committed and prosecutors could land convictions against Wildstein, Kelly and anyone else implicated, \u201cparticularly if they can demonstrate if the woman died as a result of the traffic jam.\u201d Christie says he didn\u2019t know anything about this. How could this get him? If Christie\u2019s close associates are prosecuted or convicted, it could lead them to turn on Christie, Dershowitz said. Thursday\u2019s press conference was the longest and most candid in Christie\u2019s career, New Jersey public radio reporter told Jake Tapper. \u201cThis is absolutely extraordinary,\u201d he said.  Christie offered a lot of information to back up his claim that he knew nothing. At the same time, he may have given investigators fodder to work with, but also a lot for Wildstein and Kelly to contradict, should they open up to lawmakers who questioning them. \u201cThey may very well want to save themselves and say, \u2018Wait a minute; don\u2019t believe what the governor said,\u2019\u201d Dershowitz told Baldwin. Wildstein may have pleaded the Fifth initially, but that\u2019s normal in the beginning, Jeffrey Toobin told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your client testifying until he has seen all the documents available.\u201d But things could change. If lawmakers decide to go after Christie, they could offer Wildstein \u2013 or Kelly, if they question her \u2013 immunity. They could decide to save themselves at his expense, Toobin said. Anyone Christie fired may also try to get revenge.",

            "article_content": "Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that in order for his party to win in 2016, his party will have to run on big government, \u201cnot run away from it.\u201d During a long, scripted speech at the National Press Club in Washington, the boisterous New Yorker heralded government \u2013 and its programs to aid the middle class \u2013 as what \u201cunites\u201d the party. \u201cTogether, Democrats must embrace government,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIn order to win in 2016, Democrats must embrace government, not run away from it.\u201d Schumer\u2019s argument was that Democrats must regain the mantle as the party for the middle class by focusing laser-like on populist legislation the benefits a large number of voters and sticks to a coherent, simple message. This \u201cstrategy must become our blueprint. Indeed it should unite Democrats from Elizabeth Warren to Hillary Clinton to Joe Manchin,\u201d Schumer argued, noting politicians across the Democratic spectrum. During a speech that was as much a history lesson as it was guiding vision, Schumer faulted Democrats for, in his opinion, fumbling the mandate they won in 2008 by focusing on the Affordable Care Act \u2013 also known as Obamacare \u2013 at the outset of the Obama administration. \u201cAfter passing the stimulus, Democrats should have continued to propose middle class-oriented programs and built on the partial success of the stimulus, but unfortunately Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe took their mandate and put all our focus on the wrong problem - health care reform.\u201d He added, \u201cThe focus on Obamacare gave anti-government forces and the Republican Party new vigor and new life, at least temporarily\u201d and led to their wins in 2010. Schumer told the assembled reporters that the Affordable Care Act was \u201ca good bill\u201d that \u201cshould have come later.\u201d Instead, Schumer said the reason he opposed pushing health care early in 2009 was that he law did not affect enough of the electorate to be worth the political capital it cost. \u201cTo aim a huge change in mandate at such a small percentage of the electorate made no political sense,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cSo when Democrats focused on health care, the average middle class person thought, \u2018the Democrats are not paying enough attention to me.\u2019\u201d Schumer\u2019s remarks come at a turbulent time for Democrats. The 2014 election saw massive Republican wins across the country. Democrats fell deeper into the minority in the House and Republicans took back the Senate. Republicans, who have argued the nation wants smaller, less involved government \u2013 and point to their 2014 election win \u2013 seized on the senator\u2019s speech. \u201cSchumer\u2019s message has an old car stank to it,\u201d said Brad Dayspring, strategist with the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cEmbracing a dysfunctional government that is 17 trillion in debt is a thumb in the eye to middle class voters and young Americans, but reflects how out of touch Democrats are heading into 2016.\u201d",

Let\u2019s not forget, they were a team of rivals,\u201d one ally told The Hill. \u201cNow is the time to further enunciate these differences.\u201d Clinton allies expressed similar sentiments to CNN. The thinking goes that if the president is unpopular, Clinton should start distance herself now, as opposed to months down the road when it may be harder. 2.) Run to Obama Clinton allies have also been telling reporters that because Republican pickups in Senate create a larger target for both her and the President, it would make sense for them to join forces. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s legacy is now entirely dependent on the election of a Democratic successor as president who will protect and extend it, not demolish it,\u201d David Brock, the chairman of a pro-Clinton super PAC, told the Washington Post. \u201cShould she run, they both now have a common enemy in a Republican Congress that will define politics through 2016.\u201d Simon Rosenberg, the president of the New Democrat Network, echoed Brock in the same Washington Post story. \u201cLooking ahead to 2016, I think it would be wise for the entire party, but particularly its presidential aspirants, to learn the lesson of [Al] Gore 2000 and the 2014 midterms,\u201d Rosenberg said, referencing two elections where Democrats ran away from their own president. \u201cYou cannot run away from the president of your party.\u201d 3.) Find a rationale David Axelrod, President Barack Obama senior political adviser who at one point was hell bent on beating Hillary Clinton, told an audience in Washington, D.C. on Thursday that in order to win in 2016, Hillary Clinton needs to \u201cnot rely too much on that we do have an electoral vote advantage and demographic advantages.\u201d Instead, Axelrod argued that Clinton need to find a rationale for her campaign, and do it quickly. \u201cI think the danger for Secretary Clinton is that, as was the case in 2007, her candidacy is out in front of the rationale for it,\u201d Axelrod said, urging the former secretary of state to get out of the \u201ccocoon of inevitability.\u201d 4.) Deal with your baggage Rudy Giuliani visited Politico on Wednesday, and the former presidential candidate revealed he had his own advice for Hillary Clinton. \u201cShe\u2019s a candidate who, with her baggage, can be beaten by the right candidate who handles it the right way and by the right campaign who handles it the right way,\u201d the former New York City mayor said. \u201cAs a first lady she tried one thing and failed,\u201d he added, referencing her push to pass universal healthcare early in her husband\u2019s first presidential term. 5.) Ride the populist wave Robert Reich, a Clinton cabinet official from the 90s and friend to both Bill and Hillary, told MSNBC that in order to win in 2016, the former first lady needed to focus on economic populism far more than her husband did in his presidential runs. Reich said that Bill Clinton got away by \u201calluding\u201d to issues like economic inequality and the decline of the middle class. For Hillary, on the other hand, \u201cit\u2019s got to be central.\u201d \u201cNow the situation has changed,\u201d he said. Clinton has been using populist rhetoric in her speeches and regularly focused on minimum wage and economic inequality while stumping for candidates in 2014.",

            "article_content": "Warren and two other women senators joined the Senate Democratic leadership team Reid said he picked Warren for the leadership \"to be Elizabeth Warren\" Reid said women have improved the Senate's effectiveness Firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren joined Senate Democratic leadership Thursday after Senate Democrats convened Thursday to assemble a leadership team for their role as the incoming minority caucus. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who was elected to continue leading the Democratic caucus in the minority, said he tapped Warren to join Thursday because of who she is. \u201cI expect her to be Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Reid said explaining what he expects the Massachusetts senator to do as part of the leadership team. Warren, known for hitting populist notes in stump speeches, said she was excited to join the Democratic leadership to continue fighting for the middle class. \u201cWall Street is doing very well, CEOs are bringing in millions more and families all across this country are struggling,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to make this government work for the American people.\u201d And flanked by Warren and the two other women who are joining his leadership team (Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Debbie Stabenow), Reid said women in the Senate have brought positive change to the legislative body. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this institution change for a lot of reasons,\u201d Reid, who has been in Congress for three decades, said. \u201cOne reason it has changed for good is because of women. Women think differently than men.\u201d Reid also insisted that Democrats would stray from replicating what he described as an obstructionist Republican minority once his party loses the gavel. \u201cThis is not get-even time,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI do not intend to run the Democratic caucus like the Republican caucus has been run in the minority.\u201d A Senate Democratic leadership aide said earlier that Reid would like Warren to join the leadership because he \u201ctrusts her and her judgment.\u201d And while not every Senate Democrat wants Warren, a high-profile, liberal junior senator in a leadership post, the leadership aide said \u201cReid will get his way.\u201d Sen. Jon Tester of Montana also joined the leadership team and will head the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee as Democrats look to reclaim the majority in 2016. One Democratic senator, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said the inclusion of Warren is a sign the party mistakenly moved away from core Democratic stances \u2013 such as defending Obamacare on the campaign trail \u2013 and needs to be more focused on middle class issues like raising the minimum wage. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody better than Elizabeth at talking to people who feel this sense of very real economic disenchantment,\u201d Murphy said. Despite the mid-term election losses, Reid and the other top members of the Democratic leadership were all re-elected, although two centrist members of the caucus voted against Reid. \u201cWhen you have an election like this, common sense says we need to change things,\u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri.  \u201cThe voice was very loud and unmistakable that most Americans, and most Missourians, want us to change things.  To me that means changing leadership and it was just that simple.\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin said the Democrats\u2019 problems are deep rooted and change is needed. \u201cI voted for a change and that change was not voting for this leadership,\u201d Manchin told reporters. The top GOP leaders were all re-elected: Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky will become majority leader, flanked by Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi beat out Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada to lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

            "article_content": "Sen. Mitch McConnell criticizes U.S.-China deal as more of Obama's \"ideological war on coal\" Sen. Jim Inhofe says deal unfair and knocks Chinese pledge as \"hollow and not believable\" Under the agreement, the U.S. will cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26-28% by 2025 China vows to peak carbon emissions output, produce more energy from renewable sources by 2030 Top congressional Republican leaders quickly criticized the U.S.-China climate change pact to cut carbon emissions that President Barack Obama announced while traveling in Asia. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and Sen. Jim Inhofe, who is expected to chair the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, slammed the agreement in statements released shortly after the deal was announced Wednesday. \u201cOur economy can\u2019t take the President\u2019s ideological War on Coal that will increase the squeeze on middle-class families and struggling miners,\u201d McConnell, who hails from the coal state of Kentucky, said. \u201cThis unrealistic plan, that the President would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs.\u201d U.S. and China reach new starting point President Barack Obama announced Wednesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping that the U.S. will cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26-28% by 2025 while China committed to creating more energy from zero-emission sources and begin reducing its emissions footprint by 2030. Boehner called the deal another example of Obama\u2019s \u201cjob-crushing policies.\u201d \u201cAnd it is the latest example of the president\u2019s crusade against affordable, reliable energy that is already hurting jobs and squeezing middle-class families,\u201d Boehner said in a statement Wednesday. Inhofe criticized the deal as unfair and knocked the Chinese pledge to produce 20% of its energy from zero-emission sources as \u201chollow and not believeable.\u201d \u201cThe United States will be required to more steeply reduce our carbon emissions while China won\u2019t have to reduce anything,\u201d Inhofe said. Skepticism over U.S.-China deal China overtook the U.S. within the last decade as the world\u2019s top polluter following decades of the U.S. as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. McConnell and Inhofe called attention to the midterm election results, both noting that \u201cthe American people spoke up against\u201d Obama\u2019s policies. The two senators also made a pledge of their own, vowing to rein in regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency, a common target for Republicans. McConnell will take the helm of a freshly won Republican majority in the Senate in January. And while McConnell and Obama have both vowed to try and work together, climate change regulation is likely to remain a contentious point with little common ground between Obama and GOP leaders. The agreement does not require congressional ratification, but a senior Obama administration official said \u201cleading climate deniers\u201d in the GOP could try and stop the initiative through legislation. \u201cCongress may try to stop us, but we believe that with control of Congress changing hands we can proceed with the authority we already have,\u201d the official said. The plan will also offer incentives in the United States to build up solar and wind power. \u201cConsumers and businesses will save literally billions of dollars,\u201d a senior administration official said.

            "article_content": "The House of Representatives remained solidly in Republican hands after Tuesday\u2019s midterm election. The GOP was expected to keep the House majority this cycle. But the party overcame a significant Democratic fundraising advantage and was able to beat back challenges to many of their members in swing districts and take control of some seats in some areas long held by Democrats. This year, the battle for the House was fought on a relatively small terrain \u2013 in roughly 40 competitive seats.  After state legislatures reshaped congressional districts in 2010, the vast majority of House\u2019s 435 seats became more solidly blue or red. Republican incumbents and challengers framed the 2014 midterm election as a referendum on President Barack Obama. His record low approval ratings served as a drag on Democrats across the country, and many candidates tried to detach themselves from the president\u2019s record and turn the focus to local economic issues. Democrats argued House GOP members were more concerned with helping powerful special interests than protecting the middle class.  But the president loomed large over the campaign, and questions about how he handled a series of international and domestic crises in the late fall \u2013 from the threat from the terrorist group ISIS in the Mideast to the outbreak of Ebola \u2013 made it tough for the Democratic message to break through. Rep. Greg Walden, chair of the House Republicans\u2019 campaign committee, frequently told reporters that the 2014 midterm elections mirrored the contest in 2006. That year, Democrats tied GOP members to President George W. Bush and the unpopular Iraq war, and won control of the House. The tea party wave that put Republicans in the majority in 2010 had already sent most of those fiscally conservative House Democrats packing. But more Democratic losses this year means the ranks of centrist Democrats in the House are virtually non-existent. House Speaker John Boehner added to his GOP majority, but an influx of more conservative members means increased headaches for him in the next Congress.  Since he took the gavel in 2011, Boehner has struggled with defections from a bloc of his own members who repeatedly demanded a harder line on slashing federal spending and confronting Senate Democrats and the president on health care and other issues. Boehner has already outlined a five part agenda he wants to tackle in the next Congress and said he wants the GOP bills that stalled in the Democratic Senate over the last few years to be revived.  His plan includes reducing the debt, reforming the tax code, eliminating government regulations, instituting legal reforms, and expanding education opportunities. House GOP leaders could have their work cut out for them.  Many House conservatives are suspicious of Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who they view as too much of a Washington insider and too willing to negotiate with the Obama administration or Senate Democrats.  If Republicans are able to capture the upper chamber Boehner and McConnell will likely wrestle with a vocal group from the right flank of their party over legislative priorities. With a more liberal House Democratic caucus, the task of negotiating any significant legislation across an even wider ideological divide will grow even tougher.  Democrats will have their eye on regaining control of the House in 2016, when they believe the political environment will be better for them.  The incentive to join Boehner to help pass bipartisan bills won\u2019t be very high, and a more polarized House could increase gridlock. Despite the low number of competitive House races in this election cycle, the Center for Responsive Politics found that nearly $800 million was spent by candidates and outside groups on campaigns for the 2014 election cycle. Rep. Steve Israel, chair of the House Democrat\u2019s campaign arm, told reporters early Tuesday night, even before results began to come in for 2014, that he could \u201cguarantee the House will be in reach in 2016.\u201d See the House results",

            "article_content": "Independent Eliot Cutler hasn't cracked 20 percent in recent polls for the governor's race. Democrats say Cutler is siphoning off votes from Dem. candidate Rep. Mike Michaud. Cutler said there's no 'bromance' between him and Republican Gov. Paul LePage. Don\u2019t expect a chest bump on election night this year in Maine. Independent governor candidate Eliot Cutler denied a close relationship between himself and the Republican incumbent, Paul LePage, during their final debate Tuesday night. \u201cI would not suggest \u2013 and I think he would agree, that we don\u2019t have a bromance,\u201d Cutler told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash while distancing himself from the man he high-fived and hugged during their first debate earlier this month. \u201cFour years ago \u2026 we ended up with Paul LePage as governor. We shouldn\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d LePage agreed there\u2019s a lack of brotherly love between the two in a humorous moment during an hour-long debate, sponsored by WMTV, CNN, and WABI, along with Democratic candidate Rep. Mike Michaud. It\u2019s a tight race between LePage and Michaud. Cutler \u2013 who hasn\u2019t registered above 20 percent in most recent polls \u2013 has caused ire among Pine Tree state Democrats, who think he\u2019s splitting the anti-LePage vote that would coalesce around Michaud in a two-person race, ensuring a Democratic victory. \u201cI would not suggest \u2013 and I think he would agree, that we don\u2019t have a bromance.\u201d Eliot Cutler, independent governor candidate from Maine, on his relationship to Gov. Paul LePage LePage, who doesn\u2019t deny some benefits of the third party candidate, agrees Cutler is taking away from a major party candidate\u2019s smooth victory \u2013 his own. \u201cIf it was Mike Michaud versus Paul LePage, the election\u2019s over,\u201d he said about his own head-to-head strength against the six-term congressman. The candidates sparred that way as well, with LePage and Michaud saving their harshest attacks for each other, letting Cutler attack on topics he wanted or stay out of the ones he didn\u2019t. While talking broadly about infrastructure, health care, and taxes, Michaud\u2019s attacks over LePage\u2019s attempts to cut some government programs prompted some of the unvarnished candor he\u2019s earned a reputation for using when provoked. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to all this rhetoric for about several months now; I\u2019m tired of it,\u201d LePage said. \u201cThis man doesn\u2019t know what honesty is, and that\u2019s all I can tell you.\u201d Michaud showed some grit in his own rebut about LePage\u2019s frankness. \u201cWhat the governor says is anything, whether it\u2019s factual or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThis man doesn\u2019t know what honesty is, and that\u2019s all I can tell you.\u201d Maine Gov. Paul LePage on opponent Rep. Mike Michaud Cutler struck right down the middle, ignoring the sparks and proposing to find a way to pay for Michaud\u2019s proposals and avoid more of LePage\u2019s cuts. Asked about the current Ebola outbreak in America, Michaud struck at the state\u2019s preparedness, criticizing LePage for leaving two top infectious disease positions open at the Maine Center for Disease Control. \u201cThe governor has failed us as far as keeping these positions vacant,\u201d Michaud said. LePage didn\u2019t take the bait and quickly turned to the work he\u2019s done since the crisis began to prepare the state and respond to two suspected cases that did not test positive. \u201cAs your governor I\u2019m not going to be irresponsible and scare the Maine people,\u201d he said. \u201cI am assured by the doctors, and by the professionals at the hospitals, that we are as prepared as we can be.\u201d On this, Cutler agreed with Michaud that the positions needed to be filled but made a sharp turn to health care reform, spending very little time on the topic of Ebola. LePage also stood by his comments from the previous night\u2019s debate about people making a wage of $100,000 not qualifying as wealthy. \u201cThe governor doesn\u2019t understand what hardworking men and women are going through here in the state of Maine.\u201d Rep. Mike Michaud, Democratic candidate for Maine governor \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s off-mark, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wealthy, I really don\u2019t,\u201d LePage said. \u201cI defy anybody to tell me if you\u2019re making make $100,000 and you\u2019ve got two kids going to college, and you want to give to try to give them a good start in life, that that\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d Michaud \u2013 who prides himself as one who fights for the middle class \u2013 pounced. \u201cThe fact that the governor said last night that $100,000 is not a lot of money \u2013 it IS a lot of money,\u201d Michaud said. \u201cThe governor doesn\u2019t understand what hardworking men and women are going through here in the state of Maine.\u201d Whoever wins will need appeal to Maine\u2019s love of bipartisanship, which has given Independent Angus King to the governor\u2019s mansion twice and a current senate seat in Washington. To do that though, perhaps a little more bromance is needed. CNN\u2019s Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "President Obama is set to hit the trail for Democratic candidates The 2014 midterm elections take place in less than four weeks He won't be going to some deeply red states, an official says He has largely been off the trail because of his low job approval numbers Just months after President Obama was described by his own advisers as a \u201cbear\u201d on the loose, there are few midterm sightings of the man once dubbed the \u201ccampaigner in chief\u201d by his Republican adversaries. The President has spent much of the 2014 cycle behind closed doors, either cloistered inside the White House cocoon dealing with a seemingly endless series of crises and scandals, or at private fundraisers, urging donors to write checks to top Democratic Party campaign and political action committees. New CNN Poll: The ISIS Impact Tough road for Democrats to keep the Senate Axelrod: Obama's ballot line was mistake Panetta attacks Obama on ISIS, leadership That political calendar will evolve somewhat as Election Day draws near, a White House official told CNN. For starters, the President will appear at events with Democratic candidates in the coming weeks, the official said. Obama will make the argument for policies aimed at middle class voters, just as he did in last week\u2019s speech on the economy in Chicago. \u201cThe President has already succeeded in making a pretty aggressive case about why that\u2019s important for the country, and I would anticipate that in the context of the upcoming elections you\u2019ll hear the President make that case again,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. Carter criticizes Obama on ISIS: \u2018We waited too long\u2019 Even though the White House is not quite ready to announce Obama\u2019s upcoming campaign stops, there are a few states that can be crossed off the map. Races in Louisiana, Arkansas, Alaska, where incumbent Democratic senators face uphill battles to win reelection, remain at the top of the Obama no-go list. \u201cThere are definitely deeply red states in play this cycle where it won\u2019t make sense to send the President,\u201d a White House official said. Democratic senator can\u2019t judge Obama\u2019s Ebola handling So far, Obama is also avoiding crucial Senate races in states where he won decisive victories in the past.  The White House has yet to signal any plans to send the President to Iowa, a critical battleground he captured twice: in 2008 and 2012. Instead, first lady Michelle Obama will travel to Iowa Friday to appear with Democratic congressman Bruce Braley, who remains locked in a close race with state Sen. Joni Ernst for the seat vacated by liberal stalwart Tom Harkin. \u201cWe defer to the campaigns who know their states best how to win,\u201d a White House official said. Can lame ducks fly? Advice for Obama on his last two years Another sign of Obama\u2019s drag on his party\u2019s midterm hopes can be found in North Carolina, a critical Obama victory in 2008 that he and his party failed to translate into a more lasting Democratic incursion into southern red states in the years that followed. Despite North Carolina\u2019s potentially strong base of Democratic support from African-Americans and countless college-aged voters, Obama has become a major obstacle for the state\u2019s endangered incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan. Best of the vice president's 'Bidenisms' How the Huxtables helped elect Obama Obama to immigration activists: Cover me Her opponent, state House Speaker Tom Tillis, repeatedly tried to link Hagan to the President during a debate Tuesday in the state\u2019s prosperous Research Triangle area. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to make this election about his policies,\u201d Tillis said in the debate. Bill Clinton plays savior for Arkansas Democrats That remark was a reminder of a comment made by Obama at a speech on the economy last week in Chicago: \u201cThese policies are on the ballot \u2013 every single one of them,\u201d the President said.  His long-time adviser, David Axelrod, called that part of the speech a \u201cmistake.\u201d Michael Steel, a spokesman for U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and a midterm strategist for the North Carolina Republican Party, described the Obama factor as \u201chuge\u201d in Tuesday\u2019s debate. \u201cHer worst moments in the debate were when she refused to distance herself from the President,\u201d Steel said of Hagan. Poll: In North Carolina Senate race, libertarian could be spoiler A key Democratic Party operative, who asked to speak on condition of anonymity, said inserting Obama into crucial campaign contests carries some risk.  Not only does the President\u2019s unpopularity drive up enthusiasm among conservatives, the strategist said. It may encourage some moderate Democrats to stay home. \u201cEven Obama supporters, they\u2019re disappointed in him,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cWe can\u2019t find a way to motivate them.\u201d The first lady, Vice President Joe Biden, and Bill and Hillary Clinton are seen as better alternatives. Will same-sex marriage become a 2014 issue? Even though Biden has spent the last several days calling leaders in the Middle East to clarify his comments that appeared to suggest Arab nations were partly responsible for the rise of ISIS, the vice president appears to be in demand among Democrats. \u201cSo what if he f***ed up?\u201d one Democratic strategist said, noting the party\u2019s base is attracted to the vice president\u2019s \u201cUncle Joe\u201d shoot-from-the-lip style.  Biden just wrapped up an event on Tuesday with Amanda Renteria, a congressional candidate in California. He is scheduled to appear with Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Wednesday. Six times Joe Biden aimed for the truth and caused a headache The one campaign setting where the president appears to thrive are fundraisers.  A White House official provided a list of approximately 50 fundraisers where Obama has spoken to Democratic donors this year.

            "article_content": "GOP reviving politics of fear as nation worries about terror threat Former Sen. Max Cleland tells CNN: \"That's exactly what they did to me\" The politics of fear. Until recently, that seemed so 10 years ago, right after September 11, 2001. That is, until ISIS started beheading Americans. Now, just six weeks before Election Day, security concerns could be a September surprise that shakes up the midterms. Across the country GOP candidates on the ballot in November are using the threat posed by ISIS to dust off an old playbook \u2013 attack Democratic opponents as weak on national security. The sun had barely come up Tuesday after a night of new United States and coalition airstrikes in Syria, when New Hampshire Republican Senate challenger Scott Brown released an ad using an ominous image of a fighter holding a black ISIS flag, while Brown talks about the threat from \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d Brown, a retired member of the Army National Guard, touts his own experience in the ad before putting up side-by-side pictures of his Democratic opponent, Jeanne Shaheen, and President Obama, saying, \u201cPresident Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the threat, not me.\u201d This ad could hit particularly close to home in New Hampshire; James Foley, the American journalist beheaded by ISIS, was from the Granite State. Tea party favorite trying to win in Iowa Dana Bash interviews Robert Menendez Is Congress avoiding ISIS debate? Related: James Foley\u2019s mother \u201cappalled\u201d by U.S. government But Republican strategists tell CNN that ads like this are driven by voter data from focus groups and polling all over the country, which signals that security is a rising priority among voters, especially with married women who Republicans rely on in midterm elections. Neil Newhouse, a GOP pollster who does work in several competitive races this year, tells CNN security is now a \u201ctop-tier issue that no one saw coming.\u201d CNN Poll: Spike in terror fears In addition to his work for campaigns, Newhouse has polled for years on what he calls \u201cWalmart Moms\u201d \u2013 female voters with children 18 or younger at home and shop at Walmart at least once a month. During focus-group interviews Newhouse and colleagues conducted earlier this month in Arkansas and Iowa, two key battleground states this November, \u201cWalmart Moms express specific concern about ISIS,\u201d Newhouse said in a memo about the data. \u201cThis is an unusual for swing voters and not a common theme we have heard in previous groups,\u201d the memo said. Christie drops 85 lbs., but thinking big Chicken dispute hits Iowa campaign Fierce fight for Kentucky heats up Rep. Greg Walden, the Oregon Republican in charge of getting more House Republicans elected in November, also told reporters last week that national security issues were \u201cpopping\u201d in opinion polls. The National Republican Congressional Committee is jumping on that \u2013 rolling out four security-related television commercials last Friday in competitive races, including spots that warned Democrats\u2019 positions make them \u201cdangerous\u201d in the face of new threats from ISIS. Walden cited \u201csecurity moms\u201d as a key group he believes are already gravitating towards Republican candidates. The issue, however, could ensure they go from supporting Republicans to actually making sure to vote. Two new ads were released on Tuesday \u2013 more proof that Republicans are all in on this new security strategy. Back to the Future? Both Republican and Democratic campaign strategists say this mirrors the approach the GOP used effectively in 2002 and 2004. To former Georgia Sen. Max Cleland \u2013 it is eerily familiar. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what they did to me,\u201d Cleland told CNN in a telephone interview. In 2002, the year after 9/11, his GOP opponent Saxby Chambliss ran ads calling him weak on national security. Despite the fact that Cleland was a Vietnam War veteran who lost three of his four limbs on the battlefield, Chambliss\u2019 attacks resonated with Georgia voters and Cleland lost his Senate seat. Cleland says there were a lot of other reasons for his defeat, but that certainly was a factor. So what is his advice to Democrats like Shaheen who are coming under fire on the New Hampshire campaign trail now? \u201cFight like hell and tell the people of New Hampshire this is b*llsh*t,\u201d said Cleland. \u201cThe Republicans will use any advantage. If the economy was sucking air they would do that now,\u201d Cleland added. Shaheen did in fact release a statement Tuesday pushing back on Brown\u2019s ad questioning her national security chops, saying \u201cI have supported and will continue to support aggressive action to destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria.\u201d She\u2019s not the only Senate Democrat under attack on security. Republicans in North Carolina are hitting Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan for failing to focus on the terror threat. Hagan is locked in a tight race with GOP candidate Thom Tillis. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and Tillis tweeted out a chart on Monday that showed that Hagan had missed half of the hearings on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and as chair of a subcommittee on emerging threats, had not held a hearing on the terror group ISIS at all. A spokesman for Hagan acknowledges she did miss Armed Services Committee hearings because they conflicted with other Senate work. But Democrats deny that Kagan ignored ISIS in the subcommittee she chairs, saying she held several hearings on counterterrorism, and that Iraq and al Qaeda have been a major focus of all of them. ISIS is such a big threat, the Armed Services Chairman wanted to chair hearings on the issue before the entire committee. Hagan aides are fighting back by slamming Tillis for not taking a position on whether to arm and train Syrian rebels, which Hagan voted for. Obama offers \u2018broad vision of American leadership\u2019 in U.N. speech Democrats Push Back There is some evidence Democrats are worried that what they call \u201cthe politics of fear\u201d could work against them. Former Iowa state Rep. Staci Appel, who was targeted by the NRCC on Friday, scrambled an ad of her own on the air to respond. The GOP used footage of Appel\u2019s response to a question in a recent debate, and suggested she would not support taking away U.S. passports from suspected terrorists. Appel responded in her new ad by speaking directly to camera and calling her GOP opponent David Young\u2019s charge \u201ca lie.\u201d \u201cI support revoking passports for terrorists,\u201d said Appel in the ad. Still Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg argues the concept of a \u201csecurity mom\u201d \u2013 the kind of voter being targeted in these new ads \u2013 doesn\u2019t exist. She says it\u2019s a myth. \u201cWe should not conflate an expression of concern about terrorism with it as a driver of vote choice,\u201d says Greenberg in a blog for the Huffington Post. \u201cVoters typically look to the President and to the military for security, not to members of Congress,\u201d says Greenberg. \u201cMoreover, there is a world of difference between where we are now and where we were just after the 9/11 attacks.\u201d On that, GOP pollster Neil Newhouse agrees, calling today\u2019s security concerns much lower than they were in the two elections after 9/11. Still, he insists it has resonance \u2013 especially given how close the ISIS beheadings happened to Election Day. The chairman of the Democratic Campaign Committee, Rep Steve Israel of New York, says he still believes that middle class economics, not national security, is the dominant factor in how most people will vote. Share your view on the airstrikes Israel also argues that this GOP strategy will turn off independent and swing voters in key races. \u201cThey [independent voters] want to be united during a time of threat and don\u2019t want a political party to divide Americans,\u201d Israel told CNN. \u201cUsing ISIL as a political tool is meant as a strategy to turn out their base, but the inherent problem in pushing partisanship is losing persuadable voters,\u201d he said, predicting it would \u201cbackfire\u201d But Walden, Israel\u2019s GOP counterpart, says talking security on the campaign trail is a legitimate issue and fair game. Walden told reporters that its\u2019 important for GOP candidates to engage voters on issues they are talking about, and recent developments in the Mideast have made national security one everyone is talking about.

            "article_content": "Vice President Joe Biden travels to Iowa, a key state in presidential campaigns He speaks at an event for Nuns on the Bus, a social justice campaign Biden trails Hillary Clinton in recent polls for the Democratic nomination in 2016 Vice President Joe Biden headlined a small Catholic event Wednesday in Des Moines, Iowa, stoking speculation about his presidential aspirations. Biden used most of his speech to tout Nuns on the Bus, a group of liberal Catholic nuns who convey their message of social justice on road trips. But his praise for the group came in the form of stressing likely Democratic issues in the midterm elections: the importance of health care and growth of the middle class. \u201cThis nation is stronger when every voice is heard and everyone has a seat at the table,\u201d Biden said on the steps of the Iowa Capitol. \u201cRight now, only some of the voices are being heard, and as a result over the last couple of decades, things have gotten out of whack, folks.\u201d Biden says use of \u2018offensive\u2019 term Shylock was a poor choice To those in the audience, the presidential politics of the vice president\u2019s visit were obvious. Biden has admitted he is thinking about running for president, and a recent CNN/ORC International poll found that 15% of Iowa Democrats would like him to be the Democratic nominee in 2016. The vice president\u2019s trip comes on the heels of Hillary Clinton\u2019s much-talked about trip Sunday to the Harkin Steak Fry, the annual outdoor fund- raiser run by Sen. Tom Harkin. The visit was Clinton\u2019s most obvious step toward a presidential run since leaving the State Department in 2013. In the same CNN/ORC poll, 53% of Iowa Democrats favored the former secretary of state. \u201cJoe tells it like it is, and we are blessed to have him,\u201d said Craig Stark from Clive, Iowa, who said he hopes Biden runs in 2016. As for how he feels about Clinton, Stark said, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have dynasties like Bush dynasties. \u2026 To me we need new blood.\u201d The crowd also featured some of Biden\u2019s most ardent supporters from his short-lived 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cJoe Biden knows how to tell the truth, whether it is the politically correct thing to say or not,\u201d said John Olsen, who proudly said he supported Biden in the 2008 caucuses. \u201cYou will become a fan of Joe Biden if you ever get a chance to meet him. He is the most personal, down-to-earth, lovable guy.\u201d Clinton\u2019s weekend visit was the first time she had been in Iowa since 2008, but Biden is no stranger to the Hawkeye State. The vice president last visited a year ago when he spoke at the Harkin Steak Fry, the most important annual event for Iowa Democrats that is widely seen as a must-stop for Democrats considering a run at the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you come to speak at the steak fry, a whole lot of people seem to take notice. I don\u2019t know why the hell that is,\u201d Biden joked then. \u201cYou\u2019ve attracted the entire national press corps here.\u201d Biden has also made a point to acknowledge Iowa on a regular basis. Biden called John Lundell, the new mayor of Coralville, Iowa, to congratulate him on his victory in November. And in May, Biden stopped by a party of Iowans in Washington for a lobbying trip. Wednesday\u2019s speech was not Biden\u2019s only stop in Iowa. During his visit, the vice president did a rope-line photo session with supporters of local Democratic campaigns, including congressional ones, according to campaign sources in Iowa. The photo session was seen as a perk for supporting local Democrats. Biden\u2019s speech was the kickoff of the latest initiative from Nuns on the Bus in which the group will encourage voters in 36 cities along a 5,252-mile route to turn out and vote in the 2014 midterms. The vice president focused a great deal on what Democrats are talking about ahead of the election: the poor and middle class. \u201cThings are out of whack,\u201d Biden said about the tax system in the United States. \u201cIt comes down to a simple question of fairness. Americans have always done best when we acted as one America. Because when we do, the nation succeeds\u201d He added: \u201cIt is time for a fair tax structure \u2026 one that values hard work as much as inherited wealth. \u2026 It is time to close these tax loopholes, folks.\u201d Nuns on the Bus was also active around the 2012 midterms. The group organized a multistate tour to bring attention to Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s proposed budget cuts for Medicare and other social welfare programs. Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of the group behind the bus tour, told CNN that Biden\u2019s attendance was meant to encourage civic engagement but said the event was \u201cnot partisan.\u201d \u201cRight now, we are just doing what Pope Francis challenges us to do,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHe says the heart of the problems of our society and our world is inequality and what we have to do is respond to the needs of the poor and those who are left out.\u201d Campbell didn\u2019t comment about Biden\u2019s presidential chances, but she said she had an idea about why he agreed to attend the Nuns on the Bus event. \u201cEvery time I have seen him, he tells me that Catholic sisters help keep him Catholic,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI think part of the reason he is coming is his own nourishment and his support of us.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren told Bill Moyers in 2004 that she briefed Hillary Clinton about bankruptcy Clinton helped veto a bankruptcy bill. \"I never had a smarter student,\" Warren said Warren said as senator, Clinton changed position because of the financial services industry The 2004 exchange shows how Warren's changed, too -- she's now less candid about Clinton In the context of 2016, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren are rivals for the Democrats\u2019 presidential nomination whose every word about each other is scrutinized and picked apart. But Warren and Clinton have been on the national stage for years, and before they were ever considered rivals, they met each other in the late \u201990s. Warren spoke about the meeting in a 2004 interview on Bill Moyers\u2019 \u201cNOW on PBS\u201d show. Warren reflects glowingly of Clinton as first lady but also bluntly talks about how Clinton\u2019s election to the Senate in 2000 changed the former secretary of state. In 1998, Warren \u2013 an expert and professor on bankruptcy law \u2013 wrote an op-ed for The New York Times titled \u201cBankrupt? Pay Your Child Support First,\u201d about how the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000 would disproportionally hurt women and families trying to collect alimony checks from their ex-husbands. 'Candidates' duel in Op-Eds Richardson: Clinton would win over Warren Bernie Sanders runs to left of Clinton The piece, Warren tells Moyers, was eventually read by then-first lady Clinton, whose office subsequently set up a meeting with the professor in Boston. \u201cAfter she\u2019s finished her speech, we\u2019re ushered into a tiny, little room somewhere in the bowels of this hotel, and just the two of us. They close the door. Mrs. Clinton sits down. We have hamburgers and french fries,\u201d Warren says. Warren adds: \u201cAnd she (Clinton) says, \u2018Tell me about bankruptcy.\u2019 And I got to tell you, I never had a smarter student. Quick, right to the heart of it. I go over the law. It\u2019s a complex law. Went over the economics. Showed her the graphs, showed her the charts. And she got it.\u201d According to Warren, at the end of the briefing, Clinton stood up and said: \u201cProfessor Warren, we\u2019ve got to stop that awful bill.\u201d Warren opinion: What happened to the middle class? The first lady went back to Washington and became a strong proponent of killing the bill. In \u201cLiving History,\u201d her memoir about her time as first lady, Clinton writes: \u201cproposed bankruptcy reform moving through Congress threatened to undermine the spousal and child support many women depended on.\u201d She writes, \u201cMissing from this debate, I discovered, was any discussion of what happens to women and children who depend on legally required child and spousal support that is not being paid.\u201d President Bill Clinton would go on to veto the measure, a win that Warren says Hillary Clinton \u201crightly should\u201d take credit for. But then Warren\u2019s interview with Moyers takes a turn as the professor reflects on how Clinton changed when she won a U.S. Senate seat in 2000 and voted in favor of a similar bankruptcy bill in 2001. \u201cAs Senator Clinton, the pressures are very different,\u201d Warren says. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-financed industry. \u2026 She has taken money from the groups, and more to the point, she worries about them as a constituency.\u201d Elizabeth Warren in 2016? Republicans take notice Clinton is not the only one who was changed by the U.S. Senate, however. Warren, who since 2004 has gone on to become a senator from Massachusetts, was far more candid about Clinton in her 2004 interview than she was in an interview with Yahoo\u2019s Katie Couric this week. \u201cYou know, I worry a lot about the relationship between all of them: regulators, government and Wall Street,\u201d Warren said when asked if Clinton was \u201ctoo cozy\u201d with Wall Street. Couric then pressed Warren: \u201cBut what about Hillary Clinton in particular?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she responds. \u201cI worry across the board.\u201d Warren co-authored opinion: We need to rein in \u2018too big to fail\u2019 banks",

            "article_content": "Tea party dream of ousting the President not realistic Republican leaders try to tamp down far right's expectations Democrats happy to raise money off the issue Analyst says nullifying elections is \"just not how America works\" It\u2019s the wildest dream of tea party extremists: the ultimate political comeuppance for the liberal President they love to hate. Since the day Barack Obama got elected to the White House, they have wanted to force him out. First, it was the birth certificate. Then, it was the bailouts. A succession of other allegedly impeachable issues followed: IRS targeting, the Benghazi terrorist attack, executive branch overreach. But it\u2019s not going to happen, even if Republicans take back the Senate and retain their House majority in the November congressional elections. Here\u2019s why: House approves lawsuit against Obama Boehner: No GOP plans to impeach Obama No chance: The numbers just don\u2019t add up. Under the most optimistic election result for Republicans, they would be far short of the two-thirds Senate majority needed to convict Obama if the House passed articles of impeachment. Also, a CNN/ORC International Poll last week showed nearly that two in three respondents opposed impeaching the President. GOP leaders such as House Speaker John Boehner know all that, and so they\u2019re trying to tamp down the expectations of their conservative base. \u201cWe have no plans to impeach the President,\u201d Boehner said this week. \u201cWe have no future plans.\u201d GOP-led House authorizes lawsuit against Obama House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who may have presidential ambitions in 2016, also quashed the possibility, saying Wednesday that \u201cthis does not rise to the high crimes and misdemeanors level\u201d of impeachment. \u2018Stop just hatin\u2019 all the time\u2019: Meanwhile, Obama and Democrats talk up the threat to raise money and inspire their supporters to turn out in November. \u201cDon\u2019t boo. Vote,\u201d Obama told a Kansas City, Missouri, crowd that voiced its displeasure Wednesday over GOP tactics he criticized. The President cited the vote by House Republicans authorizing Boehner to sue him over executive actions, saying Congress should instead be passing legislation. \u201cThey\u2019re mad because I\u2019m doing my job,\u201d Obama said of his Republican foes, urging them to \u201cstop just hatin\u2019 all the time.\u201d Top House Democrat: \u2018You bet we\u2019re going to run\u2019 on impeachment In debate before Wednesday night\u2019s vote, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi made sure to link the lawsuit proposal to possible impeachment down the road, calling it a first step to trying to oust the President next year. The issue resonates with Democratic supporters, according to Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The group has raised $7.6 million online since Boehner announced the lawsuit plan just over five weeks ago, he said. \u201cYou bet we\u2019re going to run on a Congress that is just obsessed with lawsuits, suing the President, talking about impeaching him instead of solutions for the middle class, talking about jobs and infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u2018Not how America works\u2019:  It all makes for grand Washington theater in an election year but reflects deeper political undercurrents, particularly for a right wing already divided between diehard conservatives and more moderate Republicans. Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller called impeachment a \u201cfarfetched\u201d maneuver that could cause independent voters leaning Republican now to instead vote Democratic in November. \u201cIt reflects in the Republican Party the idea that if you lose an election, you can use every means possible to nullify the result,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not how America works.\u201d Jonathan Chait, a writer who predicted four years ago in a New Republic article that House Republicans would vote to impeach Obama before his presidency ended, said Wednesday that he now doubts that will happen. Missteps by Republicans, including primary defeats of viable candidates by conservative extremists and the government shutdown they forced last year, \u201creally convinced the establishment that they couldn\u2019t indulge the base on all its flights of fancy,\u201d Chait said. GOP pivot: Now Boehner and others want to steer their base away from impeachment, he said, noting that they fear getting pushed into holding a vote that would be politically damaging. In dismissing an impeachment move, Boehner and Ryan sought to shift the blame for any discussion about it onto Democrats and the White House. Boehner called it a Democratic fundraising \u201cscam,\u201d adding, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year\u2019s elections.\u201d Obama lambastes Republicans for \u2018hatin\u2019 all the time\u2019 Asked about the accusation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a list of Republican legislators who have discussed impeaching Obama in recent months, including Reps. Steve King of Iowa, Ted Yoho of Florida and Steve Stockman and Blake Farenthold of Texas. The challenge to Boehner and other GOP leaders is to find a middle path between tea party demands to impeach Obama and less extreme options for action, such as the lawsuit. An impeachment effort after the November election would dominate Washington in the final two years of Obama\u2019s presidency, posing possible benefits and risks. It would divert attention from congressional dysfunction contributing to dismal approval ratings but also could cause the public to blame Republicans for exacerbating that dysfunction. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of tools at our disposal,\u201d Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said, citing such steps as cutting funding for some parts of government disproportionate to the problems. \u201cNor do I think you ought to do things in a legislative sense to harass the President,\u201d said Cole, who is a Boehner ally. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a disagreement between the two branches, and this is not uncommon. You go to court, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeking to do.\u201d Nixon: The impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon and his subsequent resignation still rankle many Republicans today, 40 years later. It was an event that made efforts to remove a sitting president part of routine political discussion in America. A GOP-led House voted to impeach President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction in 1998. The Senate acquitted him on both charges, with none of the minority Democrats voting to convict, and he stayed in office. Today, any Republican with presidential ambitions \u2013 such as Ryan, perhaps \u2013 wants to avoid making impeachment a reflex response to dissatisfaction with the White House, Schiller noted. \u201cIf you want to be president some day,\u201d she said, \u201cthe last thing you want is for Congress to be able willy-nilly to impeach you.\u201d CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh, Kevin Liptak and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton called Obama's guiding foreign policy principle too simplistic Obama didn't take the former secretary of state's criticism personally, an adviser says Those within his inner circle admit the President has had problems articulating his policy It sounds like advice offered by parents to teenagers on prom night: Don\u2019t do stupid stuff. But it also is an important guiding foreign policy principle of the President of the United States. Ever since the President uttered the phrase during an off-the-record discussion with reporters earlier this year \u2013 the actual words were a bit saltier and later confirmed privately by administration officials \u2013 foreign policy critics have seized on \u201cDDSS\u201d as a crystallization of the Obama Doctrine. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is only the latest critic of the \u201cDDSS\u201d comment, describing the remark in an interview with The Atlantic magazine as too simplistic. \u201cGreat nations need organizing principles, and \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not an organizing principle,\u201d she said. U.S. to expand military role in Iraq Obama slams criticism on Syria policy Clinton tries to mend ties with Obama Clinton called Obama on Tuesday, to \u201cmake sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him,\u201d her spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement. The two will meet at a party hosted by Democratic Party adviser Vernon Jordan on Martha\u2019s Vineyard on Wednesday evening, after she holds a book signing on the island. In an interview with CNN, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes insisted that \u201cDDSS\u201d is not the \u201centire foreign policy\u201d of the Obama administration. But he maintained the expression has substance. \u201cIt means think carefully before you get into military interventions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a lesson of the last 10 years that the American people have internalized \u2013 that we have to be very careful when it comes to the application of military force, that we\u2019re not putting U.S. troops in harm\u2019s way without a clear plan and limited objectives for that effort.\u201d Opinion: Hillary Clinton pummels Obama\u2019s foreign policy Rhodes said the President did not take the criticism from Clinton personally. \u201cI think their relationship is very resilient. They\u2019ve been through so much together,\u201d he said. What hand will al-Maliki play in Iraq Shaped by more than a decade of war Clinton\u2019s apparent support for a more hawkish U.S. posture comes as Obama\u2019s foreign policy has absorbed withering criticism in recent weeks. But her potentially more interventionist approach carries its own set of risks, diplomatic and political analysts caution. \u201d \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 ought to be emblazoned on the foreheads of all future presidents and secretaries of state,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former State Department adviser during both Democratic and Republican administrations. Miller said \u201cDDSS\u201d is less a doctrine than it is a presidential mission statement that is shaped by more than a decade of war. \u201cStripped to its essence, after protecting the homeland, it should be U.S. foreign policy\u2019s second commandment,\u201d he added. Expert: More advisers won't beat ISIS Hillary slams Obama's foreign policy Hillary Clinton swings at Obama \u201cI view that as a political summary \u2026 much like \u2018It\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u2019 \u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, said, comparing \u201cDDSS\u201d to the middle-class battle cry coined by Bill Clinton strategist James Carville during the 1992 presidential election. Schiff said the former secretary of state\u2019s comments do not reflect a political break from the President, arguing the perception of a conflict just makes \u201cgood copy.\u201d Opinion: Clinton, Obama both wrong The President\u2019s strategy on crises ranging from Syria to Iraq and Ukraine offers a sharp contrast to Republicans who \u201cact first and think last,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe risks of becoming fully entangled in Iraq are tremendous,\u201d he added. The President\u2019s cautious approach is nothing new. A line can be traced from \u201cDDSS\u201d to the anti-Iraq war speech he delivered as an Illinois state senator in 2002. \u201cWhat I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war,\u201d Obama said at the time. Scars from 2008 primary still remain It was that 2002 speech that endeared Obama to the liberal base of the Democratic Party, in part because of then-Sen. Clinton\u2019s support for the Iraq war. The policy battle over Iraq that later erupted between Obama and Clinton in their fight for the party\u2019s nomination ultimately resulted in a Democrat returning to the White House. But the divide left deep scars between the two camps that were still healing even as Clinton unleashed her critique of Obama\u2019s worldview. That difficult history is why Clinton\u2019s comments to The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg came as a shock to one senior Democratic strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Specifically disturbing, the strategist said, was the former secretary of state\u2019s insistence that Obama\u2019s lack of support for the Syrian opposition gave rise to the ISIS militants in Iraq. \u201cWhy you\u2019d want to do that, I have no idea,\u201d the prominent, non-Obama affiliated strategist said of Clinton\u2019s plea for more direct U.S. involvement in Syria. Obama: New government must unite Iraq Clinton breaks with Obama policy McCain: Not just against Obama Citing the nation\u2019s reluctance to plunge back into Middle East conflicts, the strategist added, \u201cPolitically, Obama\u2019s right.\u201d In a flashback to \u201908, Obamaworld lunged to the President\u2019s defense Tuesday, in a tweet that appeared to tweak Clinton. \u201cJust to clarify: \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 means stuff like occupying Iraq in the first place, which was a tragically bad decision,\u201d former Obama adviser David Axelrod tweeted. Better job communicating its strategy Still, even the President\u2019s own advisers acknowledge that Obama has had a difficult time clearly articulating his foreign policy doctrine. During his overseas trip to Asia this year, Obama used a baseball metaphor to explain his reluctance to intervene militarily against a variety of threats, including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who crossed a \u201cred line\u201d set by the President barring chemical weapon use. That caution \u201cavoids errors,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou hit singles, you hit doubles; every once in a while, we may be able to hit a home run.\u201d After much of Washington pounced on the sports analogy, White House aides began plotting out a more thoughtful speech on American leadership that would be delivered at West Point. Before that address, Rhodes conceded to The New York Times that the administration could do a better job of communicating its strategy. \u201cPeople are seeing the trees, but we\u2019re not necessarily laying out the forest,\u201d Rhodes said. Obama told the cadets at West Point the U.S. should be willing to intervene, but not overreach, acting alone only when necessary. \u201cJust because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail,\u201d Obama said, opting to switch metaphors. The apparent struggle to neatly encapsulate the President\u2019s strategy is not lost on his critics. \u201cI do think the administration is showing some signs of a little bit of fatigue,\u201d Brookings Institution analyst Michael O\u2019Hanlon said in a recent interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a little more ambition frankly because the world senses that this President is too disengaged,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon added. A now more ambitious Obama is engaged in Iraq, risking what his aides have long described as his post-Bush legacy of \u201cending wars, not starting them.\u201d As past presidents have learned in Iraq, it is \u201ceasy to get in, hell to get out,\u201d Schiff said.",

            "article_content": "Progressives see Clinton as closer to the banks than to the middle class Clinton's record on national security also makes them wary Liberals like Elizabeth Warren and Martin O'Malley are getting some buzz on the left To prove she wasn\u2019t just an opportunist hoping to use a U.S. Senate seat in New York as a ticket to bigger things, then-first lady Hillary Clinton tried to show voters that she cared about their values and views \u2013 she listened. More than a year before the 2000 election, Clinton sat in farmhouses and in community centers, listening to voters\u2019 needs and concerns and their problems with government. Many liberal and progressive activists don\u2019t trust Clinton because they think she sides with big banks and big money instead of the middle class and they\u2019re wary of her on national security. With a Clinton presidential campaign a possibility, they want the same treatment New York voters got. What would cause Clinton not to run for president? Running to the left of Clinton Hillary hints at 2016 on 'Daily Show' Concerned about Elizabeth Warren? \u201cIf there was an actual, authentic \u2018I am going to listen to you about your issues\u2019 from Clinton, instead of kind of pounding the drum of inevitability and stampeding over the left on her way to assumed victory, that would be effective,\u201d said Sally Kohn, a progressive activist, CNN contributor and Clinton critic. Until then, the trust deficit between Clinton and the left of her party will grow, Kohn and other liberals predict. Activists point to Clinton\u2019s voting record in the Senate, where she voted to authorize the Iraq war and increase domestic surveillance. They say that and decisions her husband made while president, like the Defense of Marriage Act and the authorization of the North American Free Trade Agreement, give her little street cred among liberals and populists. 5 things we learned from Bill Clinton interview Possibly the biggest concern among liberals is Clinton\u2019s coziness with Wall Street, their big bogeyman. Since leaving the State Department in 2013, she has spoken at events sponsored by Wall Street giants like Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and Ameriprise Financial, and during her Senate runs and 2008 presidential run, Clinton defended lobbyists. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has been aggressive on the banks,\u201d said Nelini Stamp, a progressive political organizer from New York. \u201cWhen I think of Hillary Clinton, I actually think she is in bed with some of the banks and Wall Street is her ally.\u201d There is also an overarching suspicion among liberals that Clinton is saying what she needs to get elected, but would govern differently. \u201cYou wonder if it is a pivot or whether she is saying what the moment demands,\u201d Kohn said. Starting in May, before Clinton crisscrossed the country selling her book \u201cHard Choices,\u201d the former secretary of state started to talk about populist and liberal issues like college affordability and income inequality. Zelizer: Are Democrats afraid of the income inequality issue? Clinton told an audience at the liberal New American Foundation in May that \u201cthe dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach\u201d and because of that, \u201cmany Americans understandably feel frustrated, even angry.\u201d Bachmann: Clinton should be concerned Is Clinton experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Bill Clinton on Hillary and Asia tour Clinton has also recently labeled college affordability \u201cone of the biggest problems we have in the country,\u201d and says if she were elected president she would \u201ctackle growth, which is the handmaiden of inequality.\u201d People close to her have started to trumpet her record on pay equity and the minimum wage. \u201cShe has come with a more populist tone because she knows what people want to hear,\u201d Stamp said. Asked if she trusts Clinton when she talks about income inequality, Stamp said bluntly, \u201cRight now, not that much.\u201d Clinton would back limits on money in politics Clinton\u2019s changing message has been overshadowed by gaffes during her book tour, like countering questions about her wealth by saying her family was \u201cdead broke\u201d when it left the White House. At the same time, possible opponents from the left \u2013 like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 have generated more buzz among liberals as alternatives to Clinton. Other than changing her tune, Clinton hasn\u2019t been quick to address liberals who have questions for her. Instead of sitting down with them \u2013 something that a candidate would certainly do, especially one battling distrust \u2013 she has continued to hold events around her book and her family\u2019s foundation. Polls might explain why she hasn\u2019t reached out yet: Right now, liberals don\u2019t matter that much to whether Clinton would win the Democratic nomination in 2016. A CNN/ORC International Poll from June found that only 11% of Democrats want a more liberal option to Clinton. Twenty percent want someone more conservative and 63% want Clinton. What\u2019s more, a Washington Post/ABC News poll from the same time showed that 72% of self-described liberals supported Clinton, a number that was larger than moderate and conservative Democrats. But liberals do make a lot of noise. Some of that has already boosted possible opponents from the left. Clinton: It had to be Russian insurgents Clinton subbed in for Bush at speech Unauthorized bio unseats autobiography Earlier this month both Biden and Warren ignited the crowd of liberal bloggers and activists at the annual Netroots Nation conference in Detroit. Warren\u2019s speech was interrupted by chants of \u201cRun, Liz, Run\u201d from eager supporters who want to see her challenge Clinton for the presidency. Clinton wasn\u2019t there, instead continuing with her \u201cHard Choices\u201d memoir tour in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Madison, Connecticut. While Stamp, who attended Netroots Nation, said there wasn\u2019t an overarching feeling of being snubbed by Clinton, she acknowledged, \u201cIt would have been interesting to hear her in a progressive setting.\u201d \u201cPeople want to hear from a potential candidate and have those candidates hear about the work they are doing on the ground,\u201d she added. After the conference, left-leaning Democrats said they felt more energized and organized than ever \u2013 and they hope that will lead to more influence on who their party nominates in 2016. Rubio calls Clinton a \u201920th century\u2019 candidate \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be the inevitable candidate,\u201d said Erica Sagrans, the campaign manager for Ready for Warren, an effort to enlist Warren to run for president in 2016. \u201cOur take is that no one should feel like they can\u2019t support a candidate that they like or are excited about just because there is a lot of support for Hillary.\u201d Ready for Warren is a direct response to what many liberal organizers say is an assumption of inevitability among the cadre of groups and political operatives organizing for a possible Clinton campaign. The name itself is a play on Ready for Hillary, an organized group of Clinton loyalists who have raised over $8 million to help Clinton if she chooses to run in 2016. Sagrans, whose group received a great deal of attention at Netroots this month, said it hopes to \u201cchannel the excitement about Warren into tangible results and a tangible organization.\u201d But just as much as the group\u2019s goal is to \u201celevate Warren,\u201d as Sagrans said, progressives also want to direct the 2016 conversation. On this goal, progressives seem to be winning. Clinton has talked more about populist issues since embarking on the book tour and will likely be forced to continue this rhetoric if she runs for president. And liberals hope their influence will grow with time. \u201cThere is this sort of inherent question, is Hillary ready for us?\u201d  Kohn said about 2016. \u201cIt is not enough to just be the next in line. The question is: Are you really, truly listening?\u201d Clinton stands by \u2018Russia reset\u2019 comments in the face of events",

            "article_content": "Obama to slam companies that establish residency in overseas tax havens in speech Thursday The President will say such companies \"are essentially renouncing their American citizenship\" Remarks part of Obama's effort this week to advance his domestic agenda World events have overshadowed the White House's efforts this week American-based firms that use legal loopholes to avoid paying U.S. taxes have effectively renounced any allegiance to their home country, President Barack Obama will claim during remarks at a community college here on Thursday. Taking up a harsh new attack against companies that establish residency in tax havens like the Caymen Islands and Bermuda while keeping the bulk of their operations in the United States, Obama will call on Congress to mend a loophole allowing billions in tax revenue to slip through the government\u2019s fingers. A White House official, previewing Obama\u2019s remarks, said the President would make the case on Thursday that tax-avoiding companies \u201care essentially renouncing their American citizenship so that they can ship their profits overseas to avoid paying taxes \u2013 even as they benefit from all the advantages of being here in America.\u201d The White House has aimed this week to advance the President\u2019s domestic agenda, focusing on jobs programs and the economy. Bolstering the middle class has formed much of Obama\u2019s midterm election year pitch. But world events \u2013 including Israel\u2019s ground invasion of Gaza and furor over the downed airliner in Ukraine \u2013 have largely overshadowed the intended topics this week, despite the White House\u2019s attempts to highlight new job training measures. Obama\u2019s remarks Thursday, which he\u2019ll deliver at a technical college in downtown Los Angeles, come at the end of a three-day fundraising swing which also brought him to Seattle and the Silicon Valley.  The event will be the only public showing for Obama during his stay on the West Coast. He withstood some criticism for not canceling the trip, which aides countered by saying the president could conduct his job from anywhere. The White House did, however, nix an appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d replacing the late night show with a more sober CNBC interview. Obama will touch on an issue Democrats believe could help them win over voters in this year\u2019s midterm contests. The President has long decried the inherent unfairness in large, multimillion dollar corporations that operate chiefly in the United States but pay little in U.S. taxes. He used the issue to attack Republican Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign. Both Republicans and Democrats say the entire tax code needs an overhaul, but Obama is pressing lawmakers to take action now to prevent so-called \u201cinversions,\u201d which allow U.S. companies to merge with foreign firms in countries with lower tax rates. In the past decade, at least 47 U.S. companies have made the move. Several inversions have been proposed this year and more are in the works. \u201cWe should prevent companies from effectively renouncing their citizenship to get out of paying taxes. What we need is a new sense of economic patriotism, where we all rise and fall together,\u201d said U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew In a letter to lawmakers last week, adding he believed any new measure should prevent companies from gaining tax advantages by incorporating overseas. Lew said a new law should retroactively bar any firm that moved abroad after May 2014 from enjoying lower tax liabilities. CNNMoney\u2019s Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Leading Democratic governor: Middle class voters in 2014 care about economic opportunity Shumlin: \"I am not so sure that this is the change election\" According to CNN's initial analysis, roughly half of this year's 36 races for governor could be competitive GOP group: Democratic governors continue to raise taxes and increase spending Since Barack Obama was first elected president in 2008, the word \u201cchange\u201d was popular with Democrats who were seeking to win elected office. Obama effectively used it to tap into voters\u2019 disenchantment with President George W. Bush, and he ultimately swept into the White House in a watershed year for Democrats. But with the 2014 election on the horizon, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said this year\u2019s gubernatorial contests won\u2019t be about that operative word. Key gubernatorial races in 2014 \u201cI am not so sure that this is the change election,\u201d Shumlin said Tuesday during an editorial board meeting with CNN. \u201cI think this is the election where voters care about one thing, middle class voters, both independents and Democrats, care about one thing: Did you or can you create better opportunities for us and our kids?\u201d The Democratic leader continued by stating that voters who have suffered through \u201c10 years of a stagnating economy\u201d and have slowly \u201cseen jobs trickle back,\u201d want to know what candidates are \u201cgoing to do to improve my wallet.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it is going to be a lofty, idealist change election,\u201d Shumlin concluded. 2014: What\u2019s at stake Dems find a lane to run on ObamaCare Are Democrats backing away from Obamacare? IP: Changes to GOP's Obamacare strategy? The Political Reality of Obamacare Buffett not sure on minimum wage Meet woman who could turn Texas purple Four years removed, the 2010 midterm election looms large over this November\u2019s contests. Republicans - in both Congress and in the states legislatures - won major gains by tapping into anti-Obama sentiment and riding the tea party wave. But those same Republicans now have to defend their wins \u2013 Republican governors are left to defend 22 governorships in November compared to only 14 for Democrats. According to CNN\u2019s initial analysis, roughly half of this year\u2019s 36 races for governor could be competitive. Democrats are on the defensive in two highly competitive races, in Illinois and Arkansas, while Republicans are defending four toss-up races, in Florida, Maine, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Five races are \u201ctilting\u201d in favor of Democrats - Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island - and another five are \u201ctilting\u201d in favor of Republicans - Ohio, Arizona, New Mexico, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The other seven Democratic seats and 13 Republicans seats are considered safe. For Shumlin, the man in charge with ensuring Democrats make gains in November, the map is tiling in his favor. In particular, the Vermont governor said Democrats plan to use the way Republicans ran in 2010 against them. \u201cThese guys got elected as the reformers, do you remember that?\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cIn 2010, tea party governors got elected as reformers.\u201d Shumlin went on to hit a number of Republican governors for ethics investigations and tax cuts for high-income earners. He said that the last four years of leadership from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker prove that Republicans aren\u2019t reformers. \u201cAny myth that these guys are reformers is officially dead,\u201d Shumlin said. By pressing a message centered on raising the minimum wage and strengthening the middle class, those campaigning for Democratic governors and candidates feel like they are in better position to make gains in 2014 than congressional Democrats, where it is looking more likely the Democrats will continue to be a minority in the House. Republicans, as expected, have a different view of the map. In a Tuesday statement, Jon Thompson, spokesman for the Republican Governors Association, said, \u201cWhile Democrat governors continue to raise taxes, increase spending, and waste hardworking taxpayers\u2019 money on failed Obamacare exchanges in their states, Republican governors are cutting taxes, lowering spending, balancing budgets, reforming education and driving the American Comeback.\u201d Will GOP\u2019s Obamacare focus pay off? Why are some Dems running from Obamacare? Obama: Republicans \u2018were wrong\u2019 about Obamacare Republicans also have bragging rights when it comes to money in the bank. The Republican Governors Association raised $23.5 million in the first quarter of 2014, nearly doubling the $12.5 million their Democratic counterpart brought in. The RGA haul was a record for the group and more than doubled what it raised in the first three months of 2010. \u201cRGA\u2019s strong financial position will give us the resources to push back against the public sector unions and the White House, who have targeted Republican governors and candidates for defeat,\u201d Phil Cox, the group\u2019s executive director said earlier this year. Democrats hope to make up those fundraising gaps in the coming months and are using a prolific Democratic fundraiser - former President Bill Clinton - to do just that. Clinton will headline a May fundraiser with Mike Ross, the Democratic gubernatorial hopeful in Arkansas, and the former President will also headline a DGA fundraiser for Charlie Crist in Miami on May 6. Hillary Clinton, however, has not been asked by the DGA for help in the midterms. Clinton, who left the State Department in early 2013 and is now considered the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she runs, has largely stayed away from highly political events in favor of paid speeches and corporate engagements.

            "article_content": "Ryan headed to Lincoln Day dinner in Iowa Ryan's budget, \"path to prosperity, or path to presidency?\" Sarah Palin calls new Ryan budget \"a joke.\" With his budget approved by the House, Paul Ryan is turning his attention to Iowa to headline a high-profile Republican event that will only fuel speculation he\u2019s laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run in 2016. Lawmakers approved the Wisconsin Republican\u2019s 2015 spending plan on Thursday. But there were notable conservative defections, making his appearance at Friday\u2019s Lincoln Dinner in Cedar Rapids more interesting. The question that confronts Ryan is whether his budget, dubbed the \u201cpath to prosperity,\u201d will help pave a path for him to compete in the early contest state in two years. Or will it prove a political liability when Republicans choose their next White House nominee? Ryan\u2019s role as the chief fiscal expert in the GOP is the main reason he was tapped as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012, and remains his main calling card in a potential national campaign. Since Republicans took control of the House in 2010, top GOP leaders have deferred to the Budget Committee chairman to construct the party\u2019s blueprint to address the growing national debt. He has shepherded four budgets through the House and brokered a deal with Democrats last fall to avoid another government shutdown and possible default on the nation\u2019s credit limit. Ryan budget details Some say not aggressive enough But that resume has not won over some tea party groups who believe Ryan isn\u2019t\u2019 being aggressive enough about slashing the size of the federal government. The group of fiscal conservatives in the House introduced an alternative budget that balances the federal budget in four years, instead of the 10 years in Ryan\u2019s plan. Former 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who previously backed Ryan\u2019s budgets, called this version \u201ca joke.\u201d In all, a dozen Republicans voted against his bill, a mix of conservatives who wanted the swifter  cuts and moderates in competitive seats who may be worried about political fallout. \u201cI don\u2019t think it helps him at all,\u201d Tammy Kobza, Iowa State director for the Eagle Forum, a conservative group, told CNN when asked if Ryan\u2019s record crafting GOP budgets could be a basis for 2016 presidential campaign in Iowa. Kobza isn\u2019t ready to endorse any GOP candidate in the next presidential race yet, but she says there are other activists who will attend Friday\u2019s dinner who share her view that Ryan isn\u2019t conservative enough to win the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cPaul Ryan seems like a very nice man, someone I\u2019d love to have like a next door neighbor,\u201d Kobza said, but she grouped him in with \u201cWashington Republicans\u201d who she said \u201chave no clue what\u2019s going on in real world America.\u201d Jim Carley, President of Save Our American Republic (SOAR), a conservative grassroots group in Iowa, said he supported most of what Ryan had in previous proposals, but he admitted he hasn\u2019t focused on the details of Ryan\u2019s latest plan. Ryan\u2019s dilemma Iowa conservatives He told CNN that conservatives in Iowa are determined to get the federal budget in balance, and although he understands it may take some time, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have some people that are never happy.\u201d Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who has been making his own trips to Iowa to drum up interest in a likely presidential campaign, told CNN he is \u201ca fan\u201d of Ryan\u2019s. But he said voters in Iowa would have to decide about the political consequences of his budget. When pressed on whether he backs Ryan budget blueprint, Cruz declined to answer, saying his focus was on the Senate. But some Iowa Republicans say Ryan\u2019s willingness to tackle tough issues appeals to conservatives there who are especially concerned about the nation\u2019s debt. Iowans hold the lowest credit card debt in the country, according to Transunion. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of affection among Republicans I talk to, especially with the small business and donor community,\u201d former Iowa GOP Chair Matt Strawn, who is not affiliated with any potential 2016 candidate, said of Ryan in a phone interview.  \u201cThey appreciate he isn\u2019t just saying no, he\u2019s attempting to demonstrate that he\u2019s a solution oriented conservative.\u201d Ryan\u2019s Poverty push Other issues energize voters Republican activists and strategists say right now Iowa voters are energized about issues other than cutting federal spending. The backlash to the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance program is pulling people toward Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, who has seized on the issue, and is tapping into his father Ron Paul\u2019s infrastructure in the state. And the base\u2019s continued zeal to roll back Obamacare is something that Cruz has highlighted during his visits to the state. But these same Republicans also say the kitchen table issues that Ryan\u2019s budget addresses will generates enthusiasm among caucus goers when the election comes around in 2016. \u201cIowa Republicans like somebody who is put forward serious proposals.\u201d Tim Albrecht, a former aide to GOP Gov. Terry Branstad, told CNN. He believes Ryan\u2019s budget will be an asset and shows \u201che\u2019s a thoughtful, smart leader, unafraid to make tough decisions and put together tough proposals that don\u2019t necessarily endear him to the east coast elite.\u201d Albrecht suggests that it\u2019s time though for Ryan to move beyond the spreadsheets and the numbers in the budget plans and demonstrate how his proposals will work in people\u2019s lives. \u201cIf he can explain to Joe Citizen how it helps them help their pocketbook then he\u2019ll be successful.\u201d Ryan well known Veteran Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley told CNN that he expects Ryan to have a \u201cgood following\u201d when he visits the state. He pointed out that some \u201ceconomic conservatives and libertarians\u201d within the Iowa GOP may not be exactly on the same page with Ryan\u2019s approach, but said these groups \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily disagree with him but it\u2019s a matter of emphasis for them.\u201d Republicans agree that Ryan is well known in the state from the 2012 campaign and it helps that he comes from neighboring Wisconsin, and shares Iowans love of the outdoors. But Friday\u2019s visit is only Ryan\u2019s second to the state since the 2012 presidential campaign,.  Paul, Cruz, former senator and 2012 GOP candidate Rick Santorum have been to the state more often, and GOP strategists say if serious about running for president Ryan needs to start spending more time cultivating support there. Democrats aren\u2019t waiting until 2016 to put Ryan\u2019s budget proposal front and center in the November midterms. While congressional Republicans insist the fallout from Obamacare will help them regain control of the Senate and increase their majority in the House, Democrats believe Ryan\u2019s budget is key to their election prospects this fall. They say its proposed spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs are issues that will energize their base which has been deflated because of the series of problems with the health care law. Dems to highlight Ryan budget Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer has called the focus on the Ryan budget this spring \u201ca turning point\u201d and a \u201cgift\u201d to Democrats. In Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, told CNN the Ryan budget will be a major focus as he talks to voters. \u201cNo matter who my opponent is going to be they\u2019ve all been out at public meetings talking about where they stand on these issues - and where they stand on these issues is not very different from what\u2019s contained in the Paul Ryan budget.  They\u2019re going to have to own up to whether they stand behind this philosophy of governing,\u201d Braley said. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana may be one of the most vulnerable candidates seeking re-election this fall, and points out that her likely opponent, GOP Rep Bill Cassidy, has repeatedly voted for Ryan\u2019s budgets. \u201cI most certainly plan to point out how my opponent has advocated to raise the retirement age to 70.  I most certainly plan to point out how some of the proposals in that budget undercut the support for the middle class in Louisiana so I think there are just any number of things,\u201d Landrieu told CNN. Another Senate Democrat facing a tough race, Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, said \u201celements\u201d of the Ryan budget will play prominently in his race. He told CNN that those Republican candidates vying to defeat him have already linked themselves to the \u201cpretty draconian cuts\u201d to education and entitlement programs that he believes will alarm voters in his state. Dems to focus on Ryan budget Could attacks strengthen Ryan? But Iowa Republicans believe that attacks from Democrats could strengthen Ryan going into 2016. \u201cIf anything the howls coming from Democrats are an asset,\u201d Strawn told CNN, adding, \u201ceven those conservatives who would want to see more cuts, quicker, when they see Ryan being attacked, those Republicans and conservatives will rally.\u201d While three House Republicans competing for the GOP nomination for a Senate seat in Georgia opposed the Ryan bill, seeking to show conservative primary voters they wanted deeper cuts, GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who is battling his own tough re-election campaign in Kentucky, said earlier this week he supported it. \u201cMy personal view is - I think the Ryan budget is a step in the right direction,\u201d McConnell said Tuesday.  He also indicated that most Senate Republicans backed the plan. Grassley maintains that it\u2019s too early to tell which potential GOP candidate has an edge with potential 2016 Iowa caucus-goers, and he said based on discussions with Republicans \u201cof all stripes\u201d in the state Ryan is on equal footing with others in the field. But referring to some of the other potential Republican candidates who have executive rather than congressional experience, Grassley said right now there is an \u201canti-Washington feeling which I think gives some edge to governors.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana: \"We really haven't shown what we're for\" He is behind a major jobs and economic proposal Some influential conservatives question the midterm strategy of Speaker John Boehner Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina says the election will turn on Obamacare An influential group of House conservatives, unhappy with the midterm strategy of Speaker John Boehner and other top Republicans,  outlined its own election-year message on the economy on Wednesday. \u201cI think our leadership has been good about showing what we\u2019re against. I think one area where we\u2019ve had weakness is we really haven\u2019t shown what we\u2019re for,\u201d Louisiana Republican Steve Scalise told CNN in advance of introducing a new jobs bill. Scalise doesn\u2019t call out leaders by name, but in an interview in his Washington office, he sent a clear message that he believes there is a tendency for top House leaders to play it safe. He heads the powerful Republican Study Committee, a group of fiscal conservatives that includes the vast majority of rank and file House GOP members. Since its inception, the RSC\u2019s main objective is to move House GOP leaders to the right on policy measures. \u201cI would like to see our leadership be bold. I would like to see us as a House majority be bold because I think the American people are hungry for bold ideas that will solve big problems because I think our country has big problems.\u201d Scalise said he\u2019s confident voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the agenda of President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats, but he admits his own party has low approval ratings, too. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust us because they don\u2019t know what we stand for,\u201d Scalise said. Contract With America, Part II Idaho Republican Raul Labrador agrees. While he didn\u2019t work on the major jobs bill that Scalise and other conservatives unveiled Wednesday, he echoes concerns that his party isn\u2019t presenting a more aggressive election year campaign to educate voters about what Republicans stand for. Labrador says he is talking to leaders about a package of ideas \u201ckind of like a \u2018Contract With America\u2019 \u201d that would spell out bills congressional Republicans would pass in the first 90 days of the next session of Congress. In the 1994 midterm election, many credited Newt Gingrich\u2019s \u201cContract With America\u201d as a key component in helping the party retake control of the House after 40 years in the minority and helping Gingrich become speaker. Conservatives have clashed with House Republican leaders repeatedly on policy differences over the debt ceiling, the budget and spending bills. But in this case, there isn\u2019t a major disagreement over substance \u2013 it\u2019s about strategy. They believe continuing to pass piecemeal economic bills and sending them to the Democratic Senate gets lost with voters and dilutes their message. That\u2019s why the jobs measure is a big bill that rolls together roughly 15 proposals. He and others admit they are not new, but that\u2019s not the point. They believe the impact is greater by packaging them. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re putting so many of our good ideas together in one bill shows that we want to have a sharper focus on not just the broad problems that are holding our economy back, but actually put a comprehensive plan to the fact that our economy is still struggling,\u201d Scalise said at a news conference after filing the bill. Democratic pollster predicts \u2018huge turnout disadvantage\u2019 in 2014 The list includes a plan to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, a proposal to authorize more offshore drilling, measures to roll back some regulations on coal plants and expedite permits for natural gas exploration. It also lists bills rolling back some financial services reforms that conservatives believe hurt the ability of small businesses to expand and get more access to capital. The push for one overarching economic plan mirrors the playbook conservatives used recently to press their leadership to agree to hold a vote on a GOP alternative to Obamacare. The RSC introduced its own proposal to repeal and replace the health care law last year. Again they pulled together a number of ideas that Republicans previously proposed into one package. Now House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is leading an effort with key committee chairs to draft a Republican alternative to the current system. Boehner: We\u2019re pushing for more jobs Asked about the criticism from conservatives on the speaker\u2019s jobs message, Boehner said Wednesday \u201cwe\u2019ve been focused on jobs for three years and three months.\u201d He said he welcomed ideas from conservatives and said \u201cif they want to package it in a way that they think is best, I\u2019ll pat \u2018em on the back.  Job well done.\u201d Boehner agreed on the need to present a contrast for voters, saying that \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a challenge to show people what party has better ideas - we\u2019ve got ideas.\u201d But pressed on when the GOP leadership would unveil it\u2019s health care bill or any other broad agenda, Boehner said proposals would come out \u201cas we develop them.\u201d Cantor has been scheduling floor votes on targeted measures, such as a bill to reduce home heating prices. In a memo to House Republicans about the spring schedule, the majority leader touted several measures under his \u201cAmerican That Works\u201d agenda and pledged more items were scheduled to address the \u201cmiddle class squeeze.\u201d Not all conservatives are worried that the party needs to present a comprehensive economic solution this fall. Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina says it is important to repeatedly tell voters what you support. But he says the Democratic Senate won\u2019t take up any House GOP bill, and he believes the 2014 midterm election will center just on the problems with Obamacare. Asked if that issue alone is enough to help Republicans expand their majority in the House, Gowdy replied, \u201cRight now it is.\u201d Freshman Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina admitted that internal divisions among House GOP members make it hard to coordinate any unified message. He pointed to how then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi kept her members on the same page when Democrats controlled the House. \u201cThey all had a message of the day, and they all sang out of the same prayer book. We\u2019re all a bunch of individuals, so I don\u2019t think we could ever have that same kind of message discipline,\u201d Hudson said. He also said, \u201cOur leadership doesn\u2019t rule with an iron fist and say \u2018this is what you are going to say today.\u2019 It makes it harder to have a unified message to break through the noise.\u201d Scalise thinks a more comprehensive statement of what Republicans would do for the economy is critical to helping the party in its quest to take control of the Senate. \u201cRight now, there is no head of the party and the House is the only majority,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cIt would excite people more to know what we would do if we were in the majority than if you just say put us in the majority so we\u2019ll block this President\u2019s agenda.\u201d",

            "article_content": "For better or worse, the tea party movement has made a difference Who heard of Ted Cruz or sequestration back in 2009? Protesting patriots or political obstructionists? Mainstream Republicans are pushing back Five years ago, not many people knew of Ted Cruz or sequestration or had seen a tricorne hat. Today, all are familiar in the political arena because of the tea party movement that emerged in 2009. For better or worse, the coming together of frustrated conservatives fearing American ruin due to rising debt has altered the national discussion to raise the profile of people and policies previously relegated to the right-wing fringe. Republicans fear tea party challengers in primaries. Democrats complain about the tea party caucus. The fiscal conversation focuses on reducing deficits and even reforming entitlement programs that make up the social safety net. Here\u2019s a kind of \u201cgreatest hits of the tea party, volume one\u201d: IRS controversy revives tea party 1) Protesting patriots Never in the past 200 or so years have so many worn tricorne hats and other Revolutionary War-era garb to make their political point. At protests and rallies that began in February 2009 to spawn the tea party movement, the overwhelmingly white, middle-aged and older participants dressed the part of past patriots protesting against taxation without representation. They also adopted the Gadsen flag of the the 18th Century \u2013 a coiled snake warning \u201cDon\u2019t tread on me.\u201d It reflected the movement\u2019s link to the Boston Tea Party of 1773 that helped launch the War of Independence, while some note that the word \u201ctea\u201d in the label is a backronym for \u201ctaxed enough already.\u201d Top tea party group celebrates five years Such romanticism ignores the private funding from big conservative donors, such as the billionaire Koch brothers, that helped amalgamate scattered local organizations into a more coherent movement with national focus. Bachmann, Tea Party against 'Obamacare' Sen.: Obamacare an inequality Godzilla 2) Obamacare fury Daily headlines scream with Republican rage over President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms that passed in 2010 with zero GOP votes. The roots of such fury emerge from the origins of the tea party movement \u2013 conservative anger over the stimulus bill that contained more than $800 billion in tax relief and spending to help the economy recover from recession. Tea party zealots as well as mainstream Republicans and independents also disliked the auto industry bailouts and financial sector rescue started under the previous administration of Republican President George W. Bush. That anger helped Obama and Democrats win big in 2008. With control of the White House, Senate and House, Democrats pushed through the stimulus bill in 2009 and the Obamacare bill a year later. Anyone who attended or watched can\u2019t forget how opponents of the health reforms flooded public hearings on the proposal to spew full-throated attacks. Supporters got shouted down, shoving matches occurred, and the resulting perception was that middle-class  America would never accept Obamacare. Today, Republicans and conservative groups try to maintain that perception with mixed results. 3) Republican control of the House Tea party anger over the stimulus bill and Obamacare translated to a conservative campaign onslaught in the 2010 congressional elections, with private groups freed from previous funding restrictions because of the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court. Cruz angers GOP colleagues \u2013 again Republicans won back the House by gaining 63 seats in a major shift, with dozens of tea party-backed newcomers joining the GOP caucus. Advocating showdown politics and brinksmanship over federal spending and raising the federal borrowing limit, the Republican-led House forced a rightward shift on fiscal issues that resulted in more austere policies, more fights between the parties and mounting public disgust with dysfunction in Washington. O'Donnell: Dems represent collectivism 4) Democratic control of the Senate \u201cI\u2019m not a witch,\u201d declared Christine O\u2019Donnell, a moment that symbolized how the tea party movement doomed Republican chances to gain control of the Senate in 2010. A conservative activist, O\u2019Donnell entered the Republican primary to fill the Senate seat vacated by Vice President Joe Biden. So did former Delaware Gov. Michael Castle, a nine-term U.S. congressman, who was heavily favored to win and refused to debate her. With strong tea party support, O\u2019Donnell beat Castle by 6 percentage points with strong backing from conservative southern Delaware, but she proved too inexperienced and downright flaky for the pressures of a full-fledged Senate campaign. Comedian Bill Maher unearthed a 1999 clip from a TV show he hosted in which O\u2019Donnell talked about dabbling in witchcraft, and she responded with a commercial that opened with her flat-out denial. Senate passes debt-ceiling plan in blow to tea party It went downhill from there, and Chris Coons easily defeated O\u2019Donnell by 57%-40% in November. A similar scenario occurred in Colorado, where conservative Ken Buck defeated favored Lt. Gov. Jane Norton in the GOP Senate primary, then lost to Democrat Michael Bennet  in the general election. Two years later in Indiana, Republican Richard Mourdock beat veteran Sen. Richard Lugar in the primary, then lost the race for the seat Lugar had held for six terms to Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly. Michele Bachmann's political legacy Ted Cruz on what's wrong with Washington 5) Ted Cruz and Michele Bachmann Who had heard of either politician back in 2009? Today, both are household names after Michele Bachmann used her status as a tea party favorite to run for president in 2012 and Cruz rode tea party backing to get elected as a senator from Texas the same year. Bachmann railed against Obamacare and federal spending in her energetic but short-lived campaign best remembered for her frequent outlandish and accuracy challenged statements. She won the Iowa straw poll in August 2011 to get an early jump on the crowded GOP field, but her novelty flamed out and she finished sixth in the Iowa caucuses the following January. Bachmann dropped out of the race shortly thereafter, and now is leaving Congress altogether at the end of 2014. Cruz is on an opposite trajectory. More than any of the other tea party stalwarts elected in recent years, he has walked the talk by repeatedly taking on the Washington establishment of both parties in Quixotic escapades that gain him notoriety at the expense of GOP clout. Texas tea partier wants GOP on Cruz control Last September, Cruz waged a 21-hour filibuster against a government spending extension, at one point reading aloud the Dr. Seuss book \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d to his children back home,  as part of his crusade against Obamacare. His tactics led to a 16-day government shutdown in October that failed to gain Republicans anything but public scorn for the political shenanigans involved. Undeterred, Cruz recently forced fellow Republicans in the Senate to join Democrats in overcoming his filibuster of a measure to raise the federal borrowing limit so the United States wouldn\u2019t default on its bills. GOP leaders wanted to let the measure pass with no Republican support so they could blame Democrats, but Cruz\u2019s filibuster threatened an impasse that could have rattled financial markets and possibly brought a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Fearful that Republicans would again be blamed for Washington dysfunction, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell led a dozen aisle-crossers who voted with Democrats to end the Cruz filibuster, then rejoined fellow Republicans in opposing the measure in the final vote that only needed Democratic support to pass. Afterward, Cruz complained that such political \u201cshow\u201d votes hurt the party much more than his ideological purity of trying to wring more spending cuts out of Democrats in order to pass the debt ceiling hike. In the end, it remained unclear whether such antics will hurt or help the freshman senator considered a possible GOP presidential contender as soon as 2016. After sequestration: What you'll see 6) New vocabulary Who had heard of sequestration five years ago? Today it is part of the political-policy vocabulary, thanks in part to the way that the tea party changed the conversation through its laser focus on issues such as the national debt, the federal budget and entitlement spending. The refusal by tea party Republicans in the House to accept business-as-usual compromises on federal spending caused a series of showdowns with Obama and Democrats. One brought a compromise that included sequestration \u2013 across-the-board cuts in government spending, including the military. While sparing entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the sequester cuts came closest to the tea party goal of shrinking government to lower deficits. Now Congress has started undoing the sequestration limits, angering tea party conservatives and putting pressure on Republican candidates in November congressional elections who supported the December budget compromise. Boehner, the Tea Party, and the GOP Inside Politics: GOP civil war? Senate's top Republican in trouble? 7) Poor John Few sights have been as politically expressive as House Speaker John Boehner repeatedly having to drop legislation he supported because he was unable to get his own caucus to back him. The ability of tea party Republicans to undermine compromises with Democrats pushed by Boehner demonstrated the GOP split between the mainstream leadership and more extremist newcomers. Tea Party SOTU Response: \u2018Obamacare is an inequality Godzilla\u2019 After the government shutdown in October, Boehner adopted a tougher stance by criticizing tea party tactics that harmed Republicans. Earlier this month, he joined 27 other Republicans to vote with 193 Democrats in passing the debt-ceiling hike over the objections of 199 Republicans. Even Boehner\u2019s long-time political foe, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, sounded sympathetic on Thursday, calling on Republicans to \u201ctake back your party\u201d from what she described as extremists. \u201cI think (the tea party) considered it a success when they shut down government and I don\u2019t think that was for the good of the nation,\u201d Pelosi said, adding that the tea party \u201chijacked the name Republican.\u201d IRS targeted conservative groups 8) IRS targeting Without a tea party movement, there would have been no tea party groups for Internal Revenue Service officials to screen out when checking applications for tax-exempt status. It turns out that liberal groups also were targeted for extra scrutiny, based on specific words in their names, as the IRS tried to figure out if new organizations were trying to skirt election funding limits by claiming they were 501(c)(4)  social welfare organizations. Conservative Republicans continue crying foul, but investigations so far found no deliberate political machinations by the IRS.

            "article_content": "Some Democrats feel even without Clinton, Biden, their crop of 2016 candidates is strong Veteran strategist disagrees: \"It's gotta be Hillary or Joe or we're in trouble\" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren mentioned by some An air of inevitability exists around Hilary Clinton for 2016. Of course she hasn\u2019t said she will run \u2013 that\u2019s a decision she said she\u2019ll make this year \u2013 but she must feel pretty good about the tea leaves. A new CNN/ORC poll out this week found that 70% of Democrats said they are likely to support her if she launches a presidential bid. Additionally, she is beating top-tier Republican contenders, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in hypothetical matchups. Democratic strategist Maria Cardona predicted, with the caveat that a lot can happen between now and then, that if she runs, \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll have anyone running against her.\u201d That\u2019s because she is in such a strong position with her name recognition and her vast network of supporters, donors and campaign infrastructure ready to go. Emory political science professor Alan Abramowitz said the chances of Clinton being upset, like what happened in the 2008 primaries, are slim. \u201cI don\u2019t see who\u2019s going to be the Obama of 2016,\u201d he said. Would she say no? But plenty of reasons exist for her to simply say no. Presidential campaigns are unbelievable grinds and they can exact a substantial personal toll. They\u2019re full of endless days, personal attacks, and heart-clogging food. There are infinite details to master, personalities to manage, debates, and then throw in the unknowns. She will be 69 on Election Day 2016 and would have been in the political spotlight for a quarter century by then. She would have run once as the favorite for her party\u2019s nomination and lost. Many people might reflect on a similar public service career and conclude there\u2019s nothing left to prove, or that it\u2019s time for others to get in the game even if becoming the first woman president was the prize. But what if Clinton doesn\u2019t run? Multiple people associated with the Democratic Party say there is a host of promising potential contenders. But one strategist, a veteran of several Democratic presidential campaigns who asked not to be identified so he could speak freely, said, \u201cPeople saw Governor Clinton and Senator Obama as superstars.\u201d As for the potential 2016 crop: \u201cNo one talks about the rest of the field that way.\u201d Except for Joe Biden. \u201cThe truth is that, if Hillary doesn\u2019t run Biden becomes the class of the field by far,\u201d the veteran Democratic strategist told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be Hillary or Joe or we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Biden has been cagey with his intentions, dropping humorous references but refusing to commit. But his name recognition as vice president and as a veteran of the presidential campaign trail, some in the party think Biden is in a good position. Though, he would be 73 on Election Day 2016 and 74 on Inauguration Day. That\u2019s \u201cmiddle age\u201d for a U.S. senator, but no one has ever walked into the Oval Office on their first day of work at that age. Jim Manley, a former top Senate aide, thinks Biden \u201cdeserves a shot\u201d because he\u2019s been \u201coutstanding\u201d as vice president. But Joe is Joe. People either love him, hate him or forget about him. For some Democratic operatives, Biden is almost an afterthought. People spouted off numerous potential Democratic candidates and Biden\u2019s name would come up, eventually. \u201cOh yes, Joe Biden,\u201d said one strategist after gently jogging his memory. The progressive wing of the party is not impressed. Adam Green, co-director of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, left it at this: \u201cJoe Biden has had a great career in public service.\u201d After the interview concluded, Green e-mailed to say that his co-director, Stephanie Taylor, has this to say about a Biden run: \u201cThat would be funny,\u201d Taylor said. Martin O\u2019Malley Democratic pollster Margie Omero said Democrats Biden and Clinton aren\u2019t the only two who can appeal to Democratic voters. The party has \u201ca really strong bench of candidates that people are excited about that have progressive appeal.\u201d She included Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, saying he has \u201cquietly and consistently\u201d built a strong record of good schools and good economy in Maryland. Interestingly, in this informal survey of half a dozen Democratic operatives and one political science professor, people mentioned O\u2019Malley most often than any other possible contender, including Biden, but their reaction was far more muted. Manley said the \u201cjury is out\u201d and Abramowitz mused, \u201cI just don\u2019t know what kind of candidate he\u2019d be.\u201d Green called O\u2019Malley \u201ca blank slate.\u201d O\u2019Malley is laying the groundwork for a run in the event Clinton doesn\u2019t, a source close to the governor told CNN. O\u2019Malley amplified 2016 speculation when he told the Washington Post last week that he can\u2019t wait for the former first lady and secretary of state to make a decision. Elizabeth Warren The first-term Massachusetts senator would have even less experience in public office than Obama when he ran in 2008. But Democrats have a high opinion of the former Harvard professor whose advocacy paved the way for the Consumer Federal Protection Bureau. Former Obama aide Bill Burton said Warren was one of a handful of \u201cimpressive\u201d Democrats who could fill the bill should Clinton stay out. Cardona said Warren has to be \u201cput on any list.\u201d The progressives love her for her populist agenda. Green said Warren is \u201cthe north star\u201d of the Democratic Party. Kirsten Gillibrand New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s name also came up as a potential contender. But Cardona said she would have to get over her lack of name recognition, which she said is relatively easy to do. Manley, however, said it\u2019s \u201ctoo soon\u201d for New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. She should show her campaigning and fundraising capabilities as head of the Democrat\u2019s Senate campaign arm. Andrew Cuomo The New York governor received the most negative response from respondents, if he was mentioned at all. Manley said Andrew Cuomo should \u201cstick to being the governor of New York.\u201d Green said he represents the Democratic Party from the 90s and would not fit in well with today\u2019s voters, adding that he \u201cpays lip service\u201d to progressives. More on the bench? There are other possibilities, including: Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. But even though lifelong  people had little to say as they are so unknown on a national scale. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I can say,\u201d Manley said. \u201cUntested\u201d is how Emory professor Abramowitz described the field outside of Biden and Clinton. \u201cAll these other candidates have never run for national office so we don\u2019t know how they\u2019d do.\u201d",

The 30-second spot is part of a $2.5 million buy and is running statewide. A September CNN/ORC survey shows Landrieu leading Cassidy by three points. In Louisiana, Republican Bill Cassidy is running to retire Democratic incumbent Mary Landrieu. But national Democrats are hoping the GOP lawmaker\u2019s stance on raising the Social Security retirement age will stop that from happening. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will unveil a new television ad in the Bayou State on Thursday that hammers Cassidy for favoring increasing the age at which retirees can collect Social Security benefits to 70. At Tuesday\u2019s debate, Cassidy said he did not support changing benefits for those at or near retirement, but suggested that benefits for younger workers would need to be revamped. Landrieu drew a sharp contrast with Cassidy at that meeting, saying the idea of having people work until they are 70 was \u201cvery bad policy.\u201d The DSCC is reinforcing that message with its latest ad in the hotly-watched race, one of the key battlegrounds for majority control of the Senate this fall. \u201cWhen it comes to seniors, Congressman Bill Cassidy has a plan: Raise the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare to 70,\u201d the narrator grimly states. The 30-second spot is part of a $2.5 million buy and is running statewide. Landrieu\u2019s campaign on Thursday unveiled a new website, 70WillHurt.com, to highlight Cassidy\u2019s stance on Social Security. The Cassidy campaign, meanwhile, accused Landrieu of trying to \u201chave it both ways\u201d when it comes to Social Security, pointing out that the Democrat previously expressed support for the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction report that would have gradually raised the retirement age. A CNN/ORC survey released last month found Landrieu leading Cassidy 43 percent to 40 percent among likely voters, with the other Republican candidate in the race, Rob Maness, pulling nine percent. With no primary, all the contenders for the Senate seat will be on the ballot this fall. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote on Election Day the top two finishers will advance to a December runoff. In a head-to-head matchup, Cassidy leads Landrieu 50 percent to 47 percent among likely voters.",

            "article_content": "Kentucky's Democratic Senate candidate won't say if she voted for President Obama Alison Lundergan Grimes cited the \"matter of principle\" of privacy at the ballot box GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell criticized her answer, said he voted for John McCain, Mitt Romney Alison Lundergan Grimes again refused to reveal whether she voted for President Barack Obama, dodging the question for the second time in a week Monday during the only debate of Kentucky\u2019s Senate race. Grimes, the Democratic secretary of state who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in one of the nation\u2019s marquee races, cited the \u201cmatter of principle\u201d of privacy at the ballot box, noting that she is the state\u2019s chief election officer. \u201cI\u2019m not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in Kentucky in order to curry favor on one or (an)other side or members of the media,\u201d she said during Monday night\u2019s debate. The answer echoed one she gave the Louisville Courier-Journal\u2019s editorial board last week, which touched off days of criticism \u2013 with NBC \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Chuck Todd saying that Grimes \u201cdisqualified herself,\u201d and McConnell\u2019s campaign immediately placing that comment in a new ad. It came after McConnell had already blasted Grimes for trying to hide her political allegiances in a state where Obama is deeply unpopular. \u201cMy opponent has spent spent most of her time trying to deceive everybody about her own views,\u201d the five-term Republican said. McConnell also criticized Grimes\u2019 answer on whether she voted for Obama, saying there is \u201cno sacred right to not announce how we vote.\u201d He offered that he had \u201cproudly\u201d voted for GOP nominees John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, and said he voted for Trey Grayson during Kentucky\u2019s 2010 primary against now-Sen. Rand Paul. McConnell also said he doesn\u2019t buy Grimes\u2019 claim that she is a \u201cClinton Democrat.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not a dime\u2019s worth of difference between a Clinton Democrat and an Obama Democrat,\u201d he said. The debate was the only chance Kentucky voters will have to see the two candidates grapple personally in what\u2019s been one of the nation\u2019s most expensive races, and one of about a dozen that are key to Republicans\u2019 chances of seizing at least six more seats and taking control of the Senate. The free-wheeling, hour-long event was almost entirely negative \u2013 with Grimes calling McConnell \u201cSenator Gridlock, Senator No-show or Senator Shutdown,\u201d painting him as an obstructionist and accusing him of doing the bidding of conservative political funding giants Charles and David Koch. She referred to the Koch brothers as McConnell\u2019s \u201cfamily,\u201d and later, his \u201chenchmen.\u201d Much of the debate was focused on coal, with Grimes criticizing the Obama administration\u2019s move to curb emissions from coal-fired power plants by 30% over the next 25 years and McConnell going even harder after the Environmental Protection Agency and saying Grimes would be a reliable Obama supporter on issues like energy. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious, given where all her support comes from, all the anti-coal activists in the country, that she\u2019s going to do their bidding,\u201d he said. The two also tangled over Grimes\u2019 push to increase the minimum wage and equal pay legislation, and Grimes landed a shot against McConnell for putting \u201ctwo wars on a nation\u2019s credit card.\u201d Grimes benefited late in the debate from a series of questions on Obamacare that demonstrated the difficulties GOP candidates face in states that have already expanded access to coverage under the 2010 health care law. Kentucky\u2019s Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, accepted the federal Medicaid expansion and set up a state-run insurance exchange called Kynect. McConnell said he wants to repeal the health care law \u201croot and branch\u201d and that hospitals \u201care being rim-racked by these Medicare reimbursement reductions.\u201d But he wouldn\u2019t address the future of Kynect, saying that \u201cit\u2019s a state decision\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s fine to have a website.\u201d Grimes said McConnell is living in a \u201cfictional fantasyland\u201d on the issue and that more than 500,000 Kentucky residents now have health insurance because of the law. \u201cI will not be the senator that rips that insurance from their hands,\u201d she said. Several times Grimes said McConnell had already had 30 years to carry his policy ideas through. But McConnell shot back that he was the one who negotiated several bipartisan efforts to extend the debt ceiling and stave off government shutdowns with Vice President Joe Biden in recent years. And he argued that a possible future role would position him to advance Kentucky\u2019s interests. \u201cThere\u2019s a great likelihood,\u201d McConnell said, \u201cthat I will be the leader of the majority in the Senate next year.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The DSCC is spending money against the GOP challenger in Alaska's Senate race The Democratic incumbent senator is facing criticism for making an ad that focused on a heinous murder Sen. Mark Begich pulled down the ad after the victims' family got involved The race in Alaska is close and could determine the balance of power in the Senate A group that\u2019s working to keep Democrats in control of the Senate is releasing its first television ad in the contested U.S. Senate race in Alaska between incumbent Sen. Mark Begich and his GOP challenger, Dan Sullivan. The \u201cmulti-million dollar\u201d ad buy from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee comes as Begich\u2019s campaign faces a slew of negative headlines for releasing a political attack ad that focused on a gruesome 2013 murder and sexual assault case. The DSCC said it was already planning to go up with the new 30-second spot before the recent controversy, and the ad doesn\u2019t mention Begich\u2019s ad. Rather, it hits Dan Sullivan for opposing Obamacare. In the commercial, an elderly woman whose husband has Alzheimer\u2019s disease says Sullivan \u201csupports a plan\u201d to slash Medicare benefits, and his policies would raise prescription drug costs. In the commercial, an elderly woman whose husband has Alzheimer\u2019s disease says Sullivan \u201csupports a plan\u201d to slash Medicare benefits, and his policies would raise prescription drug costs. Fact Check: Would repeal of Obamacare hike seniors\u2019 drug costs? According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Alaska has the largest growth rate for seniors (age 65 and older); the population for that age group increased by 54% between 2000 and 2010. The ad also hits Sullivan for saying he\u2019s open to raising the minimum age for Social Security eligibility. While Sullivan has advocated for reform for younger generations, he has said \u201cwe\u2019re not going to touch\u201d benefits for seniors who are either receiving Social Security benefits or about to receive them. \u201cBut with the younger generation, to phase in reform, there is opportunity,\u201d he said last month at the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce GOP debate. CNN rates the race between Sullivan and Begich as one of six toss-up contests in this year\u2019s midterm elections. As a Democratic senator in a reliably red state, Begich is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to retake the majority in the Senate. The DSCC also has spent money on ads in Arkansas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Iowa, Colorado and Michigan. The new spot comes as Begich is under hot water after his campaign went up with a Willie Horton-style ad against Sullivan on Friday. The spot accused Sullivan of being soft on crime, focusing on a case in which a man allegedly murdered an elderly couple last year and sexually assaulted the couple\u2019s granddaughter, as well as another elderly woman in the home. At the time of the crime, the suspect had just finished a prison sentence of four years for another crime. His sentence should have been longer because his record included a separate felony, but he was only sentenced to four years because of a mistake by the state. Because Sullivan was serving as attorney general at the time of the suspect\u2019s sentencing in 2010, Begich\u2019s campaign tried to fault Sullivan for letting the suspect go early. However, the mistake that led to the short sentence was made before Sullivan became attorney general. Politifact gave the ad a \u201cPants on fire\u201d rating, saying the ad \u201cis not only inaccurate, it makes an inflammatory accusation.\u201d Shortly after the spot aired, the victims\u2019 family called on Begich and Sullivan, who had released his own ad countering the claims, to pull down their spots, saying the publicity could affect the jury pool for the trial scheduled for this month. Sullivan\u2019s campaign asked TV stations to stop running the ad Sunday, while Begich\u2019s team first said it would alter the ad to remove references to the case. The campaign later pulled down the ad altogether.",

That means politicking will be on the rise, especially as control of the Senate is at stake as well as control of 36 state houses. So, if you turn on your TV, expect to see more \u2013 and nastier \u2013 political advertisements. In fact, Elizabeth Wilner, senior vice president of Kantar Ad Intelligence, says as much as $3.4 billion is going to be spent on advertising this midterm season. The race with the most at stake is the one for U.S. Senate in Kentucky. This is not just one of the only Senate races Republicans are at risk of losing, but also the race where the top Senate Republican is at risk of losing his job. McConnell crashes Tea Party McConnell: 'Nothing I haven't said publicly' The Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is in a fight for his political life against Alison Lundergan Grimes, a relatively inexperienced Democratic politician who was just 8 years old when McConnell started his first term in the Senate in 1985. McConnell, a shrewd politician, prolific fundraiser and expert campaigner, has had numerous missteps, making this race even more interesting. His troubles include a flubbed campaign ad, a campaign manager who was a little too honest, the recent resignation of that manager and a caught-on-tape moment. Grimes, meanwhile, has also stumbled when talking about foreign policy, and questions have arisen about a possible sweetheart deal involving her campaign bus. This is one of the most interesting and critical races in the country. How Mitch McConnell crushed the tea party Here are four other races that are worth watching: Wisconsin governor: The Wisconsin governor\u2019s race has many national repercussions, as Republican Gov. Scott Walker is locked in a tight re-election battle against former Trek bicycle executive Mary Burke. Walker: Its going to be a tight election Economic policy is a central component of this campaign. Walker has gained prominence in conservative politics for governing as a fiscal conservative and making deep cuts to spending by cutting public union workers\u2019 pensions. He also drastically limited workers\u2019 bargaining rights. Meanwhile, Democrats, backed by labor unions, are again fighting to defeat Walker \u2013 they forced a recall two years ago that Walker won \u2013 to move forward on more Democratic economic policies, including lifting the minimum wage. Walker, who is also being investigated for alleged illegal campaign coordination with outside groups, is considered a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, but if he loses his gubernatorial race, his path to the presidency will be very, very narrow. Democrats and Republicans understand the stakes, and President Barack Obama traveled to Wisconsin on Labor Day to speak at a union event in a trip packed with political symbolism. Walker, Burke tied up in new poll U.S. Senate, Louisiana: Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu always has tough races, and her fourth bid for the Senate seat is no exception. Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy is the person who is giving Landrieu another difficult run. Cassidy is tying Landrieu to Obama in this conservative-leaning state while painting her as a corrupt Washington insider. Landrieu, meanwhile, is attempting to paint her Senate tenure as a picture of independence. Most interestingly, a political roller coaster is possible. If Landrieu or Cassidy doesn\u2019t receive more than 50% of the vote on Election Day in November, a winner won\u2019t be named until that state\u2019s December 6 election. There\u2019s a chance the Louisiana race, and the balance of the Senate, might be dragged out until December. Sen. Mary Landrieu to reimburse Senate for charter flight National Democrats go after Cassidy on Medicare U.S. Senate, Iowa: When popular Sen. Tom Harkin decided to retire, Democrats had a small panic attack as this solidly Democratic seat was now in play. But when Rep. Bruce Braley jumped in, Democrats\u2019 confidence was restored. But then that confidence has been shaken as Braley has run a gaffe-prone campaign that involves digs at farmers and meandering chickens. His missteps \u2013 combined with the surprising strength of Republican candidate Joni Ernst, who has run a great campaign that began with a breakout performance in the crowded Republican primary \u2013 make this a possible and unexpected pickup for Republicans. Climate group attacks Ernst on tax pledge, not climate Florida\u2019s 2nd Congressional District: There is little to no chance that Republicans will lose control of the House of Representatives, and some race analyzers say the GOP will even pick up seats. But this race could be a bright spot for Democrats. Even in what is expected to be a difficult year for Democrats, Democratic candidate Gwen Graham could pull out a victory in this Republican-leaning district of Tallahassee and the central part of the Florida Panhandle. Graham has some advantages. She has no problem getting money \u2013 raising more than Southerland \u2013 and she has a Florida-famous last name. Her father is longtime Sen. Bob Graham, giving her access to his connections and deep knowledge of running successful campaigns. Key races in 2014 Complete midterm coverage",

Cuban intelligence The letter begins by raising the allegation, sourced to an unnamed \u201csenior government official,\u201d that Cuban intelligence agents may have been behind the smear campaign. But Ryan\u2019s letter also suggests the possibility of a conspiracy either \u2013 knowingly or unknowingly \u2013 between Cuban intelligence and Republican enemies of the senator. Among the other theories: That a former U.S. ambassador with a beef against Menendez was the tipster who called himself \u201cPeter Williams\u201d and who shopped the prostitution story to news outlets in Washington, a government watchdog group and to the FBI. New Jersey politics Another more complicated theory offered in the letter, citing an unnamed witness: That GOP operative Roger Stone offered the story to the conservative news outlet Newsmax, which refused to publish it. The same witness allegedly claimed that Stone had a goal in mind \u2013 to ensure Gov. Chris Christie could appoint Menendez\u2019s interim successor in the event he had to resign. \u201cChris Christie is my ultimate client,\u201d the letter says the witness quoted Stone as saying. Ryan suggests ties to other New Jersey political figures who would want to help sink Menendez\u2019s campaign and notes: \u201cGovernor Christie\u2019s connection to the fraud can be explained from a motive standpoint.\u201d The letter makes no allegation that the governor was part of or even knew of the smear campaign. Stone denied the allegations in a telephone interview with CNN and called them \u201cpatently false.\u201d U.S. officials familiar with the matter told CNN earlier this week that the government was aware of the Cuban espionage allegations and had found no evidence to support it. The Cuban government-run website also dismissed any ties to Cuba. Corruption probe The FBI\u2019s foray into the prostitution allegations dovetailed with a federal investigation focused on a Menendez donor in Florida, who for years has fought allegations that he overbilled Medicare. Investigators soon began looking into Menendez\u2019s relationship with the donor. Menendez\u2019s legal team believes the false prostitution story taints the entire investigation of the senator and wants it looked into further to see where it came from. \u201cThis entire matter began with a campaign of lies to smear Senator Menendez to affect his election and the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and those lies included a fraud against the government,\u201d Ryan said in a statement. \u201cThe Justice Department has the responsibility to investigate who committed that crime, so when I have received from credible sources information that merited further review, I have sent it to them. We don\u2019t know who was responsible for the smear against Senator Menendez, but it is my hope that the Justice Department will demonstrate some urgency in getting to the bottom of it. \u201cWhoever perpetuated this fraud against the government to smear a United States Senator and potentially influence U.S. policy should be held accountable to the full extent of the law,\u201d he added. Menendez weighs in Menendez told CNN earlier this week that the Cuban intelligence involvement was plausible. \u201cWell, let\u2019s put it this way, for 22 years, between the House and the Senate, I have had a firm position in opposition to the Cuban regime that violates the human rights - the democracy of the people of Cuba,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been outspoken in that regard. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that the regime would do anything it can to stop me from being in a position that ultimately would impede their hopes of being able to get a different relationship with the United States based upon their interests, but not the interests of the Cuban people,\u201d he added. Important development Additional content from the lawyer\u2019s letter matters because it casts new light on the Menendez legal team\u2019s efforts to force the government to reexamine the beginnings of their ongoing probe of the senator. The variety of theories offered \u2013 and lack of proof to back them up \u2013 doesn\u2019t indicate Menendez\u2019s legal team knows what gave rise to the prostitution story. Another letter Ryan sent to prosecutors in January didn\u2019t mention the theories. The April letter came at a time when the Menendez probe was intensifying, with investigators using a grand jury to issue subpoenas, according to people familiar with the probe. Any possible charges aren\u2019t imminent, according to these people. Should charges ever be brought against Menendez, Ryan\u2019s letter offers a glimpse of at least part of the defense team\u2019s possible strategy. By raising questions about the beginnings of the FBI probe, the defense could attempt to put the government\u2019s own investigation on trial. The letter also shows how a well-funded defense can try to complicate criminal investigations. It\u2019s common for FBI investigations to begin with dead ends before finding a viable prosecutable crime. But most defendants don\u2019t have money to pay for lawyers who can expose those dead ends, and try to make them a liability for prosecutors. The tipster, media coverage The episode began in April 2012 when a tipster calling himself \u201cPeter Williams\u201d emailed the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, offering to supply evidence that Menendez was involved with underage prostitutes. CREW shared the information with the FBI. An FBI agent in Miami exchanged emails with the purported tipster, but the tipster appeared evasive in emails and would never agree to meet or talk with the FBI agent. After months of investigating, the FBI decided there wasn\u2019t any merit to the allegation. Reporters at several news organizations in Washington also looked into the allegations, also after receiving emails from a purported tipster, but didn\u2019t publish a story. Then in November 2013, the Daily Caller, a conservative website, ran with the story. By early 2013 the story began falling apart, and the alleged prostitutes who had claimed to be involved recanted their story. Menendez, who is of Cuban descent, won reelection and is now chairman of the Foreign Relations panel, which has given him a perch from which to thwart any Obama administration plans to relax economic sanctions to improve ties with the island\u2019s communist regime. For good measure, Ryan offers one more suggestion to the Justice Department: that a combination of Cuban intelligence tricksters and U.S. political enemies were behind the smear. He writes: \u201cWe encourage the department to show some sense of outrage that a foreign intelligence agency operated by a government that has every reason to harm Senator Menendez to the U.S. has combined with dirty tricks political operatives to successfully use the Department to accomplish its goals.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Both parties are testing messages for fall midterms in Tuesday's special election Republicans trying use Obamacare to frame midterm elections Republican candidate says outside anti-Obamacare ads are drowning other issues Democrat is confronting Obamacare debate, saying there's room for improvement It\u2019s for just one congressional seat for about eight months, but Tuesday\u2019s special election in Florida has taken on huge political significance. National Republicans are framing Tuesday\u2019s special election as a referendum on Obamacare. But their message \u2013 plus a flood of outside spending by Democrats focused on the issue of Social Security \u2013 is drowning out other issues in the race, Republican candidate David Jolly says. His Democratic opponent, Alex Sink, isn\u2019t shying away from the health care debate, touting the law\u2019s benefits and saying she\u2019s open to improvements. Both parties are looking at this race as a testing ground for their messages going into the midterm elections. Florida\u2019s 13th District is one of a small number of competitive ones, and Republicans and Democrats say the tight race here will come down to which campaign gets its supporters out. Both sides have spent more than $11 million on media and direct mail, according to data from the Sunlight Foundation. The bulk of that spending comes from outside groups hoping to shape two very different narratives. Eight things to watch between now and Election Day Crist: Republican Party is \"fractured\" Rep. Ryan: The left is exhausted Is McConnell in trouble? Deciding Clinton's role in 2014 Republican groups and Jolly\u2019s campaign have concentrated on tying Sink to Obamacare and its rocky rollout and to President Barack Obama and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who have low approval ratings among independent voters. Jolly thinks the health care law is a top issue for voters, but the message he was trying to deliver last week at a senior center focused heavily on local issues. \u201cThere is a lot more going on here that just Obamacare,\u201d he said. Jolly served as a longtime aide to GOP Rep. Bill Young, whose death last October after representing the area for more than 40 years prompted the special election.  At the senior event, Jolly pointed out his connection to Young and the federal resources the late congressman helped to deliver for the district, saying Young was \u201cnearly a father to me.\u201d Borger: Congress takes the year off But Democrats are trying to make Jolly\u2019s work as a Washington lobbyist after he left Young\u2019s staff the driving issue in the campaign, arguing he backed changes to Social Security that could cut benefits. The district has one of the highest concentrations of voters over age 65 in the country. Talk about changing retirement benefits or any concerns that Obamacare provisions could affect health care coverage resonate strongly with voters here. Pre-emptive strategy on Obamacare Standing next to former Florida Democratic Sen. Bob Graham at an event with seniors at her campaign office, Sink called the current programs \u201can American promise\u201d and said, \u201cthose programs were put in place for a good reason, and I\u2019m going to fight to protect the integrity of the Social Security and Medicare programs for all of us.\u201d Sink, who served as Florida\u2019s chief financial officer and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010, recognizes that Obamacare is a major issue.  She acknowledges that the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to cut the popular Medicare Advantage is a major worry among older voters, who she says will make up half of the electorate in the race.  Other Democratic candidates tend to avoid the O-word, but Sink talks about the law\u2019s benefits and argues she won\u2019t go back to the old system. Crist: Democrats \u2018ought to strengthen up\u2019 and support Obamacare Sink\u2019s strategy on Obamacare appears to be pre-emptive: she stresses how the health care law will help people but also notes it has some major flaws that need fixing. She said she is open to Republican-backed plans to change the law\u2019s current requirement that employers provide health insurance to employees who work more than 30 hours a week. She also said Obamacare\u2019s current requirement that businesses with more than 50 employees offer health insurance is \u201can arbitrary number\u201d and says she wants to work across party lines to adjust the law to avoid any \u201cunintended consequences,\u201d such as keeping businesses from expanding. Obama: Democrats \u2018sleepy\u2019 during midterms Jolly reiterates the Republican mantra that Obamacare must be repealed altogether. Because his own campaign hasn\u2019t raised nearly as much money as Sink\u2019s, the bulk of the ads and direct mail attacking Sink are from the National Republican Campaign Committee and other allies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Action Network, which backs GOP candidates in House races. CPAC winners and losers GOP national security policy rift? Rick Santorum: Winning means losing Although he concedes it\u2019s not likely to happen, Jolly says he remains committed to getting rid of Obamacare entirely.  He ticks through his plan to cover younger workers with a small government program and says he wants to make sure those with pre-existing conditions can always obtain insurance. Some Republicans worry about repeal-Obamacare strategy He said Obamacare shows \u201ctwo very different views of government.  We can talk about specific health care solutions, but it really comes down to a view of government that says we need more government in individual lives.  We need individual mandates and we need more interference between government and families versus a view of government that says no, we don\u2019t. That\u2019s wrong. \u201c Some Republicans worry that the bright line the party is drawing about repealing Obamacare isn\u2019t the right tactic. Bob Sikora, a resident at the Regency Oaks senior community who supports Jolly, told CNN he thinks the GOP should be talking about improving the law instead of scrapping it entirely. \u201cI would certainly think personally if I were in charge of his campaign, I would not have said, \u2018I\u2019m out to repeal it\u2019 \u2013 he\u2019s been forced to say that by some of the party higher-ups that control the tea party, which is controlling what Republicans are saying right now,\u201d Sikora said. Sink told CNN the concerns about the health care law are lower on the priority list for people in the district.  She puts it as \u201cfifth\u201d on the list of things voters raise with her at forums, after homeowners\u2019 worries about the skyrocketing costs of flood insurance, veterans issues, and the fear that any plans to start offshore drilling could hurt the tourism industry in this beach community. But one Sink supporter, Julie Meyer, who runs a retail shop in St. Petersburg, told CNN she thinks voters and the candidates should be talking about Obamacare. \u201cI would like the conversation. I think there are blatant lies about what is being said about Obamacare and that\u2019s very, very unfortunate, because people should be able to decide with the real information,\u201d Meyer said. Texas kicks off first primary of 2014 Democrats had a head start Democrats had the advantage going into the race because they did not have to spend time and money on a primary.  Jolly endured a contentious primary in January and didn\u2019t have any significant resources going into the general election.  With no primary opposition, the Sink campaign went to work against Jolly early and stuck with the line of attack that electing him would send someone to Washington who wanted to cut Social Security. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and outside groups have spent millions to drive that message home and link it to Jolly\u2019s lobbying history. House Majority PAC, an outside group that backs Democratic candidates, has spent close $750,000 on one ad that says Jolly \u201clobbied for a special interest that wanted to privatize Social Security.\u201d Jolly insists that Sink has misrepresented his position on the issue and says he would vote against the House Republican budget authored by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan because of the changes it would make to Social Security and Medicare. \u201cThey spent a million dollars painting me as an extremist and a million dollars on Social Security and Medi-scare and Social Security claims that are false,\u201d the GOP candidate told CNN. Poll: Anti-incumbent feelings at all-time high Jolly reiterates he opposes the proposals to privatize retirement accounts or alter how Medicare benefits are structured. \u201cI think the current reform plans are too aggressive, and I don\u2019t think we should pursue them,\u201d Jolly said. Republicans privately acknowledge that Sink\u2019s ability to start her ads early, combined with the fact that her campaign and the outside groups supporting her are outspending them, has hurt. David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the Cook Political Report, told CNN that \u201cDemocrats have been more consistent with their message in this race, building a narrative about Jolly as a lobbyist who operates behind closed doors, and that has clearly helped.\u201d District is evenly split This district is split down the political middle \u2013 37% of those registered to vote are Republicans, about 35% are Democrats and 28% are unaffiliated or back a third-party candidate.  There is a libertarian candidate, Lucas Overby, competing in the race, and he has participated in the three major debates. But it\u2019s unclear what kind of impact he\u2019ll have in drawing votes away from Jolly or Sink. Florida allows absentee voting by mail, and well over half of those who were mailed ballots have returned them.  In past election cycles, Republicans have traditionally posted a stronger return rate of absentee ballots, but the Pinellas County supervisors office reports that the GOP holds about a 4-point edge over Democrats sending in their ballots. Voters here frequently mention their distaste for the gridlock in Washington, and supporters of both Sink and Jolly told CNN they aren\u2019t sure that their candidate will be able to change much. Tami Simms, a registered independent who backed Young in the past and works as a Realtor in St. Petersburg, told CNN she\u2019s voting for Sink.  But she\u2019s unsure a new, more junior representative will deliver the same results. \u201cI know there are some concerns that no one is going to have (the) power that Congressman Young had from his tenure and from his longtime experience. There was more than just his tenure that allowed him to move funding for projects in this area.\u201d If Jolly wins on Tuesday, Republicans will certainly say retaining this competitive seat is a validation of their plan to make Obamacare the central issue this fall. A Democratic victory could have other candidates across the country adopting Sink\u2019s approach to discussing health care with a \u201cfix-it\u201d attitude. House Speaker John Boehner made it clear that even if the Democrats manage to pick up this seat, his party\u2019s midterm strategy won\u2019t change.  Asked if a loss in this special election could alter the GOP message of repealing Obamacare, Boehner replied simply, \u201cNo.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Special election in Florida to replace longtime congressman who died in October Political pundits scrutinize race as bellwether for November midterms Republicans trying to tie election to Obamacare and approval of the President Democratic candidate making opponent's lobbying background an issue From outward appearances Tuesday\u2019s special election to fill a vacant congressional seat in Florida doesn\u2019t seem to be that important. It\u2019s just one of 435 seats in the U.S. House, and the winner will serve out a term that comes to a close at the end of the year. But the contest for Florida 13 has landed smack in the middle of the national political spotlight. It\u2019s seen by some pundits as a bellwether for November\u2019s midterm elections, and there\u2019s been a massive infusion of outside ad money into the race to try to influence the outcome. A special election this far out from Election Day rarely gives us a preview of what will actually happen in November, but the party that does come out on top gets bragging rights until the next election. Empty your notebook: Republican finger-pointing in Florida Democrat Alex Sink is running against Republican David Jolly to fill out the term of Republican Bill Young, who died in October. Young, first elected to Congress in 1970, was the longest-serving Republican in the House. IP: King: GOP unsettled over FL election King: Florida special election test Rep. Ryan: The left is exhausted Sink was Florida\u2019s chief financial officer and narrowly lost the 2010 gubernatorial election to Rick Scott. Jolly served as a former general counsel for Young and also worked as a lobbyist. There\u2019s also a libertarian candidate in the race. Here are five things we can learn from the race: National parties test their pitches in Florida special election 1. Swing district in a swing state: The district covers most of Pinellas County and parts of St. Petersburg near Tampa, and it\u2019s up for grabs. While Young captured 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district. Obama also won it in 2008, grabbing 51% of the vote. It went for George W. Bush before that. Of those registered to vote in the district, 37% are Republicans, about 35% are Democrats and 28% are unaffiliated. Public opinion polls suggest the race remains close. With the number of competitive House seats shrinking with every cycle, Florida 13 is becoming something of a rarity. While both parties have a lot at stake, and both have tried to lower expectations, a top nonpartisan political handicapper says the Democrats have more to lose. \u201cIt\u2019s rare in politics that anything other than a presidential contest is viewed as a must-win, but the special election in Florida\u2019s 13th District falls into that category for Democrats,\u201d wrote Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. Rothenberg points out that all things being equal, Sink should win, since she didn\u2019t have a primary challenge and had a money advantage, and Jolly had to continuously battle the lobbyist label. \u201cSince most nonpartisan handicappers and analysts have for years expected this seat to go Democratic when it became open, a Republican victory would likely say something about the national political environment and the inclination of district voters to send a message of dissatisfaction about the President. And that possibility should worry the White House,\u201d Rothenberg said. Eight things to watch till Election Day Is the Republican party leaderless? Obama: GOP scared of immigration blowback GOP pushes back on 'war on women' notion 2. Is it all about Obamacare?: National Republicans are framing the election as a referendum on Obamacare. The National Republican Congressional Committee and pro-GOP outside groups link Sink to the health care law, to President Obama and to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. \u201cCanceled health plans. Higher premiums. Medicare cuts. People losing their doctors. A disaster for families and seniors. For Alex Sink the priority is Obamacare. Not us,\u201d says the narrator in a TV commercial by the Chamber of Commerce, which is backing Jolly. That\u2019s a potent message in a district that\u2019s one of the grayest in the nation. Nearly a quarter of all residents in Florida 13 are 65 or older. Jolly says he remains committed to getting rid of Obamacare entirely. Sink recognizes that Obamacare is a major issue. While she highlights how the Affordable Care Act has helped people, she also notes that the law has flaws, and says she\u2019s open to GOP proposals to amend some of the measure\u2019s requirements. \u201cRegardless of whether or not the election will tell us anything about November, the two political parties will learn lessons from this contest and apply them to future races,\u201d  Rothenberg said. \u201cIf Jolly wins, it\u2019s all about Obamacare for the GOP. And if Sink wins, Democrats will say that attacking Republican candidates on Medicare and Social Security works.\u201d 3. Excitement could translate to turnout: While special elections typically see far lower turnout than general elections, the race in Florida could have a strong showing \u2013 a statistic both sides will be eagerly trying to gauge to predict turnout in November. Early voting turnout is already higher than the total turnout for the last special election in Florida, when Democrat Ted Deutch won in 2010 after Democrat Robert Wexler resigned. Nancy Whitlock, a spokeswoman for Pinellas County elections, said about 27% of eligible voters in the district have already voted by mail or in person. By contrast, turnout for that 2010 special election was about 15% of eligible voters. That\u2019s the total figure, not just early voting. Is McConnell in trouble? Reid: Dems shoudn't fear Obama Reid: Candidates shouldn't fear Obama While registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats in the 13th District by about 11,350 voters, Democrats seem to be excited about the high early voting turnout so far. \u201cThese are tests of turnout to some extent,\u201d Rothenberg said. \u201cDemocrats are already talking about how they are doing better in the early voting than they thought they would.\u201d 4. Most expensive race so far: The contest has seen an outsized level of third-party spending, making it the most expensive race this election cycle, even more than last year\u2019s Senate special election in Massachusetts to replace former Sen. John Kerry. Outside spending also tops the current Senate race in Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is defending his seat. In addition to the $2.4 million spent by the campaigns themselves, as of mid-February nearly $9 million had been spent by outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors outside spending. Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the CRP, said the influx of cash has to do with the start of the 2014 midterms. \u201cIt seems like an anomaly that there would be all this outside interest when it\u2019s going to have to be fought again in November,\u201d she said. But she added that groups are interested in this race in part because there\u2019s \u201cno other show in town yet.\u201d Outside money, she said, can significantly strengthen or weaken the eventual victor when the race plays out again in November, but it also plays a large role in determining the dialogue and themes in the contest. Breaking the numbers down, Jolly appears to have an advantage in third-party spending. About $623,000 has been spent in efforts to oppose Sink, and Jolly has benefited from about $600,000 more to support him than his opponent. American Crossroads, the conservative super-PAC backed by Karl Rove, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are two of the largest super-PACs that have backed Jolly. On the Democratic side, House Majority PAC put in nearly $1 million. The two campaign arms in the House dished out the most cash in the race \u2013 the National Republican Congressional Committee slightly outspent the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, $2.2 million to $2.1 million. 5. From Barker to Biden to Bowzer to Bubba: Beside the national money and attention, the race also landed some big-time surrogates. Vice President Joe Biden flew in to headline a fundraiser for Sink, and former President Bill Clinton recorded an automated call for the Democratic candidate. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a rock star among grassroots conservatives, recorded a robocall for Jolly, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush starred in pro-Jolly TV commercial. But it wasn\u2019t just politicians. Bob Barker, the longtime host of \u201cPrice is Right,\u201d starred in an ad for Jolly in December. And in another blast from the past, Jon \u201cBowzer\u201d Bauman from Sha-Na-Na fame campaigned for Sink. Bowzer to campaign for Democrat in Florida",

            "article_content": "Florida's 13th Congressional District is a swing district in a swing state Republican David Jolly defeats Democrat Alex Sink in the special election Republicans say the victory shows that Democrats are on the defensive with Obamacare Campaign spending topped last year's special U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts In the first major ballot box test of 2014, the GOP won. Republican David Jolly edged out Democrat Alex Sink to win Tuesday\u2019s special election in Florida\u2019s 13th Congressional District. Jolly will fill out the term of his former boss, Republican Rep. Bill Young, who died in October. Young, first elected to Congress in 1970, was the longest-serving Republican in the House. With national Republicans framing the race as a referendum on Obamacare and a massive infusion of outside ad money to try to influence the outcome, pundits have looked to the Florida race as a bellwether for November\u2019s midterm elections. Special coverage: 2014 midterm elections But Jolly didn\u2019t mention the health care law in his victory speech and instead said, \u201cThis race is not about defending a broken agenda in Washington or advancing a broken agenda in Washington. This race is about defending Pinellas County and serving the people right here in our own community.\u201d Sink, the state\u2019s former chief financial officer who narrowly lost the 2010 gubernatorial election, said in a concession statement, \u201cWhile tonight was not the result we were hoping for, I am proud of the race we have run and so grateful for the countless Pinellas residents, volunteers and supporters who put their faith in our campaign.\u201d Swing district in swing state Jolly won 48.5% of the vote, and Sink got just under 47%. Libertarian candidate Lucas Overby was a distant third, with just under 5% of the ballots cast. With Jolly\u2019s win keeping the House seat in GOP hands, the Democrats still need win 17 seats in November to regain control of the chamber. Political handicappers say that\u2019s a tall order, considering the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts nationwide. Eight things to watch between now and Election Day Florida-13, a swing district in a swing state, covers most of Pinellas County between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, including parts of St. Petersburg. While Young captured 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district in his 2008 and 2012 victories. Attacking Obamacare the right prescription for GOP? While the candidates said local issues mattered heavily, national Republicans were quick to proclaim Obamacare the biggest loser. \u201cTonight, one of (House Democratic Leader) Nancy Pelosi\u2019s most prized candidates was ultimately brought down because of her unwavering support for Obamacare, and that should be a loud warning for other Democrats running coast to coast,\u201d proclaimed Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement. \u201cHis (Jolly\u2019s) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare,\u201d added Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Co-chair Sharon Day in an e-mail blast to reporters. CNN Poll: Support for Obamacare slightly edges up The Democratic National Committee claimed the issue of health care actually kept the contest close. \u201cRepublicans fell short of their normal margin in this district because the agenda they are offering voters has a singular focus \u2013 that a majority of voters oppose \u2013 repealing the Affordable Care Act that would return us to the same old broken health care system,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the DNC chair. Tons of outside advertising money was poured into the race, and many of the ads attacking Sink focused on health care. \u201cCanceled health plans. Higher premiums. Medicare cuts. People losing their doctors. A disaster for families and seniors. For Alex Sink, the priority is Obamacare. Not us,\u201d said the narrator in a TV commercial by the Chamber of Commerce, which backed Jolly. That was a potent message in a district that\u2019s one of the grayest in the nation. Nearly a quarter of all residents in Florida 13 are 65 or older. Jolly said he was committed to getting rid of Obamacare entirely. Sink acknowledged that Obamacare was a major issue. While she highlighted how the Affordable Care Act has helped people, she also noted the law has flaws and said she was open to GOP proposals to amend some of the measure\u2019s requirements. Democrats look to November Sink was the candidate national Democrats wanted in this race, and she faced nominal opposition in January\u2019s primary. Jolly was far from the GOP\u2019s dream candidate and had to battle to win the party\u2019s nomination. Democrats jumped on his work as a lobbyist who worked for groups pushing to privatize Social Security after he had left Young\u2019s staff. National Democrats, who began to try to lower expectations a few days before the election, said they\u2019ll make another run at the district in November. \u201cDemocrats will fight for Florida-13 in the midterm, when the electorate is far less heavily tilted toward Republicans,\u201d said Rep. Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Outside money Since it\u2019s one of a dwindling number of competitive districts and the only game in town, outside money poured into the race, which was the most expensive contest so far this cycle, topping even last year\u2019s special U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. In addition to the approximate $2.5 million spent by the two campaigns, the party committees and outside groups dished out more than $9 million to run TV and radio ads, other paid media and direct mail, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors outside spending. The pro-Republican group American Crossroads, which said it spend $500,000 on the contest, said that Florida-13 was just an appetizer \u201cA lot of us rolled up our sleeves after 2012, studied the Obama playbook and invested in targeted voter turnout and more effective messaging. The Florida CD-13 special was an important test market, and there was unprecedented cooperation among outside groups.  We intend to keep refining these lessons as we prepare for the fall elections,\u201d said Crossroads CEO Stephen Law. While a contest this far out from Election Day rarely provides a preview of what will actually happen in November, Jolly\u2019s victory will give the GOP bragging rights. \u201cRegardless of whether or not the election will tell us anything about November, the two political parties will learn lessons from this contest and apply them to future races,\u201d said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report.

            "article_content": "Republican David Jolly narrowly beat Democrat Alex Sink in a special election Outside groups supporting Jolly poured more money into race than Democrats Republicans feel they have found a winning issue on Obamacare Here\u2019s something shocking. Democrats and Republicans totally disagree about the significance of the GOP\u2019s victory in the first major competitive congressional ballot box test of 2014. Republican candidate David Jolly narrowly edged out Democrat Alex Sink to win Tuesday\u2019s special election in Florida\u2019s 13th Congressional District. Jolly will fill out the term of his former boss, longtime Republican Rep. Bill Young, who died in October. Republicans win first election showdown of the year The race was consistently in the spotlight with national Republicans framing the election as a referendum on Obamacare. They injected a massive infusion of outside ad money into the race and some pundits cast the election as a possible bellwether for November\u2019s midterms. \u201cI think this was a referendum on (President Barack Obama\u2019s) policies and on Obamacare, that played out significantly to the disadvantage of (House Democratic Leader) Nancy Pelosi. And I think it sets the tone for what\u2019s coming in the fall,\u201d Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told CNN Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to tell people this is a referendum election, Obamacare is not helping people the way it was promised, and Democrats are going to have a lot of answering to do,\u201d Walden added. Inside Politics: Florida 13 Results Rep. Ryan: The left is exhausted King: Florida special election test McConnell: 'Crush' the tea party But his counterpart at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sees very little predictive value in the results. \u201cSpecial elections are not indicators of the future. They never have been. They never will be. And certainly this is not an indicator of the future,\u201d Rep. Steve Israel, the DCCC chairman, told reporters. Special coverage: 2014 Midterm Elections While a contest this far out from Election Day rarely offers a preview of what will actually happen in November, Jolly\u2019s victory gives the GOP instant bragging rights. And the results also illustrate a few things about how the midterm election season may play out. GOP\u2019s convinced Obamacare\u2019s bad medicine for Democrats: While the candidates and local matters weighed heavily in the race, Obamacare was also a key issue. And Jolly\u2019s victory will only embolden Republican attempts top repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cHis (Jolly\u2019s) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and co-chair Sharon Day said in an email blast to reporters. Many of the ads attacking Sink focused on health care. \u201cCanceled health plans. Higher premiums. Medicare cuts. People losing their doctors. A disaster for families and seniors. For Alex Sink, the priority is Obamacare. Not us,\u201d said the narrator in a TV commercial by the Chamber of Commerce, which backed Jolly. That was a potent message in a district that\u2019s one of the grayest in the nation. Nearly a quarter of all residents in Florida-13 are 65 or older. Jolly said he was committed to getting rid of Obamacare entirely. Sink recognized that Obamacare was a major issue. While she highlighted how the Affordable Care Act has helped people, she also noted that the law has flaws and said she was open to GOP proposals to amend some of the measure\u2019s requirements. The Democratic National Committee claimed the issue of health care actually kept the contest close. The most important poll number of 2014 Roundtable: McConnell in the middle Senate's top Republican in trouble? Is McConnell in trouble? \u201cRepublicans fell short of their normal margin in this district because the agenda they are offering voters has a singular focus - that a majority of voters oppose - repealing the Affordable Care Act that would return us to the same old broken health care system,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the DNC chair. Democratic pollster Geoff Garin told reporters that \u201cbased on polling we did up until the election, Alex Sink basically neutralized the issue of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d But Garin noted that Obamacare energized the GOP electorate. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that the Affordable Care Act was a motivating issue for Republicans to come out and vote, and less so for Democrats,\u201d he said. Last autumn\u2019s flawed rollout of the health care law and the controversy over canceled policies because of Obamacare played into Republican hands. And the President\u2019s inaccurate pledge that \u201cIf you like your insurance, you can keep it\u201d under the new health care law is a line that dominated GOP attack ads the past few months. Even before Tuesday\u2019s GOP victory, Republicans pledged to keep the campaign focus on the health care law, even if it starts to gain traction with the public. A number of Republican strategists CNN reached out to on Wednesday said that while the focus won\u2019t be 100% on Obamacare, they admit it will remain a huge part of how they frame the midterms. Non-partisan analysts agree. Republicans hit Landrieu over climate change all-nighter \u201cThe one thing Republicans will take away from this race is that the Obamacare assault worked. We\u2019re going to see more and more and more,\u201d said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. \u201cRegardless of whether or not the election will tell us anything about November, the two political parties will learn lessons from this contest and apply them to future races,\u201d said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cJolly\u2019s win means it\u2019s all about Obamacare for the GOP.\u201d Outside money really mattered: In Sink, national Democrats landed the high-profile and well-known candidate they wanted in this race, and she faced nominal opposition in January\u2019s Democratic primary. Jolly was far from the GOP\u2019s dream candidate, and he had to battle to win his party\u2019s nomination. The past two months, he faced a barrage of attacks by Democrats on his days as a lobbyist and his work for groups pushing to privatize Social Security. Sink, meanwhile,  greatly out-raised, and outspent Jolly. But support from outside groups gave Jolly a major boost. Since it\u2019s one of a dwindling number of competitive districts and since it was the only game in town, outside money poured into the race. It was the most expensive contest so far this cycle, topping even last year\u2019s special U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. In addition to the approximate $2.5 million spent by the two campaigns, the party committees and outside groups dished out more than $9 million to run TV and radio ads, other paid media and direct mail, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors outside spending. The pro-Republican group American Crossroads, which said it spent $500,000 on the contest, said that Florida-13 was just an appetizer \u201cA lot of us rolled up our sleeves after 2012, studied the Obama playbook and invested in targeted voter turnout and more effective messaging. The Florida CD-13 special was an important test market and there was unprecedented cooperation among outside groups.  We intend to keep refining these lessons as we prepare for the fall elections,\u201d said Crossroads CEO Stephen Law. Turnout mattered: Florida-13, which is a swing district in a swing state, covers most of Pinellas County between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, including parts of St. Petersburg. While Young captured 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district in his 2008 and 2012 victories. So what happened Tuesday? Jolly won by around 3,500 votes out of some 180,000 cast. A libertarian candidate grabbed just under 5% of the vote. The plain and simple truth is that Sink lost because Democratic voters didn\u2019t vote. Turnout in the 2012 election was nearly double what it was in the special election. Democratic officials Wednesday said by their calculations, the GOP had a plus-13 advantage in the voting electorate in Tuesday\u2019s special election, compared to a plus-five advantage for the Republicans in the district in 2012. \u201cThe reality is Alex Sink was able to narrow a very large Republican advantage in turnout. She did very well with independent voters,\u201d said Garin. And Israel vowed to win the district come November, when he says the electorate will be more slightly more favorable to the Democrats. \u201cIf this election were in November instead of March, I think Alex Sink would have won,\u201d Israel added. A veteran Democratic strategist says his party has some hard work ahead. \u201cWhile it is true that a special election often has lower turnout (and thus is more likely to be won by a Republican), I think Democrats spin this loss at their own peril.  We lost, period,\u201d said CNN contributor Paul Begala. \u201cIt means we have to redouble our efforts to register and turn out the Rising American Electorate: people of color, unmarried women, young people.  We will never be able to match the right wing dollar-for-dollar, so we have to beat them voter-to-voter,\u201d he said. Steep road got steeper: The Democrats odds of winning back the House in November just got a little bit slimmer. With Jolly\u2019s win keeping the congressional seat in GOP hands, the Democrats still need win 17 seats in the midterms to regain control of the chamber. Political handicappers consider that a tall order, considering the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts nationwide.",

            "article_content": "Republicans are taking an aggressive stance against intra-party opposition One conservative groups called Mississippi Republican incumbent a \"liberal\" Establishment trying to prevent candidates who can't win in general election It\u2019s no secret that a battle has boiled over in the Republican Party. The fight has played out in the policy arena but also on the campaign trail. And since the inception of the tea party in 2009, it seemed like that wing had the upper hand. It slowly made effective inroads into a party many members of the vocal new group thought had lost its way. They elected a new breed of Republican into office, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who surprised the political world by defeating establishment-backed candidates in their respective primaries. But those two successes haven\u2019t been the norm, especially in the Senate, as many inexperienced but ideologically more pure candidates have been unable to seal the deal. In 2010, Sharron Angle won the Senate primary in Nevada and Christine O\u2019Donnell won in Delaware. Two years later, Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin won in Indiana and Missouri respectively. All four went on to lose against the Democrat. In a year in which Republicans have their best shot in several elections of regaining control of the Senate, party leaders are hoping to avoid general election stumbles. The Republican establishment is off to a good start this primary season, but it had an easy opener. Inside Politics: \"Thin Crust GOP\" GOP win in Florida has national impact Inside Politics: Will he run? Texas Sen. John Cornyn easily won his primary against tea party backed challenger Rep. Steve Stockman, who was largely persona-non-grata during his campaign. Still he spent $2.6 million in the final weeks leading up to the early March primary. Brian Walsh, a former Cornyn spokesman and former communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), which works to get Republicans elected to the Senate, said Cornyn did the work necessary to beat a challenger, including researching possible opponents and raising money. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that John Cornyn won,\u201d he said. Republican incumbents fight back Senate Republicans want to make sure that what happened in Texas happens elsewhere. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is facing a primary challenge from Matt Bevin, has taken the unusual step of publicly criticizing at least one group working to defeat some GOP incumbents, including McConnell - the Senate Conservative Fund. \u201cI think we are going to crush them everywhere,\u201d referring to SCF-backed candidates. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country,\u201d he said in a recent interview with The New York Times. And in an interview with The Weekly Standard, McConnell said the organization is giving conservatism \u201ca bad name.\u201d \u201cWe know their business model is only to criticize Republicans,\u201d he said. SCF Executive Director Matt Hoskins said in a statement to CNN that its members know that beating McConnell \u201cwon\u2019t be easy.\u201d But they\u2019re working to elect Matt Bevin \u201cbecause they know things won\u2019t change in Washington unless we change the people we send there.\u201d While McConnell\u2019s press office said he was talking specifically about the SCF, tea party groups took offense. \u201cHe must not want the tea party vote in the general election and that is why he should be removed,\u201d Amy Kremer, the Tea Party Express chair, told CNN previously. And the local Louisville Tea Party group endorsed Bevin last week. McConnell is expected to win his primary, but he\u2019s not making many friends among groups aligned with the tea party. Evangelical Latinos say they could be force in midterm elections Incumbents at risk The SCF is not the only thorn in Republican incumbents\u2019 side. In addition to the local and national tea party groups, Washington-based operations like Club for Growth and FreedomWorks have vowed to make sure that Republicans in name only (RINOs) \u2013 those viewed as not committed to their description of a limited government \u2013 have to empty out their Washington offices after November. Other Senate incumbents facing primaries include Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts and Mississippi\u2019s Thad Cochran. In Cochran\u2019s race, the conservative Club for Growth published an op-ed this week in SunHerald.com in Mississippi calling him a \u201cliberal\u201d because, among other things, he voted to create the Department of Education in the 1970s. \u201cWhy would his seventh term be any different from the last six?\u201d Club for Growth President Chris Chocola, a former member of Congress who voted for the budget-busting expansion of Medicare Part D in 2003, wrote in the opinion piece. Republican strategist John Feehery said that claim is ridiculous. \u201cThese guys are desperate and they are losing, so they are going to be using more and more language that is less and less rational,\u201d he said. But Stuart Rothernberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, said Cochran could have problems against State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who will benefit from money and resources of the Club for Growth and the SCF. \u201cIf there\u2019s going to be an incumbent whose defeated, Cochran is the first name on the list,\u201d Rothenberg said. Perhaps because Cochran, who has served in the Senate for 42 years and won his last election with 61% of the vote, doesn\u2019t yet understand the strength of his opponent. \u201cThe tea party is something I don\u2019t really know a lot about,\u201d he said on local station WLOX. But the Republican establishment isn\u2019t sitting on its hands and is even active in states like Mississippi and Kansas where any Republican would most likely to win. \u201cIn the past, if it\u2019s a red state, we\u2019d say \u2018we don\u2019t need to pay attention to that,\u2019\u201d said Walsh, adding that incumbents are prepared this year. Primary involvement And in primaries where there is no incumbent, the establishment is taking the calculated and unorthodox step of coalescing around favored candidates. While individual senators often endorse candidates, Walsh said the organization took \u201ca hands off\u201d approach during the last two election cycles. This year, the organization is more engaged. What\u2019s unclear, however, is exactly what resources the NRSC is providing to preferred candidates. In North Carolina, candidate Thom Tillis is the establishment favorite against tea party and FreedomWorks-backed candidates. He held a fundraiser at NRSC headquarters in Washington on Monday. McConnell attended as did a number of the 17 GOP senators who have endorsed him. Tillis spokesman Jordan Shaw said he can\u2019t speak about the role the NRSC is playing in the race. \u201cI don\u2019t work for them and can\u2019t speak for\u201d the NRSC, Shaw said. \u201cUntil we clear the primary, we\u2019ve got to be respectful of the process.\u201d Asked if the NRSC was getting involved in any primaries this year and if it could identify specific ways the group was helping, spokeswoman Brook Hougesen said, \u201cAs we have said time and again, any Republican candidate running for Senate is free to use our building as a location for their fundraiser,\u201d Hougesen wrote in an email. \u201cThis is all information that has been repeatedly reported.\u201d If Tillis\u2019 doesn\u2019t beat his opponents, OB-GYN Greg Brannon and pastor Mark Harris, in the May 6 primary, Democrat Kay Hagan\u2019s path to reelection is thought to get a lot easier. A similar scenario is playing out in Louisiana where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is in danger of losing her seat in the state that President Barack Obama lost by 12 points in 2012. Conservative groups, including the SCF, endorsed Rob Maness, a candidate who announced that he would not support McConnell as Republican leader, over well-funded, establishment-preferred Republican Bill Cassidy. What changed Republican strategist John Feehery said Republican incumbents have learned their lesson from difficult losses in the past two election cycles. \u201cI think Republicans have recruited better candidates and incumbents are taking this seriously,\u201d he said. The government shutdown over Obamacare funding was also a pivotal moment for the Republican Party as many in the GOP thought it was a pointless endeavor. After the shutdown ended, House Speaker John Boehner said conservative groups like FreedomWorks, which advocated the shutdown strategy, have \u201clost all credibility.\u201d And he said in January the shutdown strategy was a \u201cpredictable disaster.\u201d The shutdown \u201churt their standing and degraded some of the leverage they had,\u201d Republican strategist and former Boehner spokesman Kevin Madden said. \u201cThat leverage has now swung back toward McConnell and Boehner.\u201d Lessons from Florida\u2019s special election Some establishment candidates are receiving an added boost. The Chamber of Commerce, which usually does not get involved in primaries, decided that this year would be different. \u201cOur goal for 2014 is to protect and expand a pro-business majority in the House and advance our position in the Senate. How do we accomplish that? We\u2019re going early, often, and local,\u201d the chamber wrote on its website. The chamber has backed McConnell and a series of other races that are seeing opposition from conservative groups. Feehery said McConnell has nothing to lose by going after groups like the SCF who, he said, make their money by being \u201cprofessionally unhappy.\u201d \u201cThese people have no desire to find common ground. Nothing that Mitch McConnell will do will make these groups happy,\u201d Feehery said.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Paul Ryan releases a report that analyzes 92 government programs for low-income people He says the government's War on Poverty cost $799 billion in 2012 Ryan has taken up the mantle of poverty in the past year The report comes one day before President Obama releases his budget Rep. Paul Ryan concludes that 50 years after President Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty, a pathway out of poverty has become a patchwork of bureaucratic challenges. The Wisconsin Republican has zeroed in on the subject in a comprehensive analysis that points to repetition and inefficiencies in federal poverty programs. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee and a possible 2016 presidential candidate, released the 204-page report one day before President Barack Obama was due to unveil his budget blueprint for the next fiscal year. Read the report Obama aims to ignite a conversation about federal safety net spending. Fifteen percent of Americans, nearly 50 million people, live in poverty. 50 years later, War on Poverty rages on Obama: Raising wage is good for business Gov.: Government can help lessen poverty Ryan\u2019s report questions the size and scope of the government\u2019s effort to tackle poverty.  It says 92 federal programs geared for low-income people cost $799 billion per year. \u201cFor too long, we have measured compassion by how much we spend instead of how many people get out of poverty,\u201d Ryan wrote said in a statement. \u201cWe need to take a hard look at what the federal government is doing and ask, \u2018Is this working?\u2019\u201d Considered a Republican policy visionary, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee released the report amid a listening and learning tour of low-income neighborhoods that began 18 months ago after President Barack Obama was reelected. Ryan toured struggling neighborhoods with Bob Woodson, the head of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, an organization that works with disenfranchised people. In an interview with CNN in December, Woodson applauded Ryan\u2019s efforts because before he could write policy, he \u201cneeds to understand what the needs are.\u201d The political war on poverty Ryan\u2019s report is highly critical of many of the programs, saying they contribute to the \u201cpoverty trap.\u201d Because \u201cbenefits decline as recipients make more money - poor families face very high implicit marginal tax rates. The federal government effectively discourages them from making more money,\u201d the report says. It does not detail any solutions or alternatives; it identifies the programs, their cost and cites reports and studies on each program, with many concluding that the programs due more harm than good. For instance, in his analysis of the Social Security Insurance program for disabled, Ryan points to a report that says: \u201cAt age 18, approximately two-thirds of beneficiaries remain on adult SSI benefits.\u201d But not all of the reports he cites give negative reviews. For instance, Ryan cited numerous reports analyzing assistance for low-income families for child care found the program was effective in helping women enter the work force or enroll in education or job training programs. Fight on extending unemployment continues GOP: 'War on poverty' ineffective Paul Ryan welcomes Pope\u2019s welfare debate \u201cThis report will help start the conversation. It shows that some programs work; others don\u2019t. And for many of them, we just don\u2019t know,\u201d Ryan said. The report comes as Obama has amplified the issue of the growing wage gap between the rich and the poor, making income inequality a signature theme for this year that includes lifting the minimum wage. Ryan, who is a vocal advocate of a smaller government, has already met intense skepticism. The Democratic National Committee quickly pounced. This report is just a rehash of a failed economic agenda that Americans keep rejecting,\u201d DNC spokesman Michael Czin said in a statement. \u201cRepublicans just don\u2019t get it.  Their plan is to block a minimum wage increase, cut access to higher education, slash early childhood programs, voucherize Medicare and shred the social safety net \u2014 a safety net that lifted 45 million Americans out of poverty in 2012 alone.\u201d When he proposed reforms to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in 2010, he took immediate flak from Obama and Democrats who said he wanted to dismantle the big-ticket entitlements. The report was laced with partisan political ideas. For instance, it identified \u201cthe breakdown of family\u201d as a main cause of poverty - a common Republican talking point that rankles Democrats. Dr. Mariana Chilton, director of the Center of Hunger Free Communities and associate professor at Drexel University, said she is pleased Ryan \u201cignites a new conversation\u201d about poverty. But she said that some of the evidence he cites in his report, especially regarding food stamps and other nutrition assistance programs, is selective and incomplete. \u201cIt would get an \u2018F\u2019 in my master\u2019s classes,\u201d she said. Since the presidential election when Mitt Romney came under fire for his \u201c47%\u201d comments, saying nearly half of all Americans think the government should provide for them, some high profile Republicans have tried to take up the mantle of poverty reduction. Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise conservative think tank who has worked with Paul on the issue of poverty, said the congressman\u2019s involvement in the issue \u201creally signals that this is a priority for conservative politicians today.\u201d Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has proposed \u201ceconomic freedom zones\u201d and traveled to struggling cities to talk about them. Even Sen.
