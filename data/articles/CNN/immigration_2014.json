            "article_content": "House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders say they'll stand by Steve Scalise NEW: Leaders were initially frustrated with Scalise's first response to the story Scalise called GOP members of the House on Tuesday House Republican leadership is standing by Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 3-ranking House Republican, in the wake of a firestorm of criticism surrounding his 2002 speech to a white supremacist group. Scalise\u2019s position as House majority whip has been thrown into doubt by the revelation, and the congressman had been calling members to gauge the level of support he had from his party, according to a senior House Republican source. But House Speaker John Boehner, in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon, said Scalise has his \u201cfull confidence\u201d as whip. \u201cMore than a decade ago, Representative Scalise made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate.  Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I know Steve to be a man of high integrity and good character.  He has my full confidence as our Whip, and he will continue to do great and important work for all Americans,\u201d he said. His message came shortly before a similar message of support from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. House whip likely spoke to supremacists Congressman: CDC has to do a better job Jones and Scalise debate Obama's fix Obamacare site a 'national embarrassment' Cicilline: Boehner needs Democrats The controversy surrounding Scalise\u2019s address to a group founded by former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke had become a major distraction for Boehner and his leadership team since the story drew national attention on Monday. The fallout: What you need to know In a statement issued Tuesday, Scalise said he spoke to the group while he was barnstorming the district to build support for a piece of legislation \u2014 and that speaking to them was a \u201cmistake I regret.\u201d \u201cOne of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn. It was a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cI am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain,\u201d he added, and decried the group\u2019s \u201chateful bigotry.\u201d The statement did not address how much Scalise knew about the group at the time of the speech. Duke himself has said he doesn\u2019t know Scalise. Duke\u2019s former campaign manager, who said he organized the event, also said the congressman likely wasn\u2019t aware of the controversial history of his group. However, a Roll Call report from 1999 suggests Scalise knew Duke well, and was critical of his beliefs. At that time, both were considered potential contenders in a House special election, and Scalise panned him in comments to the paper. \u201cThe novelty of David Duke has worn off,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cThe voters in this district are smart enough to realize that they need to get behind someone who not only believes in the issues they care about, but also can get elected. Duke has proven that he can\u2019t get elected, and that\u2019s the first and most important thing.\u201d In a coordinated move Tuesday,  Boehner and McCarthy issued statements supporting Scalise within minutes of Scalise\u2019s new statement. There was frustration, according to the aides, that Scalise\u2019s initial statement, in which he blamed sloppy staff work for his appearance before the group in 2002, made it appear he wasn\u2019t taking full responsibility for the incident and moving to get it passed him. It is unclear at this point how much blowback Scalise will get from rank-and-file Republicans, and that might now be fully visible until lawmakers return to work next week after digesting the unfolding situation. While the only public expressions from Republicans to this point have been supportive, the aides predicted Scalise still needs to work hard in the days ahead to maintain the confidence of his colleagues. Critics of Scalise have been bipartisan, but so have his defenders. He\u2019s received strong support from Louisiana politicians, with African-American Rep. Cedric Richmond \u2014 the state\u2019s only Democratic House member \u2014 defending him from charges of racism. \u201cI don\u2019t think Steve Scalise has a racist bone in his body,\u201d Richmond told the New Orleans Times-Picayune. \u201cSteve and I have worked on issues that benefit poor people, black people, white people, Jewish people. I know his character.\u201d READ: Louisiana pols offer bipartisan backing for Steve Scalise But national Democrats have pounced on the episode, and as Boehner remained silent on the issue for most of Tuesday, ramped pressure on House Republican leadership to weigh in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, Drew Hammill, said the news of Scalise\u2019s speech is \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d for a GOP leader, but also declared that \u201cactions [of the House GOP caucus] speak louder than whatever\u201d Scalise said during the forum. \u201cJust this year, House Republicans have refused to restore the Voting Rights Act or pass comprehensive immigration reform, and leading Republican members are now actively supporting in the federal courts efforts by another known extremist group, the American Center for Law and Justice, which is seeking to overturn the President\u2019s immigration executive actions,\u201d he said in a statement. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee issued a scathing statement charging Scalise \u201cchose to cheerlead for a group of KKK members and neo-Nazis at a white supremacist rally\u201d and slamming House leadership for their silence on the development. \u201cWhile David Duke defends Scalise, Speaker Boehner and Leader [Kevin] McCarthy are refusing to condemn Scalise\u2019s choice of allies,\u201d said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee National Press Secretary Josh Schwerin. Schwerin said the incident made it \u201cclear their leadership has a history of embracing anti-Semitic, racist hate groups.\u201d According to an agenda for the event and notes attendees posted afterward, Scalise appeared at the National/International EURO Workshop on Civil Rights, a white nationalist organization founded by David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The appearance was first reported on Sunday on CenLamar.com, a Louisiana politics blog run by Lamar White Jr. But Scalise vehemently disavowed the group\u2019s beliefs in his interview with the Times-Picayune, and said he \u201cspoke to any group that called\u201d \u2014 comparing it, as an example, to the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group known for helping to register new voters. \u201cWhen you look at the kind of things they stand for, I detest these kinds of views. As a Catholic, I think some of the things they profess target people like me. At lot of their views run contradictory to the way I run my life,\u201d Scalise added. READ: The GOP\u2019s 2016 problem Scalise also suggested the appearance was in part due to staffing issues. \u201cI had one person that was working for me. When someone called and asked me to speak, I would go. I was, in no way, affiliated with that group or the other groups I was talking to.\u201d CNN has learned that the staffer at the time was Cameron Henry, who currently holds Scalise\u2019s former state House seat. Henry rushed CNN off the phone Monday night and declined to discuss the situation, but did not deny his work for the congressman. Henry\u2019s brother, Charles Henry, is Scalise\u2019s current chief of staff. Neither responded to requests for comment on Tuesday. The controversy comes just days before Republicans take full control of Congress with House Majority Whip Scalise poised to play a key role in shepherding through conservatives\u2019 legislative priorities. But even conservatives have expressed frustration with Scalise, who they believe hasn\u2019t stood strong on their priorities \u2014 pointing most recently to his vote for the government funding measure that drew heavy opposition from conservatives because it didn\u2019t address President Obama\u2019s immigration executive action. Some, however, expressed support for him Tuesday. Rob Maness, the former Louisiana Senate candidate backed by the Tea Party, has been named as a potential primary challenger to Scalise but backed him in a statement to CNN. \u201cAs Congressman Scalise has already conceded - attending this event was a mistake.  I think we are all currently taking him at his word that this was an isolated incident that happened some 12 years ago,\u201d Maness said. He added that if that\u2019s true, \u201cthis is clearly an orchestrated attack designed to distract\u201d from the real issues, including \u201cfighting back against President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, correcting a weak and feckless Foreign Policy and stopping the massive expansion of government growth and spending.\u201d More broadly, however, the establishment silence has infuriated conservatives still smarting over their loss in the Mississippi Senate race, when their chosen candidate, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, was narrowly defeated by Sen. Thad Cochran after establishment Republicans lodged racially-charged attacks against him. McDaniel came under heavy fire from establishment Republicans for being billed as a headliner for a rally alongside a white nationalist, though he never ultimately attended the rally. In an email to CNN, McDaniel said that \u201cof course there is a double standard for the GOP establishment.\u201d He noted that former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour \u201chas a long history of despicable comments, some of them overtly racist,\u201d pointing to a Politico article outlining some of the more salacious. \u201cAnd yet, he receives a free pass from establishment politicians because of his perceived influence.  All the while, others are forever tarnished for less serious deeds,\u201d McDaniel said. He added: \u201cThe establishment wings of both parties are more hypocritical than fair, seeking to crush anyone \u2013 friend and foe alike \u2013 who would threaten their hold on power.\u201d Politicians in Scalise\u2019s home state of Louisiana rallied to his defense on Monday, however, saying they don\u2019t believe he agrees with the white supremacist group\u2019s ideology. \u201cI know Congressman Scalise to be a good man who is fair-minded and kindhearted. I\u2019m confident he absolutely rejects racism in all its forms,\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said in a statement. But Scalise\u2019s alleged appearance at the event drew a harsh rebuke from Erick Erickson, the conservative RedState.com blogger and former Louisiana resident who asked of the congressman: \u201cHow do you not know? How do you not investigate?\u201d \u201cHow the hell does somebody show up at a David Duke organized event in 2002 and claim ignorance?\u201d Erickson wrote in a post Monday. He said Trent Lott \u2013 the former Senate majority leader who was driven from his post after praising Strom Thurmond\u2019s 1948 segregationist presidential campaign \u2013 lost his gig \u201cfor something less than this\u201d in 2001. And he pointed to Republicans who hit Mississippi Senate candidate Chris McDaniel in 2014 for attending events hosted by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and for making plans to attend a rally where he was billed along with a white nationalist.

Ted Cruz said the voters would decide on their eventual nominee Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s surprise announcement that he\u2019ll \u201cactively explore\u201d a presidential bid Tuesday morning did little to dissuade his potential Republican opponents from the race. Following the news, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who might make a White House bid, offered the clearest pitch yet for his own candidacy. \u201cI think I have a unique ability to deal with the threats we face at home and abroad and the challenges here, which is finally getting the government to work and dealing with a dangerous world,\u201d he told reporters on Capitol Hill. He said to \u201cstay tuned\u201d for his plans. \u201cI think there are a lot of people in the donor class who are looking for multiple voices, including Jeb\u2019s, and competition is a good thing,\u201d Graham said, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot to offer the Republican Party and the country.\u201d READ: Jeb Bush to \u2018actively explore\u2019 presidential bid Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was upbeat about the governor\u2019s announcement. \u201cI think we\u2019re a big tent \u2014 we can use moderates, conservatives, libertarians \u2014 we need \u2018em all,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI think the more the merrier \u2014 the public will determine\u201d whether Bush could win. And Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s spokesman, Alex Conant, said while Rubio has \u201ca lot of respect\u201d for Bush and thinks he\u2019d make \u201ca formidable candidate,\u201d Bush\u2019s decision has no bearing on his own. Clinton, Bush could square off in 2016 \u201cMarco\u2019s decision on whether to run for president or re-election will be based on where he can best achieve his agenda to restore the American Dream \u2014 not on who else might be running,\u201d Conant said. 5 times Jeb Bush talked about a 2016 run Many observers believe if Bush jumps in the race, Rubio \u2014 who\u2019s been mentored by the former Florida governor since his entry into politics \u2014 wouldn\u2019t run. But a source close to Rubio said Tuesday that while Tuesday\u2019s announcement changes the dynamic of the race, the junior Florida senator is still \u201con track to run for president\u201d in 2016. Another potential opponent, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, barely acknowledged that the two could face off in the primary fight. \u201cI think what Republicans want is someone who will stand up and lead, who will take on the great challenges of the day, who will make the case that the path we\u2019re on isn\u2019t working; that the Obama-economy is a disaster, that Obamacare is a trainwreck, that our constitutional rights are under assault and that we need to restore America\u2019s leadership in the world,\u201d he said. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who recently left the door open to his own 2016 bid, said the Bush announcement was \u201ckind of expected.\u201d Now, though, \u201ceveryone is starting to feel pressure to start making moves,\u201d he said. But even though Bush is seen as one of the top establishment picks in the primary if he runs, it was clear Tuesday morning he\u2019ll still have some work to convince some party leaders. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, wouldn\u2019t disclose what he discussed in his recent meeting with Bush, only that they went over the \u201cins and outs\u201d of a presidential campaign. READ: Source: Rubio \u2018on track\u2019 for 2016 run He wouldn\u2019t back the governor, either, since he\u2019s still waiting to see whether Graham, who McCain called his \u201cclosest friend,\u201d decides to run. Bush would enter the race with his \u201ccontributors, his family name, a long record as very successful governor,\u201d McCain said. Sen. Rob Portman, considered a possible vice presidential pick, told reporters he has talked to Bush recently about a potential campaign. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a strong candidate,\u201d said Portman, who recently announced he would be running for re-election rather than the White House in 2016. None of the GOP senators noted one of Bush\u2019s biggest liabilities in a GOP presidential primary, however \u2014 his support for policies anathema to conservative Republicans. Bush\u2019s support for Common Core educational standards and his previous openness to a pathway to citizenship have drawn him many critics on the far-right, and he\u2019ll face a challenge in winning over some of those primary voters. Soon after his announcement, the Conservative Action Fund, an outside spending group, emailed its supporters asking them to sign a petition urging Bush not to run and decrying him as \u201canother establishment, compromising\u201d Republican. But even right-wing firebrand Cruz on Tuesday held his fire when given the opportunity to attack Bush on one of his primary vulnerabilities, immigration reform. READ: 7 things to know about Jeb Bush \u201cImmigration will be a critical issue in this next election because we have a President who has been unwilling to work with Congress on common sense immigration reform,\u201d Cruz said, when asked how Bush\u2019s position on immigration would play out in the primaries. And some Republicans on Capitol Hill argued Bush still had a lot of work to do simply building the operation and support he\u2019d need to compete in a primary. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, also seen as a possible vice presidential pick, noted Bush has yet to stop by her state \u2014 which hosts the first primary in the nation \u2014 to meet with grassroots activists. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, you have to do the hard work in New Hampshire,\u201d she said. \u201cYou gotta do the grassroots. You gotta get down there and talk to the activists.\u201d She acknowledged that he\u2019d have \u201cthe Bush name recognition,\u201d but said there\u2019s no substitute for hard retail politicking in the Granite State. \u201cIt will make a difference how hard the candidates work in terms of meeting the activists and answering the hard questions,\u201d Ayotte said.

            "article_content": "The Tea Party lost nearly every one of its battles in 2014, but may have a better shot this cycle With three levels of primary fights, the establishment's attention and resources will be split Establishment groups are already gearing up for another costly and divisive battle The Republican establishment won big during this year\u2019s midterm elections, fending off far-right candidates in primary races who might have threatened the party\u2019s bid to retake full control of Congress. 2016 will be tougher. GOP leaders will have to keep an eye on a wide-open presidential primary, along with internal party fights at the House, Senate and gubernatorial levels. That could spread the party thin and leave an opening for conservative activists to pluck off establishment leaders with greater ease, particularly in congressional races as much of the attention shifts to the battle for the White House. Jeb Bush leads 2016 GOP candidate poll Potential 2016 presidential candidates The Year in Politics 2014 Michele Bachmann talks sexism in Congress Door-to-Door in Des Moines Conservatives, smarting from their losses this cycle, are already getting organized for 2016. And they came out of this month\u2019s government spending fight furious that congressional Republicans produced no tangible response to President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration executive action and convinced that Republicans are still ceding issues to Democrats after the election. Daniel Horowitz, a conservative strategist and editor of the site ConservativeReview.com, said that now that Republicans have control of Congress, \u201cthere\u2019s nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide\u201d for those who haven\u2019t kept their promises to the GOP base. \u201cYou can only fool most of the people some of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery capitulation [congressional Republicans] engage in, every primary they win by getting across the finish line and they don\u2019t do what they\u2019ve promised \u2014 it becomes that much tougher for them to defend.\u201d READ: GOP moves early to court conservative Christians Trent Lott, the former GOP Senate majority leader, said party leaders need to acknowledge the challenge they\u2019ll face with the presidential race at the top of the ticket. \u201cYou have to go into it realizing what\u2019s going on in the Republican presidential primaries will have some effect on the House and Senate primaries,\u201d Lott said in an interview. \u201cWhat they need to do \u2014 that they did well in 2014, but they need to do even better this cycle \u2014 is reduce the number of open seats, and recruit solid contenders.\u201d The dynamic underscores the competing priorities among Republicans heading into 2016. Establishment leaders view moderate candidates like Jeb Bush or Chris Christie as their best shot at winning the presidency. But conservatives believe that type of candidate would only follow in Mitt Romney\u2019s path to a disappointing loss, and are pushing for bomb-throwers like Sens. Ted Cruz or Rand Paul. The debate will play out at a time when Republicans are vulnerable on Capitol Hill. Though they will hold majorities in both chambers, Republicans face a daunting map in the Senate, where they\u2019ll defend 24 seats in 2016 \u2013 seven in states that Obama won twice. Establishment Republicans see a need for more centrist nominees to defend those states in particular, and yet those centrist incumbents \u2014 senators like John McCain of Arizona and Rob Portman of Ohio \u2014 already have targets on their backs. READ: 5 takeaways from Jeb Bush emails Paul Lindsay, spokesman for the establishment-friendly outside group American Crossroads, said nominating strong candidates takes on added urgency because of the tough political terrain for Republicans. \u201cI think [candidate quality] is very important, especially given the fact that we have the Senate and we\u2019ll want to make sure that we maintain it \u2014 and we have a map with a lot of Republican senators who are up for reelection in purple or blue states that Obama won,\u201d he said. The memory of Todd Akin, the Missouri Republican Senate candidate who created headaches for candidates up and down the ballot with his comments on rape and pregnancy in 2012 \u2014 and lost a winnable race \u2014 hasn\u2019t faded from the minds of Republican strategists. They are wary that another fringe nominee could undermine the party\u2019s shot at the White House this year. Building on lessons from that cycle and 2010,  national Republicans this year decided to aggressively engage in primary fights to help nominate strong candidates, and the strategy brought the GOP great success. But their primary successes took huge amounts of resources from the establishment, both financial and human, and considerable message discipline across the GOP. Along with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Chamber of Commerce and American Crossroads all poured millions into primaries to defend incumbents and beat back conservative challengers. Establishment strategists that engaged in primary fights this past cycle acknowledged with a wide-open, high-stakes presidential primary splitting attention and resources away from House and Senate primaries, conditions are ripe for an underfunded, insurgent challenger to slip through to the general. Austin Barbour, an adviser to a Mississippi-based super PAC that helped Sen. Thad Cochran fend off an unexpectedly tough challenge from the right, said incumbents this cycle should see Cochran\u2019s race as a cautionary tale. Fundraising \u201chas to be a concern,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to raise a ton of money and make sure you have a strong political organization in your state,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all going to require human capital, as well as financial capital, to win those races\u201d in 2016. GOP strategist Chris LaCivita, who advised the NRSC last cycle and was sent to help Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts overcome an unexpectedly strong independent challenger, said on that front in particular, the presidential primary could make things tougher. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be a lot of competition for money, a money and time-suck is going to really have an impact on Senate and House candidates, especially challengers,\u201d he said. Indeed, Lindsay said the group again plans to engage heavily in primaries. But he acknowledged it will be tougher to raise the money. And there\u2019s also the prospect that typically fringe candidates won\u2019t need the money to pick up traction, with a conservative presidential candidate offering them some lift. READ: Christie says Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 ambitions aren\u2019t a factor That could also complicate the party\u2019s message downballot, if incumbents and establishment candidates are asked to answer for gaffes or controversial comments made by conservative candidates engaged in the presidential primaries. And having a conservative-vs.-establishment fight at the presidential level could force some downballot candidates to address some of the more policy issues they can typically skirt, like welfare reform or disaster relief, that could be problematic for a nominee in a general election. Horowitz said conservatives see that as a key advantage of the upcoming cycle. \u201cWe do have a net benefit of a presidential election, where you have prominent people at the top of the ticket discussing those issues and forcing some of those individual candidates downballot to go on the record,\u201d he said. But Ron Bonjean, a veteran Republican strategist with close ties to establishment groups and candidates, said that could be the GOP\u2019s \u201cbiggest challenge.\u201d \u201cOur biggest concern is making sure that Republicans and candidates are running their statewide programs \u2014 and not falling into the challenges of the presidential primary campaign trail,\u201d he said. Preparing for that potential is already underway. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is in talks to launch a new super PAC geared towards Senate races, likely to bolster the NRSC and Crossroads in helping nominate strong candidates and engage in the general election fight. The NRSC has met with the chiefs of staff of all incumbent senators up for reelection. But Tea Party groups say they\u2019re recalibrating as well, preparing for what ForAmerica President Brent Bozell called \u201creal combat.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be real combat between the moderates and the conservatives in the party \u2014 it\u2019s going to come to the surface in a pretty dramatic way,\u201d he said.",

After the election, Obama quickly announced an overhaul of U.S. immigration rules and new regulations aimed at curbing environmentally-harmful emissions. He followed those moves this week with a deal that represented the biggest steps to thaw the economic freeze with Cuba in decades. The Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility \u2013 which Obama pledged to shut down as part of his 2008 campaign, but saw his plans thwarted when Congress passed a law prohibiting him from doing so \u2013 could be another target ripe for executive action. Obama\u2019s year-end message: North Korea Cuba and Congress Obama has transferred many of the detainees housed at that facility to other countries in recent months, and said Friday he\u2019ll continue trying to do that, since Congress won\u2019t allow him to shift those detainees into federal Supermax facilities within the United States. \u201cWe are going to continue to place those who have been cleared for release or transfer to host countries that are willing to take them,\u201d Obama told Crowley. Related: Guantanamo detainees release The toughest challenge, he said, is dealing with \u201csome really hard cases\u201d in which \u201cwe know they\u2019ve done something wrong and are still dangerous.\u201d Still, Obama said, he wants to shut the facility down. \u201cI think that it does not make sense for us to spend millions of dollars per individual when we have a way of solving this problem that\u2019s more consistent with our values,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama has a year-end press conference scheduled for Friday afternoon He is sure to face questions on Cuba, cybersecurity and Russia Obama and family will depart for their Hawaii vacation Friday night President Barack Obama is set to close a week jam-packed with news of a breakthrough with Cuba and new tensions with North Korea on Friday with a 1:30 p.m. EST news conference. Just weeks removed from huge Democratic losses in the midterm elections, Obama\u2019s allies say he appears liberated \u2013 taking executive actions to overhaul immigration rules, thaw the United States\u2019 economic and diplomatic freeze with Cuba and more. Here are some of the questions Obama will likely face as he confronts the press one more time before he heads to Hawaii for what\u2019s left of 2014: Did November\u2019s election result liberate you? Obama ducks lame duck status Is your information on the deep web? A President derided as overly cautious for much of the last six years \u2013 especially since the Republican wave of 2010 \u2013 is suddenly no longer hesitant to use every lever the Oval Office has to offer. He\u2019s brokered a diplomatic breakthrough with Cuba, halted deportations for more than 4 million undocumented workers, green-lit Environmental Protection Agency restrictions on ozone emissions, endorsed net neutrality and extended talks with Iran to curtail its nuclear program. And that\u2019s just been in the first six weeks since Democrats lost the Senate. With no more potential election results weighing on his actions, does Obama suddenly feel like he\u2019s free to be the President he\u2019s always wanted to be? Republicans scoff at this notion \u2013 and they\u2019re working quickly to curb Obama\u2019s executive authority. Dozens of states are challenging his immigration action in court, while Congress is plotting to defund him on immigration and block parts of his Cuba deal. The strength of Obama\u2019s resistance on Capitol Hill won\u2019t come fully into view until new lawmakers take office in January. Was this the push Cuba needed to embrace democracy? Obama: Chance for new outcome with Cuba Republicans like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio blasted Obama\u2019s deal to free American contractor Alan Gross, trade three Cuban spies for one American spy imprisoned in Cuba and ease a host of U.S. banking and travel restrictions and open an embassy in Havana in exchange for the release of 53 political prisoners and expanded Internet access. Their criticism: Obama just gave away the United States\u2019 best leverage to force Cuba to abandon communism and embrace human rights, democracy and a greater connection to the outside world. He responded by pointing out those tactics hadn\u2019t worked in the 50 years since the embargo. What was Obama\u2019s calculation on what this deal would mean for Cuba\u2019s future? What\u2019s the next campaign pledge you\u2019ll use your executive authority to fulfill? Obama was widely mocked during the 2008 campaign for promising to engage directly, without preconditions, with the leaders of the United States\u2019 enemies. And yet his Cuba deal, negotiated in secret for more than a year, shows Obama carrying through on that promise. Obama has just two years left in office to tackle a long list of complicated issues that played prominent roles in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns. Will he finally close Guantanamo Bay? Will his approach to the international stage change now that election results aren\u2019t riding on how his moves are portrayed? Russia\u2019s economy is tanking, but Vladimir Putin isn\u2019t backing down. What\u2019s next? Russia\u2019s ruble has tumbled to historic lows, and its central bank raised its interest rate to a stunning 17 percent this week \u2013 a downturn due to dropping oil prices and harsh Western sanctions on the country\u2019s oligarchs and its banking, energy and defense industries imposed as a result of the country\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region. So Russian President Vladimir Putin could have sent signals that he is willing to back off. Instead, he used a three-hour long news conference Thursday to compare Russia to a \u201cbear\u201d that the United States and its European allies are trying to chain down before ripping out its \u201cteeth and claws.\u201d Obama and his top economic advisers have long insisted that the pressure of Western sanctions will grow over time \u2013 and there\u2019s only so much Russia\u2019s economy can take. But Putin continues to resist that characterization. Is a breaking point coming soon? And if not, what will the United States and European countries do to further pressure Putin? RELATED: Obama and Putin: From frosty to frozen What does North Korea\u2019s Sony hack \u2013 and Sony\u2019s decision to pull a film\u2019s release as a result \u2013 say about America? The Obama administration is set to place the blame on North Korea for hacking into Sony\u2019s computers and threatening attacks on theaters that show \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a movie that depicts the cartoonish assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Sony subsequently decided to halt the film\u2019s planned release. Obama could be asked whether Sony was wrong to pull the movie \u2013 and whether it\u2019s troubling that a major company was so easily cowed. He could also face questions about whether there\u2019s the Sony hack will build momentum in Congress for cybersecurity legislation that would increase data sharing between companies and the U.S. government. Other similar questions: Is Sony\u2019s vulnerability an ominous sign for other corporate giants, the government, financial services institutions and more? Are cyber attacks akin to acts of violence? What can the United States do to better defend itself against future attacks?",

            "article_content": "The 1.1 trillion spending measure passes the Senate with a vote of 56:40 Some liberals fight to strip out provisions easing Wall Street regulations Tea party conservatives try to attack Obama's actions on immigrations The Senate approved a $1.1 trillion spending measure Saturday night funding most of the government through September, removing the threat of a shutdown for much of 2015. The bipartisan 56-40 vote sends the bill to President Barack Obama, who is expected to sign it into law. Passage closes a chapter of yet another fiscal battle on Capitol Hill. It came after attempts to delay the legislation by liberals who sought to strip out a policy provision that eases a Wall Street regulation and conservatives who tried to slow action on immigration. In fact, the Senate would not have been in session this weekend if it hadn\u2019t been for a small band of conservatives who sabotaged an agreement by Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who wanted to vote on the bill Monday. In a late Friday night procedural sneak attack, carried out after McConnell left the Capitol, the group led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, forced the Senate to stay.  They also pressed to get a vote on a measure to declare the bill unconstitutional because it funds what they say is \u201cillegal amnesty\u201d included in the President\u2019s recent executive orders on immigration. READ: The death of horse-trading on the Hill The move by rank-and-file members to undermine an agreement between the Senate leaders is highly unusual and may reflect the difficulty incoming majority leader McConnell will face managing the Senate when the new Congress convenes next month. Cruz defended his actions. \u201cEvery Republican candidate all across the country said we\u2019ll do everything humanly possible to stop President Obama\u2019s illegal amnesty.  We\u2019re honoring those commitments,\u201d Cruz said as he shuttled between strategy sessions in the Capitol with his cohorts Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana, and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get nothing out of this,\u201d said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who, like a lot of senators, was frustrated by Cruz\u2019s tactics and predicted he would not succeed in scuttling the bill.  \u201cThis is absolute utter nonsense for us to be here.\u201d Cruz ultimately did receive a vote challenging the funding bill because it included money for the Department of Homeland Security, which is carrying out the President\u2019s recent executive actions on immigration.  Cruz and other Republicans say the President\u2019s orders are unconstitutional. Though his challenge failed, the senator wanted a vote to \u201censure that every senator will be on record regarding the constitutionality of President Obama\u2019s illegal amnesty,\u201d Catherine Frazier, Cruz\u2019s press secretary, emailed reporters early Saturday ahead of the vote. READ: Surprises hidden in the spending bill Democrats took advantage of the Saturday session to begin procedure votes on 24 nominations, including some controversial ones like Sarah Salda\u00f1a for director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Vivek Murthy for surgeon general, and Carolyn Colvin for commissioner of the Social Security Administration. A senior Democratic leadership aide said some of the nominees would most likely have not received a vote because of timing and senators leaving for the holidays. \u201cWe gave away literally nothing, and we got a number of nominees we would not have been able to confirm if we hadn\u2019t been in session today,\u201d the aide said. Before the unusual weekend session, much of the drama over the spending bill was in the House, where Republican Speaker John Boehner and Obama formed an unusual alliance to quell their own parties\u2019 rebellions \u2013 led on the left by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D- Massachusetts. All the maneuvering was an ominous sign of what\u2019s to come now that this Congress is wrapping up its work and a new one is set to start in January. Boehner and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader McConnell are still struggling to rein in tea party conservatives who are itching for more showdowns over Obama\u2019s immigration policies, the health care law, the debt ceiling and more. And Democrats who had been loyal to Obama now find they no longer need the President, especially since many of the party\u2019s more centrist members lost their seats in a midterm election that saw Republicans gain control of the Senate and expand their advantage in the House. \u201cThis by definition was a compromise bill. This is what is produced when you have a divided government that the American people voted for,\u201d Obama told reporters Friday. \u201cHad I been able to draft my own legislation, get it passed without any Republican votes, I suspect it would be slightly different,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not the circumstance we find ourselves in and I think what the American people very much are looking for is responsible governance and the willingness to compromise, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve clearly done,\u201d Obama added. Beyond keeping the government open, the spending bill includes dozens of far-reaching policy provisions. It blocks a voter-approved law in the District of Columbia, that legalizes marijuana and blunts a school lunch program championed by first lady Michelle Obama.",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Barack Obama signed the deadline extension early Friday morning Senate could vote on spending bill Friday, but have until Saturday before next deadline Congress narrowly averted another shutdown Thursday night, 14 months after the last one What's new is that now Democrats don't need their President This Congress is going out just the way it began: in complete disarray. Fourteen months after tea party conservatives ignored Republican leaders and forced a two-week government shutdown, another one came close to happening \u2013 this time because liberals were blowing off President Barack Obama\u2019s pleas to support a government funding measure. In the early morning hours Friday, Obama signed a two-day extension, and the Senate is expected to pick up the legislation and vote on it later Friday, though they have until midnight Saturday before the next deadline. For weeks, legislative leaders insisted another shutdown wouldn\u2019t happen. And it didn\u2019t. But the House was just two hours away, and the Senate might not cast its final votes until this weekend. Obama: Parts 'I really do not like' Congress narrowly averts shutdown House passes spending bill Another flirtation with another deadline \u2013 this one after a midterm election that swept Republicans into control of the Senate \u2013 offers a grim glimpse at the paralyzing levels of dissent that could come next. Republicans don\u2019t fear their leadership. And Democrats don\u2019t need their President. READ: Shutdown averted, but barely After November\u2019s elections, when the GOP won the Senate and expanded its majority in the House, party leaders claimed a mandate. Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged that with Republicans in control of both chambers come January, things will be different. More amendments will be allowed. \u201cCenter-right\u201d legislation will advance. But long-clear divisions on the right remain \u2013 and were evident in the House when 16 Republicans, many angry that the party hadn\u2019t fought harder to block Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, opposed the measure in a key procedural vote and nearly dealt their leaders a major blow. By the end of the night, 67 Republicans voted against the measure\u2019s final passage. Conservative lawmakers complained that House Republican leadership punted their latest opportunity to combat Obama\u2019s signature health care law \u2013 which they fought to defund during the October 2013 shutdown \u2013 and his executive overhaul of immigration and deportation rules. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the same pattern \u2026 Now Obamacare is funded. Now Obama\u2019s executive amnesty is funded,\u201d Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said on Fox News. Alongside him, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, called the vote \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to midterm voters. Even if Republicans gain stability, Democrats are splintering. READ: Here\u2019s what\u2019s tucked in the spending bill Fresh off an election that purged the Democrats of many of their most centrist members, liberals \u2013 now more influential within their own ranks \u2013 have gone rogue, saying \u201cno\u201d to what the White House called a fair compromise, even though their bargaining position isn\u2019t going to get better. In an extraordinary scene Thursday afternoon, two of the party\u2019s most influential members made high-profile breaks with Obama. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the government funding measure \u201cblackmail\u201d because of its inclusion of language rolling back a Wall Street reform that Democrats had fought hard to win in 2010. Meanwhile, the party\u2019s liberal hero, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, declared on the Senate floor that it is \u201ctime for all of us to stand up and fight.\u201d Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were calling House Democrats, urging them to support the measure. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough rushed into a caucus meeting to make its case. But Democrats insisted as they exited that meeting that McDonough hadn\u2019t won many members over. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, said Democrats need to draw a line now to signal that they won\u2019t accept these kinds of deals in the future \u2013 when Republicans will control the Senate, too, and are certain to advance bills with more conservative priorities. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stand for something you\u2019ll fall for anything,\u201d Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, said in the meeting. Still, some influential lawmakers said the government funding measure was a chance at redemption. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, said Thursday night was an opportunity for Congress to break a pattern in which lawmakers have \u201cparalyzed ourselves by making the perfect the enemy of the good.\u201d \u201cWe tried to govern on a bipartisan basis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe reached across the aisle and we reached across the Capitol dome.\u201d CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "McCain edges closer than ever to 2016 campaign Says would be \"foolish\" not to expect tough primary challenge John McCain says he is \u201cmost likely\u201d running for re-election in 2016, but is aware that he will be a top target for conservative groups gunning for establishment Republicans in primaries. In an interview with CNN, the Arizona senator stepped closer to pulling the trigger on a campaign for a sixth term and seems to be spoiling for the fight. But he also said he\u2019s not sure Republicans can hang on to the Senate in two years after grabbing it back from Democrats in the midterm elections. \u201cI am approaching it, that decision, and it\u2019s most likely that I will announce that I am a running again,\u201d said McCain, who will be 80 at the time of the 2016 election. McCain had previously said he was considering and \u201cleaning towards\u201d a campaign but would announce his intentions in early 2015. The veteran senator is about to get his firmest grip on power in Washington since his defeat to President Barack Obama in the 2008 election. He will serve as chairman of the influential Senate Armed Services Committee when Republicans take the majority in January. But McCain said he would run the committee on the assumption that he will be chairman for only two years, because the Republican majority\u2019s fate will also be decided in 2016. \u201cIt is certainly not clear whether we keep the Senate or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will depend on how we can show the American people with a Republican majority that we can govern or not.\u201d McCain knows that tea party and other activists are already lining him up and could seek to exploit positions on immigration and torture that have put him at odds with the conservative base. \u201cI will be at the top of the list, there is no doubt about that,\u201d said McCain. \u201cI expect a vigorous campaign. For me to expect anything else would be foolish. And I\u2019m not foolish.\u201d In his last election, in 2010, McCain fought off a vocal primary challenge from conservative former House Republican and radio host J.D. Hayworth. Since then, a number of Tea Party-backed candidates have made a practice of challenging longtime lawmakers and candidates favored by the party establishment in primaries.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Rep. Steve Israel says the riders added to the legislation are a \"poison pill\" Congress must pass a bill by Thursday at midnight to keep the government open Dem backlash is throwing spending deal into doubt A backlash from Democrats over add-ons to a massive government spending bill is throwing passage of the measure into doubt and once again raising concerns about a government shutdown. The House is slated to vote on the legislation Thursday, just hours before agencies run out of money. But on the morning of the scheduled vote, Rep. Steve Israel, a member of Democratic leadership, said the riders in bill have become a \u201cpoison pill\u201d against Democratic support that the GOP majority needs for the measure to pass. \u201cAt this point I don\u2019t see many Democratic votes at all for a bill that is so antithetical to the middle class,\u201d Israel told CNN following a meeting with other Democratic leaders. The $1.1 trillion spending bill authorizes funding for virtually all agencies through September, but some Democrats on Capitol Hill are vowing to oppose the legislation, arguing that the addition of some key policy changes amount to a giveaway for big special interests. Congress must pass some type of legislation by Thursday at midnight to avert a shutdown. 'Policy riders' in the 2015 spending bill We have a deal (or do we?) READ: What\u2019s tucked into the spending bill The top concerns from Democrats center on a proposal to ease banking regulations in the Dodd-Frank law and a measure that would allow wealthy donors to give considerably more money to the political parties. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the provisions were \u201cdestructive to middle class families and to the practice to our democracy\u201d and demanded they be stripped out of the bill.   Pelosi\u2019s position is critical because House Republicans need Democratic support for the measure to pass. Though Republicans hold a significant majority in the House, Speaker John Boehner is expected to lose anywhere from 40 to 60 conservatives in his party who oppose the bill because it doesn\u2019t block the President\u2019s immigration executive action. Democrats will need to provide votes to offset those losses, setting up the sort of political brinksmanship that has become typical in Washington. A shutdown remains unlikely because lawmakers could agree at the last minute to approve a bill that would keep the government running for a few months \u2013 when Republicans will have full control of Congress. House GOP aides say they are surprised Pelosi and others are lobbying for changes, since Democrats signed off on the bill before its release. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, asked by CNN if he was concerned about the bill\u2019s prospects, said no, replying with a smile, \u201cdo I look worried?\u201d Key Senate Democrats are also blasting the deal. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second ranking Democrats who is in charge of counting votes, said he didn\u2019t know if he would support the compromise or how many Democrats would. He called the Dodd-Frank provisions \u201cawful.\u201d \u201cIt is just an invitation for another financial disaster and the Republicans are hell-bent on getting that included,\u201d Durbin told reporters in the Capitol. \u201cTheir appetite is whetted by the Nov. 4th election to undo Dodd-Frank. That has been one of their passions, second only to repealing the Affordable Care Act, and it means that the Wall Street interests \u2013 the big banks, you know \u2013 they\u2019re back on top as far as the House Republicans are concerned,\u201d he said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts who is heavily involved in banking regulations, lashed out at the changes to the banking rules. READ: Activists fear bill will ban DC pot legalization \u201cThe House is about to vote on a budget deal \u2013 a deal negotiated behind closed doors that slips in a provision that would let derivatives traders on Wall Street gamble with taxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system,\u201d she said in a passionate floor speech.  \u201cThese are the same banks that nearly broke the economy in 2008 and destroyed millions of jobs.\u201d She urged Democrats to oppose the spending bill until \u201cthis risky giveaway is removed from the legislation.\u201d On the campaign finance matter, House Speaker John Boehner said larger individual donations to the parties are needed because Congress had recently eliminated taxpayer funds for political conventions. \u201cThe Congress is very concerned about taxpayer funding of political activities,\u201d Boehner said.  \u201cThis provision was worked out in a bipartisan way to allow those who are organizing conventions the opportunity to raise the money from private sources as opposed to using taxpayer funds.\u201d Republican aides familiar with the negotiations say that both the chairs of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee supported the change on contributions limits to boost their own coffers. But DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Shultz told CNN it was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d true that she knew anything about the change to campaign finance laws being added to the spending bill. She said there was a joint effort with the RNC to appeal to the Federal Election Commission to raise the cap for donors for conventions, but she did not support putting this provision in the funding bill. Democratic aides say it\u2019s still early to gauge how many members will vote no on Thursday, but acknowledge that the deal was brokered by Democrats and Republicans over several weeks.  Democrats who negotiated the deal defended the end result, saying Republicans had pressed for six different changes to Dodd-Frank but Democrats were able to whittle it down to one.  Democrats also said they successfully removed more than two dozen environmental items and a handful of gun-related policy provisions sought by Republicans. Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a top Pelosi deputy, said he\u2019s voting no, and described the opposition as \u201crunning deep and getting deeper\u201d as more Democrats review the details. The number three House Democrat, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, told reporters he was undecided, but was hearing \u201clots of concerns\u201d about the banking provision, and said \u201ca lot of civil rights groups have been burning up the airwaves with problems about this.\u201d A similar measure removing this same financial regulation was passed by the House last October, with 70 Democrats voting for it, a point McCarthy noted on Wednesday when pressed about the latest criticism from Democrats \u201cDo they want to shut down the government?\u201d McCarthy said about those Democrats vowing to oppose the spending measure. Boehner\u2019s spokesman said the controversial provisions will remain in the bill. \u201cIf Rep. Pelosi doesn\u2019t think her negotiators did a good job, she should discuss it with them - but sour grapes doesn\u2019t mean she gets to rewrite the deal after the fact,\u201d Michael Steel said in a statement to CNN. Still Republicans insist that there won\u2019t be a shutdown over this issue, and indicated they would consider a short-term funding bill through early next year \u2013 when they will have full control of Congress \u2013 if this bill fails.

            "article_content": "Mitch McConnell says the Senate will vote on a bill authorizing military action against ISIS in early 2015 The incoming Senate majority leader says he wants President Barack Obama to request the authority for war Obama would be in a \"much stronger position\" if the fight against ISIS with congressional support, McConnell says The Senate will send President Barack Obama legislation authorizing the use of military force against ISIS shortly after the GOP takes majority control in January, presumed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, the Kentucky Republican said he\u2019d like to see Obama ask Congress for such a measure \u2013 but that one is coming anyway. \u201cIt would be even better if the President asked us for what he wants, but we\u2019re not going to wait forever,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to need to use force, there\u2019s no question about it. They\u2019re beheading Americans and posting it on the Internet. They\u2019re a serious threat to our national security. And we\u2019re going to have to act,\u201d he said. He signaled that crafting legislation green-lighting military action, which is already underway against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, could be an item on which Republicans could work with Obama. \u201cI think the President is moving in that direction himself,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cHe\u2019d be in a much stronger position with an authorization of the use of military force. We\u2019ve been sort of expecting him to ask for it, but if he doesn\u2019t, I think he will get one sometime soon after the first of the year.\u201d The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will start its debate on authorizing the use of military force against ISIS this week. Secretary of State John Kerry is set to appear before the panel Tuesday. Meanwhile, Sens. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, and Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, are pushing for a vote on a bill that would approve U.S. action. That measure, though, wouldn\u2019t advance in time for a vote before senators are expected to wrap up their post-election \u201clame duck\u201d session and leave Washington. McConnell said he doesn\u2019t want a vote in December, but that with the new Republican majority in place in January, \u201cWe\u2019ll address it at the beginning of next year.\u201d In the interview, McConnell previewed his plans for the final two years of Obama\u2019s tenure \u2013 saying he expects the Senate to pass legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline, forcing the President into a tough veto decision, and to \u201cpush back against this overactive bureaucracy\u201d on environmental regulations. He also said he expects votes to repeal Obama\u2019s signature health care law, as well as some of its key components, including the individual mandate that all Americans have health insurance and its tax on medical device-makers. But McConnell, pointing to a meeting with Obama last week, said Republicans might be able to agree with the President on a few issues. \u201cIt would be better, obviously, if we can get some results. And he and I had an opportunity to talk last week. And we agreed to talk about the things that we might agree on,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnd there are some,\u201d he said. \u201cTrade agreements. There may be a path forward on comprehensive tax reform. We have certainly a lot of bipartisan interest in the crumbling infrastructure in the country and what to do about it. My first choice is to make progress for the country.\u201d McConnell said his meeting with Obama was \u201cunusual \u2013 we\u2019ve not had a chance to talk very much.\u201d But he said that\u2019s no surprise, since the President took office with hefty Democratic majorities and the party kept control of the Senate until November. McConnell said he\u2019s \u201cnot opposed to negotiating with the administration.\u201d \u201cNow he needs to talk to us and that\u2019s good, because when the American people elect divided government, they\u2019re not saying they don\u2019t want anything done,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWhat they are saying is they want things done in the political center, things that both sides can agree on. And in the conversation last week, we talked about the things where there may be some agreement.\u201d McConnell left the door open to congressional action on immigration \u2013 which both McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had said would be made much more difficult by Obama\u2019s executive action halting deportations for the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is try to figure out the best way to respond to what the President has done. We know we have a broken immigration system. We know the border is not secure. We know that we need an expansion in H1-B visas. We need an improvement in the agricultural guest worker program,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThere are a whole lot of things that need to be done to improve our immigration system. And I hope the President had made it possible for us to \u2013 to deal with those issues.\u201d",

Bush might have developed a brotherly relationship with Bill Clinton \u2013 but he\u2019s still picking his actual brother, Jeb, over Clinton\u2019s wife, Hillary, in a potential 2016 presidential match-up. The two former presidents have developed a close friendship, with Bush sometimes calling Clinton his \u201cbrother from another mother.\u201d In an interview, CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley asked Bush what that makes Hillary Clinton. \u201cMy sister-in-law,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Sources close to Jeb Bush say that the former governor is not worried about a primary fight Those same sources say Bush is concerned about the toll a bid would put on him family Multiple sources close to Jeb Bush say the former Florida governor\u2019s recent public appearances in which, he seems to be thinking out loud about a possible presidential run are actually very similar to the private discussions he is having with friends and colleagues. \u201cThe public conversation is what he has been saying to us. He is honestly struggling with this decision,\u201d says a source familiar with the process, who argues it is \u201creal,\u201d unlike some other GOP contenders who have decided to run, but won\u2019t say so. \u201cHe\u2019s doing this in a thoughtful way, and he hasn\u2019t made up his mind.\u201d And while Bush, as a potential presidential candidate, if often critiqued as someone out of touch with his own party, another source claims that consideration is not a part of the Bush equation. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t worry about whether he\u2019s in tune with his party,\u201d this source says. \u201cHe knows what he believes.\u201d Indeed, adds another source, \u201che would fully expect and welcome a fight.\u201d In fact, in his recent appearance before a Wall Street Journal CEO Council event, Bush mused that the GOP nominee needs to be willing to \u201close the primary to win the general (election) without violating your principles.\u201d That\u2019s a not-so-veiled reference to what many believe occurred in Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, and recognition of Bush\u2019s own problems with the base of his party, which has balked at his stands on both immigration reform and the common core education standards for schools. Sources also say that while Bush has said he will decide in \u201cshort order\u201d \u2014 perhaps sometime early in the New Year \u2014 a decision will likely not come in a major announcement. Instead, one source says, \u201che could send some signals.\u201d In campaign parlance, that could mean the hiring of staff, forming an exploratory committee or formally soliciting money. Or simply say he\u2019s leaning towards a run or against it. While top Bush advisers have been gathering data on what a run would entail, no commitments have been made or asked of potential staff or supporters, one source says. Rather, the conversations have been \u201cif he decides to run would you talk further with us,\u201d this source says. On the personal side, Bush\u2019s concerns seem twofold according to multiple sources. First, as one puts it \u201chow can I best protect my family?\u201d In the WSJ forum, Bush himself put it this way: \u201cCan I do it where the sacrifice for my family is tolerable \u2026 it\u2019s a pretty ugly business right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a level under which I would never subjugate my family because that\u2019s my organizing principle. That\u2019s my life. I think people kind of appreciate that. So, I\u2019m sorting that out.\u201d Second, another source adds, Bush is concerned, as he has said previously, that a campaign ought to be \u201cjoyful and full of value.\u201d Translation: Bush needs to make sure he is willing to campaign daily for two years because of his love for country, party and commitment to the his issue set \u2014 immigration and education reform, tax changes, energy policy, regulatory policy. It\u2019s also clear that Bush is weighing the strain of daily campaign in a 24/7 media cycle in which everything he says will be relentlessly scrutinized. In his appearance before the WSJ conference, he made several telling asides about being \u201cfact-checked\u201d as if to underscore the media spotlight \u2014 and fishbowl life \u2014 that accompanies a presidential candidacy. What Bush is clearly not shying away from is any engagement on the issues. At the WSJ forum, Bush said congressional Republicans need to lead without grandstanding. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to make a point any more as Republicans,\u201d Bush told the CEO-filled audience. \u201c\u2026 We have to actually show that we can, in an adult-like way, we can govern, lead.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The President and incoming senate leader Mitch McConnell will meet Wednesday Atop the agenda is the Republican 'Cromnibus' plan to keep the government running The White House has yet to threaten to veto the GOP plan Other topics for the afternoon meeting: Money to fight Ebola and defense spending Bourbon buddies they are not. But there are all the makings of a spirited conversation for President Barack Obama and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, when this Washington odd couple meets at the White House on Wednesday afternoon. A new Republican proposal to fund the government thought what has been dubbed the \u201ccromnibus,\u201d which would pay for nearly all federal programs with an \u201comnibus\u201d spending bill but only offer a short-term \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d or \u201cCR\u201d for immigration related spending is expected to be on the agenda. McConnell: Executive action ignores law Possible government shutdown looming A presidential green-light to the \u201ccromnibus,\u201d a term that can only exist inside the Beltway, could help ease tensions with GOP lawmakers who are still furious over Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.  White House officials have so far not threatened to veto Boehner\u2019s plan. The President\u2019s request for $6 billion in emergency funding to battle Ebola in West Africa and a new authorization for the use of military force in the war against ISIS are likely topics at the meeting as well. McConnell laid out a nuts and bolts legislative wish-list for December\u2019s lame duck session in Congress to reporters Tuesday. \u201cI think everyone agrees on a bipartisan basis those are the three things we must do here at the end of the session \u2013 fund the government, make sure we don\u2019t have any retroactive tax increases and follow the tradition of many years which is to pass a National Defense Authorization Act,\u201d McConnell said.  \u201cI\u2019m confident the Senate will do that before we depart for the holidays,\u201d he added. But in a sign of the frostiness of the Kentucky Republican\u2019s relationship with the president, McConnell referred to Obama\u2019s immigration plan as \u201clawless\u201d and a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d Obama himself brought up the immigration action at a meeting with the Business Roundtable hours before he will sit down with McConnell. \u201cI\u2019m still hopeful that we can get legislation done,\u201d he said, saying that would \u201csupplant\u201d his executive actions. While Obama and McConnell rarely ever sit down together privately, the two leaders have held such meetings a few more times than what has been previously acknowledged by aides to both men. Same goes for the President and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The reason, top White House officials have said, is that knowledge of their conversations could jeopardize relations between the Republican leaders and their more conservative members. Obama: I'd drink bourbon with McConnell Yet it is also well-known the two men sometimes fail to connect. The President called but could not reach McConnell on election night last month, just hours after he beat Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes to win reelection in Kentucky and all but secure his place as the next Senate Majority Leader. RELATED: Obama reaches out, leaves message for McConnell The scheduled 2:40 p.m. start time for Wednesday\u2019s meeting is a bit early to share that \u201cKentucky bourbon\u201d with McConnell, as Obama offered at his post midterms news conference last month. But given that McConnell once vowed to make Obama a one-term president, perhaps the best both men can expect is a healthy pour of Washington reality.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Some conservatives pressing for changes to GOP plan Republicans are working on a plan that would avert a government shutdown GOP could vote on the plan next week Congress must act before Dec. 11 to avoid a shutdown House Republican leaders are aiming to delay a challenge to President Barack Obama\u2019s controversial immigration executive order until early next year in an effort to avoid a government shutdown next week, multiple House GOP members and aides told CNN. Speaker John Boehner announced the strategy in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Tuesday, where it was largely well-received by rank and file GOP members, although some conservatives are pressing for changes, according to multiple sources. Many members say they are still reviewing the details. At a news conference afterwards, Boehner said his members realize their hands are tied on the immigration issue until Republicans control both chambers of Congress in January. W.H.: Not asking Congress for heroics Poll: Public wary of returning Congress Immigration Order Divides Congress 'SNL' mocks immigration controversy \u201cI think they understand that it\u2019s going to be difficult to take meaningful action as long as we got Democrat control of the Senate,\u201d Boehner said. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican in line to become the next Senate majority leader, reiterated his view that the GOP should stop threatening shutdowns. \u201cWe need to quit that kind of rattling the economy,\u201d McConnell said Tuesday at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. The government will run out of money on Dec. 11 unless Congress acts. Last year\u2019s government shutdown was politically disastrous for Republicans and the party is trying to avoid a repeat just as they\u2019re on the cusp of retaking full control of Congress for the first time in nearly a decade. READ: Poll: Americans predict more gridlock The GOP plan discussed on Tuesday calls for the House to vote on legislation that would fund most of the government through September while only funding the Department of Homeland Security, which would carry out key parts of the executive orders, until just sometime in March. That would give Republicans time to pass legislation blocking the immigration orders. House Republican leaders are trying to balance competing priorities in the party. They want to mollify conservatives who are furious over the President\u2019s decision to make it easier for millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country by providing a clear opportunity for them to try to block the action. After hearing about the plan Tuesday morning, some of those House members on the right say they will oppose it because it would continue funding for agencies tasked with granting new visas through March of next year. \u201cYou just want me to fund the unconstitutional act for 60 days? Kind of like being a little bit pregnant? It doesn\u2019t work for me,\u201d Arizona GOP Rep Matt Salmon told reporters. But other Republicans \u2013 including leaders in both chambers \u2013 are fearful of tying that move to government funding. Arkansas GOP Rep. Steve Womack said now that voters gave his party control of both the House and Senate in the midterms it\u2019s was important to demonstrate that they can govern and not \u201cgive any opportunity for buyer\u2019s remorse on the part of the discerning electorate.\u201d  He said there was a \u201cnarrow window\u201d for Republicans to show they can run the government before voters size up the parties again before the 2016 election. A vote on the bill is likely next week, aides said. Testifying before a House committee on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson urged lawmakers against legislation that would fund his department for a shorter period of time than the rest of the government. \u201cThat is, in my judgment, a very bad idea for Homeland Security because during that period \u2026, we cannot engage in new starts,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFor example, we are back in a presidential election cycle. I cannot hire new Secret Service agents until I get an appropriations bill passed by this Congress \u2013 not another (continuing resolution) for a couple of months.\u201d READ: 2016 is everywhere this week. Here\u2019s why. Senate Democrats generally support the President\u2019s immigration orders and oppose the House plan to fund DHS just through March. But after meeting with his caucus Tuesday, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid it would be a \u201cbig accomplishment\u201d if the House passed a bill that funded most of the government and signaled he would support it. Separately, the House likely will vote this week on a bill that essentially calls out Obama on immigration. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte is reworking a proposal drafted by Florida Republican Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida. That bill would allow members to \u201cvent\u201d about their unhappiness with the executive action and assert that what Obama did was unconstitutional. Illinois Republican Rep. Peter Roskam said the separate vote declaring the president violated the Constitution by using executive authority on immigration is to demonstrate to constituents that the GOP opposed the president\u2019s actions. \u201cSilence is assent so to not respond in any way is in some fashion to be complicit in it, so this allows members to be on the record and clear about it.\u201d However, the bill would have not legal binding authority and the Senate is sure to ignore it. Salmon said he would vote for the bill because he opposed the president\u2019s immigration actions, but then he essentially dismissed it, saying, \u201cit\u2019s not going to go anywhere and everyone\u2019s knows it.\u201d In addition to the funding strategy, House GOP members are also still considering whether they should sue the President for the issuing the directives that they consider unconstitutional.

            "article_content": "Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush says he'll decide soon if he will run for president in 2016 Bush called for a more active foreign policy and said that could be a key theme of the next campaign He also argued for an overhaul of entitlement programs and energy, education and immigration policies Jeb Bush says he\u2019ll decide \u201cin short order\u201d if he will run for the White House in 2016 \u2013 and in a preview of what could become his campaign themes, the Republican is advocating a more active foreign policy and an overhaul of U.S. entitlement programs. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about running for president, and I\u2019ll make up my mind in short order \u2013 you know, not that far out into the future, I don\u2019t know the exact time line,\u201d Bush, the former Florida governor, brother of one president and son of another, said Monday night at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Son: Jeb Bush 'likely' 2016 candidate He said his decision on whether to seek the Republican nomination will hinge on whether he can \u201clift people\u2019s spirits and not get sucked into the vortex,\u201d and \u2013 perhaps more importantly, he said \u2013 whether \u201cthe sacrifice for my family is tolerable.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be a good candidate or a bad one. I kind of know how a Republican can win,\u201d he said. Bush added that Republicans need to take a more positive approach in 2016, and be practical enough about the national political landscape to \u201close the primary to win the general\u201d election. He then made a lengthy argument for a \u201cmore active and engaged foreign policy,\u201d warning that a rebuilt military and aggressive intelligence gathering tactics are key to preventing \u201cjihadist attacks.\u201d \u201cThere is a growing sense that we can\u2019t withdraw from the world,\u201d he said. Bush\u2019s position puts him at odds with more libertarian potential 2016 GOP hopefuls, like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who have criticized the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance efforts. He said intelligence tactics, the use of the military and other foreign policy issues, including free trade, could \u201cprobably become a bigger issue\u201d in the 2016 campaign than he\u2019d expected several months ago. \u201cThe world is being disrupted, some in good ways and some in really bad ways, and but for us, there is no source of stability that allows that transformation to take place in a peaceful way,\u201d Bush said. Bush also delved into a host of domestic issues during his 45-minute discussion with Jerry Seib, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Washington bureau chief \u2013 on each one, eventually turning to the broader theme making the United States \u201cyoung and dynamic again.\u201d On immigration, he argued for \u201can economically driven system\u201d that would allow businesses to more easily move foreigners with the skills they need into the country. On energy, he said North America could end its reliance on overseas oil in five years with an \u201call-in\u201d policy that includes oil exploration on federal lands, approving the Keystone XL pipeline, speeding up natural gas export terminal approvals and potentially allowing crude oil exports. He argued broadly for a simplified tax code and regulatory rules, and said education requires a \u201cradical transformation.\u201d \u201cThen we could actually do the other big thing, which is not going to happen any time soon, which is entitlement reform. \u2026 No developed country in the world has achieved this, and if we do it, we\u2019ll be young and dynamic,\u201d he said, adding that the United States could join the ranks of rapidly developing economies like Brazil, India and China. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be the means by which we see a rising income for the middle class again. Our spirits will be lifted,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "They would seem to have big advantages going into the 2016 presidential race \u2013 prominent jobs in Washington, access to major donors and the ability to influence the major national issues of the day. But being a member of the Senate hardly paves a clear path to the White House. Only three presidents \u2013 Warren Harding, John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama \u2013 have moved directly from the Senate to the White House. That\u2019s not stopping senators from eyeing the prize at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. At least six members of the world\u2019s most exclusive club are considering presidential campaigns that could buck history. Will Chris Christie run in 2016? Presidential race kicks off with Jim Webb Sen. Portman's 2016 Plans The benefits The Senate is one of the most important bully pulpits in American politics \u2013 overshadowed, only, by the White House itself. \u201cThe advantages are you have a podium, you have the Senate floor, you can say things and attract press attention,\u201d said Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992. \u201cYou are just not coming out of nowhere. If you are lucky enough to have a committee that you chair you can promote certain things. So you do have some built in mechanisms which help you run for president.\u201d Look no further than Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as examples of first term legislators who have effectively used the chamber \u2013 in particular the Senate floor \u2013 to their political advantage. READ: Rand Paul dives back into Ferguson debate For Paul, it was March 2013, when he walked into the Senate to express concerns about the U.S. drone program and to try and block the nomination of John Brennan to head the CIA. Nearly 13 hours later, the Kentucky Republican relinquished control of the floor but not before he turned the nation\u2019s attention towards the use of drones on U.S. soil. \u201cStand with Rand\u201d quickly entered the political vernacular and spread into the mainstream. Political supporters printed t-shirts and campaign signs with this phrase that will likely be a rallying cry if Paul ultimately decides to run for president. Seven months later, Cruz stole the national spotlight by helping to shut down the federal government for 16 days in protest of the Affordable Care Act. In the summer leading up to October 1 \u2013 the federal government\u2019s new fiscal year \u2013 Cruz sought support from grassroots activists to pressure Congress to oppose funding Obamacare. The week before the shutdown, he spoke for more than 21 hours straight from the Senate floor criticizing the health care law. Several days later, the federal government shut down, which angered many Republicans who complained that his actions were nothing more than a political stunt that could hurt other Republicans. But Cruz won praise from like-minded conservatives \u2013 key allies if he decides to seek the GOP presidential nomination. READ: Ted Cruz floats Lieberman to replace Hagel The political perks of being a senator are countless as the position can help a lawmaker establish a national profile, and make important connections with deep-pocketed donors, powerful titans of business, influential activists and world leaders \u2013 all critical elements of a presidential campaign. \u201cYou have to understand you will be taking part of your responsibilities away, but also the fact that you are a United States senator opens a lot of doors,\u201d said Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. These doors are often opened by fellow senators, who ask their colleagues to attend fundraising events here in Washington and around the country. The senator headlining the event is provided the opportunity to meet donors and activists that otherwise would be out of reach. The senator, who is being honored at the fundraiser, gets to pocket donations for re-election. This quid-pro-quo is part of the daily political business in Washington, and ambitious senators can use it to their advantage. \u201cName another job in politics where you can freely travel the country, and meet with big donors and activists,\u201d said Alex Vogel, who served as senior political strategist to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tennessee, and as general counsel for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. The drawbacks Still, for all of the political benefits a senator has due to the trappings of the office, there is plenty of baggage that comes along with it and often it is opened up during a presidential campaign. This is not a new phenomenon. British scholar and politician James Bryce 126 years ago identified the hurdles a Member of Congress faces in seeking the U.S. presidency in his book The American Commonwealth. Bryce, who became British ambassador to the U.S. in 1907, observed in a chapter titled: \u2018Why Great Men Are Not Chosen Presidents,\u2019 that a relatively unknown candidate is a safer choice than a known candidate with a public record. \u201cThe famous man has probably attacked some leaders in his own party, has supplanted others, has expressed his dislike to the crotchet of some active section, has perhaps committed errors which are capable of being magnified into offences,\u201d Bryce wrote. \u201cNo man stands long before the public and bears a part in great affairs without giving openings to censorious criticism. Fiercer far than the light which beats upon a throne is the light which beats upon a presidential candidate, searching out all the recesses of his past life.\u201d Then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton faced this problem when she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. There was little unknown about Clinton, who lived most of her adult life in public view including eight years as first lady, when she ran for president. But Clinton\u2019s rivals for the Democratic nomination, including then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, turned to her Senate record and criticized her for voting in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War. The war was unpopular with the Democratic base, and since Obama wasn\u2019t elected until 2004 he wasn\u2019t forced to vote on it. During the 2008 campaign, Clinton refused to say her vote was a mistake \u2013 she has since publicly stated it was a mistake. \u201cI think running for president from the Senate is tough, because you are constantly taking votes,\u201d said former Sen. John E. Sununu, R-New Hampshire. \u201cA lot of them are tough votes on strange amendments that are not always easy to explain in a 30 second commercial.\u201d Explaining votes can be just as politically damaging as actually casting them. Then-Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, tried to clarify why, as a senator, he supported and then opposed a massive package to fund operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cI actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it,\u201d Kerry said at the time. His explanation fell flat. President George W. Bush\u2019s campaign seized on Kerry\u2019s comments and turned it into a television commercial. What Kerry was trying to say was that he supported the funding package initially with the condition it would be paid for by the repeal of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. It wasn\u2019t and he voted against it. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is considering a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, has had his own legislative headache over the issue of illegal immigration. He was a key player in crafting legislation in 2013 that dealt with all aspects of the problem including putting in force a plan to legalize the estimated 11 million illegals already living in the U.S. as well as strengthening border security. Conservative activists howled over the legalization effort and the House opposed it. Rubio is now focusing his attention on securing the border. CEO vs. legislator Perhaps one of the biggest problems for a senator seeking the presidency is that the field of candidates will include at least one, if not more, governors also interested in moving into the White House. Governors make the argument that they are forced to address real world problems on a daily basis, while senators debate, debate and continue to debate major issues. The Senate, is known after all as the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest deliberative body.\u201d Harkin said voters also see this distinction when they are sizing up candidates: CEOs vs. lawmakers. \u201cThere is a real difference between legislators and governors and that is why governors have a much better chance at being elected president,\u201d said Harkin. \u201cI think in the public\u2019s view they see a governor as a mini president. They run the executive branch and they look upon legislators differently. They really do. I think that is a real drawback to any senator running.\u201d Unlike previous years, the Republican or Democratic Senate leader is not looking at running for president. The last two to seriously consider it were Frist and Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. Both eventually took a pass and did not run for president. Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kansas, did win the GOP nomination in 1996, but he was forced to resign his seat after it became impossible for him to run for president and oversee the Senate at the same time. While Dole tried to create space from his time in Congress on the presidential campaign trail \u2013 he was first elected to the House in 1960 and Senate in 1968 \u2013 the former Majority leader was unable to shake the label as a Washington insider. When Dole delivered his final Senate speech in June 1996, he praised the institution and acknowledged its imperfections. \u201cI would no more distance myself from the Senate than I would from the United States itself,\u201d Dole said. \u201cThis body is a reflection of America. It\u2019s what America is all about. We come from different states and different backgrounds, different opportunities, different challenges in our life. And, yes, the institution has its imperfections and our occasional inefficiency. And we\u2019re like America. We\u2019re still a work in progress in the United States Senate.\u201d For McCain, and the scores of presidential Senate hopefuls before him, after losing there was a soft landing at a place of importance and power. \u201cAfter I got the nomination, I literally wasn\u2019t able to vote for a long period of time,\u201d said McCain, noting the drawbacks of a presidential campaign. \u201cFortunately, I lost and was able to make up for it.\u201d In addition to Cruz, Rubio and Paul, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, have all expressed interest in running for president in 2016. In all, 16 senators have served as president, but 13 of them held different positions at the time they assume that office.",

            "article_content": "Ferguson violence revives race debate for first black president Obama spoke about Ferguson on Tuesday night Comments reflect balancing act Obama must walk when it comes to race President Barack Obama \u2013 who once famously declared \u201cthere is not a black America and a white America\u201d \u2013 is again feeling his way through a volatile debate over race that offers fresh evidence of the nation\u2019s enduring divisions. The first African-American president is confronting the delicate issues of justice and discrimination after renewed violence this week in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked by a grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict a white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, a black youth, this summer. These issues refuse to fade for Obama, despite hopes that his election would lead to a post-racial era. On Tuesday night in his hometown of Chicago, Obama tried to master a balancing act that has become all too familiar during his nearly six years in the White House, reflecting on the African-American experience while standing by the legal system. He offered comfort to those angered by the grand jury\u2019s decision while identifying with the horror of looting and burning businesses in suburban St. Louis. Complete coverage of what\u2019s happening in Ferguson \u201cIf any part of the American community doesn\u2019t feel welcomed or treated fairly, that\u2019s something that puts all of us at risk,\u201d Obama said. But he added that \u201cnothing of benefit results from destructive acts. For those who think that what happened in Ferguson is an excuse for violence, I do not have any sympathy for that.\u201d It was not quite the rhetoric of the transcendent political figure who spoke eloquently about race during his first campaign, nor was it the impassioned president who reacted so personally in the aftermath of Florida teenager Trayvon\u2019s Martin\u2019s death. Instead, Obama pledged to lead a national conversation on race and address the deep rooted belief in many communities of color \u201cthat our laws are not always being enforced uniformly.\u201d Can Wilson return to work? Obama: \u2018No sympathy\u2019 for violence in Ferguson Obama\u2019s remarks reflect his reluctance to take sides or cast judgment on the grand jury\u2019s decision and an attempt to avoid adding to the racial turmoil. But they also show his struggle to talk about race in a way that connects with all Americans. The President \u201cis always on a teeter-totter of not really wanting to lean too far this direction, that direction,\u201d said Julian Bond, a longtime civil rights activist and chairman emeritus of the NAACP. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be the black president. He wants to be the president, and that constrains him a great deal. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever overcome that.\u201d READ: Officer: \u2018I have a clean conscience\u2019 His approach to Ferguson stands in contrast to remarks last year after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the 2012 shooting death of the 17-year-old Martin. At the time, Obama recounted his own experiences as a black man in deeply personal terms. \u201cWhen Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnother way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\u201d 44 arrests overnight in Ferguson He continued: \u201cThere are very few African-American men who haven\u2019t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars.  That happens to me \u2013 at least before I was a senator.\u201d He was more circumspect on Monday as the violence in Ferguson first heated up, saying the nation has made \u201cenormous progress in race relations.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve witnessed that in my own life, and to deny that progress I think is to deny America\u2019s capacity for change,\u201d he said. Obama has dealt gingerly with racial issues since he burst onto the national political scene in 2004 as a state senator from Illinois who delivered a galvanizing speech at that year\u2019s Democratic National Convention. His 2008 caucus win in the lily-white state of Iowa launched his path to the presidency. He would later speak with pride about his \u201ccommanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country.\u201d PHOTOS: Protests across the U.S. But he had to confront the issue more directly later in 2008 amid a furious debate over the incendiary remarks of his then-pastor Jeremiah Wright. He responded with a speech in Philadelphia in which Obama said Wright\u2019s views denigrated the \u201cgreatness and goodness of our nation\u201d and rightly offended \u201cwhite and black alike.\u201d Race would remain an unwelcome undercurrent throughout the campaign and after \u2013 most notably when his aides had to confront claims by conservative conspiracy theorists that the president was not born in the U.S. That controversy only faded when he produced a document certifying his birth for reporters. (Conservatives and Tea Party activists refuted the idea that their vehement criticisms of the president had any racial grounding). Granderson: Body cameras for police For five years after Obama\u2019s seminal speech on race in Philadelphia, he tried to avoid racial issues but stumbled over the controversial case of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. who was arrested in his own home in 2009. Obama tackles immigration, Ferguson at hometown rally Obama allowed Attorney General Eric Holder and other officials to push forward on issues like voting rights and housing that are important to the African American community. But the Martin case seemed to set a new tone for the second term of his presidency, where he has spoken with more ease about race. Obama was deeply affected by a private meeting he held last year with a group of young black boys about a mile from his home in Hyde Park, Chicago. He recalled that encounter earlier this year as he unveiled his \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d mentoring project at the White House. \u201cI could see myself in these young men,\u201d Obama said, admitting that he was lucky he made his youthful transgressions in forgiving, multi-cultural Hawaii and not in America\u2019s deprived inner cities. READ: Rand Paul blames politicians for Ferguson At other times, Obama has used the civil rights movement to make a point about the capacity of political movements \u2014 even as his own change crusade shuddered to a halt. \u201cThe arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn\u2019t bend on its own,\u201d he said, quoting Martin Luther King, a half century after the March on Washington last year. But Obama has studiously avoided the debate over whether race is a factor in his sinking approval ratings. He also shies away from talking about whether race played a role in his party\u2019s struggles in the South this election season, as Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, suggested during an interview about her own prospects for re-election this fall. People who have seen him in private settings say the president speaks more frankly about race than he has in public. The President, insiders say, feels a responsibility to use his remaining time in office to secure his legacy on African-American issues and has thought deeply about his own unique place in history. Rogers Smith, co-author of  \u201cStill a House Divided,\u201d a study of racial politics in the Obama era, said the president understood the symbolism. \u201cI definitely think he is conscious that as the first black president, he will be a subject of endless historical scrutiny as well as intense contemporary scrutiny,\u201d Smith said. Still, race is likely to remain an issue during Obama\u2019s final years in the White House. \u201cFor the overwhelming majority of people who just feel frustrated and pained because they get a sense that some communities aren\u2019t treated fairly or some individuals aren\u2019t seen as worthy as others \u2013 I understand that and I want to work with you and I want to move forward with you,\u201d Obama said Tuesday. \u201cYour President will be right there with you.\u201d READ: Why was announcement delayed?",

            "article_content": "Three top pro-immigration business groups said Congress needs to pass legislation The top lobbyists said they were hopeful Congress could work on legislation next year While not necessarily thrilled about executive action, they emphasize working together Big Business isn\u2019t embracing President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to reform the immigration system by executive order, but the community\u2019s top lobbyists aren\u2019t joining Republicans in slamming Obama\u2019s announcement, either. They just want the President and Congress to move forward on a permanent solution to fix a broken immigration system \u2013 which they say can only happen through legislation. Three top groups, which have descended on Capitol Hill to argue the economic benefits of an immigration overhaul, said arguments on the President\u2019s authority to shield millions from deportation should take a back seat to passing legislation in the next Congress. Obama: Immigration system feels unfair Boehner rips Obama's immigration order Obama sounds exactly like Bush on Immigration Dem. response to Obama immigration plan Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that while Obama\u2019s executive actions \u201craise important legal and constitutional questions,\u201d Congress and the President should press ahead toward the goal of achieving bipartisan legislation. \u201cThe debate over the president\u2019s announcement must not be allowed to forestall progress on critical priorities,\u201d Donohue said in a statement. \u201cWe call upon the president and lawmakers of both parties to enact common sense measures to provide the American economy with the workers it needs at all skill levels, while better securing our borders and dealing with undocumented immigrants.\u201d The Chamber of Commerce and other business groups joined in an unlikely coalition last year with labor groups to urge Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform \u2013 a partnership that has helped immigration advocates make headway in Congress. Business Roundtable Senior Director Matt Sonnesyn, who leads the group\u2019s work to achieve immigration reform, said he was hopeful congressional Republicans could move past Obama\u2019s executive action and toward bipartisan legislation by the spring. But Sonnesyn said Obama\u2019s decision to act unilaterally \u201ccertainly doesn\u2019t help us get to a solution\u201d and said even after Obama\u2019s executive orders kick in, \u201cour immigration system will still be broken.\u201d \u201cCertainly what the President did last night isn\u2019t going to make it easier for everyone to come together to fix immigration,\u201d Sonnesyn said. \u201cAfter some of the initial emotion dials down from what\u2019s happened here, we\u2019ll all be able to look at this constructively.\u201d That emotion is resounding among GOP congressional leaders and potential Republican candidates. House Speaker John Boehner said Obama \u201ccemented his legacy of lawlessness,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul said he \u201cwill not sit idly by and let the President bypass Congress and our Constitution\u201d and Sen. Ted Cruz called Obama\u2019s actions unconstitutional. Boehner said Friday the House \u201cwill in fact act\u201d on immigration, but did not give specifics as to how the body would respond to Obama\u2019s executive action. Republicans hammer legal case against Obama on immigration Business Roundtable, which among other groups, lobbied Congress last year alongside the Chamber of Commerce and the Partnership for a New American Economy to pass the Senate\u2019s bipartisan reform bill, supports most of the policies Obama announced Thursday, but would like to see them in the form of legislation. Sonnesyn said he is hopeful the Republican-led House, which did not take up the Senate\u2019s immigration bill, will work to pass immigration legislation or a series of smaller bills that address some of the key problems. On immigration, a tale of two presidents One of the key players in that effort will be Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Florida who has worked to push an immigration bill through the House. Diaz-Balart said he questions the legal authority of Obama\u2019s actions, but said Friday on CNN that he supports \u201ca lot of the specific things in the President\u2019s executive order.\u201d And Diaz-Balart appeared ready to move past that question in favor of working toward legislation, arguing that voters\u2019 message in the midterms was a call to end dysfunction and work together. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to work with the President or anybody else, whether it\u2019s immigration reform or other important issues,\u201d Diaz-Balart said. \u201cI hope we can work through this.\u201d John Feinblatt, chairman of the Partnership for a New American Economy, said the benefits of the policies Obama announced Thursday will ultimately outweigh how those policies came to be. \u201cYou\u2019re going to here a lot of people take issue with the process but in the end I think you have to distinguish between the process and the substance,\u201d Feinblatt said. But Feinblatt, a close adviser to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who founded the group, said he is just glad \u201ceverybody in Washington is talking about immigration.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re no longer arguing about whether to do immigration,\u201d Feinblatt said. \u201cWe might be arguing about which branch should lead, we might be arguing about the process, we might be arguing about how you do it \u2013 but we\u2019re not actually arguing about whether this country needs to reform its immigration policies. That\u2019s progress.\u201d The economic and political imperatives to reform the immigration system will ultimately prompt Republicans to work toward legislation before the 2016 presidential election, Feinblatt said, pointing to the growth of Hispanics and Asians as a share of the voting population. \u201cCongress Is going to have to get to work,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: President Barack Obama\u2019s remarks announcing a new executive action on immigration as prepared for delivery and released by the White House. My fellow Americans, tonight, I\u2019d like to talk with you about immigration. For more than 200 years, our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations.  It\u2019s kept us youthful, dynamic, and entrepreneurial.  It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities \u2013 people not trapped by our past, but able to remake ourselves as we choose. Media strategy behind immigration speech But today, our immigration system is broken, and everybody knows it. Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules.  Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less.  All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America.  And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows, or risk their families being torn apart. It\u2019s been this way for decades.  And for decades, we haven\u2019t done much about it. When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system.  And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders.  Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history.  And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half.  Although this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it\u2019s been in nearly two years.  Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s.  Those are the facts. Meanwhile, I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix, and last year, 68 Democrats, Republicans, and Independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate.  It wasn\u2019t perfect.  It was a compromise, but it reflected common sense.  It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents, while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, started paying their taxes, and went to the back of the line.  And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits. Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of a bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law.  But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote. What is Obama is expected to announce? Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law.  But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President \u2013 the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican Presidents before me \u2013 that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just. Tonight, I am announcing those actions. First, we\u2019ll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings, and speed the return of those who do cross over. Second, I will make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed. Third, we\u2019ll take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country. GOP: Obama will regret immigration order I want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy.  Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws.  Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable \u2013 especially those who may be dangerous.  That\u2019s why, over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent.  And that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security.  Felons, not families.  Criminals, not children.  Gang members, not a mother who\u2019s working hard to provide for her kids.  We\u2019ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day. But even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants \u2013 in every state, of every race and nationality \u2013 will still live here illegally.  And let\u2019s be honest \u2013 tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn\u2019t realistic.  Anyone who suggests otherwise isn\u2019t being straight with you.  It\u2019s also not who we are as Americans.  After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time.  They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs.  They support their families.  They worship at our churches.  Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here, and their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours. As my predecessor, President Bush, once put it:  \u201cThey are a part of American life.\u201d Now here\u2019s the thing: we expect people who live in this country to play by the rules.  We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded.  So we\u2019re going to offer the following deal:  If you\u2019ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you\u2019re willing to pay your fair share of taxes \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily, without fear of deportation.  You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. That\u2019s what this deal is.  Now let\u2019s be clear about what it isn\u2019t.  This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently.  It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future.  It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive \u2013 only Congress can do that.  All we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re not going to deport you. I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty.  Well, it\u2019s not.  Amnesty is the immigration system we have today \u2013 millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time. That\u2019s the real amnesty \u2013 leaving this broken system the way it is.  Mass amnesty would be unfair.  Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character.  What I\u2019m describing is accountability \u2013 a commonsense, middle ground approach:  If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.  If you\u2019re a criminal, you\u2019ll be deported.  If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up. The actions I\u2019m taking are not only lawful, they\u2019re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century.  And to those Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer:  Pass a bill.  I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution.  And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary.  Meanwhile, don\u2019t let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue.  That\u2019s not how our democracy works, and Congress certainly shouldn\u2019t shut down our government again just because we disagree on this.  Americans are tired of gridlock.  What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose \u2013 a higher purpose. Most Americans support the types of reforms I\u2019ve talked about tonight.  But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home.  Millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens.  So we don\u2019t like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship.  I know that some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are, or take our jobs, or stick it to middle-class families at a time when they already feel like they\u2019ve gotten the raw end of the deal for over a decade.  I hear these concerns.  But that\u2019s not what these steps would do.  Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society.  And I believe it\u2019s important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other\u2019s character. Because for all the back-and-forth of Washington, we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger.  It\u2019s about who we are as a country, and who we want to be for future generations. Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law?  Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future? GOP governors hedge on immigration reform Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents\u2019 arms?  Or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together? Are we a nation that educates the world\u2019s best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us?  Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs, businesses, and industries right here in America? That\u2019s what this debate is all about.  We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration; we need reasoned, thoughtful, compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes, not our fears. I know the politics of this issue are tough.  But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it.  Over the past few years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs, without taking a dime from the government, and at risk at any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids.  I\u2019ve seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didn\u2019t have the right papers.  I\u2019ve seen the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in a country they love.  These people \u2013 our neighbors, our classmates, our friends \u2013 they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life.  They came to work, and study, and serve in our military, and above all, contribute to America\u2019s success. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students, including a young woman named Astrid Silva.  Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old.  Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on.  When she started school, she didn\u2019t speak any English.  She caught up to the other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBS, and became a good student.  Her father worked in landscaping.  Her mother cleaned other people\u2019s homes.  They wouldn\u2019t let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school for fear the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant \u2013 so she applied behind their back and got in.  Still, she mostly lived in the shadows \u2013 until her grandmother, who visited every year from Mexico, passed away, and she couldn\u2019t travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported.  It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her, and today, Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree. Are we a nation that kicks out a striving, hopeful immigrant like Astrid \u2013 or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in? Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger \u2013 we were strangers once, too. My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants.  We were strangers once, too.  And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship.  What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal \u2013 that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will. That\u2019s the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us.  That\u2019s the tradition we must uphold.  That\u2019s the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.",

            "article_content": "Obama presses on where Bush failed on immigration Reform core to Obama's 'change' identity White House quit waiting for the House to act When George W. Bush couldn\u2019t get an immigration overhaul though the Senate, he gave up. When Barack Obama couldn\u2019t get a bill through the House, he changed the rules. Rewriting the immigration system was at the core of Bush\u2019s \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d political brand and was dear to his heart. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work,\u201d a deflated Bush said on a June day seven years ago when the comprehensive reform effort finally died on Capitol Hill. Obama: We were strangers once too Obama: We'll deport felons, not families Past presidents' use of executive power GOP: Obama will regret immigration order 'DREAMer' reacts to Obama announcement Faced with failure, he asked his team if he could reshape the immigration system with his own executive power, but they concluded he couldn\u2019t. So Bush \u2013 a president who fought the war on terror with an expansive interpretation of executive power \u2013 moved on to other things for his last 18 months in office. Obama refuses to accept the same fate. READ: Obama: \u2018You can come out of the shadows\u2019 When immigration reform died in Congress this year, Obama, like Bush, asked his lawyers if he could change the system on his own. This White House team came to the opposite conclusion. So, more than 500 days since the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill, Obama unveiled his plan to go it alone. In a prime-time address, he announced he would wield executive power to patch up the system as best he could, temporarily shielding up to five million people from the threat of deportation. He said he had no choice but to go ahead \u2014 despite furious claims by Republicans he is subverting the Constitution and behaving more like a king than a weakened president hemmed in by a hostile Congress. \u201cTo those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress have failed, I have one answer. Pass a bill,\u201d Obama said. The president plans to offer temporary relief from deportation to the parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have been in the country for more than five years. He\u2019ll also extend a program that already allows undocumented migrants brought here as children to stay in the country. READ: Republicans hammer legal case against Obama The measures are far short of the fix that Obama had hoped a permanent comprehensive immigration bill would provide. And since he was forced to act via executive order, his moves could be wiped out with the stroke of a pen by a future president. But it\u2019s clear that Obama is motivated by far more than the prosaic business of fixing the broken immigration system. In the two weeks since the Republican rout in the mid-term elections dealt what many had thought was a killer blow to his presidency, Obama has been working at a furious pace. A president who believes he was elected twice to engineer change is not giving up just because Congress is in his way. Republican House Speaker John Boehner is noticing and warning of retribution. \u201cPresident Obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left,\u201d Boehner said. Reforming immigration was always on Obama\u2019s mind when he took office. \u201cIt was on the big bucket list of why he was running for president,\u201d said a White House official. \u201cClimate, immigration and health care were problems that have eluded presidents for decades.\u201d \u201cHe really thought he had an opportunity to take on all three,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt looks like he is going to make progress on all three.\u201d Events that led to Thursday night\u2019s address had been unfolding for months, a factor that may explain the noticeable lack of drama surrounding Obama\u2019s announcement. WATCH: McConnell: Executive action ignores law There was none of the excruciating tension or euphoria that greeted other signature moments of the Obama presidency \u2014 like the killing of Osama bin Laden, or the passage of health care reform. Senior administration officials confided that Obama signed off on the final details of the plan when he got back from Asia this week. But administration lawyers had been beavering away for months to flesh out legal justifications. Many in the White House had thought that it would never get to this point. In June 2013, when the Senate bill passed, administration insiders thought that the House would put a new law on Obama\u2019s desk to sign. Officials reasoned that if the Republican Party was ever going to capture the White House again, it needed to mend fences with Hispanic voters after Mitt Romney was wiped out among the crucial voting block in 2012. \u201cIt was clear there was going to be momentum for this,\u201d the official said. Knowing his political brand was radioactive for Boehner, Obama deliberately stepped back in the days after the Senate bill passed. But his patience began to fray as the months dragged on. All the time, Obama was feeling heat from immigration activists in his liberal political base  \u2014 so much so that he made a series of statements to the effect that he couldn\u2019t just lash out and fix immigration on his own. Those comments \u2013 intended to give the House space to do its work \u2013 have instead come back to haunt him and are ammunition for Republicans who say Obama knows he is breaking the law. In the end, it seems Boehner did not believe his position was sustainable atop a restive Republican caucus if he used Democratic votes to pass a bill A separate senior White House official said Thursday that the administration had concluded there was no point waiting any longer because Boehner would not promise to bring up a new bill in the new Congress. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a moment when the Republicans won\u2019t say \u2018just wait another day,\u2019 the official said. The showdown that precipitated Thursday\u2019s speech happened back in June. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson were in the White House at a PGA Tour event \u2014 which might have been a rare moment for Boehner and Obama to bond over one of the few passions they share: golf. READ: Transcript of Obama\u2019s address But afterwards, the president was seething because Boehner told him he would not be sending him a bill on immigration. The Speaker later said he told the president that the American people simply \u201cdon\u2019t trust him to enforce the law as written.\u201d The decision came against a backdrop of a boiling crisis on the southern border as thousands of child migrants were teeming across the border. Republicans charged the human tide was triggered directly by the President\u2019s earlier executive order that offered certain categories of Dreamers \u2014 undocumented immigrants brought the nation as children \u2014 relief from deportation. In a mid-term election year, Republicans had also been spooked by the stunning primary loss of Republican House majority leader Eric Cantor, who was accused by his insurgent opponent of being too soft on \u201camnesty.\u201d Obama snapped in an event a few days later in a Rose Garden speech. \u201cPass a bill; solve a problem. Don\u2019t just say no on something that everybody needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Watch Obama\u2019s address Thursday night at 8 p.m. ET on CNN. President Barack Obama is set to unveil his long-awaited overhaul of U.S. immigration rules \u2013 potentially shielding millions of people from deportation \u2013 Thursday in an 8 p.m. ET speech from the White House. The impending actions are fraught with political controversy, as Republicans lambast him for circumventing the legislative process to declare \u201cexecutive amnesty.\u201d There\u2019s also intense interest surrounding who, exactly, among the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants will be covered. Here\u2019s our guide on what to watch for during and after Obama\u2019s speech tonight: Dreamer's perspective on reform McConnell: Executive action ignores law Castro: Obama 'doing the right thing' GOP: 'Emperor' Obama overstepping power Obama to announce immigration plan What would Obama\u2019s executive order do? The centerpiece of Obama\u2019s plan is that the undocumented parents of children born in the United States, and therefore citizens, are expected to gain protection from deportation \u2013 potentially benefiting up to 3.5 million people. It could also broaden protections for undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children, put a new focus on deporting criminals and expand visas for skilled workers. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said border security measures will be included, too \u2013 something Republicans have been clamoring for. Which parents stay and which ones go? Undocumented parents of U.S. citizen children will be covered. But what about the parents of \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2013 undocumented immigrants who were brought into the United States as children and have grown up in the country? Those children themselves got a reprieve from the threat of deportation under Obama\u2019s 2012 \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u201d program. It was a step Obama took after Congress nixed the DREAM Act, which would have given them citizenship, in 2010. Eligibility for the program is also cut off for immigrants who arrived after 2007. But, despite the Obama administration\u2019s position that families shouldn\u2019t be split up, administration officials have indicated that Dreamers\u2019 parents wouldn\u2019t be covered by the president\u2019s new action. Obama could address the fate of those parents Thursday night. Will there be age limits? Just as the 2010 program only benefited those who arrived after 2007, Obama\u2019s latest move could have cut-offs or age limits, too \u2013 and that would narrow the scope of his order. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that 3.6 million people would be covered if Obama\u2019s protections for the undocumented parents of U.S. citizen children comes without restrictions. But that number would drop to 3.3 million if parents are required to live in the United States for at least five years before becoming eligible, and 2.5 million with a 10-year requirement. How hard will Obama hit Congress? The President\u2019s popularity is battered, but his policy positions on immigration are actually fairly popular. Despite an overall wave of support for GOP candidates, 57% of this year\u2019s midterm election voters believe undocumented immigrants should have a chance to apply for legal status, while just 39% want them deported to the country they came from, according to CNN\u2019s exit polls from Election Night. So it will be no surprise when he says that, in his view, Congress should quit whining and start voting on an immigration reform bill if it doesn\u2019t like the executive order (One caveat, 48 percent of Americans also don\u2019t approve of Obama\u2019s executive action on the issue, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out Wednesday). The Senate approved a measure Obama called acceptable in 2013, but the House never gave it a vote. Obama has pointed that out repeatedly in recent weeks as he\u2019s moved toward announcing his new action. But how direct Obama is in his criticism of Congress on Thursday night could reveal just how concerned the White House is about the legal grounds for his move, and the odds that it could be unraveled by an angry, Republican-controlled House and Senate. How will congressional Republicans react? Sure, the GOP will decry Obama\u2019s move as \u201cexecutive amnesty\u201d and accuse him of ushering in a bitter new era as Republicans get set to take control of the Senate in addition to the House. The real question is: What are they going to do about it? Their first decisions could come quickly, with the government\u2019s funding due to expire after Dec. 11. Republicans could try to cut funding in ways that would hamper the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to implement his executive order \u2013 though Senate Democrats are all but sure to reject such a move, raising the specter of another government shutdown. Or they could seek a short-term funding measure in order to try again once the GOP takes over both chambers in January. Two House Republicans who would play a key role in crafting immigration legislation and overseeing its implementation, House Judiciary chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia) and Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas), fired a warning shot at Obama on Wednesday. In a letter to the president, they wrote that \u201cas the chairmen of the committees with oversight over border security and our nation\u2019s immigration laws, we will be forced to use the tools afforded to Congress by the Constitution to stop your administration from successfully carrying out your plan.\u201d Who will be watching? Major broadcast networks \u2013 including CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox \u2013 have signaled they will not carry Obama\u2019s speech live. That means much of his audience will be found on cable networks like CNN. And the speech will also occur at the same time that Spanish-language network Univision is airing the Latin Grammies \u2013 with plans to cut away for Obama, giving him access to a crucial audience. RELATED: Broadcast networks opt out of Obama immigration speech \u2013 except for Univision Obama won\u2019t be dropping the issue after Thursday night\u2019s speech. On Friday he\u2019ll talk immigration at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas.",

Nearly six in 10 Americans support creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., but just 38% approve of the President\u2019s plans to use his executive power to act on immigration, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Wednesday. Senate Dems: Obama, we've got your back GOP: 'Emperor' Obama overstepping power Another 14% said they were unsure about or had no opinion on Obama\u2019s planned executive action on immigration. Castro: Obama 'doing the right thing' The poll comes as Obama is expected to announce Thursday that he will sign an executive order to shield as many as 5 million illegal immigrants. Sens. weigh in on Obama's immigration move Will GOP impeach Obama over immigration? The legal battle over Obama\u2019s immigration plan Republicans are up in arms about the President\u2019s plan to use executive action to reform the U.S. immigration system, which they describe as a move to bypass Congress that exceeds his constitutional authority. Support for a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants increased to 74% when given the details of the bill that passed the Senate last year, but did not get a vote in the House. Those details include ensuring illegal immigrants pay a fine, back taxes and pass a background check before starting the process to become American citizens. Obama\u2019s plan is also expected to redirect U.S. immigration officials to refocus their deportation efforts on criminals who are undocumented immigrants. And officials have also told CNN that Obama\u2019s plans could also expand worker visas for certain sectors, like technology. Obama to reveal immigration executive action plans on Thursday A CNN exit poll on Election Day this month also showed that 57% of Americans believe illegal immigrants should get a chance to apply for legal status. About 4 in 10 of those surveyed said they believe illegal immigrants should be deported.",

            "article_content": "Chris Christie was in Florida at annual meeting of the Republican Governors Association Christie was cautious in talking about Obama's immigration plan Christie is a potential 2016 presidential contender Chris Christie \u2013 a self-styled truth teller with a penchant for political combat \u2013 was notably cautious Wednesday when pressed on President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to issue immigration executive orders. At the annual meeting of the Republican Governors Association here, the New Jersey governor and potential 2016 presidential contender repeatedly avoided weighing on the Obama plan that could defer deportation for almost four million undocumented immigrants. Christie, the RGA\u2019s chairman, addressed reporters at the conference and basked in the glow his successful 2014 election cycle, proudly flanked by new governors-elect from the blue states of Illinois and Maryland. Sens. weigh in on Obama's immigration move Will GOP impeach Obama over immigration? Obama to announce immigration action But even as other Republican governors with White House ambitions sharply attacked the President\u2019s decision, Christie hedged on the hot-button issue when reporters broached the subject. \u201cLet\u2019s wait to see what the president says tomorrow night before we have any kind of reaction to that,\u201d Christie said when asked about the immigration announcement. READ: Immigration announcement Thursday He did express confidence that the new Republican leadership in Congress will avoid a government shutdown over the matter despite threats from hard-line conservatives. \u201cAll this kind of hysteria about shutdown to me is just people wanting to make news,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI have confidence in the Speaker, I have confidence in Leader McConnell that they\u2019ll do this the right way and run the government.\u201d Later, asked if he would repeal Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration if he were elected president, he punted again, saying that questions about a hypothetical candidacy were irrelevant. \u201cI am not going to articulate the basis of a yet unknown candidacy,\u201d he said. Christie instead turned the focus back to New Jersey where, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve been dealing with this stuff already, because of the president\u2019s unwillingness to deal with this issue.\u201d He pointed to a version of the DREAM Act he signed last year granting tuition breaks to children of undocumented workers \u2014 a bill that rankled some conservative activists in early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 and flagged his opposition to driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants. Other governors at the meeting, including several eyeing their own White House bids, were more willing to condemn the president, often in blunt terms. READ: Five questions about immigration Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, said the president should sit down with congressional leaders and work on a piece meal approach to immigration reform. \u201cI think it would be a profound mistake for the president to overturn America\u2019s immigration laws with a stroke of a pen,\u201d he said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich called unilateral action a \u201cmistake.\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called the move \u201cillegal\u201d and said the president is breaching Constitutional separation of powers. Texas Gov. Rick Perry also called the executive order unconstitutional. Obama is also putting his own party in jeopardy, he said. \u201cI think he jeopardizes long term the Democrats ability to ever get back into power in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Perry said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Congress could file suit and lake legal action against the president. There would be a \u201ccompelling\u201d case to made against the president in the court system, he said. Though his potential rivals might have been drawing a policy contrast with Christie ahead of next year\u2019s primary, they and other Republicans gushed over his political work atop the RGA. Christie raised over $100 million to elect GOP governors in 2014 and even went into debt to help pull long-shot Republican candidate Larry Hogan over the finish line in deep-blue Maryland. \u201cI want to thank Gov. Christie for believing in us, and the RGA for coming to the rescue,\u201d Hogan told reporters. Bruce Rauner, the governor-elect in Illinois, called Christie \u201ca relentless campaigner.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d he said. And Pence said \u201cthe country owes a debt of gratitude\u201d to Christie for helping install 31 governors in state houses across the country, the most for either party in 16 years. \u201cI speak on behalf of all the Republican governors, when I say thank you to Gov. Christie for his extraordinary leadership,\u201d Pence said.\u200b",

            "article_content": "Watch President Barack Obama\u2019s speech live on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on CNN. President Obama will announce an overhaul of immigration rules during a Thursday night address Obama will follow the announcement with a speech detailing his plan Friday in Las Vegas Obama invited top Democratic lawmakers to the White House for a Wednesday night dinner Republicans have warned that Obama's executive order could stall all legislative work President Barack Obama will unveil his long-awaited immigration plan Thursday evening, changing rules governing deportations that could affect millions of undocumented immigrants and setting off an explosive battle with Republicans. Obama\u2019s prime-time address will be followed Friday by an event in Las Vegas, sources tell CNN. While exact details of his announcement aren\u2019t yet public, the basic outline of the plan, as relayed by people familiar with its planning, includes deferring deportation for the parents of U.S. citizens, a move that would affect up to 3.5 million people. \u201cEverybody agrees that our immigration system is broken. Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for far too long,\u201d Obama said in a video posted on his Facebook page Wednesday. \u201cAnd so what I\u2019m going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as President to make the system work better, even as I continue to work with Congress to encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\u201d Obama invited congressional Democratic leaders to the White House for a dinner Wednesday night to discuss his plans for an executive order, a source told CNN. RELATED: 5 questions you should be asking about Obama and immigration Actions 'huge' for Hispanic community The President declared in June he wouldn\u2019t wait for Congress to pass a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system, initially saying he would announce changes by the end the summer. The decision was delayed until after the midterm elections, when the White House believed it wouldn\u2019t be caught up in campaign politics. But Republicans are expressing deep anger at the anticipated move, saying unilateral action on immigration would forestall any legislative action. Two House Republicans who would play a key role in crafting immigration legislation made a fresh call for Obama to hold off on his plans Wednesday \u2013 and warned that if he goes ahead, they\u2019ll try to stop the White House from implementing his executive order. \u201cInstead of proceeding with ill-advised executive action, we implore you to work with Congress to enact legislation to address our broken immigration system,\u201d Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) and Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said in a letter to Obama. Related: \u2018Orange is the New Black\u2019 actress pushes Obama for immigration overhaul \u201cWe strongly urge you to respect the Constitution and abandon any unconstitutional, unilateral executive actions on immigration. Let\u2019s secure the border, enforce our immigration laws in the interior of the United States, and build a broad consensus for immigration reform,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOtherwise, as the chairmen of the committees with oversight over border security and our nation\u2019s immigration laws, we will be forced to use the tools afforded to Congress by the Constitution to stop your administration from successfully carrying out your plan.\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest chided the GOP during his briefing Wednesday, saying concerns about how Obama\u2019s immigration move could affect the government funding debate and presidential nominations in the weeks ahead are \u201cpredicated on at least the premise that Republicans have been exceedingly cooperative with the president.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid \u2013 the Nevada Democrat who will lose his post once Republicans take control of the chamber in January \u2013 lauded Obama\u2019s move, saying the GOP forced his hand. W.H.: Obama not exceeding authority \u201cComprehensive immigration reform brings relief to families being torn apart by our broken system,\u201d he said. \u201cComprehensive immigration reform is an economic issue and one we must address. That\u2019s why I have been so disappointed that Republicans have ducked, dodged and skirted taking up legislation this Congress forcing President Obama to act administratively.\u201d The contours of Obama\u2019s announcement have been the subject of speculation among immigration activists for months, though the White House has yet to officially relay what Obama will announce when he speaks to the American people on Thursday night. Administration officials say a key part of the announcement will be allowing the parents of American citizens, who are undocumented immigrants themselves, to remain in the United States without the threat of deportation. That would include the parents of legal residents, but not the parents of children eligible for delayed deportation under a rule Obama enacted in 2012. Up to 3.6 million people would be affected by that change, according to an estimate from the Migration Policy Institute, though the figures are smaller if Obama\u2019s announcement includes a minimum number of years spent in the country. Mandating parents live in the U.S. for at least 5 years before becoming eligible would bring the number affected to 3.3 million; a 10-year minimum would bring it down further to an estimated 2.5 million people. READ: Immigration fast facts Other potential areas of reform include extending the deportation deferment for immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Altering the age restrictions on that action could allow hundreds of thousands more people to remain in the United States. Officials also said the plan could include a stronger focus on deporting criminals who are undocumented immigrants and an expansion of worker visas in areas like technology. Lastly, the plan could include new resources to bolster security on the border. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the \u201creforms will be comprehensive,\u201d and that border security measures will be included. Obama\u2019s position on immigration could be a popular one. Despite an overall wave of support for GOP candidates, 57% of this year\u2019s midterm election voters believe undocumented immigrants should have a chance to apply for legal status, while just 39% want them deported to the country they came from, CNN\u2019s exit polls found. Those exit polls found that 71% of U.S. midterm voters believe undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country legally if they meet certain requirements \u2013 while 25% said those immigrants shouldn\u2019t be allowed to stay. A September CBS/New York Times poll found 51% saying Obama should use his executive powers to address immigration if Congress fails to act while 43% said he should not. A similar ABC/Washington Post survey earlier that month found 52% support for Obama acting on his own. Dana Bash and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Obama has pledged to act on immigration before the end of the year White House official says President has not yet reviewed final recommendations But Obama is aware of the general details in the expected plan, officials said NEW: The plan is not expected to include the parents of \"Dreamers\" \u201cI feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don\u2019t keep on making the system worse,\u201d he said during last week\u2019s news conference. At the end of the day it will all come down to what the legal team thinks can be defended in court, in addition to some political considerations, sources say. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is the Academy Awards,\u201d one official told CNN recently, meaning that the contents of the envelope are not a surprise. Citing his legal authority as chief executive of the United States, Obama said in a press conference in Myanmar Friday that he would act on immigration reform by the end of the year. \u201cI believe that America is a nation of immigrants,\u201d the President said. Everybody agrees that the system is broken; there has been ample opportunity for Congress to pass a bipartisan immigration bill that would strengthen our borders, improve the legal immigration system and lift millions of people out of the shadows so that they are paying taxes and getting right by the law.\u201d Obama issues new immigration ultimatum Sen. Cruz targets immigration, internet Hoyer: Obama should act on immigration Boehner's tough words for Obama on immigration The senior White House official who spoke to CNN said that any executive action could come as soon as this week. The White House is also not going to yield to threats of a shutdown. Asked Tuesday about a potential scenario in which Congressional Republicans would try to defund Obama\u2019s immigration action in an upcoming spending bill. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the president\u2019s actions would be within the law. \u201cWe would consider it to be unwarranted for Republicans in Congress to try to undo that executive action using the budget process,\u201d Earnest told reporters, casting doubt that such an a move would \u201cdetermine the outcome at all\u201d of Obama\u2019s actions. Warnings from Republicans are not affecting White House plans, according to the official, who said the White House is not going to command less in the executive action order just to appease furious lawmakers. Obama Friday encouraged Congress to act on immigration and said he told Republican congressional leaders that he was interested in working on a legislative solution, but without that he would act. \u201cI indicated to (House) Speaker (John) Boehner several months ago that if in fact Congress failed to act I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try and make the system work better. And that\u2019s gonna happen, that\u2019s gonna happen before the end of the year,\u201d said Obama. The senior White House official said that before issuing any order the president will review his administration\u2019s proposals for extending deportation relief to undocumented immigrants with American-born children and those who entered the United States as children themselves. Another senior administration official told CNN that the main contours of the executive action are three-fold: direct immigration agents to allow parents of children who are American citizens to obtain documents that allows them to stay in the United States legally, protect illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children and make clear deportation should still be the policy for convicted criminals. The plans appear to exclude any parents of \u201cDreamers,\u201d those who were brought in illegally as children who already have deferred action themselves from Obama\u2019s earlier action, according to sources. Though the general details of the plan are known, it is still in flux, and may change by the time it is announced, according to two other sources briefed on the subject who shared more in-depth details under consideration with CNN. Those sources said that the plan includes a focus on deporting criminal illegal immigrants. The final number of immigrants shielded will be affected by restrictions such as whether people with police infractions such as a DUI can qualify, they said. The plan would include an expansion of visas in certain categories of workers such as those in the technology industry, which is popular with the business community, and more resources to protect the border, according to the sources. The move has been the subject of months of anticipation. But with lame duck legislative wrangling underway on Capitol Hill, the president\u2019s advisers could also wait until next month to make a final decision on how to repair a system both Republicans and Democrats admit needs fixing. And while officials say the specifics of what he will announce haven\u2019t been finalized, the broad outlines of a potential plan that eases deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants have been floated by immigration groups for months. For the multitude of groups who are watching the process unfold, the moment is charged. \u201cWithout hesitation I can say the level of anticipation is intense. We were hoping this would happen in September,\u201d said Clarissa Martinez, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza. \u201cIt\u2019s long overdue. The sooner the better.\u201d Millions affected An expansion of Obama\u2019s \u201cdeferred action\u201d program (DACA) that went into place in the summer of 2012 is considered to be a likely component of Obama\u2019s immigration action, according to two sources close to the plan who spoke to CNN. DACA delayed deportation proceedings for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States by their parents as children. In the DACA plan there were caveats on who was eligible. In order to apply, immigrants needed to be younger than 31 at the time the rule was enacted, and younger than 16 when they were brought to the United States. And applicants are required to either be in school, have earned a high school degree or be honorably discharged veterans. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, says 1.2 million people were eligible under those rules and nearly 700,000 applied for deferred deportation, with hundreds of thousands more aging into the requirements over the next decade. But many more would become eligible if Obama expands, or eliminates altogether, those requirements, which were meant to encompass the same sector that would have qualified for permanent resident status under the DREAM Act, which has languished in Congress. The sources said that some parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, or so-called \u201cgreen-card holders,\u201d would be granted legal status that allows them to work and avoid deportation. The President\u2019s plan would affect those parents who have been in the United States five years. That move would bring another 3.4 million people into the eligibility ranks, according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis. According to the two sources who spoke to CNN, any executive action is not expected to include broader use of so-called \u201cparole\u201d status. While some pro-immigration advocates support this idea, it is seen as a red line by many conservatives who view it as a potential way to provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens. Currently such parole status is provided to spouses and family members of people serving in the U.S. military. If the parents of children who are eligible under the current DACA rules were included, the number would rise to 3.7 million. Changing those rules could also expand the eligible population: eliminating the education requirement, for example, would allow 430,000 more undocumented immigrants to be eligible for deferred deportation, the Migration Policy Institute estimates. And allowing people over 30 who were brought to the United States by undocumented parents would allow another 200,000 immigrants to apply, the think-tank\u2019s report says. Immigration activists, frustrated with the rate of deportations under Obama and further exasperated with the delay in Obama\u2019s immigration action, have been urging the White House to go big and expand the deferred deportation order in a way that allows the maximum number of people to stay. But many who have been watching the process closely believe the eventual announcement will fall short of those appeals. Political football Whatever Obama finally decides \u2013 and at this point, the options seem clear \u2013 he\u2019ll be met with fierce blowback from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have spent months preparing for the announcement by warning of executive overreach and political well-poisoning. The White House yielded to politics once already, delaying the immigration announcement from its promised debut this summer to a new date before the end of this year. The move was meant to shield vulnerable Democrats from political attacks on the topic; many of them lost their races anyway. The postponement wasn\u2019t met kindly from immigration groups, who said there wasn\u2019t time to spare on providing deportation relief for the millions of people who could be affected by new rules. There could still be election year ramifications, since Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu remains locked in a runoff contest with a Republican rival. But with the Senate firmly in Republican hands, any further delay would seem to offer little political advantage while only eroding support further among immigration reform activists. \u201cFor us, every day that there\u2019s a delay, and every day that people have to wait, means more people unjustly deported,\u201d said Praeli. Some Democrats want Obama to wait to announce the executive action after essential business clears the House and Senate. Sen. Harry Reid, the outgoing Senate Majority Leader, told CNN the president should hold off any immigration action until a new bill funding the federal government is approved. He said enacting the immigration plan ahead of the spending measure could anger Republicans and risk a government shutdown. \u201cI\u2019d like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it. But it\u2019s up to him,\u201d Reid said. But no matter when the action comes, it seems destined to ignite GOP furor. The near certainty of an executive action by year\u2019s end hasn\u2019t slowed Republican efforts to stop it: this week a Republican congressman from Texas, Rep. Joe Barton, said if Obama goes forward with the plan, impeachment proceedings could be a possibility. Those threats aren\u2019t exactly a new thing. Democrats have raised millions of dollars by warning their party\u2019s base about impeachment threats from conservative House members. More real is the threat that taking executive action on immigration forestalls any legislative effort on the matter. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill say a new plan delaying deportations would enrage Republicans, leaving little political will to push through a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system. Obama seems little concerned by Republican threats against making the immigration move, however, pointing out they had an opportunity to pass a bipartisan reform measure in the House but balked. \u201cI feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don\u2019t keep on making the system worse,\u201d he said during last week\u2019s news conference.

            "article_content": "NEW: Senate blocks Keystone bill Vote previews battle that lies ahead between Congress, Obama Landrieu: 'This is for Americans, for American jobs' The Senate blocked a measure Tuesday that would have authorized construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as Democrats chose their pro-environment base over an old friend \u2013 embattled Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu. The vote could just be a speedbump for the Keystone project, with Republicans ready to try again \u2013 with much better odds of success \u2013 once they take control of the Senate in January. \u201cThis will be an early item on the agenda in the next Congress,\u201d incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said after Tuesday night\u2019s vote. Senator: I'm a 'no' on Keystone Senate fails to approve Keystone pipeline Boehner advises passage of Keystone But it\u2019s a sharp blow to Landrieu, who had based much of her campaign for re-election in a December runoff on the argument that she could deliver results. For days she had insisted that she had the 60 supporters necessary to cross a key procedural threshold, only to fall one vote shy on Tuesday night. \u201cThis is for Americans, for American jobs, to build an American middle class, and it will create 40,000 immediate jobs,\u201d Landrieu said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. \u201cIf the people of this Congress haven\u2019t noticed, there\u2019s a long unemployment line in some parts of this country.\u201d READ: What to know about the Keystone debate The vote served as a preview of the confrontations that lie ahead in Washington. President Barack Obama is on track to overhaul immigration rules on his own by the end of the year \u2013 a move that is pushing some conservatives to consider shutting down the government in retaliation. And as soon as the new Republican Congress is sworn in next year, Keystone will be back on the agenda, along with efforts to curtail Obamacare, raising the prospect of Obama issuing a series of vetoes. But for all the battles that lie ahead, Tuesday\u2019s vote was really about local politics. Louisiana\u2019s Senate race is headed for a Dec. 6 runoff election, and Landrieu \u2013 currently the Senate Energy and Natural Resources chairwoman \u2013 saw the pipeline as a final chance to demonstrate her clout to voters in an energy-rich state. Republicans responded by guaranteeing her opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy, a seat on the energy committee. The House GOP also had him sponsor their own Keystone authorization bill, which was approved Friday on a 252-161 vote. Cassidy rubbed salt in Landrieu\u2019s wound Tuesday, with his spokesman saying the vote was \u201cperfect snapshot of her time as chair of the Energy Committee \u2013 a failure.\u201d READ: Why the Senate Keystone vote is important Right now, the decision on whether to approve the Canada-to-Texas pipeline is in the hands of the State Department. Obama has said repeatedly in recent days that he wants Congress to stay out of it and leave it to State to finish its review of \u2013 among other factors \u2013 whether the pipeline would contribute to carbon pollution the could cause climate change. \u201cThere is a process underway and the president is confident that that process will carefully evaluate the consequences of this specific proposal and that that\u2019s the proper way for a decision like this to be made,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. Six years into that review, though, lawmakers have grown impatient. \u201cThis process has not worked. This process has not brought this project some sort of finality \u2013 yes or no?\u201d North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, one of the pipeline\u2019s most outspoken Democratic supporters, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Liberal Senate Democrats like California\u2019s Barbara Boxer railed against the pipeline Tuesday, arguing that the environmental harm it could cause far outweighs the potential economic gains. Boxer pointed to potential health risks of laying the pipeline, including heart disease, increased hospitalization, and a higher prevalence of chemicals that \u201cpenetrate deeply into the lungs.\u201d \u201cThe facts are the facts are the facts,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a scientist then be humble and listen to the peer-reviewed scientists. They don\u2019t have a special interest. They have an interest in giving us information we should base our decisions upon. \u201c Boxer also referred to the project as the \u201cKeystone Extra Lethal Pipeline.\u201d READ: Fact-checking Keystone jobs claims The Keystone debate on Tuesday pitted traditional Democratic allies against each other. Many of the Democratic no votes were longtime friends and supporters of Landrieu who had contributed tens of thousands to her campaign. Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California, Chris Coons of Delaware and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota all contributed $7,000 or more to her campaign, and all opposed passage of the bill. In the lead-up to Tuesday night\u2019s vote, the big question was whether Landrieu could find the 60 supporters necessary to clear a key procedural threshold. In addition to the chamber\u2019s 45 Republicans, all of whom were expected to support the bill, Landrieu was joined by 10 more Democratic co-sponsors: Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, Montana Sen. John Walsh, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. Three more Democrats had pledged last week to support the measure: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper and Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey. That left her one vote short \u2013 and her options looked limited. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller said Monday night that he was a no vote. Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said Tuesday that he wouldn\u2019t support it. \u201cCongress is not \u2013 nor should it be \u2013 in the business of legislating the approval or disapproval of a construction project,\u201d King said in a statement. After the vote, five anti-Keystone protestors in the Senate gallery interrupted with chants and cheers. They were removed by police \u2013 and the Senate moved on without a speech that had been expected from Landrieu. CNN\u2019s Alexandra Jaffe contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Senate is set to vote Tuesday on a bill that would authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline The bill is being championed by Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu ahead of her Dec. 6 run-off election Landrieu has 14 of the 15 Democrats she needs to reach the 60 votes necessary for passage The fate of the controversial Keystone pipeline isn\u2019t the only thing at stake during a crucial vote in the Senate on Tuesday. A vote to move forward on legislation approving the pipeline\u2019s construction would usher in a new era of animosity between resurgent Republicans in Congress and President Barack Obama. It could also determine the fate of embattled Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who is pushing the legislation in an uphill battle to fend off a GOP challenger in a runoff election next month. Landrieu is very close to securing the support necessary to advance the legislation. All 45 Republicans will vote for the measure and 14 Democrats are on record supporting her. But she needs one more Democrat to join her to reach the critical 60 vote threshold. By Monday night, she said she had the votes necessary. \u201cI feel very comfortable,\u201d Landrieu said. It\u2019s not clear whether she actually won someone over or was just expressing confidence ahead of a vote that could determine her political future. In a three hour-long Senate floor debate Tuesday in advance of the vote, Landrieu was a bit more tentative. \u201cThis is one of the first debates in eight years where the outcome is uncertain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe usually know the outcome of the vote before we take it because the deals are all cut.\u201d In her speech, Landrieu made an aggressive case in favor of approving the pipeline while other Democrats dissented. \u201cTo everyone who thinks this pipeline is the end of the world \u2013 we already have 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the United States,\u201d Landrieu said. \u201cWe\u2019re only completing basically 1,000 miles. What is everyone upset about? California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer pointed out the potential health risks of laying the pipeline, including heart disease, increased hospitalization, and a higher prevalence of chemicals that \u201cpenetrate deeply into the lungs.\u201d \u201cThe facts are the facts are the facts,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a scientist than be humble and listen to the peer-reviewed scientists. They don\u2019t have a special interest. They have an interest in giving us information we should base our decisions upon. \u201c Boehner advises passage of Keystone Boxer also referred to the project as the \u201cKeystone Extra Lethal Pipeline.\u201d Keystone protesters have message for Democrats The GOP-led House on Friday approved a measure that will skip the conclusion of the six-year-old State Department review of the pipeline and authorize its construction. If the Senate ultimately approves the measure, Obama could be poised to issue what would be just the third veto of his nearly six year presidency. At a news conference last week, Obama made clear that he doesn\u2019t want Congress to interfere with the State Department\u2019s process. \u201cUnderstand what this project is: It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. It doesn\u2019t have an impact on U.S. gas prices,\u201d Obama said at a Friday news conference in Myanmar. The showdown comes as Obama and congressional Republicans appear to be on a collision course over immigration. Republicans are considering how to respond if Obama follows through with a pledge to revise immigration policies by the end of the year. Some GOP lawmakers have talked about potentially shutting down the government if Obama keeps that promise. On Keystone, Senate Democrats are moving toward a vote largely to help Landrieu, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources chairwoman. She is facing off in the December runoff against Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, who sponsored the House\u2019s Keystone bill and has been promised a seat of his own on the energy panel. The measure offers Landrieu a final chance to demonstrate her clout before voters return to the polls. Already, Landrieu was joined by 10 Democratic co-sponsors: Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, Montana Sen. John Walsh, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. Three more Democrats had pledged last week to support the measure: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper and Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey. The list of Landrieu\u2019s potential Democratic allies to provide the final vote is dwindling rapidly. One of Landrieu\u2019s top targets, West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, said he won\u2019t support the measure. Another potential backer, Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, told CNN Tuesday he will vote against the bill. Landrieu\u2019s entreaties to other Democrats have also been rejected in recent days. Outgoing Michigan Sen. Carl Levin won\u2019t support the pipeline, a spokeswoman said Monday. Nor will New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who tweeted his opposition over the weekend. Also confirming their opposition to the measure to various news outlets were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez and Colorado Sen. Mark Udall. Retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa said he wouldn\u2019t be voting for the pipeline. \u201cI\u2019ve come to this conclusion: every dollar that we spend on fossil fuel development and use is another dollar we spend digging the graves of our grandchildren,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to be a part of it anymore. I\u2019m through. That\u2019s just how strong I feel. I know we can\u2019t solve it overnight, but we have to be on a steep glide path in getting rid of fossil fuels as a source of energy for our planet.\u201d Even Landrieu\u2019s Democratic supporters were facing pressure. Anti-Keystone activists, including college students, were trying Tuesday to convince Carper and Bennet to change their minds, protesting at the senators\u2019 Capitol Hill offices. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing politics for too long and this is not a political game \u2026 this is affecting everyone,\u201d student Rachael Scheinman told CNN inside Bennet\u2019s office, holding a sign that read, \u201cSen. Bennet, if you\u2019re not a climate denier, don\u2019t vote like one.\u201d \u201c[Bennet] needs to vote his conscience on this one,\u201d added student Elli Bloomberg. Boehner: A Keystone veto is \u2018equivalent to calling American people stupid\u2019 The peaceful scene in Bennet\u2019s office was in contrast to a more rambunctious protest in Carper\u2019s office, where protestors loudly chanted, \u201cYou can\u2019t eat money, you can\u2019t drink oil,\u201d  \u201cKeep the tarsands in the soil, we don\u2019t want this dirty oil,\u201d and  \u201cWhat do we want?\u201d \u201cClimate justice,\u201d \u201cWhen do we want it?\u201d \u201cNow.\u201d Staffers attempted to speak to protesters in Carper\u2019s office and explain his vote. \u201cWhat I hear you saying is that the senator is politicizing an environmental crisis,\u201d one protester said. \u201cIf he believes the science, there\u2019s no reason for him to be voting like this and mortgaging our future,\u201d said another. Capitol police arrested four of the activists inside Carper\u2019s office. They were escorted outside to chants of \u201cclimate heroes.\u201d Despite their intentions to vote against the bill, both Boxer and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) congratulated Landrieu for bringing the bill to the Senate floor in a move that Democrats hope will rally votes in her favor in her upcoming runoff. Senate approval of the Keystone pipeline is all but guaranteed, with Republicans set to take control of the chamber in January. The only question appears to be timing. As Landrieu and her allies search for Democratic support, the pipeline is also becoming an issue in the 2016 campaign. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced Monday that he is planning a two-day swing through Canada in December. That trip is expected to included an energy speech that addresses the Keystone pipeline. \u201cMy view is that we are missing an enormous opportunity when we delay development of the Keystone XL pipeline,\u201d Christie said in a speech during a recent trip to Mexico. \u201cNot only is Keystone a major job creator, delays in its approval sends an unfortunate signal on multiple fronts.\u201d Keystone XL pipeline debate: What do I need to know?

            "article_content": "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie warned newly elected House Republicans over lunch on Monday not to shut down the government unless there\u2019s a clear end game. Christie emphasized that lawmakers should take a lesson from the 2013 government shutdown, according to a Republican source familiar with the discussion. It\u2019s unclear if Christie specifically mentioned Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a potential rival for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, in his remarks to the group of members who are attending orientation this week.  But Cruz was one of the leading conservatives on Capitol Hill last fall who insisted on defunding Obamacare.  The fight over that issue triggered a shutdown that lasted more than two weeks and left the GOP damaged politically. Federal agencies will run out of money in mid-December unless Congress passes a new spending bill.  Some conservative lawmakers are pressing Republican leaders to attach a provision to the government funding bill that would strip money for agencies so that they cannot carry out any immigration executive action from President Barack Obama. In order to avoid a shutdown, Congress will have to vote on some sort of spending measure before a new group of members is sworn in and starts voting in January. But if the House and Senate adopts a short term bill next month, these new members could face the issue early next year. According to Rep.-elect Ryan Zinke of Montana, Christie told the group that shutting down the government \u201cwas not a good idea.\u201d Christie was asked at the meeting what he planned to do to help unite the Republican party.  He said he was focused on three areas where he thought there was some common ground \u2013 energy policy, tax reform, and reducing government regulations. Christie sidestepped questions from reporters after he left the members dining room in the Capitol, saying he had a train to catch. Several newly elected House Republicans who attended the lunch stressed that Christie\u2019s advice to them was to focus on getting things done. \u201cThe mandate wasn\u2019t to say no, \u201d Zinke told reporters, adding that the new Congress needs to offer solutions and \u201cwe can articulate a better plan that the current Administration.\u201d Rep.-elect Tom MacArthur, the one new House Republican elected from New Jersey,  told reporters that Christie received a standing ovation at the lunch and his remarks were met by a \u201ctremendous\u201d response. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters afterwards that Christie criticized the president, but also emphasized the party\u2019s positive mission going forward. \u201cHe did bring up what the president is doing is dividing the country and really this election was more about ways we can unite the country and make it work.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Obama stakes out defiant tone toward GOP The White House readies executive action on immigration Republicans puzzle over how to respond A defiant Barack Obama dives into what could be a defining period of his presidency this week, after repeatedly enraging Republicans from afar during his Asia tour. Obama faces showdowns with the GOP over immigration, the Keystone XL pipeline and his drive for a nuclear deal with Iran, all of which have huge consequences for his political legacy. Far from being chastened by the Republican capture of the Senate, Obama is setting out to prove he is no lame duck and can still set the agenda. Obama: Immigration reform 'way overdue' Obama: $3 billion to fight climate change Is Obama reassessing strategy in Syria? Obam set to act on immigration reform But the GOP insists the mid-terms gave them a share of power in Washington, and believe Obama risks usurping his authority and even the constitution with his bold new strategy. Obama drawing lines on immigration, climate change Obama chose a highly symbolic setting to set the tone for two final White House years in which he will face a unified Republican Congress. Side-by-side in Myanmar with the world\u2019s most famous dissident, Obama refused to bow to what Republicans regard as the capital\u2019s new political \u201creality.\u201d On the veranda of the lakeside villa from where Aung San Suu Kyi faced down a junta, Obama said he had long warned House Republicans he would use executive power to reform the US immigration system if they failed to. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna happen. That\u2019s gonna happen before the end of the year.\u201d The president doubled down in Australia on Sunday, before boarding Air Force One for home, saying he would be derelict in his duties if he did not act. \u201cI can\u2019t wait in perpetuity when I have authorities that at least for the next two years can improve the system,\u201d he said. White House officials have not said when Obama will wield his executive powers in a move that could remove the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented people. But they say it will be soon. While Obama was abroad, post-election tensions escalated sharply on Capitol Hill as happy talk from both sides about working together quickly ebbed away. U.S. and China reach new starting point Senior aides dispute the idea the elections were a referendum on the President and say Obama is at his best when he is on \u201coffense\u201d and believe that\u2019s  what Americans want to see. So, as he trekked through Asia, Obama rattled Republicans almost every day. Related: On the other side of the world, Obama determined as ever to bypass Congress He surprised everyone with a new climate deal with China that the GOP slammed as costly and \u201cridiculous.\u201d He popped up on video to discuss new Internet regulations that may spark another row. He refused to budge on approving the Keystone XL pipeline to take oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast. He may veto a bill on the project that Congress is expected to pass this week. While in Asia, the president debunked the idea that the plan, opposed by environmentalists in his political base, would create lots of jobs and lower gas prices. Obama says he still wants to work with Republicans on tax reform and infrastructure spending bills. But it looks like he has decided that he won\u2019t compromise his legacy priorities to get that done. GOP promises retribution, but avoids specifics Republicans are fuming over Obama\u2019s go-it-alone attitude since voters handed the GOP the Senate and expanded its majority in the House. \u201cWe\u2019d like for the president to recognize the reality that he has the government that he has, not the one he wishes he had,\u201d said the next Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham warned Obama could spark a backlash over immigration. Sen. Cruz targets immigration, internet Obama issues new immigration ultimatum \u201cIf he goes it alone he is going to run into the ire of the American people,\u201d Graham said, though said Congress also had a responsibility to act. Republican Senate leadership member Roy Blunt warned however that Obama will eventually have to play ball, or he will end up with Republican bills he doesn\u2019t like. \u201cAt that point, his choice is to sign it or veto it.\u201d Republican leader John Boehner said his goal was to stop the president from violating his oath of office and the constitution. \u201cThere are things he is just not going to get.\u201d Republican anger is however masking a serious problem the party has yet to resolve : how to hit back at what it sees a presidential power grab. Other than warning that Obama would \u201cpoison the well\u201d for future cooperation, GOP leaders won\u2019t say whether they will use pending federal funding bills as leverage. That route led to a damaging government shutdown for which the GOP paid a heavy political price last year. One response could be to pass a series of short term funding measures, that keep administration priorities in limbo and maximize Republican leverage. House Republicans could also chose to expand the lawsuit they have already lodged against Obama alleging he usurped his authority in implementing Obamcare. Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer stirred buzz on Friday by declaring executive action on immigration would even be an \u201cimpeachable\u201d offense. GOP leaders are already braced for pressure from the right for a tangible and not merely symbolic reflex when the president acts. \u201cIf the president moves forward and does his executive action, the Republicans have no choice but to respond,\u201d said Dan Holler, communications director of Heritage Action for America, a conservative non profit group. \u201cThat response needs to be legislative. The vehicle that makes most sense is denying funding for the activity that they say is unconstitutional and inappropriate.\u201d Obamacare: Voters, are you stupid? Obama\u2019s strategy could divide Republicans Holler\u2019s point reflects a secondary benefit some Democrats see in Obama\u2019s strategy \u2014 it will cause a big political headache for Republican bosses. Obama\u2019s immigration move is certain to ignite a firestorm of grass roots conservative anger. That will in turn pile pressure on rank-and-file Republican House members who campaigned for office slamming what they see as an imperial president. Some conservative lawmakers were already skittish at leadership warnings that it might be impossible to repeal Obamacare with a Democratic president in the White House. Nothing worries Republicans in deeply conservative districts more than the prospect of a primary challenge, and many simply cannot afford not to mount the kind of rowdy response to Obama which will rock Boehner\u2019s restive caucus. Several House Republicans are arguing that it\u2019s time to quickly get to work on holding hearings and drafting an immigration bill to demonstrate their party has its own reform ideas, and is not just about blocking the president\u2019s policies. \u201cUltimately we all know we\u2019ve got to deal with this problem, so why not start dealing with the problem - even though it\u2019s the lame duck, even though you\u2019re not going to get anything through to final passage,\u201d Idaho Republican Rep Mike Simpson told reporters Friday. \u201cNow we could start showing some seriousness that we\u2019re going to address this problem.\u201d Executive orders on immigration will also detonate as the 2016 presidential race dawns, trapping Republicans between the party\u2019s activist base and a desire to engage Hispanic voters vital to GOP White House hopes. Republicans are also adamantly opposed to the nuclear deal with Iran which could emerge from down-to-the-wire talks in Vienna starting this week and are threatening to upend it with new sanctions. Obama appears to reject the idea Republicans have a mandate for change at all. He stressed in his post-election news conference that two thirds of Americans did not even vote and he was \u201cthe guy who\u2019s elected by everybody.\u201d But he knows a tough political fight looms and reflected Friday on the contrast between polarization at home and the welcome he gets on his travels. \u201cYou are always popular in somebody else\u2019s country. When you\u2019re in your own country, everybody is complaining.\u201d CNN\u2019s Senior Congressional Producer Deidre Walsh contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "President Obama is expected to take executive action if Congress doesn't act Several lawmakers weighed in Sunday saying a shutdown wouldn't solve anything Mitt Romney says there's \"got to be more productive ways\" to work with the President Republican lawmakers overwhelmingly agreed on Sunday talk shows that shutting down the government to avoid unilateral action by President Barack Obama on immigration is not a good option \u201cI think there\u2019s got to be more productive ways for us to be able to impress on the President the need to work for a permanent solution as opposed to a temporary stop-gap solution,\u201d Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts governor and two-time presidential candidate, said on the CBS show \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThe President ought to let the Republican Congress, the Republican House and the Republican Senate, come together with legislation that they put on his desk which relates to immigration. And he can veto it or not, but let the Congress and let this election have its say, as opposed to jumping in by doing something unilaterally \u2013 and in a way which is extraconstitutional \u2013 he\u2019s poking an eye of the Republican leaders in Congress, and he\u2019s making it more difficult for there to be a permanent solution to this issue.\u201d Another potential 2016 presidential contender for the GOP also weighed in. \u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t shut down the government,\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d  \u201cBut absolutely they should do everything they can to force the President to follow the law.\u201d Shelter for immigrants In September, the White House announced that it would delay any action on immigration until after the November elections. Shortly after the midterms, the President left Washington for a weeklong trip to Asia and Australia.  Obama is scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday night, and the issue is expected to be at the top of his agenda. Sens.-elect James Lankford of Oklahoma and Tom Cotton of Arkansas both received calls from the President on Election Night, urging compromise on the issue. On Sunday, both resolved not to go down the same path as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who voted to shut down the government in October 2013, less than a year into his first term. \u201cWe\u2019re not pursuing a government shutdown,\u201d Lankford said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to shut down government because that doesn\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d Cotton echoed. A few of their Republican colleagues mirrored their sentiments, with Sen. John Thune of South Dakota saying a shutdown \u201cdoesn\u2019t solve the problem\u201d and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma saying a shutdown is an \u201cinappropriate weapon (and an) inappropriate tool.\u201d But in rejecting the government shutdown option, Republicans are now faced with a key question: Where must they compromise to pass a bill that the President will actually sign? Speaking at the G20 Summit in Australia on Sunday morning, Obama outlined his conditions. \u201cThere is a very simple solution to this perception that somehow I\u2019m exercising too much executive authority. Pass a bill I can sign on this issue,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf Congress passes a law that solves our border problems, improves our legal immigration system, and provides a pathway for the 11 million people who are here, working in our kitchens, working in farms, making beds in hotels, everybody knows they\u2019re there, we\u2019re not going to deport all of them. We\u2019d like to see them being able to be out in the open, pay their taxes, pay a penalty, get right with the law.\u201d Despite vocalizing his aggressive plans for unilateral action on immigration, Obama did concede that any executive action he takes could be undone by his successor. \u201cThe very nature of executive authority means future presidents can reverse those actions,\u201d Obama said. In June 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill that outlined provisions to create a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents, while also beefing up security along the border. More than 500 days later, the House has yet to pass a bill of its own, a situation that House Speaker John Boehner insists exists because of the President\u2019s unwillingness to compromise. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight the President tooth and nail if he continues down this path,\u201d Boehner said at a news conference Friday. \u201cThis is the wrong way to govern.\u201d Defiant Obama says he won\u2019t bend to GOP",

The remarks came during a reception for a coalition of liberal organizations called Democracy Alliance. Biden told the gathering that income in the United States is the most unequal it has been since the 1920s, according to an attendee, who spoke to CNN on the condition he not be identified since it was a private event. Income inequality appeared to be a priority for this audience, and has been a key focus for such leaders as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who received a warm welcome when she spoke to the group Thursday. Biden makes amends with Israel's Bibi Biden: 'I'm not changing my brand' W.H.: Presidential run is up to Biden The vice president said key Democratic policies and philosophies resonate among Americans. The party had a good message ahead of the most recent election, which ended with Democrats losing seats in the House and losing control of the Senate, but its leaders didn\u2019t speak loudly enough to push it, Biden said, according to the source. Not all of the vice president\u2019s remarks went over well, including his telling the group that Americans still prefer Democrats despite the electoral drubbing. \u201cNo one responded,\u201d said the source. Much of Biden\u2019s talk Friday was personal in nature. He got emotional, according to the participant, when he recounted how his father could not get a loan for him to attend an Ivy League university \u2013 and he said people in such situations need the country\u2019s help. Biden talked about how his children have followed him into public service, despite it not being not the most lucrative profession. He joked he almost wishes he had a Republican kid so that \u201chis retirement would include a window with a view,\u201d the attendee quoted him saying. He also got some laughs and applause recounting how he told then-Sen. Barack Obama \u2013 when he accepted his offer to be his running mate in 2008 \u2013 that he would not change his brand, a seeming reference to his reputation for outspokenness and occasional verbal missteps. The former Delaware senator said he speaks his mind and will continue to do so. Biden did not talk about whether he\u2019d run for president, something that he has been openly considering. Nor did he mention the hot-button issue of immigration reform, even as the Obama administration prepares executive action to prevent the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants.",

            "article_content": "Obama has pledged to act on immigration before the end of the year Precise timing is unclear President Barack Obama could take action as early as next week to protect undocumented immigrants with American-born children and those who entered the United States as children themselves from deportation, an administration official familiar with the plan told CNN. The official said Obama could sign an executive order bypassing lawmakers and implementing those changes on his own by next week \u2013 though the White House says it hasn\u2019t nailed down the timing or content and that final decisions won\u2019t come until Obama returns from his Asia trip. The move has been the subject of months of anticipation. But with lame duck legislative wrangling underway on Capitol Hill, the president\u2019s advisers could also wait until next month. While not specifying when Obama might make his move, the White House said Thursday he\u2019s nearing a final decision on how to repair a system both Republicans and Democrats admit needs fixing. Sen. Cruz targets immigration, internet Hoyer: Obama should act on immigration Boehner's tough words for Obama on immigration And while officials say the specifics of what he will announce haven\u2019t been finalized, the broad contours of a potential plan that eases deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants have been floated by immigration groups for months. For the multitude of groups who are watching the process unfold, the moment is charged. \u201cWithout hesitation I can say the level of anticipation is intense. We were hoping this would happen in September,\u201d said Clarissa Martinez, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza. \u201cIt\u2019s long overdue. The sooner the better.\u201d Millions affected An expansion of Obama\u2019s \u201cdeferred action\u201d program (DACA) that went into place in the summer of 2012 is considered by immigration activists a likely component of Obama\u2019s immigration action. DACA delayed deportation proceedings for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States by their parents as children. READ: Could immigration reform cause another government shutdown? There were caveats on who was eligible: in order to apply, immigrants needed to be younger than 31 at the time the rule was enacted, and younger than 16 when they were brought to the U.S. And applicants are required to either be in school, have earned a high school degree, or be honorably discharged veterans. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, says 1.2 million people were eligible under those rules and nearly 700,000 applied for deferred deportation, with hundreds of thousands more aging into the requirements over the next decade. But many more would become eligible if Obama expands, or eliminates altogether, those requirements, which were meant to encompass the same sector that would have qualified for permanent resident status under the DREAM Act, which has languished in Congress. That could mean extending deportation relief to the parents of U.S. citizens, a move that would bring another 3.4 million people into the eligibility ranks, according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis. If the parents of children who are eligible under the current DACA rules are also included, the number rises to 3.7 million. Changing those rules could also expand the eligible population: eliminating the education requirement, for example, would allow 430,000 more undocumented immigrants to be eligible for deferred deportation, the Migration Policy Institute estimates. READ: Reid to Obama: Wait on immigration orders And allowing people over 30 who were brought to the U.S. by undocumented parents would allow another 200,000 immigrants to apply, the think-tank\u2019s report says. Immigration activists, frustrated with the rate of deportations under Obama and further exasperated with the delay in Obama\u2019s immigration action, have been urging the White House to go big and expand the deferred deportation order in a way that allow the maximum number of people to stay. But many who have been watching the process closely believe the eventual announcement will fall short of those appeals. \u201cWe have been making the case all along with activists and scholars that the president could provide relief to millions of people. I don\u2019t think they will,\u201d said Lorella Praeli, the advocacy director at immigrants\u2019 rights group United We Dream. \u201cI think they will try to couch that as \u2018these are our political constraints.\u2019\u201d Political football Whatever Obama finally decides \u2013 and at this point, the options seem clear \u2013 he\u2019ll be met with fierce blowback from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have spent months preparing for the announcement by warning of executive overreach and political well-poisoning. The White House yielded to politics once already, delaying the immigration announcement from its promised debut this summer to a new date before the end of this year. The move was meant to shield vulnerable Democrats from political attacks on the topic; many of them lost their races anyway. The postponement wasn\u2019t met kindly from immigration groups, who said there wasn\u2019t time to spare on providing deportation relief for the millions of people who could be affected by new rules. This time the White House seems intent to get the announcement done before the New Year. Obama vowed action during a post-election press conference last week and Josh Earnest, his press secretary, reiterated the end-of-year goal during a press conference in Burma Thursday. There could still be election year ramifications, since Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu remains locked in a runoff contest with a Republican rival. But with the Senate firmly in Republican hands, any further delay would seem to offer little political advantage while only eroding support further among immigration reform activists. READ: Obama determined to bypass Congress \u201cFor us, every day that there\u2019s a delay, and every day that people have to wait, means more people unjustly deported,\u201d said Praeli. Some Democrats want Obama to wait to announce the executive action after essential business clears the House and Senate. Sen. Harry Reid, the outgoing Senate Majority Leader, told CNN the president should hold off any immigration action until a new bill funding the federal government is approved. He said enacting the immigration plan ahead of the spending measure could anger Republicans and risk a government shutdown. \u201cI\u2019d like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it. But it\u2019s up to him,\u201d Reid said. But no matter when the action comes, it seems destined to ignite GOP furor. The near certainty of an executive action by year\u2019s end hasn\u2019t slowed Republican efforts to stop it: this week a Republican congressman from Texas, Rep. Joe Barton, said if Obama goes forward with the plan, impeachment proceedings could be a possibility. Those threats aren\u2019t exactly a new thing. Democrats have raised millions of dollars by warning their party\u2019s base about impeachment threats from conservative House members. More real is the threat that taking executive action on immigration forestalls any legislative effort on the matter. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill say a new plan delaying deportations would enrage Republicans, leaving little political will to push through a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system. Obama seems little concerned by Republican threats against making the immigration move, however, pointing out they had an opportunity to pass a bipartisan reform measure in the House but balked. \u201cI feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don\u2019t keep on making the system worse,\u201d he said during last week\u2019s news conference.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Reid has privately conveyed concerns to the White House Republicans are debating how to confront Obama over immigration Some GOP lawmakers say leaders shouldn't rule out a shutdown Boehner told GOP he doesn't want a shutdown Congressional Republicans are vowing to fight President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to make immigration changes through executive action, but they are struggling with how to do that without triggering another government shutdown. The House and Senate need to pass a measure during the lame duck session to fund federal agencies, which will run out of money in mid-December. House conservatives are pressing Speaker John Boehner to attach language to the spending bill that would block any money for federal agencies to give out any new visas or green cards. READ: John Boehner\u2019s next challenge Sen. Cruz targets immigration, internet Hoyer: Obama should act on immigration Boehner's tough words for Obama on immigration Obama immigration remarks 'declaration of war' But House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, who is crafting a yearlong so-called \u201comnibus\u201d spending measure, warned that effort could trigger a shutdown, and insisted no one wants to go down that road. \u201cThere\u2019s no one stronger than me against unilateral action by the President on this subject, however it\u2019s been said before - don\u2019t take a hostage you can\u2019t shoot,\u201d Rogers told reporters after a meeting with all House Republicans on Thursday. The debate over how to confront Obama is posing a sudden challenge for Republican leaders fresh off their victories during last week\u2019s midterm elections, which gave them control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in nearly a decade. A day after the election, Mitch McConnell, who will become Senate majority leader in January, said Republicans would take positions Obama wouldn\u2019t like but pledged not to shut down the government. Obama, who is traveling in Asia this week, has said he remains committed to using his executive authority to address immigration by the end of the year but the precise timing isn\u2019t clear. White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters in Myanmar that Obama is \u201cnearing a final decision.\u201d Boehner told members at Thursday meeting that one of his top priorities is to use every tool available to him to stop any effort by the president to go around Congress on immigration, according to several Republicans who attended.  But the Speaker also said he doesn\u2019t want a shutdown, and he cautioned members that they need to game out a smart way to respond before they move forward with a vote. At an afternoon press conference, Boehner pledged to \u201cfight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path.\u201d He said no decisions were made and GOP leaders were considering various ways to block the action, but did not rule out waging the fight on the spending bill. \u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d he said. READ: Obama determined to bypass Congress Arizona Republican Rep. Matt Salmon, who drafted a letter signed by more than 50 House GOP members to Rogers, told reporters he\u2019s not pushing for a shutdown, but leaders shouldn\u2019t rule out any options. \u201cIt\u2019s really tragic that before we even fight a fight, or even stake a claim that we\u2019re throwing in the towel.  I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to operate.  We don\u2019t have to talk about ultimatum scenarios at this point in time,\u201d Salmon told reporters after the meeting. Salmon argued that after the midterm elections Republicans have a mandate to push back at the president, and they should use their legislative authority to curb his executive actions. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid supports Obama\u2019s effort to address immigration but has privately conveyed concerns to the White House that an executive action could threaten passage of the spending bill. \u201cThe President has said he\u2019ll do the executive action, the question is when,\u201d Reid told CNN in a hallway interview in the Capitol. \u201cHe can do it, you know, it\u2019s up to him. But I\u2019d like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it. But it\u2019s up to him.\u201d Several Republicans told CNN the memory of last year\u2019s shutdown and the damage it inflicted on the GOP brand is fresh enough that members are willing to give the Speaker some time to decide what approach to take.  A vote on a spending bill is not expected on the House floor until early December. READ: Harry Reid: Dems won\u2019t engage in \u2018obstruction\u2019 What\u2019s complicating the next move for Boehner and other congressional Republican leaders is no one knows the details yet on the timing or scope of what the President will do. Even if House Republicans have the votes to pass something as part of a spending bill, any measure that blocks the president from using his own authority will be blocked in the Senate, which is still controlled by Democrats, or vetoed by the president.  That leaves the clock ticking before the government runs out of money on December 11th. One option GOP leaders are considering is passing a short term spending bill -one lasting a few weeks even -  that would avoid a shutdown and give them more time to decide how to respond to the President after he rolls out his plan, which is expected by the end of the year. Another is to expand the lawsuit against President Obama that House Republicans already approved to challenge his authority to implement Obamacare.  Although the House voted to sue the president in July, the formal legal paperwork hasn\u2019t been filed with the courts yet. Whether leaders decide to challenge the president as part of a spending bill or later, it\u2019s clear that conservatives are bracing for a major confrontation with the president over his plans to allow potentially millions of undocumented workers to remain in the U.S. \u201cI trust him completely to do the worst left wing, twisted policy that he can come up with\u201d Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks told CNN. READ: What to expect from the lame duck Congress CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Harry Reid spoke on the Senate floor for the first time since the election Reid: 'I am ready to work' with Mitch McConnell In his first public comments since the election, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid Wednesday pledged cooperation with Republicans when they take Senate control in January. But he also didn\u2019t hide his disdain for past GOP tactics. Reid pointedly promised not to engage in a \u201cstrategy of obstruction,\u201d which he has accused Republicans of pursuing while Democrats were in charge. \u201cI am ready to work with him in good faith to make this institution function for the American people,\u201d Reid said while standing across the aisle from Sen. Mitch McConnell, who will take over as the next majority leader.  \u201cI saw first hand how a strategy of obstruction was debilitating to our system.  I have no desire to engage in that manner.\u201d Reid said he was ready to get past the election loss. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed it\u2019s wise to follow Will Rogers\u2019 admonition: \u201cDon\u2019t let yesterday use up too much of today.\u201d  We have a lot of work to do and no time to linger on the past,\u201d Reid said in floor remarks at the beginning of the lame duck session. Despite the tough rhetoric, Reid also complimented McConnell and said he holds him in the \u201chighest regards.\u201d For his part, McConnell sounded emboldened when making his opening statement on the floor, immediately after Reid spoke. \u201cLast week the American people sent a strong message to Washington.  They voted for a new direction.  They called for a change in the way we do things in the Senate and they sent a new team to Washington to carry their wishes forward,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe plan to do just that. Referring to President Barack Obama\u2019s expected controversial executive orders on immigration, McConnell said, \u201cThe actions of the next few weeks could help set a tone of the next Congress.\u201d \u201cPresident Obama has a duty to help build the trust we all need to move forward together, not to double down on old ways of doing business,\u201d he said. After both men spoke, they turned to each other and shook hands, something they don\u2019t do very often. Reid then slung his arm around McConnell\u2019s shoulders and they stared down at the floor together, sharing a few words. As they turned to leave, McConnell took Reid\u2019s forearm and gave it a light tug, as if to say to affirm a personal bond despite their hardened political opposition.",

            "article_content": "Congress returns to Washington Wednesday Lame duck session marks final few weeks of Democratic control in the Senate Triumphant Republicans return to Washington Wednesday to prepare for a new era of GOP dominance on both sides of the Capitol. But first, they have to get through a short, final Senate session under Democratic control. The post-election lame duck session should be fast-paced as lawmakers work to clear leftover business, including a must pass bill to fund the government, and other bills to arm Syrian rebels and extend expiring tax breaks.  Republican leaders are anxious to start the new Congress in January with a clean slate when they could control as many as 54 seats. Senators: 'We can do big things' Senators who were defeated in the last election must return to the Capitol to vote on these items.  But newly-elected senators, excited after their victories, can\u2019t vote until they are sworn-in in January. The incoming freshmen will be here for three days of intensive orientation. Unlike past orientations, when senators were given heavy binders and detailed briefings about foreign policy, national security, and other current topics, this week\u2019s sessions will deal more with the practical matters of operating a Senate office, including hiring, disbursement, and ethics rules. They will be conducted by individual senators who will share their experiences. There will be a special dinner honoring the new members and their spouses Wednesday night in the Capitol. The incoming members will also be assigned temporary office space for use until they move into their permanent digs sometime next year. Like an overcrowded elementary school, those offices will be housed in trailers sandwiched into the courtyard of the Russell Senate office building. While the lame duck agenda is packed, one controversial item the Senate may not deal with until next year is approving Loretta Lynch to be the new Attorney General. Democrats signaled Tuesday they are unlikely to try to confirm her even though if they moved now, they could approve her with just Democratic votes. Congress' New Guard confronts the Old Guard Democrats say Lynch, who has been confirmed twice by the Senate, is highly qualified and will be approved regardless of who controls the chamber. \u201cThere may be some who feel they have to vote no simply because it\u2019s a nominee by President Obama,\u201d Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said in an MSNBC interview Tuesday.  \u201cBut the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats will vote for her.  She\u2019s superbly qualified.\u201d However, most Republicans don\u2019t want to rush the process, preferring to explore more carefully Lynch\u2019s background and views on immigration and other hot-button subjects. \u201cMs. Lynch will receive fair consideration by the Senate.  And her nomination should be considered in the new Congress through regular order,\u201d Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell warned over the weekend. Tensions between the parties are already high after a bruising two-year session that was marked by gridlock and partisanship. Senators are now bracing for President Barack Obama to announce controversial executive orders to change immigration laws, which could be released during the lame duck. Lawmakers and aides are guessing the President will wait until after December 11, which is when Congress needs to clear that critical funding bill to keep government operating. These women are the new face of Congress Republicans are vehemently opposed to Obama revising immigration laws on his own and have warned that doing so could make it difficult to get anything of consequence done during the lame duck. \u201cWhat the President does over the next two months is really going to set the tone for the next two years in Washington,\u201d Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of the GOP leadership, said on Fox News Sunday.  \u201cSo, I think it would be like the President pulling the pin out of the hand grenade and throwing (it) in as we\u2019re actually trying to work together.  I\u2019m hoping that cooler heads at the White House prevail.\u201d Other items Senate Democratic leaders hope to bring to the floor include a package that would extend some personal and business tax breaks set to run out at the end of the year along with the annual Department of Defense bill that will likely include extending approval Congress already gave for training and equipping Syrian rebels. They will also vote on billions in new funding for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, billions more for the military operations against ISIS, and possibly an NSA reform bill written by the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which would rein in the government\u2019s ability to make bulk collections of phone and Internet data. However, Republicans are doubtful this bill will be debated now. Senate Democratic leaders are considering a vote on the Keystone pipeline during the lame duck, according to a source familiar with the issue. A decision hasn\u2019t been finalized but such a move could boost Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in her run off race. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, meanwhile, also has a long list presidential nominations he wants to clear. Do scandals matter anymore in elections? The Senate could start debate on authorization of military force to give formal approval for U.S. military action in Syria and Iraq.  However, aides in both parties said that vote on any new authorization will likely be put off until the new Congress. The U.S./Iranian nuclear talks could also take center stage during the lame duck, as those negotiations hit a critical deadline Nov. 24. There is bipartisan support in the Senate for new sanctions against Iran if those talks fail. New and returning senators will gather privately Thursday morning in the Capitol to elect new leadership for their respective caucuses.  There are no major changes expected in the leadership ranks, with Sen. Mitch McConnell set to become majority leader and Reid set to become minority leader. Will Congress kill an Iran nuclear deal?",

            "article_content": "Rand Paul calls on conservatives to decry the President's use of military action without authorization The senator said the war is \"illegal\" and must be made valid \"or it must be ended\" Sen. Rand Paul declared the war against ISIS \u201cillegal\u201d in a new opinion piece Monday, urging conservatives to speak out against President Barack Obama\u2019s decision not to seek congressional authorization for military action against the terrorist group. \u201cThis war is now illegal. It must be declared and made valid, or it must be ended,\u201d the Kentucky Republican wrote in an op-ed published Monday by The Daily Beast. The U.S. began airstrikes in Iraq in August and in Syria in September, citing a 2001 measure known as the Authorization for the Use of Military Force as the president\u2019s legal basis for going after terrorist threats. Paul cites the War Powers Resolution of 1973 in stressing his long-held position that all military action must be approved by Congress. The exception is when a situation is considered urgent. In that case, a president has 60 days to get authorization after military action. If there\u2019s no approval from Congress, the president has 30 days to end the mission. Rand Paul plants feet between both sides of foreign policy debate While Paul said he doesn\u2019t think the War Powers Resolution specifically applies to the ISIS situation \u2013 because the U.S. had not been attacked \u2013 he notes that even if it did, the president\u2019s time would be up. \u201cTaking military action against ISIS is justified. The president acting without Congress is not,\u201d he wrote, reiterating a stance he\u2019s held since September. This fall Paul has described the airstrikes against Syria as appropriate action but said Obama\u2019s method for doing so was \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Were the first shots of 2016 just fired? The op-ed comes as Paul, who\u2019s seen as a likely presidential candidate in 2016, has been trying to shed his isolationist image yet maintain his libertarian-leaning roots. In the new op-ed, he specifically reached out to conservatives, saying they \u201cthey should end their conspicuous silence about the president\u2019s usurpation of Congress\u2019 sole authority to declare war.\u201d Paul blasts Obama as arrogant \u2018autocrat\u2019 He suggested conservatives are being hypocritical in their criticism of Obama by lambasting him for acting alone through executive actions but staying quiet when he authorizes military action without approval. \u201cConservatives who blast the president for ignoring the separation of powers on immigration display a fatal inconsistency by embracing unlimited war-making powers,\u201d he wrote. Paul: Washington\u2019s \u2018barnacled enablers\u2019 push for constant war Paul: Midterms 'a repudiation of Clinton' His piece comes as a report from Politico lists new details about his all-but-certain presidential campaign.

            "article_content": "Obama may get a lukewarm welcome in China Cruz expected to track McConnell's every move in the 2015 Senate Will Landrieu invite Obama down to Louisiana for the runoff? CNN\u2019s John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on \u201cInside Politics\u201d to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. One last Campaign 2014 maneuver and several intriguing post-election shifts and calculations made for a fun trip around the table. 1. New ground troops -- in Louisiana There is one more round in the 2014 election, and Republicans are heavily favored: the Louisiana runoff for the U.S. Senate between Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy. So put this one in the \u201ctaking nothing for granted\u201d file: A GOP source tells CNN the Republican National Committee is sending in 350 field workers to help with the December 6 get-out-the-vote effort. Democrats, too, say they will bolster their staff there now that all the other campaigns are over. But Landrieu faces a bigger question: whether to invite President Obama down for the runoff. He has been persona non grata during the election, but many party strategists think Landrieu\u2019s only chance is sky-high African-American turnout. 2. Watch out, McConnell: Cruz\u2019s 2015 plans If Mitch McConnell, the presumed new Senate majority leader, is ever trying to find Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, he might just want to turn and look over his shoulder. Cruz's 2015 playbook The freshman tea party favorite makes no bones about believing that McConnell is too establishment and too accommodating. Jonathan Martin of The New York Times chatted with Cruz on election night and came away with the distinct impression Cruz will be tracking every McConnell move. \u201cI asked him about whether or not the party should try to sort of back off the repeal of the Affordable Care Act or try to compromise on immigration,\u201d said Martin. \u201cHe said emphatically not, and in fact he said the only way to keep faith with the folks that elected them was to stand by the issues that had done so. And he said the biggest two issues for his party of the cycle were, A, repealing Obamacare, as he called it, and B, stopping the President\u2019s illegal executive action, as he called it, on immigration.\u201d Next year, Martin points out, McConnell might be wishing Cruz finds himself in Iowa more often than in Washington. 3. And memo to McConnell: Enjoy it while you can It long has been his dream job. Now, as McConnell prepares to rise to majority leader, the 2016 lineup suggests he might want to savor every minute. Politico\u2019s Manu Raju notes that the 2016 map is to Republicans what the 2014 map was to Democrats \u2013 as in tough. \u201cThere are a number of Republican senators that we are going to be looking at very closely on whether or not they decide to run again,\u201d said Raju. \u201cPeople like Richard Burr of North Carolina, Dan Coats of Indiana, Mark Kirk in Illinois. There are several others \u2013 Chuck Grassley in Iowa.\u201d Raju notes that if those GOP senators retire, then the Democrats have a chance to take those seats \u2013 and maybe take back the Senate majority. 4. How Obama tries to get over a bad election \u2013 head to Asia Asia trips are a long haul \u2013 a drain on any president. But Obama perhaps is dreading this one a little less, because it gets him out of a Washington buzzing about how the midterm election further weakened his political clout. Obama'a less than warm Asia welcome So off he goes, but not without reminders that news travels fast these days. Julie Pace of The Associated Press notes that the Chinese, before they roll out the red carpet, apparently are eager to tell their people it is a weakened U.S. president coming to visit. \u201cOfficials are right now increasingly nervous about the reception he is going to get in China,\u201d said Pace. \u201cThere\u2019s a newspaper in China that\u2019s connected to the government that wrote a story before he left saying that the American public had \u2018downgraded\u2019 the President and was tired of his \u2018banality.\u2019\u201d 5. Same leaders on Capitol Hill but \u2026 Debbie Wasserman Schultz faced buzz in the middle of the campaign that the White House was less than thrilled with her performance as Democratic National Committee chairwoman. Now, as Democrats sort through the rubble of the results from their perspective, the ambitious Florida congresswoman is getting even more heat from fellow Democrats. Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post took us inside the debate over whether \u2013 or when \u2013 the DNC would be under new leadership. \u201cShe has said she wants to serve out her term \u2013 it ends in January 2017 \u2013 and in some ways there\u2019s questions about whether or not she\u2019s close enough to Hillary Clinton, and whether she\u2019d want her to stay on,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be interesting to see whether or not she\u2019s able to stick it out or move on.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama has a fast start after election debacle Moving quickly: More military advisers for Iraq, AG nomination, Ebola funding request Big staff shake-ups have not been Obama's style, and that's unlikely to happen President Barack Obama isn\u2019t giving Republicans time to catch their breath after celebrating an election triumph. He barnstormed into action following Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, pushing his priorities before Republican leaders can frame their agenda for the new Congress, which convenes in January. Obama challenged congressional leaders he met with over lunch Friday to back his expanding war against ISIS. The President plans to send up to 1,500 more troops to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces while asking Congress for another $5.6 billion to fund the operation. Hoyer: Obama should act on immigration Pentagon: U.S. putting more boots in Iraq U.S. sending more troops to Iraq On another front for the busy White House, Obama on Saturday named U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to succeed outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. The move put Senate Republican leaders \u2013 whose aides said they were not informed ahead of time \u2013 on the defensive. In a volley of news releases they insisted that her confirmation should be put off until the majority-GOP Senate convenes in January. Obama is also pressing lawmakers to approve $6 billion in emergency funding to fight Ebola before they leave Washington for the holidays. And the President will head to Asia this weekend to show his authority on the world stage has not been splintered by pending GOP domination of Congress. READ: Obama sends 1,500 troops to Iraq The President is operating from a playbook by his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, that\u2019s been weeks in the making; it takes him through the lame duck session of Congress and his penultimate State of the Union address in January. One of his next moves, aides say, will be to use his executive power to reshape the nation\u2019s immigration system before the end of the year, despite Republican claims he will \u201cpoison the well\u201d for future cooperation. But Obama\u2019s time to wield the initiative will be brief. Come next year, he will be hit with a blizzard of bills from the new Republican Congress, including efforts to dismember his signature health care law and policies on climate change. As the President fights the dreaded perception he is a lame duck, his strategy can be summed up in three words \u2014 show no weakness. He is making a clear attempt not to appear morose after an election seen as a repudiation of his administration. READ: First on CNN: Obama to nominate Lynch as attorney general Reporters at a post-election news conference sought to goad Obama into admitting culpability for the Democratic meltdown, but he avoided prolonging the story by giving the election defeat a catchy term similar to \u201cshellacking\u201d \u2013 the word he used in 2010. Instead he vowed to play the \u201cfourth quarter\u201d of his presidency well. The approach is designed to maximize Obama\u2019s remaining political capital in Washington, which will quickly dry up once the 2016 presidential campaign fires up. Obama will also deny pundits the political firing squad they are demanding, and has no plans for a big staff shakeup. Even before Tuesday\u2019s election, critics had demanded fresh blood in a White House that critics see as sealed off from political reality. But aides say the kind of shakeup that helped invigorate other late-term presidencies is not Obama\u2019s style. Even now, he is still surrounded by many aides from his 2008 campaign. \u201cWhat I am ruling out \u2026 would be sort of a large-scale public firing,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday. Still, many aides are worn down by the brutal demands of a punishing presidency weighed down by crisis after crisis at home and abroad \u2014 so there will be some natural turnover with two years to go. But there are no signs Obama will make huge changes in the West Wing or to his Cabinet \u2014 along the lines of President George W. Bush\u2019s dismissal of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld after the 2006 midterms, when control of Congress flipped to the Democrats. READ: Immigration activists hope they don\u2019t get burned by Obama \u201cThere will be some people leaving, but I don\u2019t think there will be a huge shakeup,\u201d said one White House official. One difference from 2006 is that the outspoken Rumsfeld was closely associated with a war that had gone bad \u2014 in Iraq, which was the prominent issue in an election Bush referred to as a \u201cthumping.\u201d Ditching Rumsfeld allowed Bush to reengineer war strategy with his troop surge, which staved off a humiliating defeat in Iraq. But other than Obama himself, there is no obvious official who encapsulates the failings of this administration, so a satisfying \u201cclearing out\u201d might impress Beltway insiders but achieve little. Staff changes that do take place will likely come after the president has recharged his batteries and reflected on the way forward during his annual December vacation in Hawaii, an official and a former administration official said. But the big names are staying. National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who earned some rough reviews on Capitol Hill and among some U.S. allies for her sometimes brusque manner, said Friday she was going nowhere. \u201cI serve at the pleasure of the President and I will continue to serve as long as he\u2019d like me to,\u201d said Rice. No one expects Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to leave yet, despite whispers about his performance in Washington. The biggest personnel change \u2013 and one of the few that will resonate outside the Washington area code, may be the one involving Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken, whom Obama nominated Friday as deputy secretary of state. The Washington Post reported Friday that former U.S. Under-secretary of State Nicholas Burns is the choice of some administration hands to inject new foreign policy bandwidth into the administration. But Obama\u2019s inner circle is notoriously tough to penetrate, a factor that might put off some potential newcomers. Those mulling their futures include one of Obama\u2019s longest-serving aides, senior policy adviser Dan Pfeiffer, a 2008 campaign alumnus, who had several health scares last year. West Wing staffers are not expecting McDonough to leave. But senior adviser John Podesta\u2019s self-imposed one-year term limit at the White House is almost up. He is tipped to join Hillary Clinton\u2019s yet-to-launched presidential campaign. Ebola czar Ron Klain, meanwhile, is likely in line for a more permanent West Wing policy job. Deputy communications director Jennifer Palmieri is also said to be considering her future, while Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes has not yet made his intentions public. Many people had expected David Plouffe, Obama\u2019s campaign guru, to return to a White House role after the election. But Plouffe is now steering online smartphone taxi service Uber as senior vice president.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker John Boehner warns President in person against an executive order RNC Chairman Reince Priebus also blasts Obama on immigration reform His stance a change from a 2012 RNC report saying reform is politically necessary House Speaker John Boehner warned President Barack Obama in person Friday that signing an executive order overhauling immigration laws would spoil their chances of cooperating on other issues in the future. Boehner, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and other congressional leaders met with Obama for a two-hour lunch at the White House, where Boehner repeated the warning he\u2019d issued after Republicans seized control of both chambers in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. Sources said immigration reform was the focus of a 30-minute discussion during the lunch. \u201cThe speaker warned that unilateral action by the president on executive amnesty will erase any chances of doing immigration reform and will also make it harder for Congress and the White House to work together successfully on other areas where there might otherwise be common ground,\u201d Boehner\u2019s office said of the lunch. He and other congressional leaders didn\u2019t talk to reporters as they left the White House. But the White House said in a readout of the lunch that Obama \u201creiterated his commitment to taking action on immigration reform in light of the House\u2019s inability to pass a comprehensive bill.\u201d David Axelrod tweets Obama: Get House to vote on immigration Obama had already repeated his pledge to sign an executive order on immigration in the coming months during a news conference this week \u2013 and Boehner and McConnell separately said doing so would \u201cpoison the well\u201d and complicate the White House\u2019s chances of getting Congress on board with any of its other goals. Boehner\u2019s message came the same day that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said that Obama\u2019s \u201cnuclear threat\u201d of an executive order on immigration  would cause the GOP to back away from supporting the type of comprehensive reform that he\u2019d said looked key to the party\u2019s survival just two years ago. Immigration activists hope they don\u2019t get burned by Obama Priebus blasted Obama for politicizing the issue, saying he\u2019s caused Republicans to lose interest in advancing a measure that would hand undocumented workers a pathway to citizenship before first improving security on the U.S. border with Mexico. And he said Obama would be \u201cthrowing a barrel of kerosene\u201d on already-inflamed tensions with congressional Republicans if he goes ahead with \u201cexecutive amnesty.\u201d \u201cWhat I think [Obama has] done is unify the country and the electorate around one big principle, and that\u2019s that we need to secure the border,\u201d Priebus said at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cHe has created a situation that I think may have not have existed before that episode that has galvanized the country [to] a place where I don\u2019t believe most people are interested in comprehensive immigration reform unless they are convinced that the border is secure,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s because of the president\u2019s haphazard political game that\u2019s created an environment that will not allow the legislation to move forward unless people can be convinced that that border is secure. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve come.\u201d Opinion: Obama, GOP, get going on immigration reform Priebus\u2019s stance was a departure from an RNC-commissioned \u201cautopsy report\u201d that came in the wake of Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012. That report called on Republicans to support comprehensive immigration reform legislation, warning that otherwise, the party could alienate the rapidly-growing Hispanic electorate. He said most Republicans agree that immigration reform ultimately must happen. \u201cHowever, what we\u2019ve seen happen over the last several months is that the president has been using people as political pawns and lying to people when it comes to immigration reform,\u201d Priebus said.",

            "article_content": "Immigrant rights activists say they hope Obama will act despite GOP Senate takeover Obama has said he plans to issue an executive order on immigration Advocates will protest at the White House Friday House Speaker John Boehner said President Barack Obama could get \u201cburned\u201d if he uses executive action to help undocumented immigrants. There are a good number of immigration activists who feel burned that he hasn\u2019t done it already. While they were pleased to hear Obama renew his vow Wednesday that despite Republicans\u2019 takeover of the Senate he still intends to use his executive authority to help fix the nation\u2019s broken immigration system, the message from immigrants\u2019 rights groups to the White House remains the same: They\u2019ll believe it when they see it. Obama immigration remarks 'declaration of war' Boehner to Obama: Don't Poison the Well Advocates of immigration reform want the president to provide deportation relief to millions of undocumented immigrants since Congress has so far failed to pass a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws. It is hard to believe that a new Republican Senate and emboldened Republican majority in the House are likely to pass a bill that would pass muster with immigration activists. That leaves Obama and his promised executive action as immigration activists\u2019 only hope. They hope he\u2019ll keep his word. After promising on June 30 to announce the so-called executive actions he would take by summer\u2019s end, the White House delayed the move until after the mid-term election. Activists say they are tired of waiting and are planning a series of rallies, marches, conferences and other events to urge the president not to allow politics to delay action. \u201cDetails matter and promises have been made before,\u201d said Cristina Jimenez, managing director for immigrants\u2019 rights group United We Dream. \u201cOur campaign to protect our communities will continue until the policy is changed in a way that includes our parents, families and neighbors.\u201d At risk is not just the president\u2019s standing with the Latino community. Activists say this is an issue for all Democrats \u2013 including potential 2016 candidates \u2013 who some believe have taken Latino voters for granted. In a November poll by Latino Decisions, two-thirds of Latino voters said immigration was either the most important or one of the most important issues driving their vote this year and 60 percent of Latino registered voters who were not planning to vote said the delay in executive action made them less enthusiastic about the president and the Democratic Party. An October survey by Pew Research found that 55 percent of Latino registered voters disapproved of the way the Obama administration has handled the issue of deportations. \u201cThe president\u2019s legacy is at stake,\u201d said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. Hispanic members of Congress who support reform point to the 2 million people deported during the Obama administration as they make their case for swift, expansive action. The president \u2013 who has frequently been called the \u201cDeporter in Chief\u201d by immigrant groups \u2013 used a Congressional Hispanic Caucus gala in September to repeat his promise to act before year\u2019s end. He again reiterated that promise at a post election press conference on Wednesday, just moments after incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned that doing so would poison the well with the new Republican controlled Congress. Grassroots immigration anger Obama: GOP imn. stance political suicide Still, some advocates are skeptical. \u201cThere is nothing until there is something,\u201d said Marisa Franco, the lead organizer of the National Day Labor Organizing Network\u2019s (NDLON) #Not1More campaign against deportations. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop the pressure until we see the president follow through.\u201d And at least one former top Obama adviser urged the President to hold off on executive action in exchange for an up or down vote in the House. \u201cPOTUS should agree to shelve exec order for up or down vote in House,\u201d Axelrod said on Twitter on Thursday. Immigrant groups say \u201cgo big\u201d Several advocates who have been part of discussions with the administration, believe the president will use the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program he announced in 2012 as a model for future action. DACA allows immigrants brought here illegally as children to stay without fear of deportation and apply for work permits if they meet certain criteria. The president could expand this relief to potentially millions more people. Many supporters want the president to \u201cgo big\u201d with a move that would include everyone who would have been allowed to stay in the United States under the bill the Senate passed in June 2013. That would mean an estimated 6 million to 9 million people could qualify. \u201cWhat they actually announce and who they decide to protect is not entirely clear at the moment, but what is clear is that the expectations are high,\u201d said Katy Green, a spokesperson for the advocacy group America\u2019s Voice. Advocates taking action Activists are planning to protest in front of the White House on Friday to drive that point home. Pe\u00f1a Nieto on the U.S. immigration debate W.H.: Obama committed to bipartisanship \u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d said Gustavo Torres, president of Maryland group CASA in Action and co-chair of the national Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), at a press conference with other activists on Thursday, adding that more events are planned around Thanksgiving, including a hunger strike. Immigrant rights groups have been slowly ramping up pressure on the president. The Friday before Election Day, some two dozen United We Dream activists hailing from as far south as Florida and as far north as Massachusetts descended on the intersection opposite the White House. For half an hour they sat on the pavement amidst a cacophony of honking horns holding giant pictures of loved ones in danger of being deported. Some marched in circles chanting: No Justice, No Peace. Members of the same group interrupted the president repeatedly during a campaign stop in Bridgeport, CT days later \u2013 including one who was wearing a t-shirt that said \u201cObama Deports Parents\u201d \u2013 and heckled potential presidential candidate-in-waiting Hillary Clinton at a campaign rally in Maryland earlier in the week. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, long an outspoken advocate for executive action,has already set up a \u201cGetting Ready for Administrative  Action\u201d website with advice to help prepare undocumented immigrants for the president\u2019s announcement. It includes suggestions for the types of documentation immigrants can begin gathering to prove they qualify, once a plan is announced. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) held a rally in Los Angeles Wednesday with community based organizations and labor unions to urge action now that the election is over. The group will host an immigration conference next month. Boehner: We will move to repeal Obamacare Wolf delves deep into politics, Mideast \u201cOur hope is always that by Thanksgiving, people would sit around the dinner table giving thanks for the administrative relief\u2013 and that by Christmas we will have no more separated families,\u201d said CHIRLA\u2019s Executive Director Angelica Salas. NDLON is planning a demonstration next week outside the Department of Homeland Security by people directly affected by deportations. The groups\u2019 plans go beyond pressuring the president. They also want to use rallies as well as Twitter and Facebook to make a case to the American public that bringing the undocumented out of the shadows is good for the economy and say it\u2019s also important to deliver that message to Congress, since only lawmakers can find a permanent solution to the broken immigration system. \u201cThe best way to get that legislative outcome is for the president to put a marker down and let the Republicans respond,\u201d said Janet Murgu\u00eda, the president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza. \u201cIf they disagree, let them put their best foot forward on immigration reform and let\u2019s see what they will do.\u201d",

John McCain says he's 'seriously considering' running for re-election Warns that the campaign will be \"very, very, tough,\" starting with the GOP primary McCain will announce his decision in early 2015 Sen. John McCain, who has held onto his Senate seat for 30 years, seems hesitant to let it go in the next 2016 election. The Arizona senator, who will be 80 years old that year, told reporters on Thursday that he is \u201cstrongly considering\u201d and \u201cleaning towards\u201d another reelection bid. \u201cWe were talking to our longtime supporters \u2013 many of whom have been with us for many years and we\u2019re grateful for their support \u2013 about the options, and what we see as the future of the party in Washington and here in Arizona,\u201d McCain said after an event at the Ritz-Carlton in Phoenix, according to the Arizona Republic. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of their input as to whether I should run for re-election or not. They know that I am seriously considering it, and leaning towards it.\u201d While his supporters think he has enough steam for another term, McCain said it would be \u201ca very, very tough campaign.\u201d He has been heavily criticized by conservatives for sticking closer to the center than with them. The Arizona Republic reports that the state\u2019s Republican Party targeted McCain earlier this year for \u201cbeing too liberal,\u201d especially with immigration reform. If he decides to throw his hat in the ring, McCain knows the campaign trail will be bumpy. \u201cOh, I think you can certainly anticipate it,\u201d McCain said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to win a campaign, you have to plan for all scenarios, including significant primary opposition.

Every campaign I\u2019ve been in, I\u2019ve said, \u2018Look, this is going to be the toughest.\u2019 You have to assume that. We\u2019ve seen, historically, that people who take anything for granted, then they put that election in jeopardy. I\u2019ve never done that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Mitch McConnell is set to lead the Republican senate and vowed to restore 'regular order' However factors like the 2016 elections may give Democrats incentive to block GOP efforts One question will be how the GOP decides to address Obama's health care law Another issue is immigration though chances look slim for sweeping legislation Voters who are fed up with endless gridlock might be disappointed if they expect a Senate now controlled by Republicans to change things. One congressional expert put it bluntly: \u201cThe basic factors causing [gridlock] are not gone,\u201d said James Thurberfrom, a professor at American University.  \u201cSo it is likely that we will have a lot of delay and stalemate in the Senate.\u201d The stark reality is Republicans don\u2019t have the 60 votes they need to overcome Democratic filibusters, making it hard to pass many of their priorities. Sen. Ted Cruz dodges McConnell question Very different outlooks for next Senate Utah's Mia Love makes history with win But perhaps the biggest obstacle  for Republicans \u2013 the next election. Senate aides from both parties and outside congressional observers agree that political positioning for the upcoming 2016 presidential and congressional elections will likely dominate the day-to-day workings of the Senate, While Republican leaders believe it is important they show the country they can pass legislation and govern effectively, Democrats will likely do everything they can to block GOP achievements because they think they have a good chance of winning back the chamber in 2016. In that cycle, Republicans need to defend 24 seats \u2013 many from politically divided states \u2013 while Democrats only have to defend 10, most of which are from blue states. \u201cLook, the Democrats see an opportunity to keep the White House in 2016 and pick up seats and get the majority back,\u201d said a GOP Senate aide predicting Democrats will refuse to work with them. Complicating matters for Republicans is an expected tug of war within their party, with potential 2016 presidential contenders trying to assert their conservative credentials while other GOP Senators in competitive states try to appeal to moderate voters. The new GOP power players \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a little bit more chaotic and disorderly,\u201d said Ramesh Ponnuru, of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. In addition, it\u2019s unclear how President Barack Obama will respond to a Congress fully in Republican control, and whetherl he will make a genuine effort to cut hard-to-reach compromises or be more aloof, choosing to shore up his legacy over the last two years of his term by issuing executive orders on immigration and other priorities. Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, currently the Senate minority leader, is set to take over the powerful top job in the Senate when the new Congress convenes in January. After complaining for years that the Democrats put politics ahead of a well-functioning Senate, McConnell has vowed to return to \u201cregular order\u201d so that budgets, spending bills, and other items are approved months before the threat of a government shutdown or fiscal cliff looms. But his longtime sparring partner, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, is sure to challenge him on anything Democrats oppose. \u201cI think there will continue to be a battle between Reid and McConnell. They don\u2019t like each other,\u201d Thurber said.  \u201cReid will use delaying tactics as a minority leader, threatening filibusters. I don\u2019t think Republicans will have 60 votes so they can\u2019t overcome that.\u201d The particular dynamics of the Republican conference make it even more difficult for McConnell to manage the Senate.  On one side of his conference he has three tea party senators \u2013 Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas \u2013 who may seek the GOP nomination for president and who will be reluctant to cut deals with Democrats as they work to attract conservative primary voters. On the other side are a dozen or more senators who will be up for re-election in purple and blue states \u2013 such as Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mark Kirk of Illinois \u2013 who may want work across the aisle to show the broad base of voters in their states that they helped cut through the DC gridlock. \u201cI think he will be constantly maneuvering and using duct tape and glue to keep his conference together,\u201d Ponnuru said of McConnell. In fact, Cruz has already proposed a ten-step plan he\u2019d like Republicans to follow next year. He argued, in a recent USA Today column, his plan would prove to voters Republican senators take seriously their desire to change Washington.  His ideas include implementing tax reform, passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, reforming federal education policies, auditing the Federal Reserve, and repealing or reforming Obamacare. Democrats lose Congress under Obama Voters angry, dissatisfied with Obama CNN Election Night in America One of Republicans\u2019 top priorities will be to rework parts of Obamacare, with the recognition they won\u2019t be able to repeal the law in its entirety because of President Obama\u2019s veto authority.  But they at least want to make changes to the individual and employer mandates, get rid of the medical device tax, and pass other reforms. \u201cI think it\u2019s more likely we\u2019ll have a step-by-step approach to dismantling it and replacing it with consumer oriented, more cost-effective health care that won\u2019t interfere with the doctor/patient relationship,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican senator.  \u201cThat\u2019s what the American people want and that\u2019s what our goal is to provide.\u201d Another major concern among Republicans is Obama\u2019s plan to use his executive authority to change immigration laws, something he may announce shortly after the election. Republicans hope to be in a stronger position to push back on those changes now that they will control both the House and Senate. Republicans also want to pass several energy bills, including approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.  And they and want to push through a variety of job creation bills that passed in the GOP-controlled House last Congress but that were never taken up by Senate Democrats. Bipartisan support is possible on pending trade bills supported by the White House. One of the biggest changes to Capitol life that McConnell says he will institute is to have the Senate work an actual five day work week.  Under Reid, the Senate typically was in session only four days a week, with truncated schedules on Monday and Thursday.  But doing so well test McConnell\u2019s ability as leader because members of both parties \u2013 most of who travel back and forth to their states each weekend to be with their families and constituents \u2013 have enjoyed the luxury of the shortened Senate week.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker John Boehner warned President Obama against executive orders on immigration His remarks come amid many Republicans speaking out against the White House Two days after the midterms, big fights are much easier to spot than areas of compromise Republicans won back control of the Senate and increased their majority in the House Two days after voters angry with Washington\u2019s dysfunction swept Republicans into control of the Senate and expanded their advantage in the House, Speaker John Boehner used his first post-midterm news conference to issue a \u201cburn\u201d notice to the commander-in-chief. \u201cWhen you play with matches, you take the risk of burning yourself and he\u2019s going to burn himself if he continues to go down that path,\u201d the Ohio Republican told reporters on the Hill, when asked about President Barack Obama\u2019s plans to issue executive orders on immigration before year\u2019s end. Just hours after Obama recommitted himself to staying the course on immigration orders and protecting his signature health care law, Republicans spent Thursday firing back shots at the administration, signaling that Tuesday\u2019s midterms did little to quell partisan tension in Washington. Obama's Sr. Adviser responds to Boehner Boehner: We will move to repeal Obamacare W.H.: Obama committed to bipartisanship Obama & McConnell: The first test Republican National Committee members as well as GOP leaders on the Hill took the election results as a sign to dig in on their issues, and while both parties made reference to compromise, Thursday\u2019s developments suggested more of the opposite was in store. Obama alone after midterm repudiation Two of the most powerful Republicans in Washington, Boehner and the expected next Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, outlined their priorities in writing, using an oped in the Wall Street Journal to showcase their 2015 priorities. Among them: Repealing Obamacare, authorizing construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and reforming the tax code. The pair took shots at Democratic House and Senate leaders who shepherded most of Obama\u2019s significant legislative achievements through Congress, saying they \u201cwon\u2019t repeat the mistakes made when a different majority ran Congress in the first years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, attempting to reshape large chunks of the nation\u2019s economy with massive bills that few Americans have read and fewer understand.\u201d And in his press conference, Boehner said the House will likely vote again next year to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2013 both in full and in separate chunks, like stripping away the medical device tax and the individual mandate. Get ready: 2016 starts now And he warned that if Obama will \u201cburn himself\u201d if he overhauls the U.S. immigration system through executive order in the coming weeks \u2013 which president has pledged to do. Going ahead with those plans, Boehner said, will \u201cpoison the well\u201d in the eyes of congressional Republicans. It\u2019s the same phrase Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell used Wednesday \u2013 indicating that a major fight is likely to come before the new Congress is even sworn in. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in his Thursday briefing that Obama is looking forward to meeting with GOP leaders and hearing their ideas. \u201cThe good news though is that the deck has been reshuffled,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThere\u2019s now a Republican majority in the Senate. There\u2019s a Republican majority in the House. And you could understand how this might change the political calculation that Republicans make. Maybe they now see that it would be in their own personal political interest to try to find some common ground with the president.\u201d Opinion: Did Americans get what they want? Obama himself repeated his plans for an executive overhaul of immigration laws during hid Wednesday news conference. But he also said he\u2019d like to sit down for Kentucky bourbon with McConnell and telling voters \u2013 and those who stayed away from the polls Tuesday \u2013 that he heard their message. Boehner, one of several Republicans to mention their mistrust of the President, said Thursday that he isn\u2019t buying it. \u201cThe president said, \u2018I listened to what happened Tuesday night,\u2019\u201d Boehner said before adding, with an incredulous grin: \u201cReally?\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told CNN on Wednesday night that it\u2019s \u201cbizarre\u201d to see Obama and his allies now looking for areas of compromise. Huge trust gap between Obama, McConnell President ready to compromise with GOP? RNC Chair: Obama is lying to Hispanics He pointed to Obama\u2019s handling of immigration \u2013 the president had initially planned to take executive action over the summer, but deferred that move until after the midterm elections. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a thing he says,\u201d Priebus said when asked by CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett about working with the president. \u201cAll he\u2019s been doing for the last year is lying to Hispanic voters across the country.\u201d While McConnell\u2019s ascendancy to the Senate majority leader\u2019s post is all but assured and Boehner is staying on as speaker, Democrats have some leadership questions of their own to sort through after Tuesday\u2019s devastating elections. Why Pelosi, Reid are sticking around Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel told Newsday he won\u2019t stay on for a third election \u2013 though he does want a seat at the House Democrats\u2019 already-crowded leadership table. The first look at the new political landscape will come later this month, when lawmakers return for leadership elections and the House is scheduled to vote on a series of Environmental Protection Agency regulatory bills. In the coming weeks Congress will also take up Obama\u2019s request for more than $6 billion in new Ebola-related funding, spending bills to fund the government and potentially legislation to authorize the use of military force against ISIS.",

            "article_content": "2016 campaign will soon be underway now that midterms are over The internal dynamics of Democratic and Republican races are shifting Attention Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and everyone else \u201cseriously considering\u201d a run for president. You can stop pretending now. Did the 2016 race start already? Obama: Americans have sent a message Who's in the mix for 2016 The midterm elections, which traditionally double as the unofficial starting gun for the next presidential race, are finally over. But the truth is that the 2016 campaign has been under way for two years. It started the moment President Barack Obama vanquished Mitt Romney two Novembers ago, when a multitude of Republicans began assigning blame for the loss and not-so-subtly offering themselves up as the future of the party. And Democrats started looking toward Hillary Clinton, the party\u2019s presumed standard-bearer, who was just months away from stepping down as secretary of state and wading back into the churn of the political world. READ: Republicans takes control of Senate In a broad sense, the basic contours of the race have changed little since then. The choice in 2016 continues to look like a clash between Clinton and whichever Republican can emerge from a huge pack of ideologically diverse candidates. But the internal dynamics of the Democratic and Republican races are shifting dramatically. For Clinton, a two-year run on the lucrative paid-speaking circuit and a rocky national book tour renewed questions about her political instincts, and provided new ammo to Republicans eager to raise fresh questions about a historic political figure whose reputation is fairly well baked in to the public consciousness. But only a handful of Democrats seem willing to challenge her for the nomination, and none of them boast the kind of star power that Obama tapped to overcome the Clinton juggernaut in 2008. Republicans, meanwhile, are still figuring out how to communicate with a changing electorate that \u2014 even after the Republican tsunami on Tuesday \u2014 still favors Democrats in presidential years. The party is bracing for an electoral free-for-all, the likes of which it has not seen since 1964 when conservative Barry Goldwater emerged from the Republican convention in San Francisco as the nominee. Unlike recent cycles, there is no de-facto front-runner \u2014 and even Romney has seen his name floated by Republicans anxious about a presidential field that is as unpredictable today as it was two years ago. \u2018Wide open\u2019 field \u201cThe Republican field is wide open but a little more competitive than last time,\u201d said former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a GOP candidate in 2012. \u201cWhile the Republican field was big last time, a lot of the folks running didn\u2019t have all the tools in the toolbox to put together a successful campaign. That\u2019s in contrast to this cycle, where the people being mentioned today have an existing reputation, can raise an incredible amount of money, and have more serious public policy credentials and positions.\u201d READ: Full election results The new GOP power players Sen. Ted Cruz dodges McConnell question Graham: Obama a 'distant figure' in D.C. Republicans take control of U.S. Senate Though the Republican names being tossed around have more prestige and thicker resumes than the GOP cast of characters in 2012, the party has also endured scandals and stumbles over the last two years that have tarnished some of their brightest hopes. One early golden boy, Christie, was sullied by the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal in New Jersey and political compromises, like the New Jersey DREAM Act, that scored points with the public at large but rankled activists on the right. His sinking reputation opened the door for Bush to fill the space as the preferred choice of the Republican establishment, especially its powerful donor class. Still, as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Christie regained some political mojo this week after helping lift GOP governors to impressive wins in blue states like Maryland and Illinois. READ: Governor\u2019s race shockers Another young star, Rubio, a Cuban-American senator from Florida, saw his luster fade after he introduced an immigration bill that landed with a resounding thud on the right. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, an Indian-American Rhodes scholar, is a health care policy specialist who chided the GOP after the 2012 race as \u201cthe stupid party.\u201d But he undercut his thinking-man brand by diving headfirst into hot-button cultural fights \u2014 Google \u201cJindal\u201d and \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d \u2014 that seem more fit for cable news than the executive mansion. There\u2019s Paul, rooted in controversial libertarian politics, who emerged in the Senate as one of the more thought-provoking public figures in recent memory, with calls to expand to the party\u2019s reach to younger people and minorities. His biggest asset \u2014 a sometimes undisciplined shoot-from-the-hip authenticity \u2014 might also be his biggest liability. WATCH: GOP\u2019s big night in 90 seconds Cruz, a Harvard-educated conservative legal mind, captured the hearts of social conservatives and tea party activists, but earned the enmity of Republican leadership in Washington by becoming the face of the government shutdown. Those are just a few of the Republican faces vying for spots on the national stage with 15 months until the Iowa caucuses \u2014 and none of them have a lock on the nomination. \u201cWe are going to have a very large field, and there won\u2019t be a true front-runner,\u201d said Haley Barbour,  the former Mississippi governor and veteran GOP strategist. Former presidential candidates Rick Perry, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee are eyeing repeat bids, and other ambitious Republican governors like Jindal, Ohio\u2019s John Kasich, Indiana\u2019s Mike Pence, Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker are considering the idea, too. Kasich and Walker both won big on Tuesday. The bench goes even deeper, to Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a budget whiz and the rare Republican who supports same-sex marriage, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a conservative author and fixture on the conservative speaking circuit, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a foreign policy hawk. Hillary Clinton Rand Paul calls out the Grand Old Party Clay Aiken loses bid for House seat As it stands now, at the end of 2014, all of them will be vying for the right to take on Clinton, the Democratic heir apparent once again. Despite her unquestioned status as the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination and the White House in 2016, Clinton\u2019s re-emergence on the political scene, covered ad nauseum by the press, has not been smooth. She defended her buck-raking lecture tour \u2014 which took her to private equity firms and interest groups that have opposed Obama\u2019s agenda in Washington \u2014 by saying that she and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, needed the money because they were \u201cdead broke\u201d after they left the White House. WATCH: Dems lose big under Obama She delivered an impatient and defensive answer in June when pressed about her \u201cevolution\u201d on same-sex marriage, a reminder of her fraught relationship with the news media. In a CNN town hall that same month, she said the government should deport children from Central America who illegally crossed the border seeking refugee status, a position that put her at odds with Hispanics lobbying for a more humane immigration policy. Clinton\u2019s return to the campaign trail this fall has been considerably smoother. At event after event for Democrats in tough midterm races, she rallied voters with punchy and well-received speeches, though one recent flub \u2014 saying that businesses don\u2019t create jobs \u2014 suggests she isn\u2019t entirely comfortable channeling the populist fervor that\u2019s taken hold among the Democratic grassroots. Unlike 2008, when she shied away from the history-making potential of her gender, she has been unafraid to embrace women\u2019s issues in her stump speeches, talking about issues like abortion rights, access to contraception and paid sick leave. Her efforts meant little, though: Hillary and Bill Clinton campaigned in 25 states for more than 30 candidates at 75 campaign events. And in a wipeout year for Democrats, pretty much everyone they shared a stage with lost. The same was true for any Democratic surrogate but the klieg lights shine brighter on the Clintons. Exits polls signaled a harsh rejection of the status quo and the Obama administration, raising a number of questions for Clinton, both about her rationale for running and how she plans to address her relationship with the unpopular president during a campaign. READ: Obama alone after midterm repudiation But the more immediate question now swirling around Clinton is not if she will run \u2014 but when. Some Democrats have urged Clinton to signal her intentions quickly, perhaps by forming an exploratory committee sometime over the holidays, allowing her to begin hiring staff and laying groundwork for a national campaign apparatus. A presidential announcement in the New Year\u2014 in January, for instance \u2014 would also deny some oxygen to other Democrats flirting with a run. Others say Clinton can afford to wait much longer \u2014 perhaps until the the spring \u2014 and are urging her to do so to avoid being dragged into the muck of campaigning too early. \u201cThose who are urging her to start running now are those who think she has to respond to every attack or allegation or question from a reporter,\u201d said Donna Brazile, the Democratic strategist who managed Al Gore\u2019s campaign in 2000 and a CNN contributor. \u201cShe does not. She has the luxury of time. She can focus on what kind of candidate she wants to be. She can test her message. The last thing we need is a candidate who comes rushing out of the box to start appearing at J-J Dinners. She needs to take some time off and recap,\u201d Brazile said. The constellation of groups with ties to Clinton-world \u2014 the Ready For Hillary super PAC, Correct The Record, the Center for American Progress, Priorities USA Action, the super PAC co-chaired by former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina \u2014 appear primed to ramp up for a presidential run now that the midterms are in the books. Politico reported last week that David Plouffe, Obama\u2019s longtime political guru, recently advised Clinton and two of her top confidantes, Cheryl Mills and John Podesta, on how to build out a campaign organization and avoid the kind of self-inflicted blunders that plagued her in 2008. Other Democrats Though most of the Democratic Party\u2019s rising stars are deferring to Clinton when it comes to 2016, a handful of others say they will make a decision about the race whether Clinton runs or not. Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who has compiled a progressive record on social and economic issues in his home state but is little-known nationally, is the most serious of them. He has logged more miles campaigning for Democratic candidates in 2014 \u2014 more than Clinton or anyone else in the party \u2014 collecting chits for a potential campaign in the process. He took a serious hit on Tuesday when his lieutenant governor and hand-picked successor in Maryland, Anthony Brown, was felled by a Republican who ran almost exclusively against O\u2019Malley\u2019s record on taxes. READ: Takeaways from Election Night The Democratic Party\u2019s biggest grassroots star, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has said repeatedly that she will not run, but those statements have been ignored by progressives who demand that she join the race and address her signature issues \u2014 income inequality, student loans and financial sector reform among them. Tuesday\u2019s election revealed a deep well of economic discontent in the country that Warren seems primed to tap into. Vice President Joe Biden, all-too-aware of Clinton\u2019s strength with the party establishment and mindful that launching a campaign would immediately emasculate an already-diminished president, does not seem close to making a decision about the race even though he insists it\u2019s under consideration. Other potential candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb would, at first glance, enter the race as protest candidates, hoping to tap into simmering anxiety about Clinton\u2019s moderate policy inclinations and her ties to Wall Street. Democratic voters, in Iowa and elsewhere, have been telling reporters for months that a contested but not-too-divisive nomination fight would be healthy for the party and the primary process. A Clinton-versus-whoever primary would allow other Democratic up-and-comers a chance to introduce themselves, ensure a debate over the hot-button issues of the day, and give operatives the ability to keep the party\u2019s mechanics in working order. Even with token opposition, a primary would help keep Clinton in fighting shape ahead of the general election. The chances of Clinton losing the nomination again are at this point slim, even though her poll numbers have slipped with the general public since leaving the State Department and re-entering politics. But polls also show that her reputation is sturdier among Democrats than it was at this point six years ago \u2014 and her lead over potential foes is even larger. Competitive primary \u201cA strong competitive primary would be important and helpful,\u201d said Matt Sinovic, the executive director of Progress Iowa, a grassroots progressive organization in the caucus state. \u201cBut if there is a primary, it would be mostly stylistic, because she is such a known quantity. Look at the issues we care about, like raising the minimum wage, protecting Social Security, getting immigration reform done. Clinton is strong on every one of those issues.\u201d The Republican race is less predictable, and dramatically so. READ: 4 things Christie said after the midterms Lording over the Republican race from balmy Florida is Bush. The son of one president and younger brother to another, Bush\u2019s last name continues to be something of a liability with the American public, even as memories of his brother\u2019s troubled presidency fade. But his family pedigree is also an asset within the Republican establishment and the political insiders whose opinions matter greatly in the early stages of a presidential race. Bush is a known commodity to GOP donors and a trusted and pragmatic voice on policy issues \u2014 especially immigration reform \u2014 for Republicans who want to expand the party\u2019s appeal beyond its conservative base and bring Hispanics into the fold. \u201cThere are probably two people who have the capacity to define the Republican race very quickly,\u201d said Tom Rath, an influential Republican attorney in New Hampshire. \u201cOne is Mitt Romney. If he got in, he would be the unquestioned leader. But he is not going to do it. The other is Jeb.\u201d Bush, the 61-year old former Florida governor, is genial, well-liked by Republican donors and professionals and earnest to a fault about his 2016 thought process and whether he can run for president \u201cwith joy in my heart.\u201d In the words of one Republican donor who spent time with him at a South Carolina fundraiser last month, \u201cpeople just like being around him.\u201d \u201cJeb would immediately tap into the single biggest group of fundraisers, he would do that in a big way,\u201d Rath said. \u201cThere is a cachet that goes with his name. The aura around him is that he is the serious one.\u201d Though he barely cracks double digits in hypothetical 2016 polls, Bush would immediately command the attention, and the dollars, of the GOP establishment. That would mean less early running room for other Republicans, like Christie, Rubio or Kasich, hoping to tap into the same financial network. Bush versus conservatives But aides to other potential candidates have eagerly pushed the idea that the moderate and easy-going Bush, who last ran for office in 2002, is out of step with the conservative bent of today\u2019s Republican Party and the frenzied pace of today\u2019s hyper-active media environment, fueled by outside political spending, social media and a new generation of political reporters. READ: Voters say yes to paid sick days \u201cIf Jeb gets in, a lot of the money will go there right away, sure,\u201d said an adviser to another potential GOP candidate. \u201cBut a significant amount will still be there. Look, we will have to see if the Bush name still works. If Jeb is able to understand how the game is played now compared to when he was last playing in the majors. If he can hit those fastballs.\u201d Two of the issues precious to Bush and his admirers in the Republican establishment \u2014 education and immigration reform \u2014 are poison pills for a passionately vocal slice of the Republican base. A champion of charter schools and education vouchers, Bush is a defender of the Common Core academic standards that many conservatives view as federal intrusion into local schools. And sweeping immigration reform has been a non-starter among right-leaning activists for almost a decade, so much so that another Republican presidential wannabe, Rubio, backed away from the very same immigration overhaul he co-sponsored in the Senate after grassroots conservatives revolted over the bill. \u201cThere are three issues that are non-starters with conservatives,\u201d said Steve Deace, a nationally syndicated conservative talk radio host based in Iowa. \u201cDon\u2019t even show up if you support Obamacare, Common Core or amnesty. And Jeb Bush is the poster child for two of those three.\u201d Echoing a long-held view of conservative activists, Deace said the Republicans must nominate an unapologetic fiscal and social conservative in 2016 \u2014 someone like Cruz \u2014 or risk alienating the party\u2019s base in the general election. Nominating Bush or Christie, he said, would spell disaster. \u201cWhatever pagan deity the Clintons pray to, they are on their knees praying to run against a Bush or a Christie in 2016,\u201d Deace said. \u201cIf one of those guys was the nominee, their base turnout models would make what McCain and Romney did look like the the charge of light brigade. They would be lucky to get to 40 percent in a general election.\u201d READ: Why voters hate the Obama economy The enduring tension between the GOP\u2019s conservative and pragmatic wings \u2014 a feature of the party since the earliest Taft-Dewey clashes of the 1940s \u2014 will again be at play in 2016. The primary will test whether tea party conservatives like Cruz still have the kind of firepower, and megaphone, that they did in 2010 and 2012. The Republican establishment, which has tried to bring order to a volatile nomination process that they believe wounded Romney in 2012 by forcing him to tack too far right before the general election, will also be challenged. There are some things GOP leaders cannot control, namely the unpredictable power of outside money and the ability of a single donor to prop up a candidate of his or her choosing, even long-shots. Wild card That wild card has the potential to throw campaigns wildly off-message and needlessly drag out a divisive primary fight, especially in media-saturated political environment that rewards over-the-top statements and fuels silly micro-controversies. But even the most by-the-book candidates must bow to this new campaign reality, Pawlenty said. \u201cMoney, celebrity, and schtick will matter,\u201d said Pawlenty. \u201cAnd having billionaire friends who can fund Super PACs is probably key, too.\u201d But GOP leaders and their allies in the business community, who largely succeeded in sidelining controversial conservative voices in 2014, are working to reign in the nomination process. The Republican National Committee imposed new rules to shorten the nominating calendar and reduced the number of GOP debates in an effort to keep the intra-party battling to a minimum. \u201cThere is a clear risk of having too many subgroups who don\u2019t agree with each other,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cWe must avoid that. We have to nominate somebody who can unite our party and attract a large numbers of independents and moderates and conservatives.\u201d Though their grassroots base may disagree, Republicans in Washington have also been blunt about the need to expand the party\u2019s reach beyond white voters, whose share of the national vote shrinks ever year. At the same time, the country\u2019s Hispanic and Asian populations are on the rise. Among the potential candidates, Bush, Christie and Paul have been blunt about the need for Republicans to temper hardline rhetoric on immigration and do more to appeal to Hispanics, a rapidly-growing piece of the electorate that broke 3-1 for Obama over Romney in 2012. What GOP leaders know all-too-well is that the voting population looks very different \u2014 younger and less white \u2014 in a presidential year than it does in a midterm. The Republican National Committee\u2019s \u201cGrowth and Opportunity Project\u201d \u2014 the so-called GOP \u201cautopsy\u201d issued in the wake of their 2012 loss \u2014 said the party has to drastically change the way it talks to Hispanic voters. \u201cIf Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States (i.e. self-deportation), they will not pay attention to our next sentence,\u201d the report said. Javier Palomarez, the president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said that roughly 60,000 Hispanic-Americans turn 18 every month. Another way of looking at that figure: Every 30 seconds, a Hispanic becomes eligible to vote. \u201cThese numbers speak for the themselves,\u201d Palomarez said. \u201cThey tell the tale. What I have personally told President Obama is that never before has the Hispanic vote been more critical in electing an American president, and to me, never again will an American president be elected without openly courting the Hispanic vote.\u201d Barbour, who flirted with running for president himself in 2012, expressed confidence that Republicans have learned from their mistakes after a six-year hiatus from the White House, and will be willing to overlook ideological differences to get behind a nominee who can win. \u201cOur party is so concerned with the direction President Obama has taken us these last six years,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cI am reminded of the Democratic Party in 1992, when they were out in the wilderness. They had been out of the White House for 12 years, and they were not about to be left outside again. It gets cold outside.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama spoke for the first time since the election GOP will hold at least 52 Senate seats, according to CNN projections President Barack Obama isn\u2019t ceding ground on his most controversial policies despite an election that delivered a stinging rebuke to him and his party on Capitol Hill. During a roughly 90-minute press conference Wednesday, Obama gave no sign that he\u2019d accept major revisions to his signature health care law, change his mind on bypassing Congress on immigration or consent to Republican demands on energy and the environment. Indeed, the President didn\u2019t do much to suggest that his White House would work differently after Republicans won at least 52 seats in the Senate and their biggest majority in the House since World War II. President ready to compromise with GOP? Graham: Obama a 'distant figure' in D.C. What's next for Sen. Mitch McConnell? Obama: I will not sign healthcare repeal While Obama made clear he had no desire to reshape his agenda, he did acknowledge that voters dealt his party a dramatic defeat on Tuesday. READ: Forecast for new Congress \u201cTo those of you who voted, I hear you,\u201d Obama said in his first public remarks since the election. To those who didn\u2019t vote, \u201cI hear you too.\u201d Obama avoided language like \u201cshellacking,\u201d which he used to describe losses Democrats experienced in 2010. The closest he got to accepting blame for the campaign came when he said every election result offers a \u201cmoment for reflection.\u201d \u201cThere is no doubt the Republicans had a good night,\u201d Obama said. The success of Obama\u2019s final years in office could rely on Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is in line to become the next Senate majority leader. The two men have had an antagonistic relationship \u2013 McConnell once vowed to make Obama a one-term president \u2013 but have occasionally found common ground. McConnell worked closely with the administration, though mostly through Vice President Joe Biden, to broker a deal in 2012 to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. Obama reached out to McConnell on Wednesday and sounded an optimistic tone during the press conference. \u201cYou know, actually, I would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell,\u201d Obama said. WATCH: GOP\u2019s big night in 90 seconds The new GOP power players McConnell: The Senate needs to be fixed Still, the distance between Obama and McConnell quickly became clear. They both identified tax reform as a potential area of compromise. But Obama described that effort by encouraging lawmakers to lower tax rates by closing loopholes \u2013 a strategy McConnell and other Republicans have rejected for years. During a press conference in Kentucky, McConnell urged Obama to follow Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, who built domestic legacies despite often having to deal with a Congress controlled by opposing parties. McConnell said those two presidents are \u201cgood examples of accepting the government you have rather than fantasizing about the government you wished you had.\u201d \u201cThe president has really got a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThere certainly are going to be areas of disagreement.\u201d It will take time to see whether McConnell has running room from conservatives within his party who may prefer a strategy of confrontation. Obama, meanwhile, must consider how he can safeguard his own political legacy of health care reform, a Wall Street overhaul and an uneven economic recovery. But Obama insisted that the bitter polarization that has plagued his crisis-scarred presidency and turned his hair gray doesn\u2019t get him down. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me mopey,\u201d he said. \u201cIt energizes me, because it means that this democracy\u2019s working.\u201d READ: Last white Democrat from Deep South loses congressional seat",

            "article_content": "Democrats entered Tuesday anxious, yet hopeful, that the party would avoid major losses in the midterm election. What little optimism Democrats harbored early in the day had dissipated well before the clock struck midnight. Predictions of a long night, a Senate hanging in the balance waiting for the results of Southern runoffs, fell flat. The Republican Party won and it won big. It was a good ole fashioned thumping \u2013 one that reverberated well beyond vulnerable incumbents running for federal and state offices. Democrats lose congress under Obama Red state or blue state America? While every Democratic loss was stinging to the party, losing seats in reliable political strongholds was cutting. Democrats lost the governorships in Illinois, Maryland, and Massachusetts \u2013 states that President Barack Obama won by 17, 26 and 23 points, respectively, just two years ago. In the fight for control of Congress, the goal for Republicans was a net gain of six seats in the Senate \u2013 a notion well within the bounds of possible in the days leading up to Tuesday. The GOP won seven: Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia. We are still waiting on the results in the Senate race in late closing Alaska, as well as in Virginia. In Louisiana, pre-election polls indicated that Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy would be favored in a December runoff against Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. If there was a tacit acknowledgment that Democrats might lose the Senate majority, it was a complete surprise that Republicans clobbered them in governor\u2019s races. Endangered Republican governors in Florida, Kansas, Maine, Michigan and Wisconsin all won re-election. The new governor of Obama\u2019s home state of Illinois will be a Republican. It was a tough night for Democrats \u2013 a party that will be searching for answers, and an inspirational leader in the coming weeks and months. Here are five takeaways starting with the next likely political leader of the Democratic Party. Republicans seize Senate, gain full control of Congress Democratic political chief: Hillary Clinton Look no further than Hillary Clinton\u2019s travel schedule over the past two months to see how popular she is with Democratic lawmakers and base voters. It was a path her husband, the political iron man, started blazing earlier in the year \u2013 crisscrossing the country as the \u201cgo-to\u201d surrogate. The Clintons went where the President could not, did not and was not welcomed. Together, the Clintons participated in more than 100 campaign events. Yet, even they couldn\u2019t save Democrats on a night that went big for Republicans. Today, we enter a new election cycle and Hillary Clinton is the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. If she runs, Clinton will become the new political head of the party, as the President bears down and focuses on his final two years in office. \u201cAt the end of the big slaughter, a party out in the woods wonders who can lead them out,\u201d said a veteran Democratic strategist, who spoke candidly about Clinton only on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe are going to be looking for our Moses, and in this case everybody knows who they want to get them out of here. People will turn to her and want her to be that. The question will be will she accept it?\u201d While GOP operatives will highlight the fact that Clinton and her husband failed to help Democrats win Tuesday, it won\u2019t harm her standing among Democratic voters. The CNN exit poll showed that 83% of Democrats think that she would make a good President. New 2016 GOP mentionables The biggest story from Tuesday about the 2016 Republican presidential field will be Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s victory in Wisconsin. Democrats had a political bulls eye on his back. After all, he took on the unions and won, survived a recall election in 2012 and won. On Tuesday night, he won again. A loss would have ended any serious talk about Walker running for President. That possibility is still alive. But there are several other names that will emerge from the midterm election and become part of the 2016 conversation. Ohio Gov. John Kasich easily won re-election in a state that boasts 18 electoral votes in a presidential election. On a recent trip to New Hampshire, a well-known Republican elder immediately mentioned Kasich, a former chairman of the House Budget Committee, as the candidate he would like to see run in 2016. That just might happen. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder was in danger of losing re-election Tuesday night. But the governor, who embraced the \u201cOne Tough Nerd\u201d slogan \u2013 sailed to victory in a state that Obama won by 9.5% in 2012. A GOP strategist, who works with several potential 2016 candidates, noted that Snyder has a \u201ccompelling\u201d story to tell as a successful executive and venture capitalist who may be looked upon favorably by business-type donors. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez won re-election by 16 points in a reliably Democratic state \u2013 Obama won it by 10 points two years ago. She is the first Hispanic woman governor in American history and at a time when the GOP is trying to rebrand itself and reach out to minority communities, Martinez offers a different choice for GOP voters. Martinez is not well known nationally \u2013 her political advisers made it a point that she was running for re-election this year, not auditioning for the White House. Well, she has won a second term and even if Martinez doesn\u2019t seek the GOP nomination, there is no question she will be on everyone\u2019s short list as a potential vice presidential running mate. GOP 2016 hopefuls weigh in on midterm results And then there is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was not on the ballot, but played a key role in this election. He serves as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, overseeing the fundraising and political arm of GOP governors in the midterm election. As of Wednesday morning, Christie had only lost one incumbent governor, Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, which was expected. (We are still waiting to learn the fate of Alaska GOP Gov. Sean Parnell, who is in danger of losing re-election). Even if Parnell loses, it was a great night for Christie who was forced to defend many Republican governors perceived to be weak. He did so effectively. Earlier this year, there was speculation that Christie would have to step down as RGA chairman as he fought back allegations about being personally involved in Bridgegate. He stayed in the position. Instead, Christie barnstormed the country raising money for candidates, picked up political chits for his efforts and introduced himself to new donors. The RGA chairmanship, if used effectively can be a launching pad for a White House run. Coming out a big winner on Election Day can only enhance that position. If Christie runs for president, his time at the helm of the RGA will be well spent. Hey Washington, no one likes you While the CNN exit poll showed that 59% of the electorate was angry/dissatisfied with the Obama administration, 60% said they were angry/dissatisfied with GOP leaders in Congress. That is hardly a ringing endorsement for the nation\u2019s leaders at a time when fear is driving people\u2019s emotions on the economy and personal safety. The CNN exit poll showed that 45% of the electorate named the economy as the most important issue facing the country, followed by health care 25%, illegal immigration 14% and foreign policy 13%. Looking ahead to 2016, White House contenders and congressional candidates will be emphasizing that they have the plan to turn the economy around and protect the U.S. homeland. How the candidates differentiate themselves \u2013 especially in the presidential race \u2013 will be interesting and telling. Exit polls: Majority of voters dissatisfied or angry with Washington Political rhetoric will define policy Listen for the tone, and look closely at the body language when the President addresses the nation today following the political drowning his party took last night. It will be instructive as to how things may go in the lame-duck Congress. It is unclear if anything will get done when the House and Senate returns this month, let alone in the final two years of Obama\u2019s presidency. Just days before the election, Vice President Joe Biden said the White House was \u201cready to compromise\u201d in an interview with CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger. What does that mean? Who knows? But Biden is correct that if Obama wants to get anything done, he is going to have to work with Republicans. Will they work with him? Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is likely to become the new majority leader in January, sent a signal Tuesday night that the GOP has its own policy priorities to pursue. \u201cFor too long, this administration has tried to tell the American people what is good for them and then blame somebody else when their policies didn\u2019t work out,\u201d McConnell said in a speech following his own re-election. Common ground was a common theme a handful of K-Street lobbyists with business interests echoed Tuesday as they looked at the new makeup of Washington. \u201cRepublicans are going to have to decide if they are going to negotiate, and Obama is going to have to decide if he is willing to negotiate,\u201d said a veteran lobbyist, who worked for centrist Democrats on Capitol Hill and spoke freely only on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWill they be able to negotiate or continue to govern by deadline? They both should realize governing by deadline doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Worst campaign There were plenty of nominees to choose from for this dubious award, but one candidate stood out from the rest, by a long shot. Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, should have never had a serious general election challenge, let alone a bruising primary in August. The veteran senator refused to acknowledge that times were changing, and lawmakers who appear out of touch with their states were vulnerable. Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Indiana, fell in 2012, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, and Rep. Mike Castle, R-Delaware, both lost in 2010. Roberts had to fight his way through the primary and he thought it was over. It wasn\u2019t. A rescue mission from national Republicans saved his campaign and gave him another six years in the Senate. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t run the worst campaign in the country, it is only because he didn\u2019t have one until recently,\u201d said a senior GOP adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",

Jeanne Shaheen defeated him to win a second term, according to a CNN projection. Shaheen said late Tuesday night that Brown had called her to concede, and praised him for a \u201cvigorous race.\u201d The race represented Republicans\u2019 best chances at picking up a Senate seat in the Northeast \u2013 one that was vital for Democrats to protect as they faced majority-threatening challenges elsewhere. Over the summer, Brown used a series of crises to nationalize the race \u2013 arguing that President Barack Obama and, by extension, Senate Democrats like Shaheen, are unable to govern effectively. New Hampshire's Senate race He was among the first Republican candidates to call for a travel ban from Ebola-stricken countries in West Africa. He ran ads focused on ISIS and the border security, and focused much of his campaign on hitting Democrats over illegal immigration. Shaheen, meanwhile, turned to core Democratic economic issues and issues affecting working class voters and women. She hit Brown over what she argued were impossible-to-peg stances on lifting the minimum wage and mandating equal pay. She accused him of supporting GOP tax measures that promoted outsourcing while representing Massachusetts in the Senate.

In 2010 he rocketed to national stardom among conservatives when he put thousands of miles on his truck in deep-blue Massachusetts, defeated Martha Coakley and grabbed deceased Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy\u2019s seat in a special election. But Brown lost that seat two years later, in a campaign against a much tougher Democratic opponent \u2013 liberal icon Elizabeth Warren. A year later, after a trip to Iowa and a brief flirtation with the idea of running for president, Brown moved to his home state of New Hampshire and decided to take on Shaheen \u2013 who Republicans viewed as vulnerable, but didn\u2019t have anyone with the star quality it\u2019d take to beat her prior to Brown\u2019s arrival.

And about 8 in 10 Americans disapprove of how Congress is handling its job, according to a survey of voters outside of polling places on Election Day. The places America votes What's the impact of a republican win? Who are the midterm spoilers? Nearly six in 10 voters are either dissatisfied or angry with both the White House and Republican leaders in Congress. Less than a third of Americans are satisfied with the Obama administration and GOP leaders. Follow the election on CNN Politics\u2019 livestream And heading into the voting booth, seven in ten Americans said they were concerned about economic conditions. Most voters had a negative view of both parties, with the Democratic Party barely edging out the GOP to pull a positive view from 44% of voters compared to 40% for the Republican Party. But the two parties will be playing to moderates, with about 40% of voters identifying themselves as neither liberal or conservative. The conservative bloc is also larger than the liberal bastion, with about 36% of Americans calling themselves conservatives. And after an election that has played up government dysfunction and crises both at home and abroad, exit polls reveal that voters are concerned and anxious about the current state of the country and the direction it is headed. Two-thirds of voters said they believe the country is headed on the wrong track, and only 22% believe the next generation of Americans will be better off. And about 72% are at least somewhat worried that there could be a terrorist attack on U.S. soil. And voters\u2019 confidence in the government has been seriously shaken, with only 1 in 5 voters saying they trust the government to do the right thing. On the issues Ebola: Ebola also hit the campaign trail this season and about six in ten Americans said they followed news about Ebola. And only about 44% of Americans believe the federal government has done a good job combating the disease. ISIS: The threat of ISIS has also been played up by some Senate candidates, and a majority of Americans surveyed Tuesday support airstrikes against the militant group in Iraq and Syria.

That is, of course, assuming control of the Senate does not hinge on razor-thin victories that trigger recounts and possibly runoff elections in two states. Election Night will deliver clarity as well as confusion. There will, of course, be individual winners and losers, and the GOP is expected to easily hold, if not build upon, its majority in the House. But the great unknown is which party will control the Senate \u2013 an important detail that will greatly influence President Barack Obama\u2019s final two years in office. A viewer's guide to the election Republicans need a net gain of six seats to win control of the Senate and momentum seems to be in their direction. With polls opening across the country, Election Day could also offer fresh evidence that the angry, anti-incumbent mood extends well beyond Washington, as the fate of several embattled governors will be decided on this night. We may also witness the rebirth of a handful of political dynasties, as well as the crushing defeats of two high-profile, and much-hyped Democratic candidates: Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis and former American Idol star Clay Aiken, who is seeking a congressional seat in North Carolina. And as the dust settles in the early morning hours of Wednesday, attention will turn to the next presidential and congressional elections that will occur just two years from now. That\u2019s assuming control of the Senate will not hinge on recounts and runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana.

Yet it has a dark underside on Election Day \u2013 especially when there are charges of voter intimidation. In the past, supporters of both political parties have been accused of strong arm, nefarious tactics. Long lines, an insufficient number of ballots at polling locations and possible calls for judicial intervention to keep polls open could make for a messy, confusing and frustrating Election Day. 5 p.m. ET: We will start receiving results from the exit polls \u2013 surveys that people take at designated polling locations after voting as well as phone surveys among millions of early voters. The preliminary data will likely provide a window into voters\u2019 thoughts about the most important problems facing the country, and what specifically they think about key issues such as the economy, health care, immigration and terrorism. 6 p.m. ET: Polls begin to close in Kentucky, which holds one of the most watched Senate races of this midterm election. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is locked in a competitive re-election battle with Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a candidate Democrats hope can topple the minority leader. 7 p.m. ET: A dual focus on Kentucky and Georgia, which features the two best pick up opportunities for Senate Democrats. Winning one of these seats would take a little pressure off of Democrats who are playing defense for the remainder of the night. Knocking off McConnell would provide an added psychological boost for Democrats, but public polling shows that he has a single digit lead at this point in the race. In Georgia, there are two Democrats hoping to build upon their families\u2019 political legacies. Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, is running for the Senate seat vacated by GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Jason Carter, grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, is seeking the governor\u2019s office \u2013 the launching pad for his grandfather\u2019s successful presidential bid. But both contests are so close there is a belief that each race could go to a runoff if the candidates fail to receive more than 50% of the vote. If this happens, Carter would face off again against Gov. Nathan Deal on Dec. 2. Nunn and her Republican opponent David Perdue would face the voters again on January 6. 7:30 p.m. ET: Republicans have their first real, solid opportunity to win a Democratic seat in the open race to succeed Sen. Jay Rockefeller. Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito and Democratic Secretary of State Natalie Tennant are the respective nominees for their political parties. North Carolina will be closely watched as Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat, is trying to hold off an attempt by House Speaker Thom Tillis to send her home after one term. A victory by Republicans in North Carolina would be one of many critical building blocks the GOP is looking for to take back the Senate majority. As a pop culture side note, Aiken will learn if his American Idol stardom can transform into a congressional victory. Spoiler alert: it\u2019s unlikely. 8 p.m. ET \u2013 9 p.m. ET: Polls across the country are closing in this hour, and in terms of the Senate majority the focus broadens to New Hampshire and Arkansas. In the Granite State, polls close at 8 p.m. ET and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is facing former Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown in what has turned into an ugly campaign. Polling shows the race to be tight, and a Republican victory would be devastating to Democrats. A half hour later, polls close in Arkansas, where Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor is battling Republican Rep. Tom Cotton. Arkansas is one of several seats that the GOP has a chance of winning. In this hour, we may begin to see the anti-incumbent mood spread to the states. Governors in five states \u2013 Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maine and Pennsylvania \u2013 are in danger of losing re-election. And we may see a Republican reclaim the governorship in deep blue Massachusetts, a position Mitt Romney once held. 9 p.m. ET: Voting will end in Kansas, a state Republicans should not have to be defending. Embattled Sen. Pat Roberts is trying to win a fourth term, but questions regarding his Kansas residency has put him on the political ropes. The twist in this race is that the Democratic candidate dropped out in order to give Independent Greg Orman a chance to win. It is unclear if Orman will align himself politically with Senate Democrats if he defeats Roberts, but it is one of the most intriguing contests of the night. In South Dakota, it appears as if Republicans have turned around Gov. Mike Rounds\u2019 campaign \u2013 a needed victory in their quest for six seats. Colorado is another seat Democrats need to win in order to maintain their majority, but Sen. Mark Udall is in danger of losing to GOP Rep. Cory Gardner. The Louisiana Senate race features eight candidates, including Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu \u2013 and it is unlikely to be decided until the Dec. 6 runoff. Davis\u2019 high profile, low polling bid to be the next Texas governor is likely to end in defeat. But the first legacy victory of the night is expected to happen when George P. Bush, son of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, grandson of former President George H. W. Bush, nephew of former President George W. Bush, wins the race to become the next Texas Land Commissioner. And we have another chance to see if the anti-incumbent mood is pulsating beyond the Beltway as four more governors in Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, and Wisconsin are in danger of losing re-election. Keep an eye on Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s race \u2013 a defeat would all but end any plans he may have in running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. 10 p.m. ET: Republicans are expected to easily win the Montana Senate seat, and have a shot of picking up the Iowa Senate seat. Both seats are currently held by retiring Democrats. A loss in Montana is expected while a defeat in Iowa would be a major blow to the Democrat\u2019s ability to keep the Senate. 11 p.m. ET: Polls in the most populous state, California, close and Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to easily win re-election. Oregon begins releasing real vote totals and Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley is expected to defeat GOP challenger Monica Wehby. Polls begin to close in Alaska. 1 a.m. ET: Voting ends in the U.S. as the final Alaska polls close. Depending on what happens earlier in the evening, the fate of the Senate majority may come down to who wins the competitive race between Democratic Sen. Mark Begich and GOP challenger Dan Sullivan.

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama heckled by immigration protesters in Connecticut Obama is scheduled to campaign Sunday in Connecticut and Pennsylvania He'll rally for two gubernatorial candidates, which is where he's focused his fall campaigning His campaign stops have been limited this cycle amid low approval ratings After a campaign season marked mainly by Democrats fleeing his shadow, President Barack Obama embarked upon the final push of what he calls his last campaign Sunday, hoping to mobilize voters in the few pockets of the country where he remains somewhat popular. Obama headlined afternoon campaign rallies for Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, capping off a cycle that saw him rally for only one Senate candidate and a handful of governors. His diminished presence in 2014 amounted mostly to headlining high-dollar fundraisers in wealthy neighborhoods, mostly on the coasts, where he sought to motivate donors amid bleak prospects for his party in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. In tight races across the country, Democrats have distanced themselves from his policies, declaring themselves independent from the White House as Republicans worked overtime to lump them into the same unpopular mold. The President himself has fueled that effort at times, saying during an economic address in October that his \u201cpolicies are on the ballot\u201d and telling Al Sharpton during a radio interview that vulnerable Democrats are \u201call folks that vote with me.\u201d Obama, whose presidential campaign drew massive crowds of young people and African-Americans in 2008 and 2012, has been working to propel those voters to the polls. Democrats have little chance of keeping control of the Senate unless traditional Democratic voting blocs turn out in force. That was Obama\u2019s goal Sunday in Philadelphia, where he revved up a majority black crowd at a rally for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some work to do. Because two days from now, you get to choose your future,\u201d he said, reminding the 5,500 attendees that the historic battle for the right to vote must be honored by casting ballots in midterm elections. Obama reiterated that theme in Connecticut earlier Sunday at a rally for Gov. Dannel Malloy. \u201cYour vote matters,\u201d he told the 1,900 supporters who came to see him speak in Bridgeport. \u201cDon\u2019t let people tell you it doesn\u2019t.\u201d The crowd in Connecticut was largely enthusiastic about hearing from the President, but his speech was interrupted multiple times by protesters for immigration reform who carried signs with messages such as \u201cDREAMers demand bold, broad, inclusive relief.\u201d Each time protesters interrupted Obama, they were shouted down by the crowd. On at least one occasion, members of the crowd ripped the signs away from a group of protesters, who were ultimately escorted out by security. The campaign effort over the weekend amounted to Obama\u2019s biggest push for Democrats this cycle. His reduced role is the outcome of record low approval ratings and policies unpopular in many parts of the country. The restricted campaign role isn\u2019t necessarily where Obama wanted to be during the final congressional contests of his presidency, though past second-term presidents have similarly dragged down their party\u2019s candidates. \u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot this time, and this is the last election cycle in which I\u2019m involved as President,\u201d he said in Maine on Thursday. \u201cIt makes you a little wistful, because I do like campaigning. It\u2019s fun.\u201d He was originally scheduled to campaign in Connecticut last month, but canceled shortly beforehand for meetings on his administration\u2019s Ebola response. The president\u2019s rescheduled appearance comes at a potentially critical point for Malloy. The one-term governor is polling neck-and-neck in his re-election battle against Republican nominee Tom Foley, a former U.S. ambassador to Ireland who lost to Malloy by only 6,400 votes in 2010. A Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday had the two men at 43% each among likely voters. A third candidate, Joseph Visconti, is polling third with 7% in the same survey, with 6% undecided. Despite these poll numbers, Connecticut Democratic Party spokesman Ian Sams said Sunday he believes a heavy emphasis on voter turnout will bring Malloy a win on Tuesday. \u201cI think with President Obama coming here today, we\u2019re going to see a lot of interest from base Democratic voters,\u201d Sims told CNN. \u201cIf they come out to vote, turn out in full force, Gov. Malloy\u2019s confident he\u2019s going to win this campaign.\u201d Connecticut is a reliably blue state, but not totally averse to GOP governors \u2013 Malloy himself succeeded two Republicans when he took office. In Pennsylvania, Wolf has led the GOP incumbent Tom Corbett for most of the race, and while polls have narrowed recently, he still maintains an edge.",

Obama: GOP imn. stance political suicide Romney did not budge, explaining the rationale for blocking the bill. \u201cI think the Republicans in the House were looking at what was coming up from the Senate and saying: \u2018You know we can do better if we pick up some more seats in the Senate.\u2019\u201d Republicans did not do well with winning Latino votes in 2012 elections and the GOP\u2019s 2012 self-assessment criticized the party\u2019s outreach to Latino voters. \u201cWe must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d it said. \u201cIf we do not, our party\u2019s appeal will continue to shrink,\u201d the RNC said after the 2012 election. Romney said the GOP is better prepared to deal with immigration this time around.  \u201cYou are going to see a provision first of all, to secure the border, second of all, to deal with those who have come here illegally and third to make sure that our immigration policies are more open and transparent to the many people who do want to come here legally,\u201d Romney said. While he said he wouldn\u2019t predict if Republicans were going to \u201cwin the Senate,\u201d he said he\u2019s confident Republicans will \u201cpick up a lot of seats.\u201d Regardless, Romney says Republicans will be better equipped to deal with the issue of immigration after midterm elections. \u201cWe have a lot better prospect of having a piece of legislation which deals with the issue in a way I described it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Tuesday's election could determine Senate control Turnout will be key if Democrats want to maintain their majority Obama appealed to women during a trip to New England Democrats aiming to keep the Senate are facing tough odds in next week\u2019s election with their chances depending on convincing a surge of women and African-Americans to vote. Both sets of voters will be vital in two of the crucial races \u2014  in North Carolina and Iowa \u2014 which new CNN polls show are headed for photo-finishes with only three days of campaigning left. Republicans are especially bullish in Iowa, where their candidate, Iraq war veteran Joni Ernst, leads Bruce Braley by 49% to 47% for a Senate seat Democrats have held for nearly 30 years. Braley leads among women voters by 12 points in the CNN/ORC International survey \u2014 but Ernst does three points better than that among men and also dominates the potentially decisive bloc of rural voters. In North Carolina, home of the most expensive midterm race in history, Sen. Kay Hagan leads by two points and enjoys a slim gender gap. Her advantage comes after she spent much of this election cycle slamming Republican foe Thom Tillis over his attitude to equal pay legislation. READ: Battle for Congress hits final stretch The GOP has a solid grip on the House but Republicans need a net gain of six seats to grab the Senate for the first time in nearly a decade. They\u2019re expected to easily win South Dakota, Montana and West Virginia to bring them to the cusp of victory on Tuesday. Other battlegrounds are in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Hampshire and Colorado, making the outcome of the election too close to call. And Republicans have to watch a few seats of their own. Democrat Michelle Nunn is surprisingly strong in Georgia and Republican Sen. Pat Roberts is struggling to put away an independent challenger in Kansas. Election day might be Tuesday, but more 14.8 million Americans have voted already, casting early, absentee and mailed-in ballots, according to Dr. Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project. READ: How McConnell would run the Senate Both parties are claiming the early edge. In North Carolina, for instance, 48 percent of the more than 870,000 early voters were Democratic, a potentially significant boost for Hagan. Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Czin said the party is encouraged because it is seeing early voting from people who didn\u2019t show up in the last midterm elections in 2010. That election was disastrous for Democrats when the tea party wave helped Republicans take control of the House. But in Iowa, a state where Democrats usually have the edge in early voting, Ernst is tied in early returns. And in another danger sign for Democrats, Republican Cory Gardner is up 10 points in Colorado. Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said that the GOP\u2019s predictive analysis shows Democrats are behind in early voting. \u201cWe have changed our strategy and are turning out more voters who normally wouldn\u2019t vote in midterm elections and are turning them out earlier than we ever have before,\u201d she said. Early voting is especially crucial for the Democrats, because their base voters are historically less prone to show up in midterm elections. A heavy early turnout for the party could help offset expected enthusiasm among Republicans on Election Day. Setting the stage for a frantic final weekend of campaigning for an election that will set the stage for the early skirmishes of the 2016 presidential campaign, top party surrogates were out in force. Bill Clinton is blitzing states where President Barack Obama, with his tattered political brand, would not be effective and was hitting the trail for Hagan on Friday. READ: 7 times Democrats wished Obama would go away Obama did, however, get off a few blows in friendly territory in Rhode Island on Friday, saying that Republicans backed policies towards women and politicians that belonged in a \u201cMad Men\u201d episode. On the Republican side, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is visiting three states \u2013 Arkansas, Kansas and Wisconsin and Rand Paul was at a lunch in Pennsylvania with embattled GOP Gov. Tom Corbett. As both parties focus on turnout, the discussion in the competitive Louisiana Senate contest is turning to race. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu angered Republicans by suggesting to NBC News that Obama has a tough time in the South because the region has not \u201calways been the friendliest place for African-Americans.\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, blasted Landrieu\u2019s comment as \u201cremarkably divisive\u201d and said Obama was unpopular because of his policies. \u201cShe appears to be living in a different century,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTrying to blame it on race is ridiculous.\u201d Landrieu later repeated her line in a statement that also attributed Obama\u2019s unpopularity in Louisiana to energy policies, including a moratorium on offshore oil drilling. \u201cIn addition, the south has not always been the friendliest or easiest place for African Americans to advance, and it\u2019s been a difficult place for women to be recognized as the leaders we are,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone knows this is the truth, and I will continue to speak the truth even as some would twist my words seeking political advantage.\u201d And as the midterm season winds down, potential 2016 presidential contenders are getting a taste of what life might be like on the campaign trail if they decide to seek the White House. Hillary Clinton was repeatedly heckled Thursday in Maryland by activists backing a path to citizenship for young, undocumented immigrants. \u201cI am a strong supporter of immigration reform,\u201d the former secretary of state shouted over the rowdy rally.

            "article_content": "The battle for the Senate is unsettled heading into the final days of campaigning Themes that were expected to dominate the cycle haven't resonated Political climate still favors Republicans The battle for control of Congress is entering a final, frantic five-day stretch that favors Republicans but has room for plenty of surprises that could determine which party will run the Senate. The unsettled nature of so many individual contests at this late stage underscores the unpredictability of this election season. And Election Night could turn out to be a nail-biter that continues for days \u2013 or even months. Has campaigning for 2016 already begun? Giuliani: ISIS may be afraid of Christie Louisiana cooks up spicy Senate race The themes that were expected to dominate this election cycle \u2013 Obamacare and immigration \u2013 are turning out to be duds. Meanwhile, threats posed by Ebola and ISIS \u2013 hardly dinner table conversations a year ago \u2013 are suddenly top issues. And on top of all that, add a mix of 2016 presidential drama as potential contenders barnstorm early voting states to help congressional candidates. READ: With Ebola battle brewing, Obama heads to Maine The GOP is poised to extend its grip on the House and needs a net gain of six seats to take back the Senate for the first time since 2007. Republicans are expected to easily take Democratic seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia, leaving them needing just three more seats to build a Senate majority. But getting there could get tricky. North Carolina Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is holding firm in a race many observers thought she would have lost by now, up four points in an Elon University survey over her challenger, Thom Tillis. READ: 7 times Democrats wished Barack Obama would go away In Georgia, Democrats believe that Michelle Nunn \u2014 one of the emerging stars of this election cycle \u2014 could beat Republican David Perdue. If neither candidate gets 50 percent of the vote a run-off election will take place in January. In Kansas, Senator Pat Roberts is still slugging it out against independent candidate Greg Orman and even the man most likely to become majority leader in a Republican Senate, Mitch McConnell, cannot take re-election for granted in Kentucky. The loss of any of that trio would complicate Republican hopes in the Senate. Still, there are other pickup opportunities for Republicans. In Colorado, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall seemed to be in good shape just a few months ago. But now he\u2019s down by seven points to Republican challenger Cory Gardner in a Thursday Quinnipiac University survey. The Denver Post had the race closer \u2014 with Gardner up two percent. In New Hampshire, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is in a very tight race with former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown. Meanwhile,  Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, fighting an uphill battle in an increasingly red state, was down between 13 and seven points to challenger Tom Cotton in two recent surveys. READ: Hillary Clinton could end up alone in Iowa Other key states where Republicans have a good chance of picking up seats include Louisiana, Alaska and Iowa. Though the 2014 race isn\u2019t even wrapped up yet, the next election in 2016 is already unfolding as potential presidential candidates stump in key early voting states. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced plans to blitz 19 states before Election Day, including Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, which will play outsized roles in the presidential campaign. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, made waves by jabbing Hillary Clinton over her attitude towards business. On the Democratic side, Clinton, who increasingly appears to be waging an undeclared presidential campaign, tracked through Iowa this week \u2013 the state that did most to doom her 2008 White House bid. Obama remained a sideshow, with his low approval rating making him unwanted by Democrats in swing states. So, he has been largely confined to raising millions of dollars for Democratic Party coffers, or stumping for candidates in liberal territory. On Thursday, Obama was headed to Portland, Maine, to campaign for Rep. Mike Michaud who is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Paul LePage in a tight governor\u2019s race.

McCarthy says the VP is more effective in 36 hours than Obama is in three months House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tied his party\u2019s 2016 White House prospects to the election just one week away \u2013 and how Republicans govern over the next two years. Speaking at a fundraiser in Long Island this weekend, the No. 2 House Republican told donors that Republicans need to win back the Senate this year and govern effectively in Congress beginning in January to have a chance at seating a Republican in the Oval Office. \u201cIf we don\u2019t capture the House stronger, and the Senate, and prove we could govern, there won\u2019t be a Republican president in 2016,\u201d McCarthy said, according to a Politico profile published Sunday. McCarthy has privately estimated that the GOP has a 75 percent chance of retaking the Senate, according to the same report. But it will be \u201ctough\u201d if those Senate odds don\u2019t prevail, McCarthy said. \u201cIf it stays Democratic, it\u2019s going to be a frustrating time,\u201d he added. McCarthy: We'll turn this country around House GOP leadership shake-up One of the challenges Republicans are sure to face if they take a majority in both houses of Congress is immigration reform.

But if that happens, McCarthy said it would \u201cstop everything,\u201d Politico reported. McCarthy ascended to his post as House Majority Leader in August after his predecessor Eric Cantor lost his Republican primary in a surprise defeat that sent shockwaves throughout the Beltway. McCarthy also knocked Obama for having a tough time \u201ccoming to an agreement,\u201d but offered his praise for Vice President Joe Biden. Biden can \u201cdo more in 36 hours than [Obama] did in three months,\u201d McCarthy said.",

His approval rating dropped to 39 percent in New Hampshire \u2013 which has driven Brown\u2019s efforts to connect Shaheen with the president. Sen. Elizabeth Warren Puts up a Fight New Hampshire's Tight Senate Race Sen. Elizabeth Warren Puts up a Fight And that\u2019s what Brown tried to do, using every issue possible \u2013 illegal immigration, Ebola, ISIS and Obamacare among them \u2013 to try to nationalize the debate. Shaheen, meanwhile, cast Brown as a political opportunist and turned to Democrats\u2019 bread-and-butter economic topics like equal pay and raising the minimum wage. Here are six lines that showcased the debate\u2019s top issues: Scott Brown: \u201cShe calls it fear-mongering; I call it rational fear.\u201d The day another potential Ebola case was reported \u2013 this time, a doctor in New York \u2013 the two sparred over the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the threat. Brown called for a ban on travel from the West African epicenter of the outbreak. He blasted Obama\u2019s appointment of Ron Klain as the nation\u2019s Ebola response coordinator as someone \u201cwith no experience in his field.\u201d He criticized Shaheen for not voting to close the U.S. border with Mexico. And he complained that the New York doctor should have been quarantined when he returned to the United States. Brown even said the Ebola threat would be minimized if Republican Mitt Romney had been elected president. \u201cHad he been president, I feel he would have had a clear and concise plan. He would have reassured the American people,\u201d Brown said. Shaheen, meanwhile, criticized Brown for \u201cfear-mongering about this issue,\u201d and said neither she nor Brown have medical expertise on the issue. But Brown shot back that \u201cshe calls it fear-mongering; I call it rational fear.\u201d Jeanne Shaheen: \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes sense for the president to come to New Hampshire right now.\u201d Just like he has through the entire race, Brown repeatedly tied Shaheen to Obama \u2013 whose approval rating, a CNN/ORC International poll released Thursday found, is 39 percent in New Hampshire. The political damage that association can cause Shaheen was most clear when she said she didn\u2019t want Obama to campaign for her. \u201cThe fact is, that there are big differences in this race between my opponent and me, and it\u2019s not just about the president,\u201d Shaheen said, repeatedly turning to issues like increasing the minimum wage and mandating equal pay. Brown said on a number of issues, Shaheen and Obama might as well be the same person. He said she\u2019s already supported the president\u2019s agenda for six years, and said she cast the deciding vote to approve Obama\u2019s signature health care law. \u201cThere were 60 of us,\u201d Shaheen said, referring to the Senate\u2019s 60 Democrats at the time, all of whom supported Obamacare. \u201cEvery one of us was a deciding vote.\u201d Brown: \u201cThere is a rational fear \u2026 [of] criminal elements, terrorists, people with diseases coming through our border.\u201d Illegal immigration appeared to be Brown\u2019s comfort zone. He repeatedly returned to the issue, asserting that weak border security could open the United States up to an influx of ISIS fighters, victims of the Ebola virus and more. He criticized Shaheen\u2019s support for the DREAM Act, for failing to crack down on undocumented immigrants who receive government benefits and for standing by as Obama moves toward executive action on immigration after the Nov. 4 election. He said he\u2019d never support any bills that would \u201cactually legalize people that are here illegally, who are not entitled to the protections and/or the rights and privileges that have been earned by our citizens.\u201d Shaheen, meanwhile, cast Brown\u2019s position as unworkable. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d she said, \u201cif you want border security, then you should support comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d She criticized Brown for voting in favor of a GOP budget that would have slashed homeland security spending, and for missing committee hearings on border security. Shaheen: \u201cWe don\u2019t need to import a candidate who\u2019s going to outsource our jobs.\u201d The Democrat landed two punches in one line \u2013 hitting Brown, the former Massachusetts senator, for moving into his native state to mount another Senate campaign and then pivoting to economic issues. She pointed repeatedly to Brown\u2019s support for oil industry subsidies, accused him of doing the bidding of large corporate interests and even tried to latch Brown to the Koch brothers, the conservative political funding giants who she said have pumped $2.6 million into New Hampshire\u2019s race. The two debated Shaheen\u2019s zero rating with the National Federation of Independent Businesses \u2013 with Brown repeatedly citing that figure and Shaheen dismissing it, arguing that the organization is funded by the Koch brothers. Moderator Wolf Blitzer pointed out that using Congressional Quarterly\u2019s scoring, Brown, while representing Massachusetts, voted with Obama 78 percent of the time. \u201cWell when the president does something right, I\u2019ll support him,\u201d he said. \u201cAs an independent senator, I can do that.\u201d Brown: \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the greatest fighting force off the table.\u201d Brown accused Obama \u2013 and, by extension, Shaheen \u2013 of blowing the United States\u2019 chances of defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria by insisting that ground forces won\u2019t be part of an effort that so far has included air strikes. \u201cWhat if air strikes don\u2019t work? Then what?\u201d Brown said. He pointed to a new book by former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta accusing Obama of \u201chalf-steps and missteps, and as a result our allies don\u2019t trust us, our foes don\u2019t fear and respect us, it\u2019s been an incoherent policy.\u201d Shaheen responded that the United States is \u201cbuilding an international coalition\u201d that includes 60 partners, including some Arab countries. She looked for wiggle room, saying she would take sending ground troops to the region off the table \u201cright now.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be putting tens of thousands of American troops back in as an occupying force, and we should also not be talking about ISIS in a way that spreads fear and panic among our population,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just grandstanding.\u201d Shaheen: \u201cWe should make sure that people can make a living.\u201d She tried to back Brown into a corner on whether he supports raising the minimum wage. Shaheen said women \u2013 who support her over Brown \u2013 would make up two-thirds of the beneficiaries of an increase in the minimum wage. National Democrats have called for a new figure of $10.10 per hour. \u201cThis is one of the issues that distinguishes me from my opponent, because I have been supporting middle class families here,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s now clear that he doesn\u2019t support that.\u201d Brown said his mother worked minimum wage jobs, and that he did, as well, earning his first paychecks at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. He said he\u2019s supported increases in the past. But he didn\u2019t say whether he supports an increase now, instead accusing Obama and Shaheen of trying to \u201cdictate\u201d to businesses already burdened by overregulation. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is another effort by the Obama administration, as supported by Sen. Shaheen, to just dictate to businesses what they\u2019re going to pay,\u201d he said. Poll: Dead heat in New Hampshire Senate race",

            "article_content": "Americans are fed up with dysfunction in Washington Does it really matter if Democrats or Republicans are in charge after 2014? Of course it matters. But many if not most Americans see the midterm election two weeks from Tuesday as likely to change little or nothing of consequence. Their lack of interest is part of the price of Washington gridlock and dysfunction. 'Mr. President, don't touch my girlfriend' Cruz: We'll retake the Senate, retire Reid Politicians get bad marks for absenteeism? It is nearly impossible to see a path for action of major, controversial issues like immigration reform, a new tax system, or long overdue fixes to the big-money entitlement programs Medicare and Social Security. National Journal\u2019s veteran political reporter Ron Fournier sums it up this way: \u201cNo matter how this goes, we\u2019re going to have more gridlock and more politics above policy,\u201d said Fournier. \u201cAs we turn to 2016, it will be angrier, more frustrated and voters will be angrier, more frustrated and looking for alternatives outside these two parties.\u201d Remember that last part \u2013 especially if independent Greg Orman wins the tight Senate race in traditionally ruby red Kansas. That could send both parties a signal about the public\u2019s disgust with politics as usual. But, for now, focus on this year. Democratic-held seats in Iowa, Colorado and maybe New Hampshire are within Republican reach but razor close. And now, Republican-held seats in Kansas, South Dakota and Georgia are in play, giving the Democrats late hope of changing a bad 2014 hand with wild cards. Related: Key races to watch in 2014 This may be too volatile a year for history to matter, but history usually does matter and it suggests a decent to good Republican election, depending on whether those close races all break one way or the other - as often happens -or play out in a wild night of state-by-state chess. Those two most likely scenarios: 1. Republicans add a modest number of seats to their House majority, and take control of the Senate with somewhere in the ballpark of 51-54 seats. But the truth is, whatever your politics, who wins on election night matters more than you might think.  2. Republicans add a modest number of seats to their House majority, and Democrats close strong and somehow manage to keep their Senate edge, with either 51 seats or a 50-50 tie in which Vice President Joe Biden breaks ties for the rest of the Obama administration. Either way, neither party is going to be anywhere near the 60 votes it takes to do real business in the Senate. And President Obama, for all the talk of his lame duck status that is already taking hold, would still hold  the bully pulpit and a veto pen. So, even if Republicans controlled both the House and Senate and, even if they somehow came up with the votes to repeal Obamacare, it would trigger perhaps the fastest presidential veto in history. Plus, even if the Republicans run the House and the Senate, they still have their own internal tensions. Grimes and her family's Hugh Jass Burgers South Dakota race has songs and poetry Would a GOP Senate win mean a mandate? Take immigration. Speaker John Boehner and (in the event they can achieve a slim Senate majority) new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would like nothing more than to move beyond the immigration impasse that has stymied Washington for years so the GOP can begin to try to repair its crisis with Latino voters. But grassroots anger on this issue is as great as ever, and there would be an internal revolt if Boehner or McConnell embraced even something like legal status for the undocumented. President Obama has said a permanent legal status doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough, but the conservative base equates it with amnesty. Moving past immigration, what about the debt? There has been no compromise on entitlement spending in recent years because Republicans want deeper savings than Democrats will support and there has been too much partisan grandstanding to try to work out a compromise. Would total GOP control of Congress make a difference? Maybe: there would be a united GOP negotiating front with the White House, and the President would perhaps be open to more as he considers his legacy and looks for big achievements. Or maybe not: with Republicans shy of 60 votes in the Senate, imagine Elizabeth Warren as the new Ted Cruz. She might do anything she could to gum up the works when something doesn\u2019t pass her ideological muster. And don\u2019t forget the 2016 campaign begins in earnest the day after the 2014 election. Having been stunned from the left in 2008, would Hillary Clinton would be quiet if major entitlement trims were a possibility? So, bottom line: maybe Mitch McConnell replaces Harry Reid in the role of man with big title \u2013 Senate majority leader \u2013 but little legislative leeway. Voters get this. Just ask the people working their tails off to make a difference. Christian conservative leaders say when their phone banks call voters, a leading response is: \u201cwhy bother?\u201d To that point, in Colorado Springs last week, evangelical pastor Joe Kirkdendall told me the young Christians in his ministry \u201cdon\u2019t really look to Washington\u201d as a place that solves the things they worry about most. http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/15/politics/king-roadtrip-midterm/ Related: Midterm mile markers - Roadtrip to 2014 A little more than an hour to the north, in suburban Denver\u2019s Adams County, a half dozen Latino voters I chatted with in a neighborhood restaurant had a healthy debate on some issues but all agreed the excitement of voting for President Obama had given way to a sense that every promise to them was certain to be broken. Charlotte Vigil, a volunteer for Democrats in that county, says many voters she calls are \u201cdiscouraged.\u201d Discouraged at dysfunction seems to be the state of the union with two weeks to go until election day. John King's midterm road trip Clinton's 2014 campaign kickoff Control of the Senate: What if? But the truth is, whatever your politics, who wins on election night matters more than you might think. Do you want a Democrat or a Republican as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman if President Obama has one or two Supreme Court picks in the next two years? Do you want significant changes to Obamacare? Who controls the Senate will matter bigtime in those negotiations. Republicans want more money for the Pentagon than the White House does, and if they control both chambers of Congress they would have more leverage in budget talks. More leverage, perhaps, to find that money by trimming Head Start of food stamps. That list \u2013 of where it certainly DOES matter \u2013 is a long one. But most voters don\u2019t see it because what they have witnessed the past several years leaves them convinced \u2013 understandably so \u2013 that Washington would scew up a free lunch. Take Hannah Zahn, a waitress in Winterset, Iowa, who during a visit last week talked so excitedly about casting her first ballot, just 18, in 2012. She\u2019s planning on siting out 2014, because, \u201cI don\u2019t think it really matters. They don\u2019t care about me.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bill Clinton courts black voters in Louisiana this week Ben Carson, \"Tea-vangelicals\" & the Ebola vote Hillary Clinton's Wall Street balancing act in Rhode Island CNN\u2019s John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on \u201cInside Politics\u201d to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. Talk of Bill Clinton\u2019s role in the campaign stretch, where his wife hopes to make a difference, a 2016 GOP buildup and some 2014 observations from the trail made for a lively trip around the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table on Sunday. 1. GOP grass roots sees a growing immigration crisis We thought after the 2012 presidential election that Republicans would see their crisis with Latino voters and find some way to strike an immigration reform compromise with President Obama. It didn\u2019t happen, largely because of pressure from grass-roots conservatives who oppose any path to citizenship for the undocumented and consider even granting legal status tantamount to amnesty. Grassroots immigration anger Well, if you believed perhaps there would be room, and motivation, for a deal after the 2014 midterms \u2013 think again. One striking common theme from a 1,200 -mile drive this past week across Colorado, Kansas, Missouri and Iowa is the visceral reaction of conservatives when immigration comes up \u2013 and often they are the ones to raise it early in any chat about what is driving their politics. Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising to hear this anger at a Colorado tea party meeting, where one speaker warned that Islamist suicide bombers are deliberately infecting themselves with Ebola and coming across the U.S.-Mexican border planning to \u201ccough and spit\u201d on Americans \u201cbefore blowing themselves up.\u201d But talk of a wide-open border being exploited by terrorists also animated four Kansas women during a chat at a senior center in Bob Dole\u2019s hometown of Russell, and came up in conversations with voters in conservative rural Iowa. The bottom line: There appears to be little political space for House Speaker John Boehner and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who could well be majority leader in January, to negotiate any deal that would be acceptable to Obama. And, when the President takes executive actions, as he promises to do after the election unless there is some legislative breakthrough, it is clear the conservative grass roots will demand confrontation \u2013 leaving the issue front and center as we head into the 2016 presidential cycle. 2.  Hillary Clinton\u2019s delicate Wall Street balancing act Hillary Clinton is closing the 2014 campaign with appearances designed to both help Democratic candidates this cycle and also help her test themes for her likely White House run in 2016. Last week it was Kentucky. This week it\u2019s Massachusetts and Rhode Island, to help two Democratic women in close gubernatorial contests. The Rhode Island stop, in particular, has an interesting twist, as detailed by Politico\u2019s Maggie Haberman: \u201cThat\u2019s the one to watch, because Gina Raimondo has been criticized as being too close to Wall Street herself. This has been a commentary applied to Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Haberman. \u201cWatch and see what Hillary Clinton\u2019s words are as she is helping her up there.\u201d 3. Bill Clinton to court African-American voters in Louisiana And while Hillary Clinton is in New England, \u201cBig Dog\u201d Bill Clinton will be in the Big Easy trying to help Democrats rescue a Senate seat that appears to be slipping away. Bill Clinton courts black vote Maeve Reston of the Los Angeles Times added the nickname for the former president and she noted his hope of generating increased turnout among African-Americans. \u201cWhere he can really help her is with black voters in Louisiana,\u201d said Reston. \u201cShe\u2019s going to get virtually all of them, both sides would say, but it\u2019s a matter of getting them to the polls, and Bill Clinton might be able to work his magic down there to help her do that.\u201d Turning out the African-American vote is a top priority for Democrats there and in several other states now, and there could be a sequel if the Louisiana race ends up in a runoff. 4. Up all night on November 4? Maybe a good time to invest in coffee futures? Or book an advance airfare to New Orleans or \u2013 Atlanta? Jonathan Martin of The New York Times rightly points out the likelihood of a late election night because so many Senate races are so close, including an Alaska contest that, in addition to the time zone issue, also includes many remote areas where the count could spill into Wednesday. Even then, he points out the possibility that control of the Senate might not be clear until months after November 4. \u201cI talked to a lot of folks from both parties over the weekend \u2013 increasingly certain that Georgia is in fact going to a runoff,\u201d said Martin. \u201cAnd by the way, that\u2019s a January runoff.\u201d 5. Ben Carson, the \u201cTea-vangelical\u201d vote, Ebola and 2016 Speaking of 2016, keep an eye on Dr. Ben Carson. The conservative favorite is adding staff to his talk of a possible presidential run, Nia Malika Henderson of The Washington Post reports. And supporters looking to encourage a Carson run are raising some serious money. \u201cHe\u2019s got a virtual campaign-in-waiting, a campaign chairman, his super PAC raised $3 million in this last third quarter \u2013 Ready for Hillary was only able to raise $2 million,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cLook for him to challenge Rand Paul and Ted Cruz for that key \u2018Tea-vangelical\u2019 vote. And this Ebola scare certainly gives him something of an opening to flex his medical knowledge during these next couple of days.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican Joni Ernst defends her position to eliminate the EPA for overreach Bruce Braley defends his decision to reverse his support for the Keystone Pipeline Both candidates accused each other of having ties to dark money In the exceedingly tight contest to become Iowa\u2019s next senator, Saturday\u2019s closely watched debate between Bruce Braley and Joni Ernst had the candidates trying to make each other blue by talking green. When it comes to energy, Ernst, a Republican state senator, and Braley, a Democratic congressman, both have controversial positions to defend to voters. Ernst elaborated on her position to shutter the Environmental Protection Agency, a move that critics say will make Iowa more polluted. Braley, meanwhile, explained his flip-flopping on the Keystone Pipeline that has left some Iowans skeptical about his commitment to create jobs. The debate made it clear: Environmental regulation is the issue where the 2014 hopefuls really differ. The states know how to best protect their natural resources, Ernst said, saying that \u201cthe EPA has overreached.\u201d Braley accused his Republican opponent of not wanting to ensure the cleanliness of the country\u2019s air and water. Braley himself was put on the defensive when he was asked why he had switched his position from supporting the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline to opposing it. \u201cWhen the pipeline was first proposed and we were first asked to vote on it, a lot of promises were made about what was going to happen with the oil produced in that pipeline and the jobs it created,\u201d Braley said. \u201cBut the more I looked into it and the more I talked to Iowans, there was no guarantee that the oil produced and sent through that pipeline was going to stay in the United States and benefit U.S. consumers. And there was no guarantee that a lot of jobs would be create for Iowans.\u201d The pipeline, which has yet to receive federal approval, would not run through Iowa, although the Republican Patty of Iowa strongly supports the measure as a part of their platform. At the center of the energy debate, the candidates swapped jabs about another kind of green: special interest dollars. Braley accused Ernst of favoring the interests of the oil industry over those of the alternate energy because she is backed by oil money. Ernst said the EPA overreached when the federal agency sent workers to Iowa to manage the water supply of agriculture producers, and accused Braley of supporting the agency because he is backed by wealthy environmentalists. The two candidates displayed a smaller gap in positions when it came to foreign policy. Both expressed concern over vetting and arming Syrian rebels to fight ISIS there. Ernst and Braley\u2019s parties differ greatly on immigration, but in this Senate race, the difference was a matter of degrees. The Republican said she is opposed to amnesty for undocumented immigrants already in the country but would not vote to repeal an Obama administration program that grants relief to some youths who were brought illegally into the country as children. Braley went a step further, saying that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, as the program is known, is working well for Iowans. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to young people in Iowa who are using it \u2026 and I\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s done to give them hope and opportunities to get a job and make a better future for themselves and their families,\u201d he said. For much of the election, Braley has tried to shake his white collar image, after he made comments suggesting that Sen. Chuck Grassley was merely \u201ca farmer with no law degree.\u201d Ernst capitalized on that gaffe last night. \u201cI am a young woman who grew up on a southwest Iowa farm drinking well water. My father is a farmer, and our farmers are some of the best conservationists out there. \u201c But Braley bit back. \u201cThat\u2019s why my ancestors came from Ireland during the potato family, settled across the river in Cole Valley to start a better life for themselves. Than they moved to Iowa to start a farm. My great-great-grandfather died breaking that prairie.\u201d On debate night, a new Des Moines Register poll showed the candidates in a dead heat. Ernst now leads 47% to 46% over Braley, down from a 6-point lead in their last poll.",

            "article_content": "Obama sounds increasingly pessimistic about Democrats' chances in the midterms Obama: \"We get depressed too easily\" Democratic candidates in races across the country are distancing from Obama At pricey fundraisers \u2013 where there\u2019s plenty of freedom to offer an unvarnished view of the world away from the cameras \u2013 President Barack Obama is sounding increasingly pessimistic about his party\u2019s chances in the midterm elections. At a Thursday fundraiser at the Los Angeles home of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Obama complained Democrats have a \u201ccongenital disease\u201d during midterm cycles, repeating a diagnosis he has used before.  \u201cWe get depressed too easily,\u201d Obama joked. \u201cWe\u2019re terrible at paying attention to midterm elections,\u201d he continued. Obama's celebrity fundraising friends READ: Gwyneth Paltrow to Obama: \u2018You\u2019re so handsome that I can\u2019t speak.\u201d The gloomy mood is understandable. Former top Cabinet secretaries, and even Jimmy Carter, are hammering his policies. Key Democratic candidates are avoiding him, and in at least one case, unwilling to say if she voted for him. Next month\u2019s elections loom at a moment of great hand-wringing for the president\u2019s party.  Understanding full well Obama\u2019s unpopularity is a drag on some Democrats in tight congressional races, White House officials are signaling to party leaders and campaign managers alike there will be no consequences should they run away from the president in order to win. Obama has yet to acknowledge his own weak standing with the public at any of his political events.  Instead, the president appears to blame what he describes as obstructionist Republicans and a polarized, vapid news media. \u201cWe live in such a cynical time, partly because of how the media is now structured,\u201d Obama said at Paltrow\u2019s home.  \u201cWe only listen to folks who feed our biases and our inclinations.  And bad news tends to attract the most attention,\u201d he added. Obama: This is suicide for Republicans Is life lonely in the Oval Office? Michelle campaigning on 22nd anniversary At an earlier event in the day, Obama used stark language to label House Republican refusals to pass immigration reform \u201csuicide.\u201d The president seemed to retool at least part of his midterm pitch, after declaring his policies are \u201con the ballot\u201d in November, a line that his former strategist David Axelrod called a mistake.  In Hollywood, there was a re-write to that declaration. \u201cMy name is not on the ballot,\u201d Obama said in Los Angeles.  \u201cBut our values and our ideals\u2026 are at stake,\u201d he added, avoiding any reference to his \u201cpolicies.\u201d READ: Have Democrats already lost the Senate? Democratic candidates in critical races across the country are scrambling to distance themselves from both Obama and his policies, especially in the south where the president remains deeply unpopular. In Kentucky, Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes refused to answer whether she had ever voted for Obama during an appearance before the Louisville Courier-Journal editorial board Thursday. \u201cYou know, this election isn\u2019t about the president,\u201d Grimes said. \u201cI was actually, in \u201908, a delegate for Hillary Clinton,\u201d she added. As he starts his own midterm push, the president is sticking to friendlier turf.  In California, he made an unannounced stop at the campaign office of Democratic congressional candidate Ted Lieu, a state senator running for the seat vacated by outgoing Rep. Henry Waxman (D) California. \u201cCalifornia is right at the heart of the battle for control of the House,\u201d Obama said to volunteers at Lieu\u2019s call center. \u201cBecause of just the day-to-day work you\u2019re doing, making phone calls, making sure our voters turn out, answering people\u2019s questions about what the issues are, it makes a difference \u2013 that\u2019s how I was able to get elected.\u201d READ: House Dems worry about cash challenge White House officials reject the notion that the president\u2019s mood is grim. Obama\u2019s message at upcoming public campaign events will likely differ in tone and substance from remarks he makes at fundraisers, another official added. Obama will campaign with Connecticut governor Dan Malloy on October 15, White House officials announced Thursday.  Obama\u2019s advisers argue the president still has the ability to excite base Democratic party supporters who were instrumental to his two successful runs for the White House.  Steering clear of Obama, they argue, is also a gamble. \u201cWe\u2019re not bringing him in to suppress voter turnout, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u201d Malloy quipped to the Connecticut Post. As soon as the president steps onto the stage in Connecticut, the president\u2019s rhetoric will be placed under a microscope. \u201cNot a great way to go out of office, angry and blaming the system,\u201d former presidential adviser and CNN political analyst David Gergen said.  \u201cMy sense of it is he\u2019s on an emotional roller coaster,\u201d Gergen added. Once the midterms are over, Gergen suggested a reshuffling of top White House staff to buoy the president\u2019s prospects for his final years in office. \u201cIf he shook it up a little bit, that would help,\u201d Gergen said.

            "article_content": "The White House is reportedly considering ways to close Guantanamo Bay. Sen. Pat Roberts says he'll \"shut down the Senate\" if President Obama makes such a move. House Speaker John Boehner said Obama is willing to \"unilaterally rewrite the law\". Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts is threatening to \u201cshut down the Senate\u201d with a Ted Cruz-style filibuster if President Barack Obama tries to thwart the congressional ban on moving Guantanamo Bay detainees into U.S. prisons. \u201cI stopped him once from trying to send the Gitmo terrorists to Leavenworth\u201d prison in Kansas, Roberts said during an event in Topeka, according to Roll Call. \u201cI shall do it again, I shall do it again and if he tries it I will shut down the Senate.\u201d The White House denied a Wall Street Journal report that it is considering ways to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, which could lead to detainees being transferred into the continental United States. Moazzam Begg: I wanted my day in court Kansas incumbent faces fierce challenge Tapes could prove Gitmo inhuman treatment Despite the denial, Republicans were outraged by what they said is another attempt to sidestep Congress. Roberts, faced with a tough re-election race, said he thinks other Republicans would be with him. \u201cTed Cruz did it with regards to Obamacare, if necessary I\u2019ll do it for terrorists,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could do 21 hours \u2013 maybe 22 or 23. But I will have help on this. I can see John McCain there, and I can see Lindsey Graham there, and I can see Kelly Ayotte there, and I can see a whole bunch of other people there.\u201d Other Republicans also pounced on the report. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Obama is willing to \u201cunilaterally rewrite the law\u201d because he is \u201cso eager to bring these terrorists\u201d into the country. \u201cNot only is this scheme dangerous, it is yet another example of what will be this administration\u2019s legacy of lawlessness,\u201d he said. Boehner also quickly sought to parlay the report into an advantage for Republicans in the Nov. 4 midterm elections, saying that \u201ceach and every Democrat should make their position known\u201d and pledging that the House GOP would oppose any effort to keep detainees housed in Guantanamo Bay out of the United States. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Friday morning report highlights another area where Obama could turn to executive action after seeing his initiatives thwarted in Congress. Already, the president has signed orders to raise the minimum wage and impose anti-discrimination rules for federal workers and contractors. He has also said he plans to announce an immigration overhaul after the midterm elections. In response, House Republicans have sought to sue the president, arguing that he is overstepping his authority. Obama\u2019s options could include vetoing an annual bill setting military policy, which since 2010 has included the ban on transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees into the United States, or he could attach a signing statement saying he considers that restriction an infringement on his executive power, the Wall Street Journal reported. However, the White House denied the report that similar action is in the works on Guantanamo Bay. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the White House doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhat new press reports are referring to when they say the administration is \u2018drafting options\u2019 intended to \u2018override a congressional ban.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt remains true that we continue to object to congressional restrictions, as we\u2019ve said many times,\u201d she said. \u201cTo the greatest extent possible and consistent with our national security interests, detainees will be repatriated or resettled, or prosecuted in federal courts or military commission proceedings,\u201d Hayden said. There are now 149 detainees housed within the Guantanamo Bay facility. More than half have reportedly been approved for transfer, and some could be shipped to other countries. The possibility of transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees into the United States could be a dangerous one for Democrats. A Gallup poll in June found that 66 percent of Americans oppose moving those detainees into U.S. prisons, while just 29 percent support doing so.

            "article_content": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is endorsing Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts Roberts is trailing independent candidate Greg Orman in the key race Embattled Republican Sen. Pat Roberts added to his cavalry of endorsements Monday, receiving the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Roberts, a conservative three-term senator, is in an unusually tough race in deep-red Kansas with independent businessman Greg Orman, whom Roberts attacked hard about what he\u2019s calling questionable business dealings with Rajat Gupta, a former Wall Street executive convicted of insider trading. \u201cHe isn\u2019t honest about his liberal ideology, and he isn\u2019t coming clear about his business record,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cMr. Orman is using his business record as a sole qualification for his candidacy, but the truth is Mr. Orman built his business career working with one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest criminals, avoiding taxes, and laying off hard-working Americans.\u201d Roberts\u2019 low poll numbers have garnered national attention in a year Republicans could win a Senate majority. It\u2019s been over 80 years since Kansas elected a non-Republican senator, and party members don\u2019t want the Sunflower state to be the reason they remain in the minority during the next Congress. The Chamber of Commerce endorsement is critical for Republicans who represent themselves as business allies. The organization typically shows support for Republican candidates, which could include ads and other financial support. \u201cWe\u2019re all in for Senator Roberts. Period,\u201d Rob Engstrom, a senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re going to clearly point out where Mr. Orman and his liberal record with his liberal allies stands on the issues. And once Kansas voters hear that and believe that and know that, Senator Roberts will win.\u201d Republican Party members from all spectrums concerned about winning a majority have also come to Kansas to campaign with the senator. Bob Dole, a former GOP presidential candidate, Senate majority leader, and member of the Kansas congressional delegation, campaigned for Roberts last month, as did other establishment party members including former former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney will be in Kansas later this month, Roberts said. Tea party supporters also have given Roberts the support he\u2019ll need to win in November, even after their preferred candidate, Dr. Milton Wolf, lost to him in the primary earlier this year. Sarah Palin has already stumped for Roberts, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas will kick off a statewide bus tour campaign this Friday. Asked why Orman\u2019s business experience and position in favor of immigration reform like the Chamber\u2019s didn\u2019t qualify him for the endorsement, Engstorm said, \u201cI would argue there are very few positions where we share a common view. Dodd-Frank, American energy exploration, cap-and-trade, Obamacare. He\u2019s either on the wrong side or won\u2019t say where he stands.\u201d Engstrom didn\u2019t mince words to show his support for Roberts\u2019 business record. \u201cThis is the senator \u2013 this is the man \u2013 who is pushing back against Obama and Harry Reid, and Mr. Orman is not. He\u2019s absent,\u201d he said. Orman didn\u2019t return the candidate questionnaire used to decide endorsements within the organization that represents over 300,000 members, Engstrom noted. Roberts isn\u2019t the only Republican having trouble in the polls this year in Kansas. Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s re-election is also in question. Asked by CNN whether Brownback is dragging down his campaign, Roberts replied, \u201cI will let Governor Brownback speak for himself, but I think \u2013 I think he\u2019s coming back.\u201d",

Lindsey Graham fuels speculation on a potential 2016 presidential bid. Graham says Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) \"not quite ready\" to be president in a Weekly Standard interview. The field of potential Republican presidential candidates in 2016 might have just gained one more name: Sen. Lindsey Graham. Known for his hawkish foreign policy approach, the South Carolina Republican told the Weekly Standard in a story published Friday that he\u2019ll enter the race if he thinks he\u2019s the most competent messenger for a more aggressive foreign policy approach. \u201cIf I get through my general election, if nobody steps up in the presidential mix, if nobody\u2019s out there talking \u2014 \u200bme and McCain have been talking \u2014 \u200bI may just jump in to get to make these arguments,\u201d Graham told the Weekly Standard. Is ISIS an immediate threat to the U.S.? Sen. Graham: Time is now to act in Iraq Graham: 'Politics is war in another form' Graham has called for airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to fight terrorism, a position that aligns well with some 69 percent of Republicans who identify themselves as \u201chawks\u201d according to a CNN/ORC poll last week. The senator, who maintains an 18-point lead over his Democratic opponent in his campaign for a third term, emerged as a vocal critic of the White House in 2012 when four Americans were killed in an attack at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. When it comes to one other possible 2016 hopeful, Sen. Marco Rubio, Graham says the Florida Republican\u2019s relative inexperience could be a disqualifier. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy, but after doing immigration with him \u2014 we don\u2019t need another young guy not quite ready,\u201d Graham said in the Weekly Standard interview. \u201cHe\u2019s no Obama by any means, but he\u2019s so afraid of the right, and I\u2019ve let that go.\u201d Though a presidential bid for Graham, 59, is likely a long shot, he\u2019s earned accolades from McCain if he were to throw his hat in the ring. \u201cI\u2019ve strongly encouraged him to give it a look,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI think Lindsey has vast and deep experience on these issues that very few others have.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Obama pledged to take action on immigration reform by the end of the year. Obama was interrupted by an undocumented immigrant activist. Obama listed accomplishments that he said have specifically benefited Latinos in the U.S. President Barack Obama told Hispanic leaders and immigration reform activists Thursday that despite frustrations with the delays in fixing the country\u2019s immigration system, he\u2019s going to need them to have his back. After punting on taking executive action on immigration until after the midterms, Obama pledged Thursday evening at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute that he will act on immigration before the end of the year. \u201cThe moment I act \u2013 and it will be taking place between the November election and the end of the year \u2013 opponents of reform will roll out the same old scare tactics,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd when opponents are out there saying who knows what, I\u2019m going to need you to have my back.\u201d Obama was interrupted by one heckler that The Hill newspaper identified as Blanca Hernandez, an undocumented immigrant activist, who shouted \u201cwe need relief now\u201d and was escorted out by security. Obama defers action on immigration President delays immigration action Latinos 'really pissed off' with the GOP Obama emphasized Thursday that he can\u2019t accomplish real, long-term change without what he called the \u201cpowerful\u201d Latino vote. \u201cSi se puede, si votamos. Yes we can, if we vote,\u201d Obama told the crowd to applause. That rallying call, reminiscent of his 2008 campaign slogan, piles on top of Democratic efforts to mobilize lackluster Latinos who appear less likely to support Democrats in November despite strong backing in recent cycles, according to the Washington Post. \u201cNothing I can do will be as comprehensive or lasting as the Senate bill.  Anything I can do can be reversed by the next President,\u201d Obama said. While Obama pushed back his plans for executive action this summer and a bipartisan Senate bill on immigration reform last year failed to pick up steam in the House, Obama insisted that his administration has done a lot to benefit Latinos in his nearly six years in office. Obama rattled off a list of campaign promises that he said he has kept: from confronting \u201cthe crisis of overcrowded classrooms and underfunded schools\u201d to fixing the \u201cbroken health care system that left one out of three Hispanics uninsured.\u201d \u201cThe progress we\u2019ve made has been hard. Sometimes it\u2019s been slower than we want, but that progress has been steady and it has been real. We have big things together and we\u2019re going to do more,\u201d Obama said. And fixing immigration reform falls under that category of \u201cmore.\u201d \u201cFixing our broken immigration system is one more big thing that we have to do and that we will do,\u201d Obama said.",

I want to talk about the things we\u2019re for,\u201d Reince Priebus said Thursday at George Washington University. The speech was part of the Republican Party\u2019s rebranding effort following its 2012 presidential election loss, in which GOP nominee Mitt Romney lost to President Obama in large part because of his weak standing with minorities, young voters and women. Priebus was critical of the way the party operated nationally in the past, saying the GOP had simply become a \u201cU-haul trailer of cash for a presidential nominee\u201d once every four years \u2013 an approach he called a \u201closer strategy.\u201d He stressed that the party needs to be \u201cobsessed over the mechanics\u201d of voter outreach efforts, especially in the data and digital fields. \u201cWe also have become a midterm party that doesn\u2019t lose and presidential party that doesn\u2019t win,\u201d he said, attributing the pattern to a lack of voter engagement and on-the-ground work. \u201cThere\u2019s something that goes on in presidential elections that we have to get our act together and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d he continued. He ticked off 11 topics that he said are \u201cdriving the Republican Party\u201d \u2013 a policy list that included health care, the economy, national security, and immigration. Priebus named a number of Republican lawmakers in Washington and governors who have proposed or enacted legislation that would address poverty, education and energy. Among them were Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and House Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference. \u201cOne election won\u2019t fix everything, but we can take a step in the right direction this November,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the American people hire us, we\u2019ll be ready on day one.\u201d The Democratic National Committee, which had staffers at the speech, knocked Priebus\u2019 remarks as simply recycled material. \u201cReince Priebus just wrapped up his third rebrand speech for the GOP (not to be confused with his earlier rebrand speech or the one before that) but all we heard was the same old rhetoric that is out of step with reality,\u201d the DNC said in an email blast.\u200b CNN\u2019s Mark Preston contributed to this report",

Even out of office, DeMint keeps counsel with a small but loyal network of Republican donors in South Carolina, an influential collection of business leaders and former state GOP chairmen who have relationships across the state\u2019s political spectrum. During the 2012 presidential race, the DeMint donors flirted with endorsing a presidential candidate and invited the cast of Republican contenders to a quasi-debate, the \u201cPalmetto Freedom Forum,\u201d in Columbia. Despite the attention showered upon him, DeMint ultimately stayed neutral in that primary. His allies, meanwhile, splintered among various campaigns. This time around, Marco Rubio is hoping to make an early good impression. The Florida senator, whose rise in the tea party-fueled 2010 election was due, in part, to DeMint\u2019s early endorsement, has quietly arranged to headline a private fundraiser in Greenville next month for the group\u2019s think tank, the Palmetto Policy Forum, a Republican source familiar with the plans told CNN. Hambycast: Branstad\u2019s mustachioed superstition exposed The pending visit makes him the first likely Republican contender to come knocking on the DeMint crew\u2019s door. Details of the event have yet to be sorted out, but it will take place on October 22, just a day before Rubio mentor Jeb Bush, another possible 2016 candidate from Florida, will host a re-election fundraiser in Columbia for Gov. Nikki Haley. Rubio is also planning to attend a grassroots fund-raiser for the South Carolina Republican Party in Columbia alongside Sen. Tim Scott, the man who replaced DeMint in the Senate. With a team of political advisers that includes Terry Sullivan, a strategist who labored in the trenches of South Carolina politics for over a decade, Rubio has started to put in serious facetime with the state\u2019s conservative community as he builds a case for the Republican nomination in 2016. Rubio was last in the state in August, when he tangled with a group of \u201cDREAMers\u201d who crashed a conservative barbecue in Anderson and loudly criticized the senator for turning his back on a comprehensive immigration reform bill. On that same trip, he held court with a group of social conservative leaders at the Greenville home of Lisa van Riper, the president of South Carolina Citizens For Life. He also met privately with officials from Bob Jones University.",

Some members, including Republicans, want Boehner to call the House back into session before the mid-term election to vote on a new authorization. Florida GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen told MSNBC Thursday that it\u2019s time for Congress to return to Washington and take up new legislation focused on the fight against ISIS. \u201cWe are shirking our responsibility by not voting on this,\u201d she said. Pentagon spokesman on fighting ISIS: \u2018I think we are in this for a matter of years\u2019 But Boehner, who is on a campaign swing for GOP candidates in New England this week, made it clear he has no plans to do so. The House speaker did tell the Times \u2013 as he said before Congress left for the final stretch before the November mid-term elections \u2013 that he believes it\u2019s important for Congress to \u201cspeak\u201d on the issue.  But he insisted it\u2019s up to the White House to draft and send new language to Capitol Hill. \u201cI would suggest to you that early next year, assuming that we continue in this effort, there may be that discussion and there may be that request from the President,\u201d Boehner said. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, who could become majority leader if Republicans win control of the Senate in November, didn\u2019t have a comment about Boehner\u2019s remarks. But his spokesman Don Stewart told CNN that McConnell \u201chas said multiple times that the President should present us with a plan and we can vote on that and if it\u2019s a good plan it will have bipartisan support.\u201d CNN Senior Congressional Producer Ted Barrett contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "U.S. and Iranian leaders to meet at UNGA? Time will tell Clinton grandbaby watch 2014 Chamber of Commerce betting on Brown A \u201cgrand\u201d moment for the Clintons, a spotlight on Elizabeth Warren, more muted White House expectations about Iran, and stretch-run GOP calculations filled our weekly trip around the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table. 1. TWO EVENTS, ONE CONTRAST: CLINTON VS. WARREN Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren are featured in high-profile events happening at the same time Monday \u2013 both in New York City. Will women save the Democratic Senate? Most difficult president of last 40 years Maeve Reston of The Los Angeles Times reminds us it is a great opportunity for those who like to compare and contrast the agendas and approaches of the Democratic Party\u2019s leading women. \u201cObviously, a lot of people on the left would like to see Elizabeth Warren run,\u201d says Reston. \u201cBut she\u2019s been out there on the trail doing a lot more for Democratic candidates so far than Hillary Clinton, who\u2019s been really focused on her own agenda,\u201d Reston adds. \u201cSo it will be interesting to watch that contrast and whether Hillary, who will be doing more Democratic events, (is) building up a little resentment there by not getting out on the trail.\u201d The Clinton event is part of the Clinton Global Initiative\u2019s focus on women and girls. Sen. Warren is headlining a big EMILY\u2019S LIST fund-raiser. 2. IF FOR SOME REASON HILLARY\u2019S EVENT DOESN\u2019T HAPPEN\u2026 Yes, there is work for the Clinton Global Initiative. And events to help Democrats gin up women\u2019s turnout in the midterms. But the most important upcoming event in Clintonland is the arrival of daughter Chelsea Clinton\u2019s baby \u2013 the first grandchild for Bill and Hillary Clinton. And Politico\u2019s Maggie Haberman tells us the \u201cbaby watch\u201d is both a personal and political turning point for the likely 2016 Democratic front-runner. \u201cThe Clintons have not said when (their) daughter, Chelsea Clinton, is due with (their) first grandchild \u2026 but it is believed to be within the next few weeks,\u201d says Haberman. \u201cHillary Clinton has said this is the thing that will impact, to some extent, anyway, her thinking about running for president, and so we are now entering that window. She says she\u2019s going to see what being a grandmother feels like.\u201d 3. A BET ON SCOTT BROWN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a big player in this year\u2019s GOP Super PAC spending, is making a big bet on Scott Brown and the New Hampshire Senate race. Fresh from a new research effort in the Granite State, the Chamber is convinced that the race, a dead heat entering the final six weeks, can be swayed by aggressively linking incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen to President Barack Obama. Watch for a tough new ad this week making the case that she has supported the President more than 90% of the time. The latest CNN poll put the President\u2019s approval rating in New Hampshire at 35%. Looking to make a splash, the Chamber is buying time in the more expensive Boston TV market in addition to New Hampshire outlets. Immigration battle in the lame duck? 4. A LAME-DUCK FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION? Congress is gone until after the midterm vote, and GOP leaders are breathing sighs of relief because there were no last-minute surprises that might have hurt the party\u2019s election efforts. Well, Robert Costa of The Washington Post reports, that\u2019s no accident. But his conversations with key tea party leaders suggest there might well be some fireworks in the so-called \u201clame duck\u201d session scheduled for after the election. \u201cThey\u2019re already planning to fight the president if he moves forward on executive action on immigration,\u201d explains Costa. \u201cIn fact, (Republican Congressman) Steve King (from Iowa) told me that he\u2019s prepared to tie government funding in December to blocking any potential executive action. So we could have another showdown on the horizon if that happens.\u201d Obama to meet with Iranians? 5. U.S. and IRANIAN LEADERS AT U.N., BUT LOW EXPECTATIONS It almost happened last year: a meeting between the leaders of the United Sates and Iran. And you could argue there is more urgency this year, given the potential for Iran to shape the fight against ISIS. But Julie Pace of The Associated Press reports that the Obama White House is going to great lengths to note grievances with Iran as it lowers expectations for any dramatic diplomatic moment as both President Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani attend United Nations events this week. \u201cNuclear talks with Iran are deadlocked, there\u2019s a lot of tension over whether the U.S. and Iran will work together to fight the Islamic State, and most importantly, White House officials are absolutely furious with Iran for detaining a Washington Post reporter and his wife,\u201d says Pace. \u201cAnd the takeaway for the White House has been that while Rouhani and his colleagues may talk more moderately than some of their predecessors, a lot of the actions haven\u2019t changed and there\u2019s not a sense that having a meeting would be productive at this point.\u201d Clinton\u2019s fall to-do list",

            "article_content": "Congress leaves D.C. to campaign full-time, with no vote yet on ISIS Republicans Democrats for not vote, Democrats blame Republicans Some members of Congress are openly appalled that their colleagues left town The smell of exhaust from idling cars fills up the Capitol parking lot. Congressional aides have their engines revved \u2013 ready to whisk their bosses to train stations and airports as soon as they cast their last vote. It\u2019s a familiar scene when Congress is getting ready to leave town, especially for an extended period. But this time the race for a six-week respite feels different. There is bipartisan consensus that the United States is now at war with ISIS and that Congress should be a part of the decision-making process on how to deal with that, by passing a new authorization for military force. Bill Clinton: U.S. has proven it can\u2019t win an Iraq land war without Iraqis Paul's false charge against McCain Corker: Obama's ISIS strategy not serious Can ISIS be beat without combat troops? But Congress took off to go campaign full time to try to keep their jobs rather than staying to do their jobs. \u201cThere is broad agreement in the country that this ISIS group is a threat,\u201d Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pennsylvania, told CNN. \u201cSo why not stay and debate it and not go home if your constituents believe it\u2019s a threat?\u201d we asked. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree,\u201d Fattah replied. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to vote yes. So I\u2019m not ducking any vote.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colorado, said a few minutes later. \u201cAs if there is not enough to do and it\u2019s not just the war issues, it\u2019s immigration reform, ENDA (Employment Nondiscrimination Act) \u2013 it\u2019s a number of different bills that have been filed that have bipartisan support,\u201d Polis said. It is true that rank-and-file House members, especially those like Fattah and Polis who are in the minority party, don\u2019t have much choice but to follow the schedule leaders lay out. Still, as we weaved through the slew of waiting cars to talk to lawmakers before they left, it was striking \u2013 but not surprising \u2013 the way blame was tossed around. Republicans blamed the Democrat-controlled Senate. W.H. defends plan to arm Syrian rebels A wary Congress votes to combat ISIS General doesn't rule out ground forces \u201cThe problem is that we have a do-nothing Senate,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said. Republicans also blamed the president. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-North Carolina, said he\u2019d be glad to vote for a new use-of-force authorization against ISIS. \u201cI wish the President would ask for one,\u201d Hudson said. Obama: ISIS threat against U.S., allies \u2018doesn\u2019t frighten us\u2019 Democrats noted that leaving now has become a tradition to help the House, where Republicans are a majority. \u201cThe House of Representatives runs every two years, and for many, many years the House has adjourned for the month of October.\u201d Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri said. Some senators were openly appalled that colleagues were heading home. Freshman Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Nebraska, had publicly urged her colleagues to stay, to no avail. Brazile: Congress should debate on ISIS Congress to consider Syria strategy Obama: No ground troops to combat ISIS \u201cWe need to be here we need to debate this issue,\u201d Fischer told us. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is on the ballot in November, but hers is a safe seat. Going home to campaign is not her first priority. \u201cMy job is to be in the Capitol working for the people of Maine and the American people and that\u2019s where I think we all belong now,\u201d said Collins, standing in the Capitol parking lot, pointing to the dome. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who won his big primary fight earlier this year and should face an easy reelection in November, had a trademark pithy synopsis. \u201cWe seem to be more worried about who runs the place than how the place runs,\u201d he said. Ultimately, all the lawmakers who complained and called it important to stay got in their cars and left, too. There\u2019s no reason to stay \u2013 there are no more votes until after the election.

You haven\u2019t spent much time in Kentucky lately. The bitter, expensive brawl over Mitch McConnell\u2019s Senate seat took an even uglier turn on Thursday, as spokeswomen for McConnell and Alison Lundergan Grimes traded shots over a new Grimes Medicare attack ad featuring a story about a stroke suffered by the Democrat\u2019s now-deceased grandfather. \u201cIt\u2019s a touching family story about a familiar circumstance to many Kentucky families followed by a totally debunked partisan attack on Senator McConnell from an increasingly desperate Alison Grimes,\u201d said McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore. \u201cAnyone who would use their grandfather\u2019s stroke to reintroduce an attack that received the triple crown of fact check false ratings has run out of justification for their candidacy.\u201d Grimes spokeswoman Charly Norton was not amused. \u201cIn a new low even for him, it is repulsive that Mitch McConnell is attacking Alison\u2019s deceased grandfather,\u201d she declared. The ad in question, which comes on the heels of a new McConnell ad blasting Grimes for supporting President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, shows Grimes\u2019s grandmother discussing the family\u2019s struggles in the wake of her husband\u2019s stroke. \u201cOur life became something else,\u201d her grandmother says. \u201cNo more vacations. No retirement. Just existing.\u201d \u201cThis is why we have to strengthen Medicare,\u201d Grimes then says. \u201cSenator McConnell\u2019s voted over and over again to raise seniors\u2019 Medicare costs. I\u2019ll never do that.\u201d CNN Poll: McConnell holds slim edge in biggest Senate race of 2014 McConnell has cried foul over Grimes\u2019s repeated Medicare attacks, but Grimes hasn\u2019t let up on a potential winning issue for Democrats swimming against the tide in red states this year. The ugliness in Kentucky doesn\u2019t stop with Medicare and grandparents. In recent days, the two sides have also exchanged barbs over immigration and guns, issues considered likely to jack up turnout in the November midterm election. McConnell hits back against Grimes\u2019 skeet-shooting ad McConnell\u2019s seat is one of only two or three Republican seats (see Georgia and Kansas) considered vulnerable in what is generally expected to be a good year for the GOP. Republicans need a net gain of six Senate seats in November to win control of the chamber. If they can pull that off while beating back Grimes\u2019s challenge, McConnell becomes the next Senate Majority Leader. With so much at stake in the Bluegrass State, it\u2019s a safe bet this campaign\u2019s tone won\u2019t improve anytime soon.",

            "article_content": "Outsiders vs. insiders is the dominant story line in GOP primaries so far After knocking off Eric Cantor, insurgents thought they had a sure win in Mississippi Two more Republican Senate incumbents face challengers but hold lead in polls Establishment Republicans fear a tilt too far right may hurt party in November Call it a brief intermission: There\u2019s a three-week break in the action after a slew of primaries in May and June and a couple big headlines. The major story line so far this election cycle is the ongoing battle that pits mainstream Republicans against tea party groups and anti-establishment organizations. After a few high-profile tea party victories in late May and early June put to bed premature stories of the death of the 5-year-old grass-roots conservative movement, incumbents and establishment candidates ran the table in last week\u2019s contests. Complete coverage: 2014 midterm elections The calendar ahead doesn\u2019t look as promising for outsiders looking to knock off another incumbent in the remaining primaries in the 18 states yet to vote. McDaniel: Miss. election not fair Ex-treasury secretary on GOP Tea party rival refuses to concede Cochran win touches racial nerve \u201cThe primaries produced only a few fights between the tea party and the establishment wing of the GOP because many congressional Republicans took their primaries seriously and kept their votes consistently conservative,\u201d GOP consultant Ron Bonjean told CNN. \u201cThe few primary battles we saw produced victories based on combinations of intensity, fund-raising and motivating voters one way or another,\u201d said Bonjean, who has been a top strategist and adviser to House and Senate Republican leaders. The resounding defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in his congressional primary in Virginia to a little-known and underfunded anti-establishment candidate rocked the GOP.  But two weeks later, the tea party lost out on a golden opportunity to oust a sitting GOP lawmaker when Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi edged out state Sen. Chris McDaniel in a primary runoff. McDaniel, who enjoyed strong support from tea party and anti-establishment groups, narrowly edged out Cochran in the June 3 primary, but with neither man cracking 50% (there was a third Republican candidate on the ballot who grabbed 1.5% of the vote), the contest moved to last week\u2019s runoff, which Cochran won by fewer than 7,000 votes. Would Cochran\u2019s strategy work elsewhere? The senator\u2019s victory was aided by votes from African-American Democrats, who were courted during the runoff campaign by pro-Cochran forces. But McDaniel alleges his team has found voting irregularities and is not conceding. \u201cInterpreting the Cochran win as some kind of \u2018Empire Strikes Back\u2019 moment is an overreach,\u201d Republican communications strategist Keith Appell told CNN. \u201cRepublican leaders and their establishment backers dodged a bullet in Mississippi, but there is still a deep and active discontent among the grass roots, and it will only continue to manifest until the leadership reconnects with its base. Anyone who seriously thinks otherwise is delusional,\u201d said Appell, a senior vice president at CRC Public Relations, a Washington public relations firm that has had many conservative clients. Some victories but a lot of defeats Anti-establishment forces have scored some victories this season. They knocked off another GOP incumbent, 91-year-old Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas, who lost his congressional primary runoff last month to a tea party-backed candidate. And in May, tea party-backed Ben Sasse came out on top in Nebraska\u2019s GOP Senate primary. The same night conservative Alex Mooney, who was supported by anti-establishment groups, won the GOP contest in West Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. But those were the major highlights for the tea party in a year when mainstream Republicans have enjoyed most of the victories. Primary challenges from the right shook up the Republican Party in the last two election cycles. But they have also hurt the party\u2019s chances of winning back control of the Senate from Democrats, effectively costing the GOP five potentially winnable elections since 2010. How did Cochran win runoff? Tea party leader in election scandal dies Inside Mississippi Senate runoff Obama: I want to say what's on my mind So what\u2019s happening this cycle? \u201cEstablishment Republicans and incumbents have learned to run against tea party-backed candidates,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, a top campaign handicapper. And outside help is making a difference. \u201cI think the Republican establishment is fighting back more than in previous cycles. There is more organization and involvement from outside groups in some of these primaries,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cI think in the past it was too often an incumbent running against an anti-establishment challenger and a host of outside groups,\u201d Inside Politics: The Chamber of Commerce\u2019s next target The battles ahead Anti-establishment forces still have an outside chance to score an upset in Tennessee and Kansas in early August. \u201cFor those folks who are looking to knock off a Republican senator in a primary this cycle, the opportunities are down to Tennessee and Kansas,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cThere is still some time for those races to develop, but they will both take work to get the challenger campaigns to the same level as Chris McDaniel in Mississippi.\u201d Two-term Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is an inviting target. He\u2019s known as a lawmaker willing to work with Democrats to broker bipartisan deals. He\u2019s facing off against a bunch of primary challengers. The one with the best shot of toppling Alexander appears to be state lawmaker Joe Carr. \u201cMake no mistake about it \u2013 the fight that Chris McDaniel started in Mississippi will continue here in Tennessee,\u201d Carr said after the Mississippi runoff. But unlike McDaniel, polls indicate Carr\u2019s the distinct underdog to Alexander. In Kansas, Sen. Pat Roberts is seeking a fourth term in office. Milton Wolf \u2013 a second cousin (once removed) of President Barack Obama \u2013 touts himself as a conservative activist with the guts to stand up to the GOP establishment. Wolf\u2019s campaign has tried to portray Roberts as more about Washington than Kansas, pointing to reports this year that the senator listed his voting address at the home of two longtime political supporters who rent out a room to him. Roberts owns a rental property in his hometown of Dodge City and a home in the Washington suburbs, where he spends much of his time. But Wolf, a radiologist, came under attack over old Facebook postings in which he exposed private patient X-rays and other personal information \u2013 poking fun at the dead or wounded. Wolf was forced to admit he made \u201cinsensitive\u201d comments. Like Carr, polls indicate Wolf trails far behind Roberts. But Sal Russo, chief strategist for the Tea Party Express, a national tea party group that backs Wolf, told CNN that the challenger is \u201cable to bring a lot of excitement and enthusiasm among the grass roots. And that\u2019s the problem Roberts has. He lives in Washington. He\u2019s pretty much out of touch with the people of Kansas. So I think that that frustration with Washington has manifested itself in growing support for Milton Wolf.\u201d Winning by losing? The next high-profile primary is Georgia\u2019s GOP Senate runoff on July 22, but the tea party doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a factor there. Businessman David Perdue and Rep. Jack Kingston advanced to a runoff, but the three more conservative candidates didn\u2019t. But regardless of the outcome of the primary contests, tea party leaders said they\u2019ve changed the conversation in Washington. \u201cThe tea party is winning by losing in the sense that you don\u2019t see any Republicans saying, \u2018Let\u2019s pass immigration reform that gives a path to citizenship. Let\u2019s make it easier for the President to raise the debt ceiling.\u2019 Almost all Republicans have shifted right,\u201d said John King, CNN\u2019s chief national correspondent. Another strategist said this year\u2019s contests aren\u2019t the final chapter in the struggle between the grass roots and the establishment. \u201cThe party remains deeply divided, and both sides have the resources and commitment needed to take the fight into 2015 and 2016,\u201d wrote Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cThe war is likely to get messier and the division more consequential before the two sides look for ways to bridge their differences. That should please Democrats.\u201d What does that mean for November? The candidates who emerge from this year\u2019s primaries could have an immediate impact come November. Democrats have a 55-45 majority in the Senate (53 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the party). But in the midterm elections, the party is defending 21 of the 36 seats up for grabs, with half of those Democratic-held seats in red or purple states. In the House, the Democrats need to pick up a challenging 17 Republican-held seats to win back the majority from the GOP. \u201cWe learned that Republicans across the board have picked highly electable candidates and have improved their chances of taking over the Senate,\u201d said Bonjean, the GOP consultant. But Democrats disagree, and say that even though mainstream Republicans are winning in the primaries, those candidates are moving further to the right to secure victories, which will likely hurt them when they face a more moderate general election electorate in November.",

Along with foreign policy, he outlined major problems he sees with Obama\u2019s policies on the economy and education. Still, Romney encouraged the audience to \u201csupport\u201d the President as he takes his next steps in fighting the militant group in Iraq and Syria.

Christie\u2019s birthday bash with Romney had all the appearances of a potential campaign rally in 2016, that is if Christie runs for President: \u2013 A highly complimentary introduction of Christie by the most recent GOP nominee. \u2013 An excited audience with phones jutted in the air, taking photos. \u2013 A giant American flag as the backdrop. \u2013 Both wives on stage. \u2013 And of course, blistering critiques of Obama. The New Jersey Republican Party hosted the fundraiser that was billed as an event to celebrate Christie\u2019s 52nd birthday, which was on Saturday. While they sang each others\u2019 praises Wednesday night, it was less than two years ago when many of Romney\u2019s supporters were saying that Christie cost Romney the election. They were were furious with Christie after he embraced Obama when the President came to survey Superstorm Sandy damage in New Jersey \u2013 just a few days before Election Day. Critics argued that Christie\u2019s warm reception of Obama gave the President some bipartisan sway. In interviews after the election, however, Romney never blamed Christie, nor did he say there was bad blood between the two. And he has frequently mentioned Christie on his list of potential 2016 Republican candidates. \u201cThis is a guy who cares about the people in this great state, he cares about the poor, he cares about the middle class. He cares about getting good jobs,\u201d Romney said Wednesday, introducing Christie. \u201cThis is a guy who fights for the things he believes in.\u201d The love fest continued when Christie was at the podium. \u201cWouldn\u2019t our country be a hell of a better place if this man were the President of the United States?\u201d Christie roared. Christie: I won\u2019t state position on immigration unless I run for president Would Hillary Clinton top Chris Christie in New Jersey?",

            "article_content": "Poll reflects significant challenges for Democrats trying to keep Senate majority 65% of poll respondents call the current Congress the worst in their lifetime Voter enthusiasm is down, which could be caused by dissatisfaction with Congress Eight weeks before the midterm elections, a new CNN/ORC International poll shows that voters in key geographic regions favor Republican candidates heading into November, highlighting significant challenges for Democrats trying to protect half a dozen vulnerable Senate seats and ultimately control of the chamber. Equally concerning for Democrats is that the GOP has a 15-point advantage with independent voters on the generic ballot, and Republicans have an edge at this point in supporter enthusiasm. While Republicans are all but assured of maintaining a healthy majority in the House, the GOP needs a net gain of six seats to control the Senate and its committees that oversee the Obama administration. Should the GOP control Capitol Hill next year, it would be positioned to direct the legislative agenda and influence President Barack Obama\u2019s final two years in office. Harman: Time for Obama to turn crisis into opportunity Will Obama approval rates drive midterms? Congress wants a say in ISIS strategy Obama defers action on immigration Because of this, Democrats are desperately trying to protect at least five incumbents in Southern or heavily rural states such as Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, and North Carolina as well as an open seat in Iowa. Most of these races are considered tossups or the GOP has a slight advantage, according to state polling and analysis by independent political handicappers. Meanwhile, there is widespread belief that three other open Democratic seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia have already been lost to Republicans \u2013 putting the GOP within striking distance of the net gain of six seats needed to take the Senate majority. Lawmakers urge Obama to work with Congress on immigration Assuming Republicans maintain control of the House \u2014 Americans are split over which party should have control of the Senate with 46% supporting a Democratic majority and 42% backing GOP control. It is a different story in the South where a majority of voters, 51%, seek a GOP controlled Senate next year, perhaps making life difficult for Democratic incumbents in Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina. At the same time rural voters also want to see a GOP-controlled Senate by a 48%-37% margin that could have significant implications for Democrats in Alaska and Colorado. 5 key midterm races to watch Overall, Americans are angry with Capitol Hill, as a whole, with a whopping 83% saying they disapprove of how Congress is handling its job, while 65% describe it as the \u201cworst Congress of their lifetime.\u201d The current approval rating for Congress is 14%, just four points higher than the all-time low of 10% in a September 2013 CNN/ORC Poll. This might explain why voter enthusiasm has dropped off significantly since the last midterms in 2010 \u2013 particularly among Republicans. Four years ago, 53% of Republicans said they were enthusiastic or very enthusiastic about voting, that number has now dropped to 37%. In 2010, 30% of Democrats were enthusiastic about voting \u2013 fast forward four years and that number has decreased two points. Challenges to predicting the November election result Despite the drop-off in voter enthusiasm from 2010, the GOP has an advantage in this category, according to the poll. And other data points show that Obama will not be helpful to many of the endangered Democrats seeking re-election. The CNN/ORC poll shows that 52% of registered voters would support a candidate for Congress who opposes Obama, while 39% would support a candidate that backs the president. Democrats are hoping that candidates in Kentucky and Georgia are able take back GOP held seats, which would help the task of keeping the GOP net gain under six seats a lot easier. As for the overall electoral mood for the House, the GOP holds a 49%-45% edge over Democrats in the generic ballot question of which party would you vote for in your congressional district. Terror fears could help GOP in midterms",

            "article_content": "Cruz says \"any and all means necessary\" should be used to stop  \"illegally granting amnesty\" Democrats say Cruz wants a government shutdown He was at the center of last year's shutdown \"It's deja vu all over again,\" says a Democratic congressional leader Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Tuesday Congress should \u201cuse all means necessary\u201d to prevent President Barack Obama from granting what Cruz considers amnesty to more immigrants who are in the country illegally. He said it would be \u201cappropriate\u201d to include a provision that would block the President from doing so in a critical government-funding bill that Congress must approve this month. Democrats immediately seized on the issue and charged that Cruz wants to shut down the government by attaching a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to the funding bill, which is known as a continuing resolution or CR.  Cruz was at the center of last year\u2019s government shutdown, which Democrats believe did long term damage to the GOP. \u201cIt\u2019s another Ted Cruz hostage situation.  Last October he held the entire federal government hostage to his ideology and now he\u2019s willing to do it again,\u201d the chairman of the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York told CNN. Obama defers action on immigration Despite Cruz\u2019s tough talk, there appears to be no appetite even among some of the House conservatives who pushed for a confrontation last fall to have a fight on the spending bill this close to the election. In the Senate, GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said he wouldn\u2019t allow another shutdown to happen. Still, Israel maintained, \u201cit\u2019s deja vu all over again.  In October as they were shutting down the government, they said they wouldn\u2019t shut down the government. They just can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d House Republicans are expected to vote Thursday on a bill to extend current government-funding levels through December 11. At issue are GOP concerns the President will expand his use of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which conservatives consider amnesty.  That\u2019s because earlier this summer the President vowed to use executive authority to take a number of steps related to immigration since Congress was gridlocked on the issue.  The President has since said he won\u2019t take any unilateral action until after the midterm election. 5 reasons Obama\u2019s delay on immigration is political But Cruz said Tuesday Republicans should use \u201cevery tool at our disposal\u201d including the CR. \u201cI think we should use any and all means necessary to prevent the President from illegally granting amnesty.  That certainly, I think, would be appropriate to include in the CR,\u201d Cruz said at a news conference.  \u201cBut I think we should use every \u2013 every \u2013 tool at our disposal.\u201d Cruz declined to say if he would vote against the CR unless the provision is in the bill. \u201cLet\u2019s wait to see what\u2019s in the CR,\u201d Cruz said.  \u201cI have a habit of waiting to see what\u2019s in legislation before I make a decision about whether I will support it or not.\u201d How far can the President go on executive actions?",

            "article_content": "Michelle Obama makes her campaign trail debut Monday She attends two events Monday for Michelle Nunn Nunn, a Democrat, is seeking the open U.S. Senate seat in Georgia The first lady has more favorable poll ratings than her husband President Obama may not be a welcome sight on the campaign trail for Democrats in many key Senate races, but the first lady is a different story. Michelle Obama made her campaign trail debut Monday in the hotly contested Georgia race for the U.S. Senate. She headlined a fundraiser and a voter registration rally for Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn, among other Democratic candidates up for election in the Peach State. \u201cThe stakes this year couldn\u2019t be higher. If we don\u2019t show up in the polls this November, if we don\u2019t elect leaders in Congress and here in Georgia who put people first instead of fighting for special interests, we know exactly what will happen,\u201d the first lady told an energized crowd, before going on to outline the familiar Democratic attack lines heard in the past two election cycles. \u201cWe will see more folks interfering in women\u2019s private decisions about our health care. We\u2019ll see more folks denying that climate change even exists. We\u2019ll see more votes against equal pay and immigration reform and raising\u201d the minimum wage. The first lady\u2019s trip began with an event at Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta highlighting her Reach Higher initiative, which encourages High School students to pursue higher education. She delivered a speech to students and faculty. The speech, which lasted less than a half an hour, was briefly interrupted when a female student fainted, but the interruption was a short one. Obama paused, called for a medic to attend to the student, and continued with her remarks. The Georgia Senate race, an open contest as a result of the retirement of Sen. Saxby Chambliss, is a marquee contest of the 2014 cycle. The race is a sort of \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of Georgia political families pitting Nunn, a nonprofit CEO and daughter of former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, against Republican candidate David Perdue, a businessman and cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue. Nunn campaign defends early campaign memo First lady stars in 'Funny or Die' video Internal campaign memo leaks Michelle Obama and Laura Bush unite Democrats see the contest as one of their best chances to pick up a Senate seat from Republicans in a midterm cycle where the party is primarily playing defense across the country. Winning that seat would greatly increase the Democrats\u2019 chance of keeping control of the upper chamber. High stakes In a tight political contest in Georgia, Obama appeared to take a do-no-harm approach, staying away from controversial current events, focusing her remarks instead on the importance of registering to vote and turning out at the polls. \u201cBarack won because record numbers of women and minorities and young people showed up to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then, when the midterms come along, too many people, of our folks, just tuned out. See, that\u2019s what happens in the midterms,\u201d the first lady continued. \u201cWhen you stay home, they win.\u201d Nunn, who spoke ahead of the first lady at Monday\u2019s event, is the former CEO of the nonpartisan organization Points of Light, a charity whose title is derived from the \u201cthousand points of light\u201d theme that George H.W. Bush spoke about frequently. President George H.W. Bush fights for Georgia Senate seat She is considered to be one of the Democrats\u2019 two best possibilities for a pickup from the GOP. The other candidate considered to have a solid chance for a seat pick-up is Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. Republican senatorial candidate David Perdue has tied Nunn to the unpopular President Obama, arguing that once in Washington she would support the President\u2019s agenda entirely. A New York Times/CBS poll released on Monday showed Nunn 6 percentage points behind David Perdue, 47% to 41%. Currently, Democrats hold a five-seat majority in the Senate, and Democrats are up for re-election in seven states that went red in the 2012 presidential election, in addition to facing tough contests in places like Iowa, Michigan, Colorado and New Hampshire. The math is on the GOP\u2019s side, making Georgia\u2019s Senate contest that much more important for the Democratic Party. In her remarks, the first lady argued that if Republicans were to regain control of the senate in November, gridlock in Washington would get even worse. \u201cFrankly, if we lose these midterm elections, it\u2019s going to be a whole lot harder to finish what we started,\u201d she said, referring to the Obama administration\u2019s agenda. \u201cBecause things will be even worse out of Washington.\u201d A popular first lady Although her husband\u2019s popularity is not great \u2013 the most recent polling from CNN/ORC International shows his approval rating at 43% \u2013 Michelle Obama still enjoys high approval ratings. A CNN poll (PDF) taken in May found that 61% of voters still have a favorable opinion of the first lady. Game on in pivotal Georgia Senate race Obama has mostly stayed away from public events on the campaign trail this cycle, though she has done Democratic fundraisers. It remains to be seen whether these types of appearances will become more frequent in the coming weeks and months ahead of the midterm elections in November. Obama is not the only high-profile figure to stump for Nunn; Bill Clinton is scheduled to attend a fundraiser for the Democratic candidate this month hosted by singer and Atlanta resident Usher. Advice to students Her first stop in Georgia was headlining an event with Education Secretary Arne Duncan at Booker T. Washington High School, which counts Martin Luther King Jr. among its graduates. The Reach Higher initiative, launched this year, is designed to encourage students to further their education beyond high school, seeking out some form of higher education, with the goal of helping the United States regain the top spot as the country with the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. Speaking to a room of high school students, Obama stressed the importance of continuing education beyond high school. \u201cYou have to understand that completing high school is not the end but the beginning of your life\u2019s journey,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning.  In today\u2019s world, in order to compete in an ever-globalizing economy, you\u2019ve got to continue your education after you graduate from high school.\u201d Obama laid out the various resources that students should utilize when exploring post-high school education options, including studying for the SAT\u2019s, attending college fairs and visiting campuses. \u201cI\u2019m giving you some insights that a lot of rich kids all over the country \u2013 they know this stuff, and I want you to know it, too,\u201d she told the students. \u201cBecause you have got to go and get your education.  You\u2019ve got to. \u201d The brief interruption in the first lady\u2019s speech occurred about 12 minutes into her remarks. Obama stopped her speech to check if the child who fainted was OK, and then called for paramedics to come to the student\u2019s aid. The student was accompanied out of the event by paramedics, but was walking on her own, according to CNN photojournalist David Rust, who attended the event.",

            "article_content": "At the top of the list, passing a funding bill to avoid another government shutdown Congress will also hear from President Obama on his plan to combat ISIS Little else is expected to be done with midterm elections less than two months away Members of Congress returned to Washington on Monday from a five-week summer break. And they already can\u2019t wait to go back home. Despite frightening international developments drawing the United States into a major military fight against the terrorist group ISIS and several unresolved policy disputes on things like immigration, members of the House and Senate come back to the Capitol with one thing in mind: Do the bare minimum and get back on the campaign trail. At the top of the must-do list: passing a government funding bill and avoiding another government shutdown.  Federal agencies run out of money at the end of September and the House could vote as early as this week on a \u201cCR,\u201d or continuing resolution, that keeps current funding levels through mid-December.  Congressional Republicans, confident they will regain control of the Senate, want to pass the spending bill quickly and without drama. Privately, some Democrats relish the idea of more brinkmanship on the issue because of the political damage a shutdown inflicted on Republicans last fall. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is in a tight re-election battle, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash recently he would not allow a shutdown to occur. Intel Chair: Obama needs endgame on ISIS What in the World: America's Ex-Im bank President delays immigration action W.H.: Obama has authority to act on ISIS \u201cI did rule it out. I\u2019m the guy who gets us out of shutdowns,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a failed policy.\u201d Leaders may decide to tack on a short-term extension of the Export-Import Bank, the credit agency that gives loans to companies to promote U.S. exports. The bank\u2019s credit authority expires at the end of the month, but many conservatives oppose renewing it, arguing the institution is another example of government doing what the private sector should do. GPS: Why the Export-Import Bank matters Another key item in front of Congress: whether to vote on authorizing military action against ISIS. After demanding a plan from President Barack Obama on how he will respond to the terrorist threat, top congressional leaders will head to the White House on Tuesday to hear from the President before he outlines his strategy in a national address on Wednesday.  Administration officials have been summoned for a series of hearings on the Hill, but it\u2019s an open question whether there will be an actual vote to grant the President new war authority or provide additional money to arm Syrian rebels. Obama: U.S. to \u2018go on some offense\u2019 in ISIS fight Asked on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d over the weekend, the President signaled that he may not think he any needs sign-off from Capitol Hill. \u201cI\u2019m confident that I\u2019ve got the authorization that I need to protect the American people,\u201d Obama said. But some on Capitol Hill said it\u2019s up to the Congress, not the President, to give the go-ahead for military action.  Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a possible GOP presidential contender in 2016, said \u201cformal congressional authorization is required by the Constitution and would force the President to commit a clearly defined strategy to protect our national security.\u201d CNN Poll: Most Americans alarmed by ISIS Senior aides from both political parties said it\u2019s hard to gauge whether a new authorization could pass until they see the administration\u2019s plans. Already, a number of proposals are being pushed by bipartisan lawmakers, ranging from a narrowly tailored bill that would authorize airstrikes against ISIS in Syria to broader legislation that would give the President congressional approval to go after terrorists around the world. Is there a way to destroy ISIS? Dems: Obama too cautious on Isis President prepares ISIS plan Obama to outline ISIS strategy Is Obama foreign policy cautious or weak? The House is scheduled to be in session for just a dozen more days before the November election, but if the continuing resolution clears both chambers without any problems, it\u2019s likely that Congress will head home for the final campaign stretch earlier than planned. The brief fall, pre-campaign session will be more about political messaging than legislating. The GOP-led House will roll up a laundry list of previously approved jobs bills  into one major economic measure, pass it and send it to the Democratic-led Senate. It will also vote on a nonbinding resolution condemning the Obama administration for not consulting Congress earlier this year when it traded five Taliban prisoners for the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was held captive in Afghanistan. Republicans continue to believe complaints about Obamacare resonate with voters, so the House is scheduled to vote this week on a bill proposed by Louisiana GOP Rep Bill Cassidy that would allow those who like their current health care plans to keep them.  Cassidy is running for Senate against one of the most endangered red state Democrats, Sen. Mary Landrieu. Any action on the politically tricky issue of immigration reform will be punted until November\u2019s lame duck session. Obama announced over the weekend that he is delaying any executive action to curb deportations of undocumented workers until after the midterms, a move House Speaker John Boehner said \u201csmacks of raw politics.\u201d  But the President is expected to announce a new policy before the end of the year and congressional Republicans will certainly fight back and try to block it. In the Senate, the first noteworthy vote of the shortened session won\u2019t have anything to do with keeping the government funded or defeating ISIS.  Instead, the Monday evening vote will be on whether to take up a Democratic-authored constitutional amendment to allow the states and federal government to regulate campaign financing.  Most Republicans oppose the approach but may vote to take it up nonetheless if for no other reason than to shrink the window into which Democrats can propose other measures Republicans consider political show votes. The constitutional amendment has virtually no chance of getting through the GOP-controlled House, not to mention ratification by three-quarters of the states as would be required.  It is sponsored by several Democrats up for re-election and has been championed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who routinely blasts the billionaire Koch brothers for spending millions to help Republicans win control of the chamber this fall. With the Senate set to leave town September 23 \u2013 after just 12 work days \u2013 Reid warned before the August break senators might be forced to work weekends in September to complete their business.    According to aides, that heavy workload may include bills to boost the minimum wage, reform the federal student loan programs, and other Democratic priorities.  Republicans oppose those bills and bristle at Democrats for clogging the calendar with measures designed to rally the liberal base and boost Democratic candidates, not actually pass laws.",

            "article_content": "NEW: The White House says Obama will act on immigration this year President Obama changes his timing on unilateral immigration steps Holding off now can help Democrats in November elections Obama says the summer child immigrant influx changed the politics President Barack Obama says he won\u2019t act on immigration reform until after the November congressional elections. The news angered Latino groups pushing him to make good on past promises to halt or substantially reduce deportations of immigrants living illegally in the country. It also prompted criticism from some Democrats, who have called for Obama to act unilaterally in the face of Republican obstruction of immigration legislation. Even Republicans who oppose Obama\u2019s intended reforms found a way to attack the President for not doing something they don\u2019t want. Here are five reasons why the unfolding Washington drama is all about politics and the upcoming elections: Latinos 'really pissed off' with the GOP 1) Waiting until after the November election keeps the focus on the voting The election is for all 435 House seats and about a third of the Senate, not the White House. Betting money now says Republicans hold their House majority and perhaps gain control of the Senate. By putting off his move until after the election, Obama prevents diverting attention from historically low public approval for Congress. A Washington Post-ABC poll in early August showed that for the first time, a majority of Americans disapproved of their own representatives. An anti-incumbent atmosphere may be the Democrats\u2019 only hope for preventing Republicans from holding majorities in both chambers. \u201cFor the Democrats, they want to make this election season about each individual candidate, about their gaffes, about their personalities,\u201d Manu Raju of Politico told CNN on Sunday. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to make this an issue-based election.\u201d Republicans know that, which is why they criticized Obama even though they oppose his planned unilateral moves. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, but not surprising, that President Obama continues to play politics with such a serious and important issue, but for this White House politics seems to dictate everything,\u201d said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ruth Guerra. 2) It avoids providing further fodder to GOP attack line of imperial Obama According to reform advocates involved in conversations with the White House, Obama has looked at expanding a program that allows immigrants brought to America illegally as children to avoid deportation. The White House also could protect undocumented immigrants in industries such as farming. Republicans, particularly conservatives, routinely accuse Obama of exceeding the bounds of his powers through executive actions. They consider immigration reforms \u2013 like a Senate-passed bill or the steps Obama contemplates \u2013 to amount to an amnesty for lawbreakers. The GOP-led House already has authorized a lawsuit against Obama for allegedly unconstitutional steps in implementing his signature health care reforms. Proceeding with executive actions now on immigration would strengthen a central conservative campaign issue for November. Democrats saw \u201csome very scary polling out of some of these red states, particularly among independent voters, where the idea of executive action in particular was not looking good for some of these Democrats who were hanging on for dear life as it is,\u201d Molly Ball of The Atlantic told CNN on Sunday. 3) Democrats don\u2019t have to defend a move made less popular by the child immigrant crisis Always a volatile political issue, immigration reform became even more inflammatory due to the influx of children from Central America across the Texas border this year. The tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors have overwhelmed U.S. border and immigration services, creating further backlogs in a system already known for long delays and lack of follow-up in processing cases. On June 30, Obama said at the White House he would act on his own on immigration, after GOP House Speaker John Boehner made clear the chamber would not take up a Senate reform bill that passed with bipartisan support. The President said then he expected recommendations from his Cabinet on what steps he could take before the end of summer, and that he intended to \u201cadopt those recommendations without further delay.\u201d However, the child immigrant influx hardened positions and raised new concerns about lax border controls, causing Obama to change his message in an interview with NBC broadcast Sunday. \u201cThis problem with unaccompanied children that we saw a couple weeks ago \u2013 where you had from Central America a surge of kids who were showing up at the border \u2013 got a lot of attention, and a lot of Americans started thinking, \u2018We\u2019ve got this immigration crisis on our hands, \u2018\u201d Obama said, adding later that \u201cthe truth of the matter is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem.\u201d Now, he said, \u201cI want to spend some time, even as we\u2019re getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action, I also want to make sure that the public understands why we\u2019re doing this, why it\u2019s the right thing for the American people, why it\u2019s the right thing for the American economy.\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that Obama \u201chas not in any way altered his commitment or interest in taking executive action, again, within the confines of the law, to act where Congress hasn\u2019t and more specifically, to act where congressional Republicans have blocked congressional action.\u201d \u201cAnd the President\u2019s commitment to acting on this before the end of the year has not changed,\u201d Earnest added. 4) It keeps pressure on House Republicans for not voting on the Senate plan By not acting now, Obama allows his administration and congressional Democrats to keep blaming Republicans for a lack of progress. Every chance he gets, Obama notes how the Senate immigration bill had support from both parties as well as a broad public coalition including business, labor, religious and law enforcement groups backing it, but won\u2019t pass because House Republicans oppose it. Earnest said that \u201cinjecting an executive action in the midst of this hyperpartisan, hyperpolitical environment\u201d shortly before the November election could have \u201ca negative impact on the broader public support and on the sustainability of immigration reform.\u201d Conservatives respond that the Senate reforms let immigrant lawbreakers off the hook and would increase competition for jobs as the economy continues growing at a slower-than-desired pace. Keeping the focus on the broader immigration debate, rather than specifics of any unilateral steps the President might take, allows congressional Democrats \u2013 especially vulnerable Senate incumbents \u2013 to depict House Republicans as blocking progress. \u201cYou have Democrats now who knew they always had an outside shot, but the President is not putting them under the gun and putting them on the spot,\u201d Robert Costa of the Washington Post told CNN on Sunday. \u201cThey think they can go to some other issues and have some strengths.\u201d 5) It responds to the political middle more than left-leaning immigrant communities The news of no executive action on immigration until after the November election angered Latino groups and others, who back reforms and who helped Obama get strong support from Hispanic voters in his two presidential elections. \u201cWhen candidate Obama asked our community for support in 2008 and 2012, he urged us all to vote based on our hopes, not our fears,\u201d said Janet Murgu\u00eda, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, a leading Hispanic advocacy group. \u201cToday, President Obama gave in to the fears of Democratic political operatives, crushing the hopes of millions of hard-working people living under the constant threat of deportation and family separation.\u201d Or as CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette put it: \u201cSome on the left are finally getting the message that Obama is not their amigo.\u201d \u201cFor Obama, the question is never what he can do for the immigration issue, but what the immigration issue can do for him,\u201d Navarette wrote in an opinion piece published Monday. In this case, Obama decided that angering his traditional political allies made more short-term sense than putting vulnerable Democrats \u2013 especially incumbent Democrats in the Senate \u2013 at greater risk of a backlash against unilateral immigration moves from independent voters who will decide close races in November. CNN chief national correspondent John King noted Sunday that most of the vulnerable Senate Democrats come from states that don\u2019t have big Latino populations. Democrats blame GOP for Obama immigration delay Obama: Waiting will make immigration executive action \u2018more sustainable\u2019 CNN\u2019s Leigh Ann Caldwell contributed to this report.",

Plus, a digital extra from Politico\u2019s Maggie Haberman shows new signs that Hillary Clinton supporters are ready to get more aggressive. Chamber\u2019s next play: Iowa\u2019s Senate battle The Chamber's next target The Chamber of Commerce continues to be a major player in the 2014 fight for control of the Senate, with its next move to be a multimillion-dollar ad buy for Republican Joni Ernst in  Iowa\u2019s Senate contest. Ernst is running against U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley. The Iowa play comes on the heels of a Chamber ad buy in New Hampshire featuring a Mitt Romney testimonial for GOP Senate candidate Scott Brown. With 58 days to Election Day, one reason Republicans feel good about their odds of capturing the Senate majority is the fact that Iowa and New Hampshire, two states President Obama won handily twice, remain within reach for the GOP. Inside Pat Roberts\u2019 new playbook Kansas campaign shake-up Robert Costa of The Washington Post spoke with insiders in the Kansas Republican Party and they say that Roberts is shaking up his entire campaign. \u201cHe brought in Chris LaCivita, who got to Kansas this weekend, a consultant from Virginia, and they got rid of Leroy Towns, Roberts\u2019 longtime confidant and campaign manager,\u201d said Costa. \u201cAnd look for them this week to try and define (Greg) Orman, the independent candidate.\u201d Who is behind that effort to define Roberts\u2019 opponent? Costa reports that Lee Atwater protege Gary Maloney is coming in to help with opposition research and get Roberts back on track. Nevada gets help from ambitious Democrats Politico\u2019s Manu Raju took us inside Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s strategy of turning the national political importance of his state, Nevada, into a boon for local political causes. Hillary Clinton, he reports, is in discussions to raise money soon for the Nevada Democratic Party. Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and Vice President Joe Biden already have attended fund-raisers of late. \u201cThe reason why that\u2019s important for Harry Reid is that he needs his candidates in this November\u2019s location, local candidates, to win,\u201d said Raju. \u201cBecause if they do, his chances of survival in 2016 really improve.\u201d The key race in Reid\u2019s Election-Day calculations is the lieutenant governor\u2019s race. Reid is concerned that Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval may try to grab his Senate seat in 2016. The thinking is that if a Democratic lieutenant governor is elected this year, Sandoval won\u2019t want to leave the Governor\u2019s Mansion in two years and hand it over to a Democrat. GOP leadership on \u2018pins and needles\u2019 over budget showdown Will another budget deadline at the end of this month lead to another government shutdown? Molly Ball of The Atlantic reports that no one expects a shutdown, but the GOP leadership is on pins and needles about being able to get the continuing resolution passed. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a game plan for how they are going to get House conservatives to fund the government,\u201d said Ball. \u201cAs we mentioned on immigration, it\u2019s riled up the right and emboldened a lot of conservatives to make demands. The Export-Import Bank is also a really tough issue and the leadership has signaled they\u2019re going to try to get it reauthorized in the continuing resolution.\u201d So there may be fireworks on Capitol Hill this month \u2013 stay tuned. The \u2018Putin Problem\u2019 isn\u2019t going anywhere Peter Baker of The New York Times shared smart insights suggesting the \u201cPutin Problem\u201d is likely to carry over into the next administration \u2013 even if the newly announced ceasefire in Ukraine holds. \u201cThe problem is that that doesn\u2019t end the story; it doesn\u2019t solve the fundamental issues,\u201d said Baker. \u201cThat\u2019s why what I think we\u2019re going to see is what we call \u2018frozen conflict,\u2019 as we see elsewhere around the former Soviet Union, in which it remains a continuing set of tensions and frictions basically for now and the next few years to come.\u201d Clinton gets a little help from her friends Super PAC plays defense for Clinton We knew the onetime pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA had morphed into a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC. But after a relatively quiet 2014, Politico\u2019s Maggie Haberman shared reporting that the group is prepared to get more aggressive, meaning prepared to inject itself into the 2016 Democratic primary competition. \u201cIt was made very clear at a private meeting of people involved with it several weeks ago that they are prepared to spend in the primary to defend her,\u201d said Haberman. \u201cThat means this is much more like what we saw with Mitt Romney and the super PAC that went after Newt Gingrich in a devastating way in the 2012 election cycle, and less like something that\u2019s just on hold to attack the Republican nominee.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Speaking in Mexico City, Christie says: nothing on immigration, for now If he decideds to run for President, \"then I will articulate a full position on it\" The New Jersey governor has criticized Obama and others in Washington over the issue He is in Mexico on an official trip as governor Gov. Chris Christie, who has long avoided wading into the immigration debate, said Thursday in Mexico City that he won\u2019t lay out his position on immigration reform unless he decides to run for president. \u201cUntil that time I have no role in the immigration debate, except for how it may affect the individual citizens of New Jersey, which I\u2019ll deal with as governor,\u201d the New Jersey Republican told reporters. \u201cBut I won\u2019t have anything to say on immigration unless and until I become a candidate for president of the United States,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf that happens, then I will articulate a full position on it.\u201d Third of Mexicans would migrate to the U.S., survey finds Rand Paul & Christie Latino outreach Christie leans right in the South Immigration fight; Christie; Warren His comments came on the second of a three-day trip to Mexico, where the governor is meeting with Mexican dignitaries and business leaders to build economic and education partnerships. While Christie has repeatedly criticized President Obama for his handling of security enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border, the governor has yet to detail his own position on legislation reform. \u201cI know you guys are begging to have me focus on immigration, and let me put you to rest: I\u2019m not going to,\u201d he said, referring to the news media. \u201cYou can ask in 18 different ways \u2026 I\u2019m not giving you the story, so you can move on to whatever your next questions are.\u201d Republican ignoring their own advice on immigration During a trip to Iowa in July \u2013 at the height of the crisis involving children crossing the border illegally \u2013 Christie declined to answer questions from reporters about immigration. \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss a complicated issue like immigration in a parking lot here in Marion, which really deserves a much deeper and more thoughtful conversation than we give out here right now,\u201d he said at the time, faulting \u201cboth parties\u201d for the way they\u2019ve handled the issue. Christie: N.J. may consider housing kids from southern border influx In June, while the governor was in San Francisco, he refused to lay out his position, again saying his current location was not the appropriate venue for such a topic. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d love me to do that,\u201d he said with sarcasm, after a reporter asked him to spell out his stance. \u201cAnd in fact what I want to do in a flower warehouse, I want to give you a very complex answer behind a set of microphones on a contentious issue that\u2019s driving debate all across the country. No thank you.\u201d On Thursday, Christie said he discussed immigration issues the day prior in a meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, saying they talked about how \u201cit\u2019s a very difficult issue for both parties\u201d in the United States and how it\u2019s Washington\u2019s responsibility to fix the problem. Since the 2012 presidential election, in which the GOP presidential nominee won only 27% of the Latino vote, Republicans have been more aggressive in courting Latino voters. Christie himself has frequently pointed out that he won 51% of the Latino vote in New Jersey during his re-election bid. Asked by one reporter about the importance of Latino voters for Republicans at the national level, Christie acknowledged the electoral advantages. \u201cThe importance of it is the more votes you get, the more chance you have to win,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care who those votes come from, as long as you wind up with more than the other guy, you win, you get to govern, and that\u2019s what our party should be focused on.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama says he wants public to know \"what the facts are on immigration\" White House official: Delay is to prevent election grandstanding President Obama has been weighing ways to change immigration system on his own Pro-immigration reform groups express disappointment in delay President Barack Obama says he\u2019s postponing executive action on immigration until after November\u2019s elections because it would be \u201cmore sustainable\u201d then. Speaking to NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, Obama said the immigration debate was affected by concerns over the large number of unaccompanied children from Latin America flocking to the U.S. border. \u201cThe truth of the matter is that the politics did shift mid-summer because of that problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019m going to act because it\u2019s the right thing for the country,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be more sustainable and more effective if the public understands what the facts are on immigration, what we\u2019ve done on unaccompanied children and why it\u2019s necessary.\u201d The decision to postpone means any political repercussions for trying to reform the immigration system by himself would come after the congressional midterm contests. Obama still \u201cwill do something before the end of the year\u201d on the issue, a White House official told CNN on Saturday. People on both sides of the immigration debate criticized the postponement, including pro-immigration reform groups that are impatient for action. Obama has been weighing executive action on immigration \u2013 including moves that could allow a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers \u2013 after congressional action on the issue stalled. The options could include expanding a deferred deportation program for children of immigrants. But he decided to delay any move to \u201ctake this issue away from those who would use it to score points as a kind of grandstanding issue,\u201d the White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s too big of an issue to allow it to be used as a tool for people trying to get votes,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about votes for any particular candidate; it\u2019s about dealing with this issue in an environment that avoids the grandstanding we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d Another reason to wait: Should the Democrats retain control of the Senate in November, Republicans may feel it necessary \u201cto try a different strategy\u201d and compromise on immigration, the White House official said. Scott Brown criticizes move Republican Scott Brown, the former U.S. senator from Massachusetts who is now running for Senate from New Hampshire, ripped the move, saying it was a cynical ploy to protect Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats for the elections. After Obama threatened to take executive action this summer, Republicans pushed back, saying among other things that the President shouldn\u2019t remove Congress from the equation. Some GOP lawmakers had suggested holding up a bill funding federal agencies \u2013 thus forcing a government shutdown \u2013 if Obama took unilateral action. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s decision to delay executive action to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants until after the election is of little comfort to people like myself who believe in the rule of law,\u201d said Brown, who faces Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in November. House Speaker John Boehner said Saturday there was \u201cnever a \u2018right\u2019 time\u201d for the President to take action by himself. \u201cBut the decision to simply delay this deeply controversial and possibly unconstitutional unilateral action until after the election \u2013 instead of abandoning the idea altogether \u2013 smacks of raw politics,\u201d the top House Republican said. The Democratic National Committee blasted the Republican criticism. \u201cThe GOP, the party that has blocked meaningful comprehensive immigration reform at every turn and sued the President for acting, is now outraged that he hasn\u2019t taken steps that many in their party deemed impeachable offenses,\u201d the committee said in a statement. But pro-immigration reform groups weren\u2019t impressed with the delay. The website of one group, United We Dream, displayed a message Saturday that Obama \u201chas further cemented his legacy as the #DeporterInChief by delaying the usage of his executive authority to stop the deportation of millions of immigrants.\u201d Cristina Jimenez of United We Dream said: \u201cThe President\u2019s latest broken promise is another slap to the face of the Latino and immigrant community.\u201d The immigration challenge An estimated 11 million or more immigrants are living illegally in the United States, many of them for years or even decades. The Obama administration has deported or turned back more than 2 million people. Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive bill that would provide a path to legal status for the millions of long-term undocumented immigrants while also strengthening border security. The legislation would have required immigrants illegally living in the country to register with the government, pay a penalty, learn English and begin the process of applying for legal status. It had the backing of the business community, organized labor and religious organizations. However, House Republicans refused to consider the Senate bill, which Obama and Democrats claim would pass if put to a vote. Conservatives say the Senate plan amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers, arguing they should be sent back to their home countries because they drive up the size and cost of government while competing with U.S. citizens for jobs. Democrats want to remove the legal uncertainty for as many of the undocumented immigrants as possible, allowing them to continue living and working here so they can eventually gain legal status and possibly full citizenship. What Obama has been considering Among the actions that Obama was considering as recently as August, according to reform advocates involved in conversations with the White House: an expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It allows immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to stay without fear of deportation and apply for work permits if they meet certain criteria. So far, some 660,000 young people have taken advantage of the program, according to a report by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. That\u2019s 55% of the 1.2 million who were immediately eligible. Advocates said the administration also has been considering expanding the program to cover the parents of U.S. citizens or all undocumented parents. The White House could also decide to cover undocumented immigrants in industries such as farming, or it could expand deportation relief based on how long a person has been living and working in the community. While there are many different mechanisms that could be used to provide relief, using the existing program as the template is an attractive alternative because that process has been running since 2012. Many Republicans have called for immigration reform that includes tighter border controls. Before for August recess, the Republican-controlled House passed a bill that would have prevented Obama from granting new deferrals \u2013 or even renewing previously granted ones \u2013 under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The Senate has not taken up the bill. How far can the President go on executive actions? 5 things Obama can and can\u2019t do on immigration CNN\u2019s Tom Cohen, Deirdre Walsh, Athena Jones, Jason Hanna and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican Tom Cotton holds slim edge over Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor Arkansas race is another that could determine who controls the Senate White women could be the key voting bloc that determines the outcome Rep. Tom Cotton has a 2-point advantage over Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor in a new CNN/ORC International poll of the political knife fight for the U.S. Senate seat in Arkansas. Cotton\u2019s 49%-47% edge over the incumbent falls well within the survey\u2019s 4.5% margin of error, essentially making this race, which will help determine who controls the Senate, a dead heat two months before Election Day. Battle for the Senate: Races to watch Election season kicks into high gear There is no sugarcoating the bitterness between the two candidates in this high-profile contest. Pryor\u2019s campaign released an ad accusing the Republican Cotton of voting against legislation that would help prepare the U.S. for a pandemic situation such as the Ebola virus, while Cotton has charged that Pryor is soft on illegal immigration. Election Center: Key 2014 Senate races Sigh of relief for Kansas Republicans The poll shows that each candidate is winning his party\u2019s traditional political voting blocs, except Cotton appears strong with a key subset of the national Democratic Party\u2019s most faithful supporters \u2013 a data point that is likely to raise a red flag among party elders and strategists. While Pryor holds an 8-point advantage over Cotton with likely women voters overall, Cotton is favored by likely voters among white women by 11 points. Losing a key constituency to an opponent by such a large margin could be devastating. \u201cThe bad news is that he seems to have opened up a new way to lose to Republicans by losing badly with white women,\u201d said a Democratic operative who knows Pryor but is not working on his race. \u201cThe good news is that is a segment of the electorate that tends to break Democratic, and he has time to close that gap. If he does, he wins.\u201d Democrats boost Begich in Alaska after controversial ad For Cotton, one of his biggest weaknesses is with people who make under $50,000 \u2013 not unexpected when you look at traditional political voting bloc alliances. Pryor has a 9-point lead over Cotton with this group. The recent decision to include a measure on the November ballot that would increase the minimum wage in Arkansas from $6.25 to $8.50 by 2017 may help the incumbent by turning out more Democratic base voters, who often sit out midterm elections. \u201cThe hope in Democratic circles is that those lower-income voters will turn out to vote themselves a raise, and while they are in the voting booth, they will wind up casting a ballot for Pryor as well,\u201d CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. When it was announced that the measure would be on the ballot, Pryor issued a statement calling it a \u201ccommon sense proposal to put more money in the pockets of hardworking families across Arkansas.\u201d Much like other critical Senate Democratic re-election bids, President Barack Obama is seen as a drag, not a plus, for Pryor in November. Obama\u2019s approval rating in Arkansas is just 33%, while 60% of registered voters disapprove of how he is handling his job. While Pryor voted for health care reform, he has opposed the President on other issues in the Senate and has not embraced him on the campaign trail. Senate election in Kentucky is marquee race Poll: McConnell, Grimes race tightens Kansas Dem.  Senate candidate drops out Shaheen, Brown on foreign policy For some Republicans, though, it is puzzling that Cotton doesn\u2019t have a bigger lead over Pryor. While Pryor is among the centrists in his party and is the son of a former governor, if you look at the most recent voting trends, they would seem to clearly favor the Republican. Cases in point: Mitt Romney beat Obama by 24 points in 2012, and four years earlier, John McCain carried the state by 20 points. In 2010, Pryor\u2019s then-Democratic colleague, Sen. Blanche Lincoln, lost her seat to GOP Rep. John Boozman by 21 points. Beyond the favorable GOP voting trends, Cotton has a resume that jumps off the page. He deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, is Harvard educated and hails from a longtime Arkansas family. Yet, there is a thought among some Republicans that Cotton has failed to connect personally with voters. \u201cIt is often said that people vote with their wallet, but it also is true that people decide based off of whom they would rather sit down and have a beer with,\u201d said a veteran GOP congressional and campaign operative. \u201cLikability matters. Mark Pryor is a likable guy. Tom Cotton\u2019s got to turn on the charm in the closing weeks.\u201d In the so-called middle, Cotton is winning independent voters by 20 points, but it is unclear how nonpartisan these voters may be. A closer look at the data suggests that these voters appear to be more conservative-leaning than liberal-leaning. Inside Politics forecast: GOP jitters in Kansas DNC: Tea party 'grabbing us by the hair' McConnell: 'Nothing I haven't said publicly' Up close with Rick Perry's Hail Mary \u201cIn some states, tea party supporters in recent years have tended to describe themselves as independents rather than Republicans since they don\u2019t feel comfortable with the GOP as it is currently structured,\u201d Holland said. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear if this is true in Arkansas, but one piece of evidence to support it is that more than half of self-described independents say they are conservative and only eight percent call themselves liberal.\u201d In the end, the winner of this race will be the person who turns out more of its supporters, while at the same time convincing crossover voters to support their campaign. The poll shows that Pryor has an edge in this category as 9% of Republicans said they are backing or leaning towards voting for him, while 5% of Democrats said they are backing or leaning toward Cotton. As for the overall electorate, 71% of likely voters said they have made up their minds, leaving about 24% who are open to changing their minds. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International, which interviewed 1,010 adults in Arkansas, including 523 likely voters, by telephone between August 28 and September 2. The sampling error for results for likely voters is +/-4.5 percentage points. Friday\u2019s poll was the second CNN/ORC International Poll of a Senate battleground state this week that shows the Republican candidate with a slight edge. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell holds a 4-point advantage over his Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes. The GOP needs a net gain of six seats to take control of the Senate.",

            "article_content": "President Obama praised unions in a Milwaukee speech on Labor Day He blasted Republicans for being obstructionists, arguing they \"say no to everything\" Democrat Mary Burke, who's running for governor in Wisconsin, didn't appear publicly with Obama Republican Gov. Scott Walker greeted Obama at the airport President Barack Obama told a large union audience in Wisconsin on Monday that while \u201cRepublicans in Congress love to say no,\u201d he is the one who \u201cplaced a bet on America\u2019s workers.\u201d In a speech that skirted the line between politics and policy, Obama outlined what many Democrats are using as a midterm platform, highlighting hopes to raise the minimum wage and pass immigration reform. Obama also used the speech to portray Republicans as obstructionists who are holding the country back. The President told the receptive audience that \u201cmost of the policies I am talking about have two things in common. They are going to help more families get ahead. And Republicans who run our Congress oppose almost all of them.\u201d When the crowd broke out in a chorus of boos, Obama reflexively turned to a now oft-used line: \u201cDon\u2019t boo, vote. Don\u2019t boo, vote. It is easy to boo, I want you to vote.\u201d The political line was a staple during Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign. \u201cI want an economy where your hard work pays off with higher wages and higher income and fair pay for women and workplace flexibility for parents and affordable health insurance and decent retirement benefits,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for the moon, I just want a good deal for American workers.\u201d Although the Obama administration billed the appearance as an official White House event set to \u201cunderscore the important progress America has made since the economic collapse,\u201d the Laborfest speech featured a jacket-less Obama who, for most the most part, appeared to be in campaign mode. \u201cI think eventually Congress is going to hear them. We\u2019ll break those folks down. We\u2019ll just stay on it. We\u2019ll just keep at it,\u201d Obama said. \u201c\u2018Cause the only thing more powerful than an idea whose time has come is when millions of people organizing around an idea whose time has come. Millions of people are voting for an idea whose time has come.\u201d The President used the Labor Day gathering of 6,000 union members and their families to herald organized labor\u2019s role in passing the 40-hour work week, overtime pay for workers and a minimum wage. Standing before helmet-clad workers sporting \u201cWe Are One\u201d t-shirts, Obama also said he would likely join a union. \u201cIf I were looking for a good job that lets me build some security for my job, I\u2019d join a union,\u201d the President said to raucous applause. \u201cIf I were busting my butt in the service industry and wanted an honest day\u2019s pay for an honest day\u2019s work, I\u2019d join a union\u2026I\u2019d want a union looking out for me and if I cared about these things I\u2019d also want more Democrats looking out for me.\u201d The midterms are important for Democrats and Obama\u2019s legacy. Midterms in a second term are historically bad for the President\u2019s party, and Democrats are facing the prospect of losing the Senate and staying the minority in the House in 2014. \u201cRepublicans in Congress love to say no,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThose are just facts, the facts of life. They say no to everything.\u201d While Obama focused much of the speech on the midterms, he was noticeably mum on Wisconsin\u2019s hotly contested race for governor between Democrat Mary Burke and Republican incumbent Scott Walker. According to a Marquette Law School poll, 49% of likely Wisconsin voters support Burke compared to 47% for Walker. The survey has a sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, which means the two candidates are locked in a statistical dead heat. Before Obama\u2019s speech, Burke walked around Laborfest and shook hands with supporters and union members. Burke and Obama did not appear on stage together, but the gubernatorial candidate did tweet that she had a \u201cgreat chat\u201d with Obama backstage and that she looks \u201cfwd to seeing him again b4 11/4.\u201d A spokesman for Burke said before the event that the two won\u2019t appear together because the event is \u201can official White House event and not a campaign event,\u201d therefore her \u201cparticipation in the public portion of events would not be appropriate.\u201d A Democratic National Committee official told CNN last week that Obama will appear with Burke before Election Day. Obama also met Walker, who greeted and shook hands with the President when he walked off Air Force One at General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee. \u201cHad no problem greeting the President just like I have no problem explaining how I differ with him on things like ObamaCare,\u201d Walker tweeted Monday night. Wisconsin has been a friendly state for Obama. In 2008, he won the state by 14 points and in 2012 he carried the state by seven points.

            "article_content": "A number of top Republican strategists say a GOP win in Kansas is now hardly a sure thing Republicans cannot count on a big midterm wave this year Any action this year on immigration would put pressure on the 2016 class of GOP presidential contenders Our Labor Day weekend trip around the \u201cInside Politics\u201d table included GOP jitters over Kansas, the 2016 impact of President Obama\u2019s immigration deliberations, progressive worries about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s hawkish foreign policy views, and Republican angst about a research project that was designed to help but may have done more harm then good. 1. As Democrats look for 2014 \u201csteals,\u201d there\u2019s no place like Kansas? We talked for months about how GOP Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas was hardly a top performer in his primary race against a tea party challenger. GOP jitters about Kansas But Roberts survived, and so the first reflex was to say, OK \u2013 it\u2019s Kansas. Lock that Senate seat in for the GOP. Not so fast. A number of top Republican strategists who have seen the latest research say it is now hardly a sure thing. These strategists are furious with Roberts personally, and even more so with a campaign team they say has not risen to the challenge. So there is mounting pressure on the other Kansas senator, Jerry Moran, who just happens to lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee. I\u2019m told leading GOP voices are pushing the NRSC to get more aggressive, including pushing for a shakeup in the Roberts campaign team. And in the GOP super PAC community, there are conversations that it might become necessary to spend money in a state that no one thought would be \u2013 or should be \u2013 on a 2014 list of potential Democratic pickups. It\u2019s important because the GOP needs a gain of six seats to win the Senate majority; if it lost a Republican-held seat, it would have to win another Democratic seat to net six. And while the GOP super PACs are seemingly flush with money, the 65-day clock to Election Day will force choices \u2013 and if there need to be sudden investments in Kansas, a few GOP challengers in other states could see their outside help shrink. 2. Maybe not all knowledge is good The GOP has a gender problem. So the GOP did some research on its gender problem. Makes perfect sense, right? Well, Politico\u2019s Maggie Haberman took us inside a Republican debate on that very question. Maybe if this private research by Crossroads GPS and the American Action Network had stayed private, it would be viewed as helpful. But Haberman\u2019s Politico colleagues got hold of it and outlined how some women view the GOP as intolerant or stuck in the past. Let the recriminations begin. \u201cThis infuriated a number of Republicans, who privately said \u2013 and some of them less privately \u2013 they thought this was completely undermining, they couldn\u2019t understand the purpose of this, that this is at cross ends to what the GOP is trying to do in the final couple of months of a very difficult midterm,\u201d said Haberman. 3. A \u201cwaveless\u201d GOP win? Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report says her analysis suggests Republicans cannot count on a big midterm wave this year \u2013 like the one they enjoyed in 2010 or the one Democrats rode to midterm gains in 2006. But no wave doesn\u2019t necessarily mean no wins; Walter says it is still more than within reason \u2013 and reach \u2013 that we\u2019ll see the Republicans get the net gain of six Senate seats they need to capture the Senate majority. \u201cWhat we have come to find, every election, is that you don\u2019t see it coming until Election Day, but one side or the other, almost always, the races break disproportionately their way \u2013 55, 60, 65%,\u201d said Walter. \u201cSo that\u2019s more of the question than waiting for a big fat wave to hit us the day after Labor Day.\u201d 4. Immigration pressures on Democrats and 2016 field The White House promises some executive actions on immigration, though there are now indications more controversial decisions might be pushed back until after the November election. As we await final word, Bloomberg\u2019s Lisa Lerer highlighted jitters among some Democrats in tight races this year but also said any Obama action this year would put pressure on the 2016 class of Republican presidential contenders. Rand Paul & Chris Christie Latino outreach \u201cLast week, Rand Paul was in Guatemala,\u201d said Lerer. \u201cHe said it was part of his annual medical mission trip, but he brought his political staff, reporters and a film crew with an aerial drone.\u201d Lerer also pointed out that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is taking his second trip out of the country as governor next week and the destination is \u2013 Mexico. 5. Liberal worries about Warren Liberals love when Elizabeth Warren goes after big banks and pushes her populist economic views. But Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post reports that some progressives are now getting a bit wary \u2013 coming to the conclusion that on some big foreign policy questions, the Massachusetts senator sounds, disturbingly to them, a lot like Hillary Clinton. \u201cShe essentially said that Israelis have the right to defend themselves and in the question of sort of civilian casualties, she essentially says that, well, it\u2019s Hamas\u2019 fault because they have put rocket launchers next to schools and in hospitals,\u201d said Henderson. So over these next weeks, Democrats will watch to see what Warren says about Syria and ISIS and what she does on her trip to Israel in November.",

            "article_content": "GOP struggling internally on message they're sending to Hispanics Some Republicans are worried about impact of some anti-immigration hardliners Crisis of thousands of migrant children streaming to the border illuminates the issue Correction: A previous version of this story did not accurately explain how the immigration bill passed in the House earlier this month would affect deportation deferments. Republicans already are steaming about President Barack Obama\u2019s expected executive action to potentially allow millions of undocumented workers to remain in the country. But another debate on immigration will refocus on internal GOP splits and raise questions about whether the party is taking any of its own advice about being more open to Hispanics. Pointing to inaction by Congress, Obama signaled last Wednesday that he\u2019s done waiting for Republicans to negotiate a compromise on any immigration measures. \u201cI promise you, the American people don\u2019t want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done,\u201d he said. How far can the President go on executive actions? House Speaker John Boehner warned Obama that any move to expand earlier executive action would be \u201ca grievous mistake.\u201d In an opinion piece in Politico last Friday, Boehner insisted any action to fix immigration \u201cmust be done by Congress, and it must be done in a common-sense, step-by-step fashion so that the American people have a say in what we are doing.\u201d Boehner was one of the first top Republicans after Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election to say that the party needed to deal with immigration. But a bipartisan Senate bill approved last year and backed by some prominent Republicans hit a wall in the GOP-led House. Because most House Republican districts are solidly red, most of the party\u2019s rank and file feared primary challenges from the right. The incentive was to stop immigration reform, not move it forward. Recent actions contradict efforts to be inclusive Undocumented immigrant debates Steve King The link between immigration & terrorism House passes $694 million border bill Obama: Congress holding up progress With Congress divided, Obama to go his own way on immigration Many Republican Party leaders and possible presidential candidates, however, say the GOP needs a more inclusive message to Hispanics if it hopes to win the White House in 2016. But the message they\u2019re hearing on immigration from many in the party could make it harder to build relationships with the Latino community. House bill Right before leaving town for the August recess, the House passed a bill that would prevent the President from renewing deportation deferments \u2014 or granting new ones \u2013 for the roughly 600,000 young people brought into the country illegally by undocumented immigrant parents. If the bill were to become law, it would mean those people could be deported. The vote was largely along party lines and Republicans pressing for broader reform said that ending the Obama administration\u2019s program easing such deportations sent the wrong message. \u201cWhy are Republicans continuing to shoot themselves in the foot?\u201d Carlos Gutierrez, a Republican himself and a former commerce secretary for George W. Bush, asked in a CNN interview. A chief proponent of the House bill, Iowa Rep. Steve King, was confronted in his home state last week at an event with Sen. Rand Paul, a likely 2016 presidential candidate. With media present covering Paul, a woman claiming that she would be deported if the measure became law confronted King about the legislation. Paul was seen leaving before the matter turned into a heated debate. Paul has made broadening the Republican Party\u2019s appeal a cornerstone of his message. He helped open GOP offices in minority neighborhoods in his home state and appeared before numerous African-American groups, highlighting his support for reforming criminal sentencing guidelines. Former 2012 vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan has also traveled to more than a dozen communities around the country to discuss poverty issues and promote his economic growth policies. But Democrats have pounced on King\u2019s Iowa dust-up as well as others trying to paint the GOP as more extreme on immigration. Rick Perry says youths crossing the border is a \u2018side issue\u2019 Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks said in a recent interview that he believed some were waging a \u201cwar on whites.\u201d Brooks was responding to a reporter pointing out the GOP\u2019s own fears about its dwindling appeal among Hispanics. But he argued that Democrats are \u201cclaiming that whites hate everybody else,\u201d which he insisted was \u201cnot true.\u201d Republicans nervous Rep. Jeff Denham of California was one of 11 House Republicans to oppose the House bill and told CNN the decision by GOP leaders to allow a vote on it was \u201cdisappointing.\u201d Echoing the same sentiment expressed by Obama, Denham said the measure was \u201ca messaging bill\u201d and \u201cwould never see the light of day\u201d over in the Senate. \u201cWe\u2019ve got kids who are going to high schools that know of no other country to call home and we\u2019ve got to address all aspects of immigration reform,\u201d Denham said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has no plans to take it up in the Democratic-led Senate and Obama has said he would veto it anyway. Boehner didn\u2019t want to turn the discussion over addressing the crisis of Central American migrant youth streaming across the southern border into a broader debate over immigration. He agreed that Congress needed to work with the White House and Democrats to pass narrow legislation to deal with the issues that caused the surge of immigrants and provide resources to handle the tens of thousands who already arrived. Number of unaccompanied minors crossing into U.S. tops 60,000 A political wedge But Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party hero, insisted that halting Obama\u2019s ability to defer future deportations had to be part of the GOP\u2019s response to the border situation. As part of a deal to pass a $694 million border funding bill, Boehner and his top lieutenants agreed to allow a separate vote on a measure promoted by House conservatives that went even further than Cruz\u2019s proposal. The bill would end all deportation deferments because they worried Obama would use his executive authority to expand them. Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart also voted against that bill and told CNN that the GOP proposal helps Democrats continue to use immigration as a political wedge. \u201cIt gives them another bullet point in their narrative,\u201d Diaz-Balart said. Both Denham and Diaz-Balart criticized Obama\u2019s actions on immigration. They said it was appropriate for Congress to respond to when it believes he is overstepping his legal authority. \u201cIf the message is perceived as strictly to protect the civil liberties and basic rights of our democracy, that is one thing. But if the message is perceived to be anti-immigrant, that is very, very negative,\u201d Diaz-Balart said. Party not taking its own advice The recent actions show Republicans aren\u2019t taking their own advice on growing their party. Last spring, the Republican National Committee issued a report that examined its 2012 loss and called for the GOP to address immigration reform. The so-called \u201cautopsy report\u201d warned that \u201cif Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States, they will not pay attention to our next sentence.\u201d Henry Barbour, a top party strategist and a report co-author, told CNN that \u201ctone is important.\u201d He conceded that taking on immigration reform \u201ctakes political courage.\u201d  But he also warned against \u201ctalking in a way that\u2019s not too hot and comes across as negative or exclusive.\u201d Barbour added, \u201cWe\u2019re a big, broad party \u2013 we\u2019re not all going to agree on immigration \u2013 not going to agree on everything, but we certainly have to have people in Washington on the Republican and Democratic side that want to get things done.\u201d House Republicans also heard about it on the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, which doesn\u2019t usually criticize Republicans. \u201cA party whose preoccupation is deporting children is going to alienate many conservatives, never mind minority voters. The episode is also sure to raise doubts among swing voters about whether Republicans would be prepared to govern if they do win control of the entire Congress,\u201d the Journal said. Advice on what to do Even if Republicans can\u2019t enact immigration reform in a divided Congress, others advise  it has to look like it is at least trying to do something. \u201cRepublican support among Hispanic voters does not hinge on immigration reform but inaction. Our inaction and poor optics can eviscerate any future we have right now,\u201d Leslie Sanchez, a Republican strategist and author of \u201cLos Republicanos \u2013 Why Hispanics & Republicans Need Each Other,\u201d said. Gutierrez said that he saw a scenario for Republicans to be on the offense if the party is able to retake control of the Senate in November. He suggested the House and Senate could come together on a proposal that would both secure the border but also provide some path to legal status for the 11 million undocumented workers. Presenting a bill to Obama would put the onus on him to respond and make him the subject of blame if he rejected it. \u201cI think this is one of those \u2018Nixon goes to China\u2019 things \u2013 it will be a Republican who reforms immigration. I don\u2019t believe that Democrats have the credibility,\u201d Gutierrez said. Expanding the wedge? Many Republicans interviewed by CNN said the challenge next year will be even greater because Democrats will want to use any divisions on the issue to further expand the wedge between the GOP and Latino voters going into the 2016 election. But they warned that the party can\u2019t use that as an excuse to not promote a message of positive reform. \u201cThis is what people are elected to do,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cJust do your job \u2013 I\u2019m talking to Republicans and Democrats alike. This is a two-way street.\u201d Campaign officials from both parties say immigration is not a top-tier issue for the midterms. There are only a handful of House Republicans in competitive races in districts with significant Latino populations. The GOP is well positioned to win control of the Senate in November, and immigration is expected to be a factor in just one key contest in Colorado, where there is a sizable number of Hispanic voters. But the 2016 vote is again expected to come down to a handful of key swing states where both parties will work hard to win over independents. And many Republicans agree that the party\u2019s record on immigration will be important in states like Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, which are home to expanding populations of Latino voters. Calling immigration reform the \u201c800-pound gorilla in the room,\u201d Diaz-Balart said if Latinos perceive that Republicans don\u2019t want to deal with immigration, then \u201cthat is a major, major, major stumbling block to get over.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rand Paul made a high-profile trip to Iowa this week Iowa is a magnet for presidential hopefuls Paul made headlines for changing his tune on foreign aid Experts say the controversy isn't a deal breaker, but he still needs social conservatives Rand Paul wears his political ambition for all to see. Look no further than the tie he sported during a three-day trip to Iowa. It had yellow images of corn, the crop that epitomizes politics in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. \u201cAnd by coincidence, I have one in the shape of South Carolina,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said Wednesday, drawing laughs. He was speaking at a Republican breakfast outside Des Moines at Machine Shed, a Midwest restaurant chain where the waiters wear overalls and drinks are served in Mason jars. Rand Paul: I'm not anti-Israel Rand Paul questioned on Israel As Paul blitzed across the Hawkeye State this week, holding events at Iowa GOP offices and campaigning for local candidates, he hardly played coy to the question of whether he was running for President. After all, his nine-city trip marked his fourth visit to the state since the 2012 election. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Iowa keeps popping up on my calendar, but it seems to be pretty frequent,\u201d he said Monday, clearly with sarcasm. His itinerary this time included a campaign-style schedule where he continued testing his 2016 message on the road. From reducing the federal deficit to defending civil liberties and reforming the criminal justice system, Paul mostly stayed on his talking points. But the trip was not without controversy. His combative answer to a reporter\u2019s question \u2013 combined with video of Paul appearing to avoid an immigration activist \u2014 absorbed most of the attention surrounding his visit. Experts say it\u2019s unlikely those story lines will derail any progress Paul has made in the state with voters, but his comments could underscore questions some Republicans have about his foreign policy, especially as he seeks to broaden his appeal. Off-message At his first stop on Monday, which actually took place in Omaha, Nebraska, near the Iowa state line, Paul held a news conference after touring a tech startup venue with Nebraska GOP Senate hopeful Ben Sasse. Asked if he still supported phasing out foreign aid to Israel, Paul fired back at a reporter for \u201cmischaracterizing\u201d his position and staunchly denied that he had ever proposed such legislation. But it\u2019s well-documented that he called for ending all foreign aid, including assistance to Israel, and sought support in Congress for his proposal in 2011. In Iowa, Paul stressed that he never introduced legislation that solely \u201ctargeted\u201d Israel and argued that he strongly favors sending money to the country. Still, he added, Israel will be better positioned in the long run without foreign assistance. \u201cEvery country ultimately would be better off to be independent,\u201d he said on Tuesday. Paul is also taking heat for quickly exiting a tense moment when an immigration activist confronted Rep. Steve King at a fundraiser while the two lawmakers ate dinner Monday night. Video of the incident shows Paul, at the behest of his press aide, quickly getting up from the table and getting away from the confrontation. Paul said he was stepping away to do interviews with local media. Whether or not those interviews were hastened because of the activist is unclear. Still, the video quickly spread and it was enough for critics to frame a narrative that Paul bolted from an uncomfortable exchange. The dust-ups in his trip made headlines and ate up much of the coverage of his Iowa visit. David Kochel, Mitt Romney\u2019s Iowa strategist in 2008 and 2012, said he doubts caucus voters will judge Paul negatively for leaving after \u201csomeone tried to sandbag him.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s fine on that,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for Israel, that\u2019s a little more difficult. You have social conservatives in Iowa who very much feel the need to be in solidarity with Israel \u2013 not just Christian conservatives, but it\u2019s also national security conservatives.\u201d While Paul has voted in favor of sending more aid to Israel this year and has proposed cutting off aid to the Palestinians, his past statements and views on foreign policy are rooted in his libertarian leanings \u2014 a perspective still largely outside of mainstream Republican thought. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably have work to do on that issue,\u201d Kochel continued. \u201cIt could be one of those things that might limit his potential.\u201d Still, Kochel thinks Paul is the current frontunner in Iowa among prospective candidates. He points to Paul\u2019s frequent travel to the state, his efforts to build a wider GOP, and the network of supporters built by his father\u2019s presidential campaigns the past two cycles. \u2018Son of Ron\u2019 In the 2012 Iowa caucuses, former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas finished with 21% of the vote, just slightly behind Romney and former Sen. Rick Santorum \u2014 who tied for first at 25%. Many of Ron Paul\u2019s supporters were previously inactive in politics, citing a lack of candidates who represented their views. \u201cYour father cured my apathy,\u201d one man told Rand Paul at an event in Council Bluffs. Building off Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 momentum, the so-called liberty faction of Iowa\u2019s Republican Party eventually took control of party leadership. Mainstream Republicans, with the support of Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, wrestled back control earlier this year. But Paul knows he needs more than just the libertarian wing of the party. As seen in his trip this week, he\u2019s going after the state\u2019s social conservatives and business Republicans, too. \u201cPaul is attempting to pivot from being \u2018Son of Ron,\u2019 so to speak,\u201d said Dennis Goldford, professor of politics at Drake University in Des Moines. \u201cHe\u2019s never going to deny that or reject it. But he has the view that Republicans need a broader base or broader range than some other candidates have maintained.\u201d Paul spoke at five GOP offices this week and five other events in a tour that took him around the state in a 730-mile loop. At each stop, Paul\u2019s main message sought to counter post-2012 perceptions that the Republican Party should change its message. \u201cI say \u2018hell no.\u2019 We have to be more boldly for what we\u2019re for,\u201d he said at the GOP office in Davenport. It\u2019s a mantra he has repeated in his travels across the country this year. But he proposes doing so with some traditional and unorthodox ideas for mainstream Republicans. Part of that includes a push to speak out against domestic surveillance programs and mount a strong defense of the Fourth Amendment. He has also been aggressive in courting voters and even Democrats to help expand the party. To do that, he\u2019s urging for reform to the criminal justice system with reduced sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and the restoration of voting rights to nonviolent felons after they get out of jail. In Northwest Iowa, home to many of the state\u2019s social conservatives, Paul placed an evangelical spin on his message. \u201cMany of us are Christians, we believe in a second chance in our religion. Anybody here who\u2019s not a sinner, raise their hand,\u201d he said Monday night at a fundraiser in Okoboji. \u201cWe believe in redemption, should the law allow people a second chance.\u201d But that\u2019s about as deep as Paul waded into social issues during the trip. He didn\u2019t talk about abortion, contraception or same-sex marriage until audience members asked him about the issues at one of his final events. Asked whether he supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, Paul said he \u201cfavors the concept\u201d of traditional marriage but argued the federal government should stay out marriage entirely. \u201cI don\u2019t want to register my guns in Washington or my marriage,\u201d he said. The previous past two winners of Iowa caucuses, Santorum and Mike Huckabee, both ran on a vocal platform with regard to social issues. Goldford said if Paul doesn\u2019t devote more attention to those topics, someone else will step in to fill in the void. \u201cTo function in Iowa he\u2019s going to have to address the concerns of conservative evangelicals because Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are going to do that,\u201d he said. Paul left Iowa before this weekend\u2019s annual summit hosted by the Family Leader, a group that\u2019s influential with social conservatives in the state. Guest speakers include Cruz, Huckabee, Santorum, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Paul said he couldn\u2019t make it due to a scheduling conflict. But he indicated he\u2019d be back. \u201cYou have to meet people four, five, six times in Iowa because they expect a real personal touch, and I think it\u2019s actually one of the good things about the process,\u201d he told reporters, before needlessly adding: \u201cif I decide to do this.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Obama looks at what he can do without Congress More than 11 million immigrants now live illegally in America Possibilities include work permits for a few million of them Both parties agree the system is broken, but can't agree on a fix With Congress mired in dysfunction over immigration, President Barack Obama says he\u2019ll do what he can to sidestep the legislative logjam. One possibility: using presidential authority to remove the threat of possible deportation for a few million immigrants living illegally in the country, a step that conservatives decry as amnesty. Here is a look at how we got here and steps Obama could take in coming months to address what all parties agree is a broken immigration system and boost the Democratic brand, though not necessarily in this year\u2019s congressional elections. What is the problem? An estimated 11 million or more immigrants are living illegally in the United States, many of them for years or even decades. They work, go to school and otherwise participate in American society even though they broke the law coming here and lack papers allowing them to stay. Father and son reunite after 12 years House passes $694 million border bill King defends comments on immigrant kids An increase in tougher enforcement laws and resources without any corresponding legal remedies for undocumented immigrants led to the huge illegal population. White House mulls steps on immigration it can take on its own While Obama\u2019s administration has deported or turned back more than 2 million people, it shifted the priority from working immigrants targeted under predecessor George W. Bush to criminals, more recent border crosses and those who keep re-entering illegally. Obama had promised to pass comprehensive immigration reform in his first term, but wound up focusing on economic recovery and health care reform. Now he wants to deliver to the Hispanic American community, the nation\u2019s largest minority demographic that strongly backed him in both election victories and is demanding an end to the deportations that it says split up families and tear the social fabric. What are we doing about it? Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive bill that would provide a path to legal status for the millions of long-term undocumented immigrants while also strengthening border security. The legislation supported by all Senate Democrats and 14 Republicans would require immigrants illegally living in the country to register with the government, pay a penalty, learn English and begin the process of applying for legal status. It also had the backing of the business community, organized labor and religious organizations. However, House Republicans have refused to consider the Senate bill, which Obama and Democrats claim would pass if put to a vote. Conservatives say the Senate plan amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers, arguing they should be sent back to their home countries because they drive up the size and cost of government while competing with U.S. citizens for jobs. Democrats want to remove the legal uncertainty for as many of the undocumented immigrants as possible, allowing them to continue living and working here so they can eventually gain legal status and possibly full citizenship. Didn\u2019t Obama already stop deporting some children of immigrants? In 2012, the Obama administration changed its policy by halting deportations of some immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. The move came after GOP Senators in 2010 blocked a Democratic bill known as the DREAM Act that would have done much the same thing. Republicans argue the step meant Obama stopped fully enforcing immigration laws, saying they now mistrust him to carry out provisions for stronger border security that they demand in any new legislation. Before going home for this year\u2019s summer recess, the GOP-led House voted to reverse Obama\u2019s previous executive actions on immigration and prevent future similar steps. The provision pushed by conservatives has zero chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate. What about the current immigrant surge in Texas? Tens of thousands of new arrivals from Central America, many of them unaccompanied children, have overwhelmed immigration facilities and services in Texas in recent months. Republicans, particularly conservatives, say two policy changes led to the surge \u2013 a 2008 anti-trafficking law that requires immigration hearings for most children arriving at the border, and Obama\u2019s 2012 decision to stop deporting some minors. Rick Perry says youths crossing the border is a \u2018side issue\u2019 Combined, the changes created a perception that children who make it into the United States won\u2019t get sent back, the critics argue. For now, the U.S. government considers the influx from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras a separate issue from the longstanding problem involving undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for years. House passes $694 million border bill Obama has asked for more money to speed the processing and care of the new arrivals, but said most of the Central Americans arriving now will be returned to their home countries. So now Obama is going to take more actions on his own? Yes. When it became clear this year that the House wouldn\u2019t take up the Senate immigration bill, Obama asked the Justice and Homeland Security departments to come up with steps he could take on his own. Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that one potential option would expand the deferred deportation program of 2012 for so-called DREAMers \u2013 children brought to America illegally by their families. Other possible steps include granting some kind of legal status to the foreign parents of U.S. citizens, and allowing some undocumented immigrants to apply for temporary work permits, the sources said. Border crisis: GOP falls into a trap The total number of immigrants affected could reach 5 million or more, some analysts say. \u201cThere are so many ways they could cut this pie and define and protect a class\u201d of undocumented immigrants, one source told CNN, adding that the decisions expected next month would examine \u201cwhat\u2019s possible from a legal perspective, a policy perspective and also what\u2019s possible from a political perspective.\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that \u201cthe review of what the President is able to do is still ongoing,\u201d and whatever options emerge will not be as enduring or as strong as what Congress could do under the Senate legislation. What is the response? The Hispanic American community wants to see the details, but supports Obama acting on his own. However, it would protest if it considers the steps too timid. As expected, conservatives react with alarm and outrage. GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, perhaps the most vocal opponent on immigration reform, said last week that Obama \u201cwants to issue another 5-6 million work permits to illegal immigrants of any age.\u201d That would violate existing law and be \u201ca direct affront to every single unemployed American, particularly those in our poorest most vulnerable American communities,\u201d Sessions said. House Republicans who recently authorized a lawsuit against Obama for changing how the health care reform law gets enforced warn of another legal challenge over further executive action on immigration. Why is this so hard? The long-term political stakes are huge. If reforms allow millions of immigrants now facing potential deportation to get eventual citizenship, Democrats would get the credit and the likely political loyalty of generations of Hispanic American voters. Republicans, meanwhile, are deeply divided over how to proceed. Conservatives warn that approving the Senate reforms or something similar would ensure that a Democrat occupies the White House for years to come. Rubio plunges into immigration debate head first More moderate Republicans argue that failing to do so would bring the same result. \u201cWe must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d the Republican National Committee concluded in its post-mortem of the 2012 presidential election, in which GOP nominee Mitt Romney lost to Obama. \u201cIf we do not, our party\u2019s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.\u201d Despite that conclusion, House Republicans have blocked the comprehensive reforms passed by the Senate. Obama said last week such division leaves him no recourse but to act on his own. If he does before the November election, as expected, it could hurt some Democrats running in traditionally conservative states. That would amount to short-term pain for potential long-term gain.

            "article_content": "Cruz opposed House GOP leaders' border bill that was pulled from floor The Texas senator wanted conservatives to change Obama immigration policy Cruz angered his fellow Republicans with Obamacare push that many blame for shutdown He has expressed his support for some anti-establishment candidates in the primaries Ted Cruz appears to have played a key role in the emergency border bill falling apart in the House. Less than 24 hours before GOP leaders pulled a vote on Thursday on the $659 million emergency measure to address the crisis provoked by a surge of migrant youth from Central America, the arch-conservative Republican senator had lobbied House allies to scrap it unless it included a provision to toughen deportation policy. Support for the bill as written was already tenuous at best, but Cruz held sway, for the moment anyway. Negotiations were scheduled to run into Thursday night with a GOP meeting set for Friday morning to discuss next steps. Still, the meddling complicated an already arduous process in both the House and the Senate of marshaling support to help thousands minors, many unaccompanied and still stuck in a legal limbo that is stressing immigration services. Ground zero for the crisis is the Rio Grande crossing in Cruz\u2019s home state of Texas. Has his reasons Cruz had his reasons and it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s figuratively crossed the Capitol to buck Republican leaders to make his case to conservative members. The move that heightened legislative uncertainty most likely leaves President Barack Obama able to throw pretty sharp darts at House Republicans. Obama\u2019s sure to blame them for doing nothing about the border crisis as Congress stops work for a month-long summer recess, likely leaving him to use his executive powers to do what he can in the meantime. Even though getting a bitterly divided Congress to agree on a common approach on the border crisis in a midterm election year was a long shot from the start, it appears lawmakers in both parties won\u2019t even have the political cover as they arrive home of having voted for or against something in their own chamber. \u201cThe Obama White House should put Ted Cruz on the payroll,\u201d Republican Rep. Peter King of New York quipped to the Washington Post following Cruz\u2019s latest foray into House affairs. Cruz vs. Boehner on border bill Should Congress leave for break? 'Border is not open to Central Americans' What was he after anyway? Cruz, a tea party star who may have presidential ambitions, met with House allies on Wednesday night in is office where pizza was served. His office wasn\u2019t saying much about it. But others who were there said he pushed them hard for a provision that would bar the Obama administration from expanding a policy that prevents deportation of immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. He urged them to oppose the emergency border bill backed by Speaker John Boehner and his lieutenants unless it defunded that policy. Cruz likens it to amnesty even though it does not convey legal status. California GOP Rep. Devin Nunes said Cruz\u2019s intervention was \u201cnot helpful.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking to me that some of our members are willing to turn their voting cards over to the Senate or to outside groups,\u201d Nunes said of those following Cruz\u2019 lead. But Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican who attended the dinner meeting with Cruz, said the attendees did not make a pact on the House bill and denied that he twisted any arms to kill it, as Republican leadership aides have claimed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be accurate,\u201d he told CNN Senior Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash. \u201cTed\u2019s a listener.\u201d Remember the shutdown Rep. King: Cruz living in his own world Cruz: I don't work for the party bosses Cruz accuses GOP of 'trickery' The scenario on Thursday conjured up memories of last fall, when Cruz led the charge against funding Obamacare that helped draw Congress into a government shutdown. At the time, Cruz rallied tea party allies in the House to join his dogged opposition to Obama\u2019s signature health law, which remains a partisan political flashpoint. Instead of working for compromise in the days before the shutdown, Cruz took to the Senate floor for 21 hours to push against Obamacare. The shutdown lasted 16 days. Boehner and other Republicans admitted the tactic was a mistake and some, like Sen. John McCain, called it futile. \u201cIt was a fool\u2019s errand to start with. It was never going to succeed,\u201d McCain said then on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Cruz placed the blame squarely on Democrats and the White House and denied his role in provoking the shutdown, despite being branded by Democrats and even some Republicans as the architect of the standoff. And then there was Cruz and the debt ceiling. And the debt ceiling Just months later, Cruz again angered fellow Republicans by blocking a vote to raise the nation\u2019s borrowing authority so it could pay its bills. Republicans quickly scuttled Cruz\u2019s filibuster attempt, which would have forced at least 60 senators to vote in favor of raising the debt limit to avoid a U.S. debt default. That would have forced some Republicans into the awkward position of voting against the measure and being seen as responsible for another shutdown or voting for it  and hurting their standing with conservatives. That procedural move provoked a contentious exchange between Cruz and his GOP colleagues as he accused the Republican leadership of \u201ctrickery.\u201d Cautious on primaries Cruz has since cautiously waded into primary politics this election cycle by linking up \u2013 often quietly \u2013 with conservative groups that are backing challengers and opposing establishment incumbents in several Senate primaries. Cruz appeared in a Senate Conservatives Fund ad backing a tea party-backed candidate vying for an open Oklahoma Senate seat in June. And that group has poured millions of dollars supporting challenges to Republican incumbents, including state Sen. Chris McDaniel\u2019s contentious challenge to veteran Sen. Thad Cochran and Matt Bevin\u2019s failed battle against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Cruz also penned a fundraising appeal for the Madison Project, a PAC that set its sights on dethroning establishment figures ranging from Cochran to McConnell to Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts.

            "article_content": "Ryan says Obama impeachment talk is a \"ridiculous gambit by the President\" GOP lawsuit against Obama is to show \"we are not going to take this sitting down\" Republicans have no confidence in Obama for immigration reform Ryan says notion must be broken that government can fix everything Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is known to glide through the hallways of Capitol Hill with headphones in his ears. It\u2019s a tactic he employs to avoid pesky reporters. But the Republican faced down a flurry of questions on Wednesday at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast with journalists. The potential White House contender offered up his views on a range of topics, like climate change, immigration reform, and his newly-released plan to overhaul federal poverty programs. He bristled at political questions, particularly one about his 2016 thinking. He opted to focus on policy matters and pepper his answers with the kind of opaque beltway jargon \u2014 terms like \u201cpay-fors\u201d and \u201cscoring\u201d \u2014 that betray his Washington pedigree. Ryan, a known fitness buff, ordered a pile of eggs and a side of fruit, declining the sausages and potatoes typically served at the Monitor breakfasts, a Washington political ritual. Here\u2019s some of what he said: House Republicans mock the President Paul Ryan grills IRS Commissioner Ryan, Paul reach out to African Americans On impeaching President Barack Obama: \u201cI see this as sort of a ridiculous gambit by the President and his political team to try and change the narrative, raise money and turn out their base and raise money for an election that isn\u2019t going to go their way. And I will just leave it at that.\u201d On the House Republican lawsuit against Obama: \u201cWhat John (Boehner) is doing is expressing frustration that we are not using the power of the purse. All he is trying to do is stand up for congressional prerogatives. And that is why the lawsuit has intellectual merit, because we want to show that we are not going to take this sitting down.\u201d \u201cThe President is issuing executive orders and regulations that exceed the parameters of the statutes that give the authority in the first place. It\u2019s important to make that distinction. That\u2019s why I will vote for it. Because I stand with the speaker in thinking that the President has exceeded his authority. Let\u2019s make sure that we don\u2019t serve the temptation that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter, is the superior branch of government on all things constitutional. That\u2019s not necessarily the case.\u201d So why not impeach?: \u201cThis does not rise to the high crimes and misdemeanor level. This is a huge difference of opinion which can be litigated in the court of public opinion through elections, which should be litigated through Congress through appropriations and the power of the purse, and there are other routes that are being pursued. But in this case, I think the President has exceeded the statutory boundaries that are written into the laws. There are executive orders that are within the boundaries of statutes to implement and execute laws. But when you do things, regulations and executive orders, that exceed the statutes, the clear letter of the law, that is lawmaking. And the lawmaking occurs in the legislative branch, not the executive branch.\u201d On opposing reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank: \u201cI do believe that the Ex-Im Bank is representational of some of the crony capitalism that we have in Washington: Big government and big business joining in a common cause to hand out preferences. I believe that we as Republicans should be pro-market, not necessarily pro-business. And that means pro-market is fighting for equal access to opportunity, the rule of law, self-government and fairness.\u201d \u201cWith the Ex-Im Bank, when most of the money goes to a handful of really large connected companies, and a lot of it just goes to one company, that to me isn\u2019t quality under the law. That to me isn\u2019t free enterprise. \u2026 Could the thing be reformed? Of course. Is that better than the status quo? Yes. But at the end of the day, I really do believe there are so many more things we should be dedicating taxpayer resources to than handing it out to select companies.\u201d On what government can do to fight climate change: \u201cClimate change occurs no matter what. The question is, can and should the federal government do something about it? And I would argue the federal government, with all its tax and regulatory schemes, can\u2019t. And all it will do is end up hurting our country, our people, and especially low income individuals.\u201d On whether House Republicans will support some kind of immigration reform before the next presidential election: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see in this climate, it really is. I think we need to deal narrowly with the border crisis. But because of the demonstrated distrust of the President in enforcing the laws, it is very hard to see how Republicans can come together with a solution that we expect the president to enforce.\u201d \u201cYou know that I am a fan of immigration reform. I have been in favor of immigration reform for many, many years. We have a broken system that needs fixing, for the rule of law, for national security, for economic security. But having said all of that, there is just no confidence or faith that the President will faithfully discharge his duties in executes and implementing the laws as written by Congress at this time.\u201d On his draft proposal to restructure federal poverty programs: \u201cIn many cases, the federal government, in its war on poverty, has inadvertently displaced civil society, prodded out good things that are happening in our communities, when it should be supporting them. It should be manning supply lines, not dictating the front lines.\u201d \u201cAnd the other point, it has given the notion in our society that this isn\u2019t your problem. Pay your taxes. The government will fix this. The government fixes poverty. That\u2019s not true. We need to break those notions that so that everybody gets involved and does something in whatever way they can to make a difference in this area. And that is one of the messages we need to pound over and over and over if we are going to be successful in reintegrating the poor and getting them from where the are to where they want to be.\u201d On whether he would support the restoration of voting rights for felons: \u201cI think that\u2019s something that we should look at. It\u2019s something we need to definitely consider. The way I look at this is, we want to encourage the notion that people should be able to earn and deserve a second chance in life. That is how you get people from where they are to the better life that they aspire for themselves. And that should be is something that we should champion in society. And I think this is among the issues that ought to be considered.\u201d Is that a theme the GOP must do a better job of championing? \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on that.\u201d On his thinking about a possible presidential bid in 2016: \u201cThere really aren\u2019t deliberations. I am just doing my job, focusing on the here and now, on 2014, on the problems that are facing our country that I see in front of me right now.\u201d \u201cI consciously decided not to think about my personal ambitions or personal career moves, or how I can think about something after 2014. In 2015, at the appropriate time, Janna and I will sit down and have the proper deliberations and conversations that are necessary for that. But right now, I am focused on what I can in my job today. I think that\u2019s just a better use of my time, and it\u2019s more faithful to the people I represent to be focusing on what\u2019s in front of us at this time.\u201d Boehner: Impeachment talk a Dem \u2018scam\u2019 to raise money",

            "article_content": "President Obama has been pushing infrastructure repair in pitch to middle class Events around the world overshadowed the President's message this week Obama faces decisions on response to airliner shoot-down President has expressed support for Israeli operations in Gaza It was supposed to be a week focused on domestic issues to bolster the chances of Democrats in November midterms. President Barack Obama wanted to drive down a virtual highway, talk about rebuilding infrastructure while standing in front of a bridge, and otherwise push his proposals to build middle class opportunity \u2013 all rejected so far by Republicans. Instead, violence erupting in the sky over Ukraine and on the ground in the Middle East set the agenda. On three straight days, Obama ended up in front of reporters for previously unscheduled statements on the volatile developments halfway around the world that obscured the planned White House messaging. Such buffeting by world events adds to a perception driven by Obama\u2019s critics that he lags behind foreign policy issues instead of getting out front. Obama: Truth about MH17 must be known On GPS: Krugman grades Obama Obama calls plane crash a 'wake-up call' On GPS: Is Obamacare working? \u201cThere is a sense that this White House is being driven by events as opposed to sort of driving its own agenda,\u201d noted CNN political analyst and Politico reporter Maggie Haberman. Toss in the immigration crisis along the southern border, with tens of thousands of unaccompanied children overwhelming available facilities, and \u201cit adds to a sense that Obama is sort of adrift in an out-of-control world,\u201d Haberman said. Facing a low approval rating in polls and the possibility of losing control of the Senate to Republicans in November, the White House has tried to focus on an Obama staple \u2013 the struggle of everyday Americans to get by. In recent weeks, the President has shared burgers in Virginia, sipped beer and shot pool in Colorado, and munched on Texas barbecue to demonstrate his connection to working Americans. Gaza crisis boils over The past week offered similar opportunities. On Tuesday, Obama tested out a car simulator in McLean, Virginia, and used the occasion to criticize his GOP foes. \u201cRepublicans in Congress keep blocking or voting down some of the ideas that would have the biggest impact on middle-class and working families,\u201d Obama said at the research facility. Meanwhile, the Middle East crisis reached a boiling point with mounting violence between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza. Wednesday, he called for meetings on domestic policy issues, but then Secretary of State John Kerry came to the White House after returning from China, Afghanistan and the Iran nuclear talks in Vienna. Late in the day, Obama announced a new set of economic sanctions against Russian banks, energy companies, defense companies and some officials due to the administration\u2019s contention Moscow has failed to take steps to end the Ukraine conflict. No domestic issues came up. Obama: Deaths an unspeakable outrage More move against Obama on border crisis New sanctions on Russia over Ukraine \u201cI\u2019ve repeatedly made it clear that Russia must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border into Ukraine; that Russia must urge separatists to release their hostages and support a cease-fire; that Russia needs to pursue internationally mediated talks and agree to meaningful monitors on the border,\u201d Obama told reporters in the White House briefing room. Obama also discussed a recount of votes in the Afghanistan presidential election, the nuclear negotiations with Iran and the collapse of a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Ukraine tragedy upstages infrastructure event Thursday was little different. Obama traveled to Wilmington, Delaware, for remarks on infrastructure funding, followed by a trip to New York for Democratic fund-raising events. Again, a development abroad dominated the focus \u2013 reports from Ukraine of a Malaysia Air jetliner apparently shot down by a surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard. With images of burning debris on TV screens across the nation, Obama started his remarks in Delaware with a reference to what happened. \u201cThe world is watching reports of a downed passenger jet near the Russia-Ukraine border. And it looks like it may be a terrible tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re working to determine whether there were American citizens on board,\u201d he added, before getting back to creating jobs to help the middle class. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden explained why he was late to speak to a class of African-American women enrolled in a technology training course in Detroit: He was on the phone with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko talking about the plane \u201cblown out of the sky.\u201d Is Obama doing enough on border crisis? Roads and bridges 'not socialism' When Obama flew to New York that evening on Air Force One, he spoke with Poroshenko and Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia. Later he would also talk with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Kerry. Before arriving back in Washington late that night, Obama also spoke with his national security team and was briefed on the latest efforts to support an investigation into the air disaster. Friday morning, after meeting with members of his Cabinet, Obama again appeared in the White House briefing room to state what many suspected \u2013 the United States believed that the plane was downed by a missile shot from an area of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed rebels. \u201cThis was a global tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cAn Asian airliner was destroyed in European skies, filled with citizens from many countries.  So there has to be a credible international investigation into what happened.\u201d He also said he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the worsening violence and Israel\u2019s ground invasion of Gaza. Minutes later, Obama got back to his domestic agenda, stopping by the first lady\u2019s \u201cstate dinner\u201d for kids who created winning healthy lunch recipes. He told the audience how much he loved the event, and rather than having to focus on bloodshed around the world, he described how he loses his mind over a good bowl of chips and guacamole.

            "article_content": "Campaigning for midterm election is in full swing Democrats and Republicans aim to appeal to respective political bases Republicans suing Obama, Democrats unveil middle class agenda Control of the Senate is at stake in November balloting If it wasn\u2019t already clear that Congress is done legislating this year, the scene inside and outside the Capitol on Wednesday illustrated that the midterm elections are in full swing. Just before the House Rules Committee began authorizing the Republican lawsuit against President Barack Obama, House Democrats gathered on the East Front steps just below the room where that hearing was to take place to unveil their \u201cmiddle class jump start\u201d agenda. With their dueling messages, they hoped to energize their respective political bases and propel supporters to the polls in November. The GOP decision to sue Obama over delaying the Obamacare employer mandate puts the politically-charged health care law \u2013 an issue that motivates the most ardent GOP voters \u2013 front and center. House Democrats argued in offering their middle class initiative that Republican priorities in Congress were skewed toward wealthy special interests at the expense of working families. Standing in front of sizable red white and blue convention-style placards with the phrases \u201cWomen Succeed,\u201d  \u201cAffordable Education\u201d and \u201cMake it in America,\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra tried to contrast the two political parties. \u201cYou can either sue the president of the United States, or you can do your job here at the House of Representatives and pass laws that help the middle class and working families,\u201d the California Democrat said. Citing the GOP lawsuit as a factor affecting the midterms, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi in a Wednesday interview in the Washington Post set an ambitious goal of picking up 25 seats in the House. Democrats would need to take back 17 seats to regain control, a feat most Democrats concede isn\u2019t likely, especially in the sixth year of Obama\u2019s presidency. That\u2019s when a president\u2019s party historically loses seats. Kohn: Dear Speaker Boehner: Do your job instead Midterm focus for Democrats: Women Congressional Democrats on both sides of the Capitol are directing much of their message toward women, who they view as the critical voting bloc. Obama won re-election in 2012 with support from 55% of women compared to 44% for GOP nominee Mitt Romney. In an off-year congressional election, Democrats know they can\u2019t expect the same turnout. But they\u2019re talking about child care, contraception coverage, and education to maximize their chances. Democrats unveiled their \u201c100 Day Action plan\u201d on Wednesday, pledging to hold votes on bills focusing on women, if they win back the House. Those measures would be targeted at raising the minimum wage, ensuring equal pay for equal work, and boosting access to early childhood education. \u201cOur agenda for women and families is \u2018When Women Succeed, America Succeeds,\u2019\u201d Pelosi said. This is not just the title of our agenda. This is a statement of absolute fact.  And our agenda presents a stark contrast to what the Republicans have done to roll back women\u2019s rights and limit women\u2019s opportunities.\u201d Women\u2019s work: The GOP\u2019s glass ceiling Dems in the Senate In the Senate, Democrats seized on the Supreme Court\u2019s big Obamacare decision last month that employers of some for-profit companies were not required to provide insurance plans that covered contraception if they opposed on religious grounds. A Democratic bill to reverse that decision was blocked this week. But the Democratic narrative on the Supreme Court fits with what many in the party have labeled a Republican \u201cwar on women.\u201d  Pelosi and other Democrats emphasized that decision was made by \u201cfive men\u201d who were effectively dictating whether or not women could get access to contraceptives. \u2018Over and over again\u2019 \u201cThis is 2014, not 1914. Most Americans thought this was settled long, long ago. But for some reason, Republicans keep dragging us back here - over and over and over again,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said. But the GOP is positioned well to retake control of the Senate in November, and top Republican leaders recognized that the issue could damage their standing among women if they didn\u2019t respond. Two female Republican senators \u2013 Kelly Ayotte and Deborah Fischer \u2013 wrote an editorial on Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal arguing Democrats were distorting the issue for political gain. \u201cContrary to the misleading rhetoric, the Hobby Lobby ruling does not take away women\u2019s access to birth control. No employee is prohibited from purchasing any Food and Drug Administration approved drug or device, and contraception remains readily available and accessible for all women nationwide,\u201d the two senators wrote. Senate Republicans introduced their own counterproposal that would codify that no employer can block a woman\u2019s access to FDA-approved contraception. Hobby Lobby is the retail business that successfully appealed the contraception case. Supreme Court women lash out at birth control decision A move to rally Republican base As the battle over a major women\u2019s issue played out in the Senate, House Republicans took their first step to approve a lawsuit arguing Obama violated the Constitution by making changes to Obamacare on his own instead of allowing Congress to act. House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions presided over a hearing with legal experts, and insisted the GOP move to sue was not about politics, but about protecting the authority of the legislative branch. \u201cThe separated powers between these branches are there in order to ensure that no one person would trample on the rights of others,\u201d the Texas Republican said. \u201cMy fear is that our nation is currently facing the exact threat that the Constitution is designed to avoid. Branches of government have always attempted to exert their influence on other branches, but the President, in my opinion, has gone too far,\u201d Sessions added. But the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Louise Slaughter, wasn\u2019t buying it. The suit was being \u201cused to appease members of the Republican party who will not rest until President Obama is charged with articles of impeachment,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a partisan, political stunt, timed to peak in the House of Representatives in November right as the midterm elections are happening.\u201d Motivating voters But both sides believe the suit will motivate voters. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released Web ads on Wednesday targeting 21 Republican incumbents and challengers with this message \u2013 \u201cTell Republicans: Don\u2019t use our taxpayer dollars for your frivolous lawsuit.\u201d As the hearing was about to start, the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm tweeted an \u201curgent\u201d message urging supporters to sign an online petition with this: \u201cStand with House Republicans as they protect your constitutional liberties and the country from continued executive abuse.\u201d The message was another tool for the campaign committee to gather names and contract information to help solicit money to support their candidates. Despite the argument by Republican candidates that Obama and his party are failing a competency test on a range of issues from the economy to the immigration crisis at the Southwest border, Obamacare is still a foundation of their campaigns. GOP candidates are expected to run ads focusing on the health law they despise, targeting specific problems voters in their districts are experiencing with it, such as cuts to a popular Medicare program.

            "article_content": "NEW: Texas legislators unveil a proposal to hasten some deportations Divided on immigration, legislators tackle the surge of Central American children President Obama wants $3.7 billion to bolster an overwhelmed system U.S. government sends about 40 recent immigrants back to Honduras Talk about a tall order. A Congress that can agree on little has 12 scheduled work days to forge a compromise on one of the most volatile issues \u2013 immigration \u2013 before going home for all of August. Failure to find agreement in the next three weeks means no immediate help for a U.S. immigration system overwhelmed by tens of thousands of children from Central America illegally entering the country in recent months. Republicans and Democrats are refining their opening positions this week as officials scramble to keep up with the unprecedented influx amid the hyperpartisan political climate of a congressional election year. Both sides appear supportive of spending more money. The sticking points involve how much to spend on what, as well as the broader policy issue of who gets deported and how fast. What\u2019s happened so far Immigration reform a political casualty? Activist: Border a 'militarized zone' Migrants' harsh journey through Mexico Facing chronic violence at home and motivated by the belief they won\u2019t get sent back by the United States, an unprecedented surge of unaccompanied minors from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador continues traveling through Mexico to cross the border into Texas. Administration officials told a congressional hearing last week that almost 60,000 arrived since October 1, with up to 30,000 more expected by the end of the current fiscal year on September 30 \u2013 well over twice the figure of the previous year. They face an immigration limbo of overcrowded holding centers, followed by transfer or release to await deportation hearings that can take months or years to happen and many don\u2019t attend. President Barack Obama last week requested $3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to respond to what his administration calls an urgent humanitarian situation. The request includes $1.8 billion to provide temporary care for children while they are in government custody, and $1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts while cracking down on smugglers. Another $300 million would help Mexico and the Central American governments discourage desperate parents from paying smugglers to get their children into the United States. Also, the Department of Homeland Security announced Monday it had sent about 40 recent arrivals including adults and children back to their home country of Honduras. It said more deportations to the three Central American nations were expected soon. First group of Hondurans deported from new U.S. facility Republicans contend Obama created the problem by halting deportations of some child immigrants in recent years, a move they say invited more to come. They want any additional resources now to bolster border security and swiftly send back the new arrivals. Democrats argue that additional resources should speed up the processing of the child immigrants, with faster hearings to determine if they have the right to stay and quicker deportations if a judge issues a removal order. Meanwhile, the divisive issue plays out on streets in some affected areas, with protesters in one California town blocking buses transporting new arrivals to temporary facilities. The House A Republican working group appointed by House Speaker John Boehner to come up with recommendations for legislation reports back Tuesday, with its findings expected to outline the GOP negotiating stance. Secretary Johnson: We will send you back Red News/Blue News: Immigration Boehner already is under pressure from Obama and Democrats to bring up a broad Senate-passed immigration reform measure that would boost border security while providing a path to legal status for millions of longtime undocumented immigrants in the country. Conservatives oppose the Senate plan as an amnesty, knowing it would add millions of likely Democratic voters to election rolls. However, moderate Republicans fear continued GOP resistance to immigration reform supported by a broad coalition of business, faith and social leaders undermines the party\u2019s chances to increase its popularity with Hispanic Americans \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest minority and an increasingly crucial election demographic. Boehner and other Republican leaders may consider the current border crisis an opportunity to show their willingness to agree on a narrow immigration measure while avoiding the sweep of comprehensive reforms pushed by Obama and Democrats in the Senate proposal. The 2008 trafficking law Republicans and some Democrats appear focused on changing a 2008 law designed to crack down on child trafficking. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Action Act requires deportation hearings for child immigrants who show up at the border from all countries except for U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada. It distinguished between neighboring and non-bordering countries because Mexicans or Canadians turned back at the border are in their home country, unlike those from Central American nations and elsewhere. Bipartisan border bill proposed A proposal by two Texas legislators \u2013 Republican Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar \u2013 would remove the hearing requirement, treating child immigrants from all countries the same. To address Democratic concerns, the measure also would allow children who are the victims of human trafficking or have a credible threat of persecution to appear before a judge to seek asylum in the United States, with a decision required within 72 hours of a child\u2019s claim. It was unclear if the Cornyn-Cuellar proposal would gain support from House Republicans, while a group of conservative southern House Democrats planned to meet Monday night with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to discuss the issue. No Senate Democrats have signed onto the Cornyn-Cuellar plan, with several party leaders including Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin of Illinois, Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez of New Jersey expressing skepticism at the concept. Durbin set two conditions for his support: legal representation for child immigrants at deportation hearings, and proper social conditions back home if they get deported. The Cornyn-Cuellar proposal relies on existing law that calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to seek out pro bono legal counsel for the child immigrants, but it contains no requirement that they have legal counsel. \u201cI think that would be a disaster for our immigration system,\u201d Cornyn said, warning of a prolonged hearing process that would \u201cserve the goal of some of the people who want to come because it would be years before they were ever deported.\u201d At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that talks with legislators continued on possible revisions to the 2008 law, or leaving it intact while coming up with a separate proposal to give Johnson more flexibility. Earnest made clear that the administration wants arriving immigrants to get a full determination of their legal right to stay in the country. \u201cWe certainly would ensure that they receive the due process to which they are entitled,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cBut once that due process has run its course, if it\u2019s found that those individuals do not have a legal basis for remaining in the country, we would like the secretary of homeland security to be able to exercise the discretion necessary to repatriate that individual or those individuals.\u201d Political fallout With all 435 House seats and about a third of the Senate up for election in November, both parties seek maximum political advantage from the issue. Republicans criticize Obama\u2019s policies for causing the border crisis and complain his administration has been slow to react. Some Democrats joined Republicans in saying the President should have gone to the Texas border to witness the situation for himself when he visited the Lone Star State last week. Obama and Democrats argue the broad reforms they support, which House Republicans have blocked after the Senate passed them, demonstrate their commitment to the plight of immigrants. Earnest noted that Obama proposed his $3.7 billion emergency funding request last week, with no substantive response as yet. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of talk from Republicans about how urgent and pressing the situation is, but not a lot of action when it comes to acting on \u2026 a detailed proposal that the President put forward eight days ago,\u201d he said. In a display of the high stakes involved, the White House planned to meet Wednesday with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to discuss concerns over expedited deportations, and also provide a briefing on Obama\u2019s funding request to the Senate.

            "article_content": "New glasses, repaired back, Rick Perry is on the move He is reengaging with the GOP's conservative base Immigration helped sink his 2012 presidential campaign But it's putting him back in the spotlight now with his Obama meeting Two years removed from his disastrous 2012 presidential bid, Rick Perry is fully recovered from back surgery, sporting new glasses, reengaging with the Republican conservative base, and showing signs that he\u2019s considering another run for the White House. Immigration policy helped sink the Texas governor\u2019s previous bid, but it has now put him back in the spotlight. He met on Wednesday with President Barack Obama, who\u2019s under fire over the surge of undocumented minors on the southern border. Obama accepted Perry\u2019s offer for a sit-down following a sharp exchange with the White House. Last week, White House spokesman Josh Earnest mocked his message on immigration, saying \u201cthe truth is it\u2019s hard to take seriously Governor Perry\u2019s concerns.\u201d Perry points to his state\u2019s long border with Mexico as ground zero for the crush of mostly children entering the United States illegally. 5 Reasons Gov. Rick Perry is underrated Texas judge to Congress: Do your job Obama agrees to meet with Gov. Perry Teen: I came to U.S. to escape gangs Immigration in 75 seconds \u201cMy message to President Obama is to secure this border, Mr. President. Finally address this issue and secure this border,\u201d Perry said last week at a congressional hearing near the border in McAllen, Texas. But he may have disappointed fellow conservatives when he said that  he was \u201ctired of pointing fingers and blaming people.\u201d He added, \u201cI hope what we can do is come up with some solutions here.\u201d Perry used more muscular language days later when he said, \u201cthis is a failure of diplomacy. It is a failure of leadership from the administration in Washington, D.C.\u201d Jeff Miller, a senior Perry political adviser, told CNN that Perry \u201cis not saying anything different than what he\u2019s being advocating since 2010 \u2013 that \u2018we\u2019ve got to secure this border. There\u2019s a crisis going on.\u2019\u201d Obama wants $3.7 billion for immigration crisis But Miller said the current crisis is giving Perry a larger platform. \u201cRight now, because of the huge influx of these children crossing the border from Mexico, the media\u2019s paying more attention and more of the public is seeing the crisis the governor has been dealing with for years. Not a lot has changed, but now more people are listening to what the governor\u2019s saying,\u201d Miller said. Immigration helped sink Perry in 2012 While a real front-burner issue in his state, Perry is also seeing political stars align. Immigration was the issue that damaged him more than any other when he ran for president last time, people close to him say. Perry to Obama: visit the border Gov. Perry: Immigrants told what to say Gov. Perry on controversial gay comments Perry launched his presidential campaign in August 2011, months after former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and the rest of the field of candidates had jumped in. Perry entered with lots of buzz and armed with big bucks and big name backers, and he quickly soared in national polls. But good times were fleeting, as Perry soon ran headfirst into Romney on illegal immigration. In a debate a month later, Perry defended his support for government-funded tuition at state schools for undocumented immigrants. He argued that if you didn\u2019t support such a move, \u201cI don\u2019t think you have a heart.\u201d But some of his Republican rivals considered that soft. \u201cGovernor Perry, you say you have got the experience. It\u2019s a bit like saying that, you know, the college coach that has lost 40 games in a row has the experience to go to the NFL,\u201d said Romney at another debate. Rick Perry\u2019s busy summer \u201cThe truth is, California \u2013 I\u2019ll say it again, California and Florida have both had no increase in illegal immigration and yours is up 60 percent.\u201d Romney added. Sources close to Perry tell CNN they believe that moment did more to hurt Perry with GOP primary voters than any other. Still, Perry suffered a more memorable blow with an epic gaffe in a November 2011 debate, when he forgot the third of three federal government departments that he had said he would eliminate. Perry\u2019s campaign limped on, but he called it quits after a disappointing fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Political resurrection? Fast forward two years. Perry decides not to run for re-election and is again making his pitch to conservative voters. Strickland on immigration: 'We've got a crisis' Congress spars over immigration Who's to blame for immigration crisis? Dems face immigration dilemma \u201cI have a simple suggestion \u2013 It is time for a little rebellion on the battlefield of ideas,\u201d Perry told the base at this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference. And Perry\u2019s summer travel plans hint toward a 2016 bid. He recently made his third trip over the past year to South Carolina \u2013 the state the holds the first southern primary. The visit to the Palmetto State precedes upcoming stops this summer in Iowa and New Hampshire. Perry even hosted a group of more than a dozen key New Hampshire Republicans at the Governor\u2019s Mansion in Austin a few weeks ago to wine and dine them, CNN is told. When he goes to the Granite State next month, it will be his first trip there since 2012, when he failed to make much of an impression at all on voters there. A veteran New Hampshire Republican ally setting up New Hampshire meetings tells CNN they are consciously doing things differently this time. They\u2019re opting for a manner more conducive to the way New Hampshire voters like to be approached, in a series of small, intimate meetings. But the tactical shortcomings from 2012 is not the only thing he\u2019s trying to improve ahead of another possible candidacy \u2013 it\u2019s also his readiness on a policy level. Perry urges Congress, Obama to work together on border security Perry sources admit that he simply wasn\u2019t up to speed on many of the key issues that confront a candidate, never mind a president. To overcome that, he now has multiple policy briefings a week, every week on issues ranging from economic policy, to education, to the environment to national security. One source tells CNN that if he is traveling and there is a think tank nearby, he will make a point of stopping for a briefing from experts. Perry has also been trying to do more international travel, attending the highbrow annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, going to Israel, and planning a trip later this year to China. But it\u2019s firestorm over immigration that may give Perry his biggest opportunity for political resurrection. Miller downplayed any impact from the current immigration crisis on a potential 2016 bid, saying \u201cto me these are two completely separate issues.\u201d But GOP analyst Ana Navarro, a CNN contributor who\u2019s close to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another possible 2016 GOP presidential contender, said \u201cPerry embodies an interesting dynamic regarding immigration. \u201cHe\u2019s a border enforcement guy with the experience of being a border state governor, but he\u2019s also shown compassion towards the human angle of the immigration debate,\u201d she said. Navarro added that \u201cIf he can somehow walk that tight rope, and be eloquent as to how he defends his position, it can show him as a pragmatist and be helpful.\u201d Reality check: 5 things you need to know about immigration crisis What Obama can and can\u2019t do on immigration CNN Films: Undocumented",

Henry Cuellar has lost patience with President Barack Obama over his response to the surge of minors from Central America crossing the southern border. The Texas lawmaker has criticized the administration\u2019s handling of what it has called a \u201chumanitarian crisis,\u201d and is urging a reluctant Obama to visit affected areas. He\u2019s also unwilling to write Obama a blank check for his $3.7 billion proposal to Congress for addressing the matter. \u201cWe just can\u2019t just trust the President and say we are going to give you exactly every penny you want,\u201d he told CNN in an interview. He also says he hopes Obama\u2019s decision to skip a border visit doesn\u2019t become his \u201cKatrina moment,\u201d a reference to how the heavily criticized federal response to the devastating hurricane and its aftermath was a defining moment in George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Cuellar\u2019s sentiment is right in line with Republican critics giving Obama heat over the unexpected influx of minors from Central America, many of them unaccompanied, and now mired in bureaucratic limbo and caught in the middle of a partisan political firefight. But Cuellar\u2019s a Democrat who is going after a President of the same party in a high-stakes election year during which immigration has gained prominence as a campaign issue. He told Fox News on Wednesday that he\u2019s gotten calls and visits from White House officials but is not giving much thought to that. Rep.: Obama one step behind on crisis Why are thousands flooding the border? Trouble on the border Mayor: Murrieta a 'compassionate' city What\u2019s going on? \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about my constituents,\u201d Cuellar said, noting the perils facing the tens of thousands of kids coming across the border in record numbers and overwhelming border and immigration services. While the current crisis is taking place in Cuellar\u2019s back yard in conservative-led Texas, his crossing of Obama and Democrats is not new for him. He was endorsed by the Conservative Club for Growth during his 2006 primary and backed George W. Bush in the 2000 election that propelled him to the White House. His bruising 2004 primary battle for the House seat then held by Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, who at the time headed the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, won him few friends in the caucus, comprised of Democrats. Cuellar endorsed Hillary Clinton over Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination and even raised money for her campaign. He also was one of 27 Democrats who voted against Wall Street reform legislation backed strongly by Obama early in his presidency. And in 2001, Republican Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s appointed Cuellar as Texas secretary of state, a post he held for 10 months. Democrats were unhappy about Cuellar\u2019s 2012 support of a redistricting proposal backed by the Perry administration. Critics said he supported the proposal in an effort to ensure a favorable district for himself,  a charge he denied. Some Democrats also question Cuellar\u2019s latest move: a plan to introduce bipartisan legislation on Thursday with Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn to address the southern border situation. That measure favored by GOP members would reverse a Bush-era law that allows illegal immigrant children from Central American countries to stay in the United States as their cases wend through the backlogged adjudication process.

Luis Gutierrez, a staunch immigration reform advocate, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire\u201d on Wednesday \u201cI wouldn\u2019t not support the legislation.\u201d After Obama\u2019s Texas trip, what now for the immigration crisis?

            "article_content": "There's an urgent problem, but not much consensus on what to do President Obama visits Texas, but not the border area of the immigrant surge Republicans want more National Guard troops; Obama says they won't help Various proposals emerge, including Obama's $3.7 billion funding request More money. More National Guard troops at the border. More children deported. A slew of possible solutions for the immigration crisis at the southern border emerged this week as President Barack Obama visited Texas. Despite the plentiful demands and proposals, a clear path forward for Obama and Congress remained uncertain in the hyper-partisan environment of an election year. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of children from Central America who illegally entered the United States in recent months still wait in an overwhelmed immigration system, some in overcrowded holding facilities in the Lone Star State and elsewhere. The White House calls it an \u201curgent\u201d humanitarian issue involving kids fleeing dire conditions in their home countries, while Republicans complain Obama invited it by halting deportations of some minors to create incentive for more to come. Now, they say, he wants to exploit it to push for immigration reforms they oppose. Boehner: Obama to blame for border crisis Gov. Perry: Secure that border, Obama Obama: We can solve immigration crisis Here are five questions about what happens now: 1) What did Obama\u2019s meeting with Texas Gov. Rick Perry accomplish? A shared helicopter ride rarely garnered so much attention. Obama and Perry, who hopes to burnish his national image after a disastrous bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, talked on the chopper from Fort Worth to Dallas on Wednesday. The President was in Texas for fund-raising events and talks with local figures on the immigration problem. Afterward, both sides called the meeting respectful and noted some common ground. But Perry also urged Obama to send 1,000 more National Guard troops to the border area and take other steps to boost security. In the end, a meeting that almost didn\u2019t happen amounted to a public display of engagement with little impact. Perry initially rejected an airport greeting with Obama, saying he wanted substantive talks. He relented when the President invited him to the meeting with local officials and others as well as the helicopter ride to get there. Texas governor lashes out at Obama over immigration crisis 2) Will more National Guard troops help? Not really. The Obama administration points to previous increases in border security resources, and as the President noted after meeting with Perry, the flood of unaccompanied minors crossing the border \u2013 57,000 in the past nine months \u2013 has little to do with evasion. In fact, the youngsters seek out the border patrol to get into U.S. custody, believing it means a high likelihood they\u2019ll end up living with relatives or family friends in America. However, tougher border security has been a Republican immigration demand for years, and the current problem gives them another chance to appeal to their conservative base by demanding the deployment of more forces. 3) What about the $3.7 billion in emergency money Obama seeks? The funding request announced Tuesday would bolster a range of federal efforts to deal with the immigration influx. It seeks $1.6 billion to strengthen customs and border efforts as well as crack down on smugglers bringing the youngsters from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador across Mexico to the United States. Another $300 million would go to help those countries counter claims by the smugglers to desperate parents that U.S. officials won\u2019t send their children back. \u201cWhile we intend to do the right thing by these children, their parents need to know that this is an incredibly dangerous situation and it is unlikely that their children will be able to stay,\u201d Obama said Wednesday. The request also includes $1.8 billion to provide care for the unaccompanied children while in U.S. custody. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a Senate committee on Thursday the requested extra money anticipated having to deal with up to 90,000 of the child immigrants this fiscal year, and another 145,000 in fiscal year 2015. In total, it costs just over 10% of the $30 billion in proposed border security funding included in the immigration reform bill passed by the Senate but stalled in the Republican-controlled House. Obama again criticized House GOP leaders for refusing to bring up the immigration legislation and he called for speedy approval of his emergency funding request. \u201cAre folks more interested in politics, or are they more interested in solving the problem?\u201d he said. House Republicans made clear they would take their time scrutinizing it. House Speaker John Boehner, who also calls for more National Guard troops at the border, created a Republican working group to examine Obama\u2019s emergency funding request and report back on Tuesday. \u201cIf you look at the President\u2019s request, it\u2019s all more about continuing to deal with the problem. We\u2019ve got to do something about sealing the border and ending this problem so that we can begin to move onto the bigger questions of immigration reform,\u201d Boehner said. While unclear how much of Obama\u2019s proposal would survive in Congress, Boehner said he wanted the House to take some action on immigration before it leaves for a month-long recess in August. Obama seeks emergency immigration funds, more authority 4) What about the 2008 law that requires deportation hearings for these kids? The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, signed by GOP President George W. Bush in the final month of his administration, distinguishes between undocumented minors from bordering countries \u2013 Mexico and Canada \u2013 and those from others that aren\u2019t contiguous. In essence, the difference involves turning back children who lack valid immigration status at the border because they would still be in their home country, versus holding a deportation hearing for those from non-bordering countries. Republicans and some Democrats say such due process now clogs up the system when Central American minors are arriving at double the rate of the previous year. Conservative GOP Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, both of Texas, planned to introduce a proposal Thursday they say would make it easier to send back many of the child immigrants while ensuring that those with legitimate refugee or migration claims get a hearing. Most Democrats, including leaders in the House and Senate, oppose such a change and instead call for more judges and other immigration resources to speed up the processing under existing law. 5)  What\u2019s this talk about enhanced powers for the homeland security secretary? Rather than change the law, Obama and Democrats seek to give Johnson, the homeland security secretary, more authority to speed up deportations once a judge orders the removal of an undocumented minor. Johnson told a Senate committee hearing Thursday the enhanced authority would allow for voluntary removals of children from Central American countries, similar to the choice available to undocumented minors from neighboring Mexico. Democrats prefer this approach over the changes sought by Republicans in the 2008 law. At Thursday\u2019s hearing, veteran Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Patrick Leahy of Vermont said they would fight any effort to revise the safeguards for due process in the existing law. Republicans, however, questioned how the current backlog of cases awaiting resolution can be reduced without removing some of the due process requirements in the law. 6) Can anything get done with the House up for re-election? With Congress already in a state of virtual dysfunction, the chances for significant immigration legislation this year appear minimal. However, the immigrant influx gives both parties new fodder to make their arguments to their respective bases. In addition, moderate Republicans concerned over their party getting blamed for inaction want to see something happen so they can show some results to the important Hispanic-American demographic \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest minority. That\u2019s why Boehner wants to get even a minor immigration measure passed this month, before House Republicans go home to face constituents in the campaign for the November election. For Obama and Democrats, the debate lets them continue hammering Republicans for blocking the Senate immigration reform plan that includes a path to legal status for millions of people who came to America illegally. Conservatives shaping the Republican agenda consider the Senate measure an amnesty for lawbreakers, while Democrats say it provides a fair opportunity for undocumented immigrants to formally join the system they already embraced. In the end, the fight is about who gets credit for reforms that all agree are necessary, even if they don\u2019t agree on exactly how to proceed. Boehner expressed his frustration with the gridlock over immigration on Thursday, telling reporters that Obama\u2019s lack of leadership caused the influx of child immigrants. \u201cHe\u2019s been president for five-and-a-half years,\u201d Boehner thundered. \u201cWhen\u2019s he going to take responsibility for something?\u201d 7) Will he or won\u2019t he? For now, the bigger question is whether Obama will travel to the Texas border region at the epicenter of the immigration influx. He didn\u2019t do so this week while in the state, prompting criticism from Perry and other Republicans. \u201cThe American people expect to see their President when there is a disaster,\u201d Perry told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan in an interview that aired Thursday, citing Obama\u2019s trip to the East Coast to tour damage caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. \u201cHe showed up at Sandy. Why not Texas?\u201d Obama, however, said Wednesday that visiting facilities where the children are processed and detained would be little more than a photo opportunity. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that is taking place down there that I am not intimately aware of and briefed on. This isn\u2019t theater. This is a problem,\u201d the President said. Cuellar, the Democratic congressman from Texas, responded that Obama needed to witness what the children endured. He told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d of an 11-year-old boy from Guatemala who died of dehydration after crossing the U.S. border. \u201cThat is the face that I want him to see,\u201d Cuellar said. \u201cDon\u2019t take any cameras, Mr. President, but go down there and see what we\u2019re facing.\u201d Opinion: What Obama could learn on the border Distrust of Obama makes border fix harder CNN\u2019s Paul Courson, Deirdre Walsh, Ed Payne, Dana Ford and Ted Barrett contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "President Obama asked Congress for $3.7 billion for border solution Republicans immediately raised concerns, especially over cost Democrats are also wading cautiously on the issue in a midterm election year NEW: Obama says Congress can solve problem now if it wants by passing his plan It\u2019s a national outcry. Republicans and Democrats have urgently pressed President Barack Obama to do something to stem the flow of child immigrants crossing the southern border \u2013 and fast. But in the hours after Obama announced Tuesday his request to Congress for $3.7 billion to slow the surge, objections began to mount on Capitol Hill. The opposition is entrenched and extends beyond the current crisis of more than 52,000 unaccompanied minors crossing the border since October. It\u2019s rooted in distrust of the President, especially on immigration. \u201cThere\u2019s widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws and it\u2019s going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said in February. Boehner: Obama to blame for border crisis From Guatemala into Mexico for $1.30 What are conditions along U.S. border? As a central example, Republicans point to Obama\u2019s decision in 2012 to defer deportations of children brought to the United States illegally by their parents. They claim that\u2019s a reason for the unexpected surge of kids today from Central America. With the door closed to any action on immigration reform this year with midterm campaigning in full swing, Congress and Obama now face a crisis around that issue, which Republicans do not want to touch as it\u2019s politically charged and complex. And they\u2019re signaling that Obama\u2019s proposal to address the situation on the southern border won\u2019t be dealt with quickly, even though the White House casts it as an emergency. Obama on Wednesday called the flow of \u201cunaccompanied children\u201d an \u201cincredibly dangerous\u201d situation, and said his proposal offers Congress \u201cthe capacity to vote immediately\u201d on a solution if it wants to address the problem swiftly. Obama heads to Texas amid \u2018urgent humanitarian situation\u2019 Is immigration crisis Rick Perry\u2019s second act? But Boehner said earlier on Wednesday, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something about sealing the border and ending this problem so that we can begin to move onto the bigger questions of immigration reform.\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia got to the heart of GOP sentiment, saying Obama \u201ccreated this disaster\u201d with his action to ease deportations. \u201cNo amount of resources or changes will be effective in stemming the surge of illegal border crossings if President Obama continues to ignore the law,\u201d he wrote in a statement, resurrecting the common refrain when immigration reform was still a possibility. Republicans also balked at the size of Obama\u2019s request, which was twice what they anticipated. It includes $1.8 billion for the care of immigrant children while in holding facilities and $1.1 billion for the transportation and removal of any children ineligible to remain in the country. Congress divided on immigration plan Obama requests billions for immigration Obama asks for $3.7 bllion for border crisis Obama requests billions for immigration Obama requests billions for immigration \u201cWhat disappoints me so much is he\u2019s asking for a blank check,\u201d Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. Fiscal hawk Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said it\u2019s an extraordinary amount. \u201cWe can put them all on a first class seat to their homes, that\u2019s $8 million,\u201d Coburn said Tuesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire.\u201d The issue of immigration is ripe with politics, especially in an election year. It motivates the Republican base, which is skeptical of reform and despises Obama. But Democratic strategist Maria Cardona said Republicans are trying to have it both ways \u2013 ask for a solution and criticize the President. \u201cThey can\u2019t scream about the house being on fire and then cut off the water supply to put out that fire,\u201d she said. The situation also plays well for Democrats. They have consistently and increasingly captured the Hispanic vote, and used immigration as a wedge to keep Latinos in their camp. While Democrats indicate they support Obama\u2019s request, they want more details before signing off. At least one has expressed some frustration with the White House on this issue and, too, raises trust, but in a different context. \u201cWe just can\u2019t just trust the President and say we are going to give you exactly every penny you want,\u201d Rep. Henry Cuellar, whose South Texas district is one heavily impacted by the current crisis, told CNN. Democrats want to maintain the status of current law giving youth the right to make their case in an immigration proceeding. \u201cI hope at the end of the day it is basically fair and humanitarian and we keep in mind repeatedly that we\u2019re dealing with children here,\u201d said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois. A law signed by President George W. Bush just prior to Obama\u2019s swearing-in, was meant to address child victims of illegal trafficking. It says unaccompanied children from countries other than Mexico or Canada cannot be immediately deported. Instead, they must be treated humanely, turned over to the Health and Human Services Department, and given an immigration hearing to determine if they qualify for asylum. 5 things you need to know about the immigration crisis Republicans want the law changed so unaccompanied youth can be immediately sent home without due process. Cuellar and Sen. John Cornyn, also of Texas, are set to propose legislation on Thursday to reverse that measure. While the White House says it will ask Congress to give the Homeland Security Department more discretion to send such immigrants home, it\u2019s unclear if Obama will request changes to the anti-trafficking law. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said this week the administration would meet humanitarian and due process standards. More judicial resources to accelerate immigration proceedings is one step the White House indicated was necessary. Even some Democrats want more information, especially regarding asylum for trafficking victims who may be fleeing abuse or life threatening situations in their domestic surroundings. \u201cI want to see what is written. I trust this president but I want to verify,\u201d Durbin said. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this story.",

Rick Perry and other Republicans lashed out at Obama, particularly his decision not to tour overcrowded border facilities while in Texas to see for himself the human side of the situation. \u201cThe American people expect to see their President when there is a disaster,\u201d Perry told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan in an interview that aired Thursday, citing Obama\u2019s trip to the East Coast to tour damage caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. \u201cHe showed up at Sandy.

This isn\u2019t theater. This is a problem,\u201d he said. The controversy has been compared to President George W. Bush\u2019s initial decision not to tour the storm-ravaged Gulf Coast after 2005\u2019s Hurricane Katrina. Bush opted instead to fly over the coast in Air Force One, resulting in a famous picture of the President peering down at the devastation from his jet. It left many feeling that Bush was detached and uncaring. Bush later acknowledged that failing to land and at least express solidarity with victims was a mistake. Perry alluded to that Wednesday in an interview on the Fox News program \u201cHannity.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that if George Bush had said, \u2018well I sent my FEMA director multiple times,\u2019 he still would have been criticized greatly,\u201d he told \u201cHannity,\u201d according to a report on the network\u2019s website. \u201cBecause you need to go. That\u2019s what governors do, that\u2019s what presidents do,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWhen there are natural disasters, when there are crises like these, a president needs to be there to show the American people, No. 1, that he understands.\u201d \u2018Go down there and see what we\u2019re facing\u2019 Even some Democrats were critical of the decision. U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that it\u2019s important for Obama to see what the children are going through. Boehner: Obama to blame for border crisis Obama: I had a 'good meeting' with Perry Immigration in 75 seconds 5 Reasons Gov. Rick Perry is underrated \u201cI\u2019m interested in him looking at the kids. The kids that I\u2019ve talked to, little innocent little boys and girls that have come across and have traveled over 1,000 miles, that one-third of the girls have been abused and raped on the way up here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last young kid was an 11-year-old little boy from Guatemala that died of dehydration. That is the face that I want him to see. Don\u2019t take any cameras, Mr. President, but go down there and see what we\u2019re facing.\u201d Obama called on Congress to quickly approve the $3.7 billion in additional money this fiscal year to deal with the crisis, which has left tens of thousands of new undocumented immigrants in a kind of immigration limbo. A lot of them surrendered themselves to Customs and Border Protection officers on the belief they will be allowed to stay in the country, and officials have struggled to house the children amid a staggering backlog of immigration cases. Obama said Wednesday that \u201cthe problem here is not a major disagreement around the actions that could be helpful in dealing with the problem.\u201d The challenge he said, is whether Congress is prepared to \u201cput the resources in place to get this done.\u201d \u201cAre folks more interested in politics, or are they more interested in solving the problem?\u201d he said. Is the immigration crisis Rick Perry\u2019s second act? Process overwhelmed No he doesn\u2019t, say Republicans who note Obama doesn\u2019t plan to visit the border area when he travels to Texas \u2013 the epicenter of the immigrant influx \u2013 on Wednesday for a trip that includes a meeting with Gov. Rick Perry. U.S. authorities estimate that 60,000 to 80,000 undocumented children will cross the border without their parents this year. While many have been released to family pending deportation hearings, others have been detained by authorities amid a growing backlog of pending cases. Begala takes on Rick Perry 'conspiracies' Congress divided on immigration plan Obama agrees to meet with Gov. Perry Obama: We can solve immigration crisis Obama administration officials blame the influx on dire conditions in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the three countries of origin for most of the new child immigrants. They note that people from other countries don\u2019t join the influx, saying that showed it involves those fleeing bad conditions in the three Central American nations. To Boehner, Perry and other Republicans, the administration invited the problem. \u201cThe children are a symptom of policies that have enticed them to come,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first thing you have to do is stop the flow, because if we don\u2019t, then the problem\u2019s not going to be the size we have today.\u201d Republicans have called for the repeal of a 2008 law signed by President George W. Bush that requires deportation hearings before sending back children from countries that do not border the United States. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can solve the problem unless we revisit\u201d the law, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is these children are placed with family members in the United States and given a notice to appear for a later court hearing. Some have called this a notice to disappear, not a notice to appear,\u201d as most don\u2019t show up, he said. Another Republican, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said the United States should immediately fly the children back to their home countries. It would cost less and signal U.S. intolerance for those who enter the country illegally, he argued. Funding breakdown Obama\u2019s emergency funding request seeks $1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts as well as crack down on smugglers. Another $300 million would go to help Mexico and Central American governments counter claims by smugglers to desperate parents that U.S. officials won\u2019t send their children back. \u201cWhile we intend to do the right thing by these children, their parents need to know that this is an incredibly dangerous situation and it is unlikely that their children will be able to stay,\u201d Obama said. The request also includes $1.8 billion to provide care for unaccompanied children crossing the border. Coburn: Obama immigration plan wrong Perry to Obama: visit the border Cupp: Obama is the photo op President Overall, it amounts to about 10% of the $30 billion in proposed border security funding included in the immigration reform bill passed by the Senate but stalled in the Republican-controlled House. Perry said lawmakers aren\u2019t going to back Obama\u2019s funding request if the government doesn\u2019t act to stop policies they see as encouraging children to show up at the border. He told Obama in a meeting that he wants 1,000 National Guard troops deployed to help secure the border, an option Obama seemed less than enthusiastic about. \u201cWhat I told him was we\u2019re happy to consider how we could deploy National Guard down there, but that\u2019s a temporary solution,\u201d Obama said of his discussion with Perry. \u201cThat\u2019s not a permanent solution. And so why wouldn\u2019t we go ahead and pass the permanent solution, or at least a longer-term solution?\u201d It was unclear how much cooperation Obama will get from congressional Republicans on his funding request. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said the request would be considered. On the Senate side, Republicans argued for changing a 2008 law signed by GOP President George W. Bush that requires deportation hearings before sending back children from non-bordering countries. Democrats, however, want to keep the law intact to ensure that any children who deserve asylum get due process in the form of a full hearing. 5 things you need to know about the immigration crisis What Obama can and can\u2019t do on immigration One night in Denver: The President and governor walk into a bar CNN\u2019s Greg Clary, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report, which was written by Tom Cohen in Washington.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker John Boehner is being criticized for his proposal to sue the President Conservative critics say a lawsuit is a political stunt in an election year Critics on the left agree The terms of a suit are still vague and unclear, even to Boehner Man up. Afraid. Feckless. Those are terms used to describe House Speaker John Boehner and his plan to sue President Barack Obama. And those are just from from critics on the right. Since Boehner announced his intention nearly two weeks ago, reaction has been mixed \u2013 at best. Republican anger over the President\u2019s sidestepping of a stalemated Congress to use his \u201cpen and phone\u201d on issues of immigration, minimum wage, LGBT rights and energy production is for real and far reaching. Boehner explains Obama lawsuit Cutter: Suing Obama a waste of tax money Boehner's lawsuit and the blame game John Boehner defends plan to sue Obama Boehner\u2019s attempt to answer what he considers a rogue presidency is to sue. \u201cThe President has circumvented the American people and their elected representatives through executive action, changing and creating his own laws, and excusing himself from enforcing statutes he is sworn to uphold,\u201d Boehner wrote in an op-ed on CNN.com over the weekend. But sharp critics say taking Obama to court isn\u2019t the right one. Naysayers on the right \u2026 Chief among them is Erick Erickson, editor of the conservative blog Red State. \u201cJohn Boehner\u2019s lawsuit is nothing more than political theater and a further Republican waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d he wrote Monday. He also said Boehner needs to \u201cman up\u201d in more ways than one. \u201cJohn Boehner and the House Republicans may lack the testicular fortitude to fight President Obama,\u201d Erickson wrote. Another conservative naysayer, columnist and author Andrew McCarthy, called Boehner\u2019s actions \u201cfeckless.\u201d \u201cBoehner and Beltway Republicans are essentially saying, \u2018We can\u2019t use our power because Obama and his media friends would say mean things about us. But our lunatic conservative base is demanding action. So let us file a lawsuit so we can say we did something,\u2019 \u201d McCarthy wrote (sarcastically), dissecting Boehner\u2019s suit threat. \u201cNow that\u2019s leadership!\u201d McCarthy added. For those two, anything short of impeachment is weak and chalked up to political drama in an election year. Proof that political foes do see eye to eye, the White House gleefully seized the opportunity to promote Erickson. Spokesman Eric Schultz tweeted, \u201cI had a bunch of reporters ask me for response to Boehner op-ed this weekend. Guess I should have sent them here,\u201d which is a link to Erickson\u2019s column. \u2026 and the left Critics on the left, who obviously don\u2019t support impeachment but are critical of Boehner, are making similar claims. They point to holes in Boehner\u2019s claim. Commentator Sally Kohn offered this suggestion to Boehner in a CNN.com op-ed: \u201cPlease exercise your (authority) and pass some laws to help America instead of wasting taxpayer money on a frivolous lawsuit that is nothing more than a flagrant partisan stunt.\u201d As for Obama, he dismissed the threat, saying, \u201cSo, sue me.\u201d \u201cMiddle class families can\u2019t wait for Republicans in Congress to do stuff,\u201d he said last week. The merits of a suit Boehner has given few details and specifics of his complaint. In his op-ed, he points to the use of executive action, says the President is \u201cignoring\u201d 40 bills the House passed focused on job creation and insists Obama ignores \u201claws written.\u201d But he has failed to specify which of Obama\u2019s 182 executive actions are problematic and which laws he\u2019s ignored. In a memo to House Republicans, Boehner indicated the areas of concern pertains to issues of foreign policy, health care, energy and education \u2013 a wide swath of issues. But Boehner has provided few details because the depth and merits of a suit are still unclear. Before the suit is even drafted, the House must pass an authorization to sue Obama. Then a bipartisan committee with a majority of Republicans will  formulate the terms of the suit by dissecting all of his actions and determining which have the most legal weight in a court. The lawyers Boehner consulted on the issue wrote that the House must \u201cdemonstrate a concrete, particularized injury, caused by the defendant, which can be remedied by a court.\u201d Perhaps providing more insight in a column, the lawyers, David Rivkin Jr. and Elizabeth Price Foley, were more specific about areas of concern than Boehner. \u201cWith the stroke of a magisterial pen, he has gutted large swaths of federal law that enjoy bipartisan support, including the Clinton-era welfare reform work requirement, the Bush-era No Child Left Behind law and the classification of marijuana as an illegal controlled substance,\u201d they wrote. Regardless, it\u2019s a process that is likely to draw out into the fall, positioning itself close to the midterm elections. \u201cThis is a political positioning of the House Republicans,\u201d CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said.

            "article_content": "NEW: To no one's surprise, Congress is divided on how to proceed President Obama travels to Texas on Wednesday Gov. Perry will meet with Obama, wants him to visit the border NEW: CNN reports about 5,000 new beds sought to temporarily house immigrant children President Barack Obama cares, the White House insisted Tuesday in asking Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds to better respond to the flood of immigrants illegally crossing the border into Texas. No he doesn\u2019t, say Republicans who note Obama doesn\u2019t plan to visit the border area when he travels to Texas \u2013 the epicenter of the immigrant influx \u2013 on Wednesday for a trip that includes a meeting with Gov. Rick Perry. Amid the political sniping, many of the tens of thousands of young Hispanic immigrants who have illegally crossed the border into Texas this year remain in limbo while waiting to be processed and possibly sent back to their home countries. The surge of undocumented youths from Central America has overwhelmed federal facilities and revived the debate over an immigration policy overhaul, one of the most partisan issues in the already overheated political climate of an election year. U.S. authorities estimate that between 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the White House is calling an \u201cimmediate humanitarian crisis.\u201d Obama administration officials blame the immigrant influx on dire conditions in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that cause people to send their children on dangerous journeys to the United States with smugglers who falsely promise the kids won\u2019t get deported. Coburn: Obama immigration plan 'wrong approach' Obama offers meeting to Perry Perry to Obama: visit the border Critics, however, say the administration invited the problem by halting deportations of some young immigrants who came to the country illegally in past years. Funding request Obama\u2019s emergency funding request is just over 10% of the $30 billion in proposed border security funding included in the Senate-passed immigration reform bill that House Republican leaders have stalled. A breakdown of the request, which requires approval from the deeply divided Congress, shows a broad approach by the administration to a problem that the critics say should have been anticipated. It seeks $1.6 billion for the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to bolster customs and border efforts as well as cracking down on smugglers, and $300 million for the State Department to help Mexico and Central American governments counter what officials called \u201cmisinformation\u201d by smugglers about what immigrants will face on the journey to the U.S. border and once they arrive. A main goal is to speed up the processing of arriving young immigrants to send back those who lack legal status. For most, the likely outcome will be a return home, White House officials told reporters on a conference call. Gov. Perry: Immigrants told what to say Strickland on immigration: 'We've got a crisis' Obama\u2019s funding request also seeks $1.8 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services to provide appropriate care for unaccompanied children crossing the border. The officials said that money would allow the government to meet its legal and moral obligations for such youngsters now being crammed in overcrowded facilities in several states while awaiting processing. On Tuesday, the Pentagon said it was processing requests from HHS to house more minors and Defense Department spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said the matter was still under discussion. But U.S. officials told CNN\u2019s Barbara Starr the requests cover about 5,000 new beds at military facilities. There currently is space for about 3,600 children. The current arrangement is to use military facilities for up to 120 days. Kirby wouldn\u2019t speculate whether the time frame would be extended, although he said it\u2019s something that would be discussed. \u201cUrgent situation\u201d In addition, the emergency funding request for the rest of fiscal year 2014, which ends on September 30, seeks an additional $615 million to ensure necessary money to fight wildfires \u2013 an issue separate from the immigration matter. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the \u201curgent situation\u201d that the emergency appropriation request would address should usurp any talk of making budget cuts elsewhere to offset the cost. \u201cWith an emergency request like this, traditionally Congress has not sought to bog down that process in a search for offsets,\u201d he told reporters on Tuesday. The administration also will seek more leeway under existing law to speed up the processing of the undocumented newcomers who are overcrowding holding facilities and sparking protests in communities intended as temporary destinations. In particular, it wants Congress to make it easier for the Department of Homeland Security to deport new immigrants who lack legal standing to remain in the country, which would ease a growing backlog of cases resulting from the influx, Earnest said. \u201cWhat we are seeing along the Southwest border is a spike in illegal migration from a handful of Central American countries,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd what we would like is for the secretary of homeland security to exercise some greater discretion after the due process rights of those individuals has been acknowledged and respected.\u201d Partisan divide It was unclear how much cooperation Obama would get from congressional Republicans. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said the request would be considered, but noted it lacked a component sought by the Republican leader. \u201cThe speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas - which this proposal does not address,\u201d said Michael Steel. On the Senate side, Republicans argued for changing a 2008 law signed by GOP President George W. Bush that requires deportation hearings before sending back children from non-bordering countries. They blame the process for a backlog created by the surge in unaccompanied minors from Central America entering the United States illegally from Mexico. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can solve the problem unless we revisit\u201d the law, said conservative Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. Democrats, however, want to keep the law intact to ensure that any children who deserve asylum get due process in the form of a full hearing. \u201cI\u2019m not inclined to support any policy change that ultimately undermines existing law and would violate the right of someone who is actually a legitimate refugee,\u201d said Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat of Cuban descent who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cEach child should be able to make their case as to why they qualify. Many will be sent back but others will qualify.\u201d No border visit Obama has come under criticism from Republicans and some Democrats for not planning to visit the border area during his Texas trip, which will include a Democratic Party fundraising event. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a possible GOP presidential nominee in 2016, called the situation similar to the much-disparaged federal response to Hurricane Katrina by the Bush administration. \u201cFor him to go to Texas and spend two days shaking down donors and never even getting near the border mess he helped create would be like flying into New Orleans in the highest waters of Katrina to eat Creole cooking, but never getting near the 9th Ward, the Superdome, or the Convention Center where thousands languished in squalor,\u201d Huckabee said. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas questioned if the border problem would harm the President in the same way the Katrina response tarnished his predecessor, telling Fox News:  \u201cI hope this does not become Obama\u2019s \u2018Katrina moment.\u2019\u201d The White House officials on Tuesday\u2019s conference call repeatedly emphasized that Obama regarded the immigration crisis as \u201can urgent humanitarian situation.\u201d Political squabble Obama\u2019s trip to Texas set off a political squabble, with Perry refusing to greet the President at the airport and instead calling for a meeting to discuss the immigration crisis. In response, Obama invited Perry to a meeting in Dallas with faith leaders and local officials, according to a letter written by senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. Perry, who is seeking to re-establish his national credentials after a disastrous bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, said Tuesday he looked forward to meeting with Obama. Previously, Perry has said he \u201creadily\u201d welcomes any federal emergency funds, but also has asked that Texas be reimbursed for more than $500 million the state has spent on border security over the past decade. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said Sunday the administration will take steps to fix the nation\u2019s broken immigration system, even without the help of Congress. That\u2019s the same message Obama has given in response to the refusal by House Republicans to take up a Senate-passed immigration reform bill. 5 things you need to know about the immigration crisis What Obama can and can\u2019t do on immigration CNN\u2019s Greg Clary, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report, which was written by Tom Cohen in Washington.",

            "article_content": "Issues that usually benefit a president not helping Obama Much of the negativity reflects the nation's partisan divide Right-wing media feeds and enhances GOP attacks Analyst: True or not, the President is perceived to be giving up Which one of these doesn\u2019t fit? More jobs, a record stock market, wars ending and dismal poll numbers. All apply to Barack Obama\u2019s presidency as it passes the 2,000-day mark, raising questions about the viability of what used to be known as conventional political wisdom. A strengthening economy and robust stock market traditionally mean general public satisfaction with government. Bringing soldiers home from war zones has always boosted presidential popularity. Not this time with this President. A CNN compilation of recent national polls indicates only 41% of Americans approve of Obama\u2019s handling of the job, down 6 percentage points from a year ago and matching the low of the past 12 months. 288,000 jobs added in June Obama; Worst Pres. Poll; Christie Obama to Republicans: 'So sue me' Why the disconnect? A convergence of factors \u2013 uneven economic growth, government crises both real and exaggerated, foreign policy problems, hyper-partisan Washington politics now on election-year steroids \u2013 helps explain it. Obama to Republicans: \u2018So sue me\u2019 Here\u2019s a closer look at some of the issues involved: 1) Jobs, but not for everyone Another strong jobs report Thursday added to growing evidence that U.S. economy has hit its full stride after the recession Obama inherited when he took office in January 2009. A White House statement noted the 288,000 jobs created in June contributed to the strongest start to a year since 1999 and the best six-month period overall since 2006. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.1%, well below the almost 10% level in the immediate aftermath of the recession as well as the more than 7% level when Obama\u2019s presidency began. In addition, the job growth last month spread across the economy instead of coming mostly from low-paying sectors such as food and drink, as occurred previously, said CNN Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans. My hope is that the American people look at today\u2019s news and understand that, in fact, we are making strides. President Barack Obama However, Romans noted that a low labor force participation rate showed many people \u201chave simply just left the labor market.\u201d Those out of the labor market for more than a year still have trouble finding jobs, so little has changed for them, she said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not all unicorns and rainbows.\u201d Obama himself alluded to the sweet-and-sour economic situation on Thursday, touting the positive report but adding that \u201cthere are still folks out there who are struggling.\u201d \u201cMy hope is that the American people look at today\u2019s news and understand that, in fact, we are making strides,\u201d he said. 2) Who benefits from a strong stock market? The jobs report that exceeded expectations of analysts sent the stock market to record heights, with the Dow crossing 17,000 for the first time. However, happiness on Wall Street doesn\u2019t translate directly to satisfaction on Main Street, noted CNN Business Correspondent Alison Kosik. \u201cOnly about half of Americans invest in stocks,\u201d so the gains don\u2019t matter to a lot of people, Kosik said, adding that the stock market \u201cisn\u2019t the economy.\u201d In fact, the soaring exchanges sow resentment among non-investors who blame Wall Street greed for the near collapse of 2008 that contributed to the recession. As a Democrat, Obama stands to benefit less from a healthy stock market than a Republican president from the party more traditionally tied to the banking-investment sector. 3) Wars ending, sort of Obama campaigned twice on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wars started by his predecessor, and he is on track to fulfill that promise. He withdrew U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011, and almost all American forces will be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016 \u2013 and his presidency \u2013 under his plan. However, myriad issues cloud the return home of the troops. The lightning advance by Sunni militants through northern Iraq threatens renewed civil war and partition, raising fears of a jihadist-controlled safe haven for terrorists threatening U.S. interests. That is the exact scenario the wars were supposed to end, and critics have accused Obama of allowing gains made in Iraq to get erased after pulling out U.S. forces. The Obama administration blames Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki for his country\u2019s collapse, saying the Shiite leader rejected an agreement to keep U.S. forces in the country and marginalized Sunni and Kurd populations in Iraq. Now Obama is sending U.S. forces back to Iraq, by the hundreds so far, to bolster security and advise Iraqi forces. The label of military advisers evokes memories of how the Vietnam War started. Another problem involves chronic and sometimes deadly delays faced by returning war veterans seeking health care from the Veterans Affairs Department. The crisis reported by CNN since November already has brought the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, various investigations and a White House report that essentially said the entire department needed an overhaul. 4) Governing woes The VA crisis follows other problems in the Obama administration, such as the dysfunctional website for his signature health care reforms, IRS political targeting of groups seeking tax-exempt status and the 2012 terrorist attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. Even though it can be explained, the concept of a president giving up doesn\u2019t sit well with people. Wendy Schiller, Brown University political scientist As expected, congressional Republicans have mounted a series of investigations, some necessary and others intended to wring as much political capital out of the controversies as possible heading up to the November elections and beyond. They also adopted obstructionist tactics after getting overrun by Democratic majorities in Obama\u2019s first term on transformative legislation such as the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reforms. The result: a gridlocked Congress of political one-upmanship, and a President who appears to have thrown up his hands in disgust by promising to act on his own as much as he can. \u201cWe can make even more progress if Congress is willing to work with my administration and to set politics aside, at least occasionally,\u201d Obama said of Thursday\u2019s job report. No polling fireworks for Obama or Congress this July 4th Republicans responded in kind, with House Speaker John Boehner saying that \u201cin order for us to make real progress, the President must do more than criticize.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of common ground where he can push his party\u2019s leaders in the Senate to work with us,\u201d Boehner said in a swipe at legislative intransigence by Senate Democrats. \u201cUntil he provides that leadership, he is simply part of the problem.\u201d If any solace for Obama, polls show the public dislikes Congress more than him, with the CNN compilation of recent surveys showing 14% approval for the legislators. By seeking to blame Republicans and declaring his intent to govern by regulation instead of legislation, Obama turns off voters who want to see the President engaged and trying, said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University. \u201cHe sort of looks like a kid on the playground who\u2019s hiding, saying, \u2018Forget it, I\u2019m not playing with you guys anymore,\u2019\u201d Schiller told CNN, adding that \u201ceven though it can be explained, the concept of a president giving up doesn\u2019t sit well with people.\u201d Obama is the same guy who won re-election in 2012, she said, but now he comes off as powerless \u201cwhen the truth is the executive branch structure is enormously powerful.\u201d \u201cThe less Congress does, the more power the executive gets,\u201d Schiller observed. 5) \u201cNattering nabobs of negativism\u201d Speechwriter William Safire came up with that phrase for former Vice President Spiro Agnew to complain about a liberal-leaning mainstream media during the Nixon administration. Now Obama faces the resulting backlash \u2013 a vitriolic right-wing media machine that feeds and enhances Republican attack politics. From talk radio icon Rush Limbaugh to Fox News to the rest of an industry spawned in the past two-plus decades, the conservative messaging reflects the deep ideological divide in the country. Obama has provided fodder to his detractors, getting cited for \u201cLie of the Year\u201d in 2013 by PolitiFact.com for his oft-repeated, erroneous declaration that his health care reforms meant \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\u201d Schiller credited the political right with \u201cpersuading people who do benefit from the federal government that they don\u2019t\u201d as part of the conservative effort to shrink the government\u2019s size and cost. \u201cDemocrats have failed miserably to counter that,\u201d she said. Now, 45% of the public automatically opposes Obama, America\u2019s first African-American president, \u201cno matter what,\u201d she said, \u201cwhether racism or ideology or both.\u201d Who is the worst president since WWII?

            "article_content": "Six-term Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, holds off tea party challenger Longtime lawmaker Charlie Rangel claims victory in tough New York primary Rep. James Lankford wins GOP Senate primary in Oklahoma NEW: McDaniel weighing whether to challenge vote Tea party-backed Mississippi senate candidate Chris McDaniel is weighing whether to challenge the results of his surprising Republican runoff loss to veteran incumbent Thad Cochran. But McDaniel contends Cochran\u2019s tactic of courting Democratic support in a crossover primary was misplaced in a GOP election even though state law permits it. In a statement, McDaniel said the move was \u201cunbecoming.\u201d \u201cIn the case of yesterday\u2019s election, we must be absolutely certain that our Republican primary was won by Republican voters,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the coming days, our team will look into the irregularities to determine whether a challenge is warranted.\u201d Democrats likely swung GOP contest Should GOP court minority votes? Rep. Rangel wins New York primary Democrats turning out for Cochran is just the tip of the iceberg in an already bizarre race marred by name-calling, mudslinging, allegations of cheating and a break-in at a nursing home where the senator\u2019s bedridden wife lives. Cochran was one of two longtime members of Congress who went into Tuesday with their political fates hanging in the balance appear to have survived intra-party challenges. In a high-profile New York primary, U.S. Rep. Charlie Rangel emerged victorious in what he says is his last race, posting a second straight narrow win over the same opponent he faced two years ago when he barely kept his seat in the House. \u201cI want each one of you to go home and know that this was your victory,\u201d he told supporters. \u201cThis is your congressman and you can rest assured that all I will be doing is thinking about you and bringing these resources home.\u201d But Rangel\u2019s challenger, state Sen. Adriano Espaillat, wasn\u2019t conceding on Wednesday. 5 things we learned from Tuesday\u2019s primaries Democrats come out in GOP contest Mississippi has no recount provisions in its election laws. The only challenge to election results must go through the courts. Mississippi law allows anyone to vote in the runoff, meaning Democrats could go to the polls as long as they hadn\u2019t voted in the Democratic primary and didn\u2019t plan to vote for their party\u2019s candidate in the general election. By CNN\u2019s count, about 61,000 more people voted Tuesday than in the primary two weeks ago. Cochran\u2019s backers turned to Democrats, especially African-Americans, who make up 37% of the state\u2019s population. They actively reminded voters of the senator\u2019s work to secure federal funds for programs such as Head Start and certain medical centers in the state. Henry Barbour, who helps run the pro-Cochran group Mississippi Conservatives with his uncle, former Gov. Haley Barbour, said he was proud that his organization was active in the effort to court Democratic voters. \u201cIt just makes sense that you would talk to folks who aren\u2019t just like you. I think that\u2019s a healthy thing. I think most people in America think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said, arguing that the strategy could be helpful for other Republicans nationwide, especially as the GOP works to rebrand its image. Barbour also dismissed McDaniel\u2019s criticism of the strategy, saying his comments were \u201chogwash.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s wrong,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cPeople have a right to vote and I\u2019m damn proud to have asked them for their support.\u201d Conservative groups supportive of McDaniel dispatched volunteers to observe poll workers to see if they were turning away those who already showed up in the Democratic primary. But those efforts mobilized groups such as the NAACP, which sent out its own volunteers to look for any signs of voter intimidation or interference. In his victory speech, Cochran seemed to at least wink at the crossover voters, thanking supporters for getting them and his supporters to the polls. \u201cYou are the ones who helped reach all the voters, make sure that they knew that they were important to this election because it\u2019s a group effort, it\u2019s not a solo,\u201d he told a victory celebration in Jackson. \u201cAnd so we all have a right to be proud of our state tonight. Thank you for this wonderful honor and wonderful challenge that lies ahead.\u201d McDaniel outpolled Cochran by about 1,400 votes in the June 3 primary but was forced into a runoff when he failed to cross the 50% threshold to win outright. 2014 Midterm Elections Rangel\u2019s last dance? Rangel had said win or lose this race was his last campaign. The Korean War veteran was trying to keep from getting pushed out of office by Espaillat, who came within about 1,100 votes of ousting Rangel in the Democratic primary two years ago. Rangel, the former chairman of the tax-writing House Committee on Ways and Means, was forced to step down from that post in 2010, and the House censured him for ethics violations later that year. Just as damaging for Rangel was the redrawing of New York\u2019s 13th Congressional District after the 2010 election \u2013 from a Harlem-based, African-American-dominated district to one that now has a Hispanic majority, thanks to shedding parts of Harlem and adding other neighborhoods in northern Manhattan and parts of the Bronx. Rangel, the \u201cLion of Harlem\u201d and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he didn\u2019t put up much of a fight in 2012. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a campaign last time. When he told me he was running, I was in Columbia Presbyterian with a viral infection in my spine.\u201d Espaillat said early Wednesday he wasn\u2019t giving in until all the votes were counted. He was down by 1,800 votes, with 99% of the precincts counted, according to AP numbers. \u201cAs we learned in 2012, every single vote needs to be counted in this race. Given the thousands of votes outstanding, the people of Upper Manhattan and the Bronx deserve a full accounting of every vote to achieve a complete and accurate tally in this race,\u201d Espaillat said in a statement. Tea party vs. establishment battle with a twist Rep. James Lankford easily won Oklahoma\u2019s Republican Senate primary in a race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Tom Coburn. He defeated former state House Speaker T.W. Shannon. Coburn\u2019s announcement in January that he would step down at the end of the year \u2013 with two years left in his term \u2013 sparked a competitive primary in Oklahoma to replace the conservative senator. There were seven candidates in the race, but the contest turned into a battle between the two front-runners: Lankford and Shannon. For a party looking for more diversity, the 36-year old Shannon, who was the youngest speaker ever of the Oklahoma House, was an attractive choice. He\u2019s part Native American and African-American. He was backed by such tea party heroes as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. And some national anti-establishment organizations pumped big bucks into the race in support of Shannon. But many local tea party groups kept their distance, with some questioning Shannon\u2019s outsider credentials. In fact, Shannon\u2019s no stranger to politics. He worked for Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma and former Rep. J.C. Watts before launching his political career. Lankford, who has risen through the ranks to become Republican Policy Committee chairman \u2013 the fifth-ranking House Republican \u2013 in two terms in Congress, was criticized by many on the right for his vote to raise the debt ceiling. But labeling the Baptist minister with strong social conservative backing as an establishment candidate was a hard case to make. \u201cThe job is clear,\u201d Lankford repeated throughout his victory speech, ticking off a number of Republican positions on how to fix the economy, including repealing Obamacare, cutting down on environmental regulation and limiting federal spending. \u201cI was a member of the class of 2010 in the House of Representatives. It was that class that moved Nancy Pelosi back to flying coach again,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we win in November, I pray we can do this same thing for Sen. (Harry) Reid.\u201d Conceding the race, Shannon said: \u201cTonight this campaign is over, but our cause remains and our cause continues. \u201cWe must get rid of Harry Reid. That means we have to send Republicans to the Senate, and that Republican is James Lankford.\u201d Other races on our radar CNN projects that Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown will win the state\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary. The two-term lieutenant governor faced off in an ugly primary battle against state Attorney General Doug Gansler and state lawmaker Heather Mizeur. In a state dominated by Democrats, Brown will now be considered the favorite in the general election to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. Brown was backed by O\u2019Malley, a potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, as well as former President Bill Clinton. Brown will go on to face Republican Larry Hogan in the general election. If he wins in November, Brown would become the third African-American elected governor in U.S. history. \u2022 In Colorado, CNN projects that former Rep. Bob Beauprez will win the GOP primary for governor, topping anti-immigration firebrand Tom Tancredo, a former congressman and presidential hopeful, and two other candidates. Beauprez will face Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper in November. \u2022 And in Florida, Republican businessman Curt Clawson won the special general election to replace embattled former Rep. Trey Radel. Clawson easily defeated Democrat April Freeman and two other candidates in the race for the state\u2019s 19th Congressional District. The heavily Republican district runs along Florida\u2019s Gulf of Mexico coast from Cape Coral and Fort Myers south to Naples and Marco Island. Clawson will serve out the remainder of Radel\u2019s term, which runs through the end of the year. There will be an August primary ahead of November\u2019s general election. Radel, a fellow Republican, was arrested last year for cocaine possession, and he resigned from Congress in January.

            "article_content": "Longtime lawmaker Charlie Rangel claims victory in tough New York primary Six-term incumbent Thad Cochran holds off tea party challenge Rep. Lankford wins GOP Senate primary in Oklahoma Rep. Charlie Rangel is claiming victory in his last dance. The Democratic congressman from New York, who was first elected to the House of Representatives 44 years ago, appears to have survived a fierce primary challenge. Rangel, who says this will be his last re-election campaign, will likely edge out state Sen. Adriano Espaillat, who came close to ousting Rangel in the Democratic primary two years ago. With 100% of precincts reporting, Rangel held a 47%-44% lead over Espaillat, with two other candidates grabbing 9% of the vote, according to numbers compiled by the Associated Press. Espaillat did not concede Tuesday night. Rangel was one of two four-decade veterans of Congress who avoided being ousted from office. After a long and bitter fight, Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi will manage to fend off a serious tea party challenge in Tuesday\u2019s GOP Senate runoff, CNN projects, and move closer to a seventh term. With 99% of the precincts counted, Cochran held a 51%-49% lead over state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who forced Cochran into the runoff after both candidates fell just short of the 50% threshold needed to avoid a longer contest. In the primary, McDaniel edged out Cochran by less than 1,500 votes. In a bizarre twist, it might be Democrats that helped push Cochran ahead at the finish line. Along with Mississippi and New York, six other states held contests Tuesday. Democrats likely swung GOP contest To clinch the GOP nomination, Cochran\u2019s backers turned to Democrats, especially African-Americans who make up 37% of the state\u2019s population. Cochran\u2019s supporters actively reminded voters of the senator\u2019s work to secure federal funds for programs relied upon by African-Americans, like Head Start and certain medical centers in the state. It\u2019s the kind of message that Republicans barely tout these days, given the renewed focus on fiscal conservatism. But Cochran supporters viewed Democrats as key to their strategy to knock out McDaniel after the incumbent barely kept his reelection hopes alive in the primary. Mississippi law allows anyone to vote in the runoff, meaning Democrats could go to the polls so long as they didn\u2019t vote in the Democratic primary and they don\u2019t plan to support their party\u2019s candidate in the general election. But McDaniel and allies argued the tactic was a stretch, and he argued that a high Democratic turnout for Cochran would reveal the senator\u2019s true colors. Final chapter underway in nation\u2019s ugliest primary \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about them being African-American. I\u2019m concerned about them being liberal,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s always been my concern. If Senator Cochran is going to court liberal Democrats to save his seat, that\u2019s a good indication that he\u2019s abandoned conservatism in Mississippi.\u201d As Cochran declared victory, McDaniel railed against Cochran\u2019s campaign tactic of stirring support among Democrats. \u201cThere is something a bit unusual about a Republican primary decided by liberal Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much for bold colors. So much for principles. I guess they can take some consolation that they did something tonight for once again compromising, for once again reaching across the aisle, for abandoning the conservative movement.\u201d McDaniel added: \u201cIf it can happen here, it can happen anywhere. And that\u2019s why we will never stop fighting.\u201d Mississippi law doesn\u2019t include provisions for election recounts. Any challenge to race results would have to go through the courts. 5 primaries worth watching on Tuesday To make sure Democratic voters weren\u2019t voting illegally, conservative groups supportive of McDaniel dispatched volunteers to observe poll workers and whether they\u2019re turning away those who already showed up in the Democratic primary. But that effort raised eyebrows from groups like the NAACP, which sent out its own volunteers to look for any signs of voter intimidation or interference. Rangel\u2019s last dance Win or lose, Rangel of New York says this is his last campaign. The Korean War veteran, who was first elected to the House of Representatives 44 years ago, is trying keep from getting pushed out office by Espaillat, who came within around 1,100 votes of ousting Rangel in the Democratic primary two years ago. \u201cAs we learned in 2012, every single vote needs to be counted in this race. Given the thousands of votes outstanding, the people of Upper Manhattan and The Bronx deserve a full accounting of every vote to achieve a complete and accurate tally in this race,\u201d Espaillat said in a statement in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Rangel, the former chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, was forced to step down from his post in 2010 and later that year he was censured by the House for ethics violations. Just as damaging for Rangel was the redrawing of New York\u2019s 13th Congressional District after the 2010 election, from a Harlem-based, African-American-dominated district to one that now has a Hispanic majority, thanks to shedding parts of Harlem and adding other neighborhoods in northern Manhattan and parts of the Bronx. Rangel, the \u201cLion of Harlem\u201d and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he didn\u2019t put up much of a fight in 2012. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a campaign last time. When he told me he was running, I was in Columbia Presbyterian with a viral infection in my spine.\u201d This time, Rangel said he\u2019s ready. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a walker. I don\u2019t have a spinal injury.\u201d Espaillat says Rangel is emblematic of all that ills Congress. \u201cThis is a coalition of victory that is completely convinced that Washington is broken and that at the center of that dysfunction is a gentleman called Charles Rangel,\u201d he said Saturday. Rangel\u2019s confidence was buoyed by a nonpartisan poll last week that indicated he held a 13-point lead over Espaillat, who if elected in November would become the first member of Congress born in the Dominican Republic. Cochran was one of two longtime members of Congress who went into Tuesday with their political fates hanging in the balance appear to have survived intra-party challenges. Tea party vs. establishment battle with a twist Rep. James Lankford easily won Oklahoma\u2019s Republican Senate primary in a race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Tom Coburn.

            "article_content": "A bitter primary battle in Mississippi will be settled in runoff New York's Charlie Rangel running his last campaign after four decades in House Senate race in Oklahoma could be headed for runoff Tom Tancredo's run for governor in Colorado could hurt fellow Republicans in November It\u2019s judgment day for two of the longest-serving members of Congress, both of whom are fighting for their political lives. The contests involving Republican Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York \u2013 who have each served more than four decades on Capitol Hill \u2013 are the marquee matchups Tuesday as seven states from the East Coast to the Mountain West hold primaries. Also in the spotlight: a high-profile tea party vs. establishment Republican contest in the GOP Senate primary in Oklahoma; the Republican gubernatorial primary in Colorado, where a controversial and outspoken former congressman is one of the frontrunners; and the GOP lieutenant governor\u2019s runoff in South Carolina, where a 2014 contest may have 2016 implications. 2014 midterms: What\u2019s at stake Mudslinging and feeding the homeless Cantor: 'Of course' I'll vote for Brat Rep. King: Cantor was right to resign Here are five contests to watch on this busy primary day: 1. Bitter battle in Mississippi: Take a six-term Republican senator fighting for another six years in Congress and a tea party-backed state senator who\u2019s challenging him. Mix in nasty attacks on both sides, a bizarre incident involving the incumbent\u2019s nursing home-bound wife, tons of cash by outside groups and lots of big names from the world of politics and even sports and entertainment parachuting onto the campaign trail, and you\u2019ve got the GOP Senate primary runoff in Mississippi. State Sen. Chris McDaniel narrowly edged out Cochran in the primary three weeks ago, but with neither man cracking 50% (there was a third Republican candidate on the ballot who grabbed 1.5% of the vote), the contest moved on to a runoff. Cochran, who\u2019s touting his seniority in the Senate and his ability bring in the federal bucks, is backed by much of the state\u2019s GOP establishment, many national Republicans and outside groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which traditionally supports mainstream Republicans. His backers argue a McDaniel victory in the primary could put a very safe GOP seat in play in November\u2019s general election. Another controversy in Mississippi Senate race But tea party groups and anti-establishment Republicans see Cochran as the problem, and his comments back in February, when told reporters that \u201cthe tea party is something I don\u2019t really know a lot about,\u201d didn\u2019t do him any favors. Several tea party and anti-establishment groups have run ads backing McDaniel or helped with get-out-the-vote efforts in support of the candidate. In the runoff campaign\u2019s closing days, big names parachuted into the state. Former Sen. Rick Santorum, a 2012 GOP presidential candidate who may run again in 2016, campaigned with McDaniel, and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, hit the trail in support of Cochran. But wait, there\u2019s more: The race also turned into a battle of celebrities. Longtime game show host Chuck Woolery \u2013 famous for hosting \u201cThe Dating Game\u201d and \u201cLove Connection\u201d \u2013 headlined a bus tour organized by the Tea Party Express in support of McDaniel. Woolery\u2019s appearance came just a couple of days after pro football great Brett Favre, a Mississippi native, starred in a U.S. Chamber of Commerce TV ad for Cochran. McDaniel\u2019s supporters say House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s defeat two weeks ago in his primary in Virginia to a little-known and underfunded tea party candidate is giving the challenger\u2019s supporters even more energy. The big question is whether Cochran can expand the electorate by persuading black Democrats to come out and vote for him. Reid, McConnell debate campaign financing Senate candidate on contentious primary Santorum weighs in on establishment GOP Cochran\u2019s bizarre answer on Cantor\u2019s defeat 2. Rangel\u2019s last run: Win or lose, Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York says this is his last campaign. The Korean War veteran, who was first elected to the House of Representatives 44 years ago, is trying keep from getting pushed out office by his main primary challenger, state Sen. Adriano Espaillat, who came within around 1,100 votes of ousting Rangel in the Democratic primary two years ago. Rangel, the former chairman of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, was forced to step down from his post in 2010 and later that year he was censured by the House for ethics violations. Just as damaging for Rangel was the redrawing of New York\u2019s 13th Congressional District after the 2010 election, from a Harlem-based, African-American-dominated district to one that now has a Hispanic majority, thanks to shedding parts of Harlem and adding other neighborhoods in northern Manhattan and parts of the Bronx. Rangel, one of the best-known politicians in the country, remains confident. \u201cIf you had a race horse that won 43 races, brings in the money, but the horse is old and experienced and knows the track \u2013 what would you do?\u201d the 84-year-old Rangel asked reporters this past weekend. \u201cWould you send him to the glue factory? Hell no.\u201d Espaillat says Rangel is emblematic of all that ills Congress. \u201cThis is a coalition of victory that is completely convinced that Washington is broken and that at the center of that dysfunction is a gentleman called Charles Rangel,\u201d he said Saturday. Rangel\u2019s confidence was buoyed by a nonpartisan poll last week that indicated he held a 13-point lead over Espaillat, who if elected in November would become the first member of Congress born in the Dominican Republic. But some political analysts say it\u2019s difficult to poll in the district and feel the race is much closer. Plus, Rangel suffered the embarrassment of failing to win endorsements from President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cIf Rangel were he to be defeated, it would be a huge national story, but not a shocking one like Eric Cantor\u2019s loss, since Rangel barely escaped defeat two years ago,\u201d Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, told CNN. 3. A run to the right in Oklahoma: Sen. Tom Coburn\u2019s announcement in January that he would step down at the end of the year \u2013 with two years left in his term \u2013 sparked a competitive primary to replace the conservative senator. There are seven candidates in the race, but the contest is really a battle between the two frontrunners: Rep. James Lankford and former state House Speaker T.W. Shannon. For a party looking for more diversity, the 36-year old Shannon, who was the youngest speaker ever of the Oklahoma House, is an attractive choice. He\u2019s part Native American and African-American. He\u2019s been backed by such tea party heroes as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. And some national anti-establishment organizations have pumped big bucks into the race in support of Shannon. But many local tea party groups are keeping their distance, with some questioning Shannon\u2019s outsider credentials. In fact, Shannon\u2019s no stranger to politics. He worked for Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole and former congressman J.C. Watts before launching his own political career. Lankford, who has risen through the ranks to become Republican Policy Committee Chairman \u2013 the fifth-ranking House Republican \u2013 in just two terms in Congress, is criticized by many on the right for his vote to raise the debt ceiling. But labeling the Baptist minister with strong social conservative backing as an establishment candidate is a hard case to make. \u201cThe Oklahoma primary doesn\u2019t fit neatly into the establishment vs. anti-establishment box. It\u2019s very different than some of the other high-profile races where you had a challenger taking on an incumbent,\u201d Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report, told CNN. \u201cThe political insider in Washington may not look like the political insider in Oklahoma.\u201d The most recent polling in the contest gave Lankford the slight edge over Shannon. But with former state Sen. Randy Brogdon at 3%, and the four other candidates grabbing about 2% support between them, this race could be headed to an August 26 runoff. 4. Controversial figure: Colorado\u2019s Tom Tancredo is making noise once again and giving fellow Republicans headaches. The former congressman, known for his hardline stance against illegal immigration, is running for his state\u2019s GOP gubernatorial nomination, in the hopes of facing off in November against Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper. Tancredo, who touted his immigration stance during a short run in the 2008 Republican presidential campaign, briefly bolted from the GOP to run for governor in 2010 as a third-party candidate, coming in second to Hinckenlooper and ahead of the Republican nominee. Tancredo will face off Tuesday against former U.S. Rep. Bob Beauprez, a late entry into the race who has establishment backing. Also running are Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler and former state Sen. Mike Kopp. What makes this contest so important is that Republicans see Hickenlooper and Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who\u2019s also up for re-election this year, as vulnerable. But here\u2019s the problem: Some GOP strategists to whom CNN spoke worry that a Tancredo victory in the primary could damage their chances of ousting Hickenlooper and could hurt the rest of the Republican ticket come November. They say that with Tancredo as the nominee, Rep. Cory Gardner\u2019s chances of defeating Udall get tougher. It appears Democrats see Tancredo as the easier candidate to beat in the midterms. An outside group with Democratic connections went up with ads slamming Tancredo for his Obamacare attacks, which could help the candidate with conservative primary voters. And another spot by the group accused Beauprez of supporting earmarks, which could hurt him with primary voters. 5. 2014 primary with 2016 implications: South Carolina Republicans are headed to the polls for a second time this month to vote for their party\u2019s nominee for lieutenant governor. The race pits former state Attorney General Henry McMaster, who\u2019s also a former Palmetto State GOP party leader, against businessman Mike Campbell, the son of the late Carroll Campbell, a popular Republican governor. But what makes this race interesting to a national audience is that two former Republican presidential candidates who may run for the White House again in 2016 are taking sides in this showdown. In the closing days of the runoff campaign, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania stumped with McMaster while former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee campaigned for Campbell. Campbell was South Carolina chairmain of Huckabee\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, and now Huckabee is returning the favor. Campbell took Huckabee on a traditional fly-in through the states three top media markets \u2013 Greenville/Spartanburg, Columbia and Charleston \u2013 designed to gain saturation statewide news coverage. McMaster focused Santorum\u2019s visit on the conservative and voter-rich Upstate. With South Carolina traditionally holding the first Southern primary in the race for the White House, there\u2019s more than just bragging rights on the line. \u201cBoth McMaster and Campbell have strong brand names in South Carolina politics, and the office of lieutenant governor is part time with plenty of time to devote to political organizing,\u201d said GOP consultant Bruce Haynes, a South Carolina native. \u201cThe Campbell brand is gold, and Huckabee already has a strong relationship with the family. McMaster is a former attorney general and S.C. GOP chair, well-known and liked in establishment party circles with a deep network of relationships that could be very attractive to Santorum in 2016,\u201d \u201cWednesday morning, either Huckabee or Santorum will come out of the runoff with a statewide winner who owes them a favor and has both the time and the network to pay that favor back in 2016,\u201d Haynes added.",

            "article_content": "House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy moves up a notch in leadership ranks California Republican defeated Labrador for the No. 2 job Few expect McCarthy's rise to significantly change how Republicans run the House House Republicans on Thursday elected Kevin McCarthy as majority leader, succeeding Eric Cantor, who is relinquishing the job after losing his primary election in an upset. The California Republican defeated Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador for the No. 2 position, which is responsible for the day-to-day running of the chamber and deciding which bills come to the floor for a vote. Labrador argued for a fresh conservative voice in the GOP leadership in challenging McCarthy, who was the favorite.

Supporters say Republican proposals will come largely from committees and McCarthy\u2019s mainly will focus on using his political skills to help shape the GOP message and strategy to push its agenda, and help coordinate with Senate Republicans, who are in the minority. Following Cantor\u2019s loss to a political upstart in Virginia last week, McCarthy began to quietly reach out to members, using his extensive network as whip to build support. Underneath his easy demeanor is an intensely political operative, who helped recruit and fundraise for most of the first- and second-term GOP members, who make up a sizeable part of the conference. He can cite polls from various congressional districts across the country off the top of his head. Because he lives in his Washington office when Congress is in session, McCarthy spends a lot of time hosting take-out dinners and working out in the House gym. Personal relationships helped him quickly accumulate commitments to win the majority leader\u2019s post. Typically the majority leader is the speaker in waiting, but McCarthy would almost certainly face a conservative challenger if the current speaker, John Boehner, decides to step down after the midterm elections. Some members on the right see McCarthy as the establishment candidate, and disagree with his position on immigration, a hot-button issue. McCarthy, who represents an agricultural district, has expressed support for some type of legal status for undocumented workers. Immigration reform: Kevin McCarthy\u2019s \u2018House of Cards\u2019 Before last week\u2019s stunning upset of Cantor many considered McCarthy as potentially the most vulnerable member of the House Republican leadership team. During his tenure as whip, there were several embarrassing episodes, when high profile bills \u2013 such as the farm bill and GOP debt limit plans \u2013 failed to pass. Because Thursday\u2019s election\u2019s only installs McCarthy as majority leader for the remainder of the current Congress, the next five months will be a test for him. He could face a challenge in the fall when all GOP leaders stand for re-election \u2014 whether it\u2019s for the top spot or for majority leader. Texas Republican Rep Jeb Hensarling, who briefly considered a bid for Cantor\u2019s post, may decide to run against him. Five things to know about Kevin McCarthy",

McCarthy may face pressure on immigration reform if elected majority leader His Central Valley district is home to farms and businesses that rely on immigrant labor Friends say his savvy, friendliness helps him in times of tough votes McCarthy's ambition and affability may be needed for thorny immigration debate If California\u2019s Kevin McCarthy ascends as expected to the No. 2 Republican leadership position in the House, one thing is assured: He will be dogged by the ever-present political specter of immigration reform. McCarthy\u2019s backers are hastily shoring up support for his candidacy as majority leader, but so are immigration reform advocates who want to make clear to him their expectations for action. Labrador jumps into race for House majority leader Texan Sessions drops bid to succeed Cantor in House leadership \u201cThere is no reason for Congressman Kevin McCarthy, as leader, not to take leadership on this issue,\u201d said immigration reform activist Arturo Rodriguez, president of United Farm Workers. \u201cEveryone will expect it and demand it. And we will step up all of our activities as a whole.\u201d Such is the thorny predicament for the politically savvy lawmaker viewed as most likely to succeed Eric Cantor as majority leader. Cantor\u2019s primary loss in Virginia set in a motion a scramble for the position. Then again, McCarthy, who actor Kevin Spacey reportedly shadowed in preparing for his role as majority whip Frank Underwood in the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d is used to such plot twists. Is D.C. real life \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d? McCarthy\u2019s own rapid rise is the stuff of a political soap opera. He is the boy from Bakersfield who married his high school sweetheart and plunked down money he won in a lottery to start a deli. He used those earnings to go to college before entering politics. His boss, former House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas endorsed his young staffer to replace him in 2006. Since then, McCarthy has easily won every subsequent re-election and has risen quickly \u2014 and shrewdly, friends say \u2014 through the House GOP\u2019s leadership ranks. He\u2019s now considered the frontrunner for the majority leader\u2019s job. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for many, many years now, but he looks at things differently,\u201d said fellow California Republican Rep. Jeff Denham. \u201cHe has the foresight to know when to push and when not to push and he understands when\u2019s the right time to get something done.\u201d Cantor replacement; Immigration Chaos at Cantor headquarters after loss 'It's a bad day for immigration reform' For example, McCarthy last year voted with many House Republicans, but not Denham, to defund the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to halt the deportation of young immigrants in the military or in school. This year, he\u2019s supporting Denham\u2019s measure to help provide a path to citizenship for young immigrants who are also members of the military. Doing the math Down but not done: Cantor\u2019s loss not end for immigration reform That\u2019s not to say there haven\u2019t been stumbles and miscalculations. McCarthy became the party whip soon after the Republican takeover of the House. But his ability to count and rally votes behind leadership\u2019s priorities were tested after partisan battles over raising the debt ceiling and funding food stamps. McCarthy\u2019s affability has been key to helping soothe ruffled feathers, friends say. Fellow California Rep. David Valadao counts McCarthy as \u201cboth a close friend and a respected colleague,\u201d and he\u2019s gotten a chance to see the would-be majority leader up close as they and others in the delegation worked together on issues of providing water to their Central Valley region as well as infrastructure needs, he told CNN in a statement. McCarthy often orders takeout and invites House members to his office to eat and talk about issues affecting their districts, their spouses and children, Denham said. \u201cHe invites members to his office and it\u2019s like sitting around the family dinner table,\u201d he said. \u201cHe also takes the time to go to people\u2019s districts all across the nation.\u201d A tale of two Republicans: A story of the GOP and immigration reform Careful calculations Crisis immigration centers under fire Anchor goes after Boehner on immigration An immigration warning to GOP Friends say McCarthy, 49, will need that personal touch for crafting relationships and a sense of timing on hot button issues, should he be elected leader next Thursday. That\u2019s because fallout from tackling immigration reform could prove politically perilous if Cantor, who has endorsed McCarthy, is any indication. Dave Brat used Cantor\u2019s willingness to consider a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants to hammer home his point that he\u2019d lost touch with his constituents. That, analysts say, was crucial to his victory in the reliably conservative Richmond-area district. \u201cI think his (McCarthy\u2019s) views on immigration are similar to Cantor\u2019s,\u201d said Steven Camarota, director of research for the non-profit Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cBut after this week\u2019s results, it seems much less likely he would push it. And even less likely still that he would move his members to push it.\u201d Conservatives are pushing aggressively to have one of their own fill McCarthy\u2019s current job as whip and join the House GOP leadership ranks, which would create an interesting dynamic between the top two Republicans in the House and the whip. GOP \u201ctrapped\u201d by amnesty McCarthy\u2019s home turf is California\u2019s 23rd congressional district, a Republican stronghold ripe with lush farmland in the shadow of mountain ranges. It is also a place that is 35% Latino and where the local business community has made clear that it depends heavily on immigrant labor to pick such crops as grapes, oranges and tomatoes. \u201cWe have spoken with Congressman McCarthy and his staff about immigration reform and its importance to our local and regional economy,\u201d Cynthia Pollard, president and CEO of the Greater Bakersfield Chamber of Commerce told CNN in a statement. \u201cI led a delegation of several other business leaders in a meeting with Congressman McCarthy last fall in Washington, D.C., to discuss the issue. He expressed at that time and has since reaffirmed his commitment to a step-by-step assessment and overhaul of the system that is clearly broken.\u201d In the meantime, immigration advocates who have hosted protests and sit-ins at McCarthy\u2019s district offices in the past vow they are poised to do so again if they sense he\u2019s unwilling to tackle reform. \u201cAs the person responsible for scheduling House votes, when it comes to immigration reform McCarthy will either be a hero or a zero,\u201d Frank Sherry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, said in a statement. \u201cHe can save the GOP from itself by quickly scheduling a vote on historic legislation that the majority of the House, the country and even his district supports; or he can squander the opportunity. \u2026The future of the GOP may well hinge on his choice,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Kevin McCarthy, R-California, elected by peers as the No. 2 GOP leader in the House Kevin Spacey reportedly shadowed McCarthy to prep for the lead on \"House of Cards\" McCarthy once used the $5,000 he won in a lottery to open a deli to help pay for college His meteoric rise might be hindered by immigration positions Rep. Kevin McCarthy\u2019s election to the No. 2 Republican leadership position in the House was expected by politicos, but this Californian\u2019s back story is full of plot twists. Here are five things you might not know about him: 1. Role model: Actor Kevin Spacey reportedly shadowed McCarthy to prepare for his role as Majority Whip Frank Underwood in the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Unlike the duplicitous and murderous Underwood, McCarthy is considered by colleagues to be an affable guy who often invites members to his office to discuss their woes and share takeout food. Still, there are a few similarities. McCarthy once told reporters at the Sacramento Press Club that Underwood\u2019s office knickknacks and d\u00e9cor look quite familiar. 2. Funding his future: McCarthy married his high school sweetheart and opened a deli with $5,000 he won in the lottery. According to the Orange County Register, an old menu shows the future politico once served up \u201cfresh Dutch Krunch white rolls every day.\u201d He used the money to help pay his way through California State University, Bakersfield. The real 'House of Cards' Who gains for Cantor's loss? Clear path expected for Kevin McCarthy Cantor defends immigration support 3. Rapid rise: His political ascent has been meteoric. His boss, former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, endorsed the young staffer to replace him in 2006. Since then, he\u2019s cruised through every re-election and used his charm, intellect and savvy, friends say, to climb through the House GOP\u2019s leadership ranks. Seven years after he first took office, he\u2019s now considered the front-runner for the majority leader\u2019s job. 4. Workouts and flip-flops: He\u2019s a workout buff who, in his spare time, dons the West Coast casual look. At Wednesday\u2019s annual softball game between women members of Congress and the media, McCarthy was spotted wearing linen slacks and flip-flops. He reportedly enjoys riding his bike along Rock Creek Park\u2019s trails in Washington or working up a sweat to P90X, much like Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. 5. Immigration views could be problematic: Like Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, the outgoing House majority leader, McCarthy has a nuanced position on immigration that could lead to some showdowns with both conservatives and pro-immigration reform advocates. Businesses in his district depend heavily on immigrant labor to work the fertile farmland. His district is also 35% Hispanic, and pro-immigration organizations have vowed to ramp up the pressure on McCarthy to address reform.

            "article_content": "Share your personal stories about immigrating to the U.S. with CNN iReport. Eric Cantor's stunning primary loss Tuesday was a blow to immigration reform Cantor's opponent made an issue of the majority leader's position on so-called \"Dreamers\" President Obama faces increasing pressure to use power of pen on immigration reform The chances of immigration reform passing in the House this year were already slim before its majority leader, Eric Cantor, lost his primary on Tuesday. So, by the time Cantor announced on Wednesday that he was stepping down from his leadership post on July 31, those who oppose any type of amnesty for illegal immigrants were sounding the death knell for related legislation on Capitol Hill. In his victory speech, Dave Brat, the economics professor who defeated Cantor by double digits, cited the lawmaker\u2019s willingness to consider a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants as one of his opponent\u2019s weak flanks. And pundits said that will be a lesson to others who might dare to push for reform. \u201cIt is a bombshell,\u201d CNN senior political analyst David Gergen said on CNN of Cantor\u2019s loss. \u201cI think it does mean more gridlock ahead, especially on immigration. Immigration reform is now dead.\u201d Those who support such measures as granting a pathway to citizenship to Dreamers \u2014 the children of those who came to the country illegally \u2014 raced to put Cantor\u2019s defeat in context. \u201cSome things do not change after a primary. Even a primary result that no one, including the winning candidate, had predicted,\u201d Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, an Illinois Democrat and staunch immigration advocate, said on the House floor on Wednesday. \u201cImmigration reform is not dead.  It might just be moving to the White House for action if none comes from this House.\u201d There was always a short window in this Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation in the House before lawmakers leave for the summer in August and before the midterm elections in November, legal and political experts say. Maybe immigration reform isn\u2019t dead after all Last year, the Senate approved a sweeping immigration reform package, including a path to citizenship for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented workers in the country, according to figures from the Congressional Budget Office. Though roughly one-third of Republicans supported the measure, the legislation stalled in the GOP-controlled House as lawmakers there weighed more gradual reforms. Crisis immigration centers under fire Anchor goes after Boehner on immigration An immigration warning to GOP Cantor had publicly backed proposals giving Dreamers the chance to receive some type of legal status, however he voted against the broader Senate measure. \u201cCantor ignored the advice of every Republican pollster and tried to be wishy-washy on immigration,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez told CNN in a statement. \u201cHe didn\u2019t convince the pro-immigration side he was with them and he didn\u2019t convince the anti-immigration side he was with them.  And he lost. That is not what happened to Sen. (Lindsey) Graham in South Carolina, Rep. (Renee) Elmers in North Carolina, or a number of others who have made a clear case for immigration reform that is not \u2018amnesty.\u2019\u201d Cantor\u2019s loss might make other Republicans facing conservative challenges skittish, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University Law School. \u201cOne primary does not determine the fate of immigration reform, however it does make it harder for Republicans to do anything before the August recess,\u201d Yale-Loehr said. But it\u2019s not all up to the House. Should Obama use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform? President Barack Obama has also been under pressure from immigration activists and members of his own party to use executive action to push through reform \u2014 especially if the House fails to act before the recess. He rejected any notion that Cantor\u2019s defeat means the end for immigration reform in the House \u2013 a message he said he would relay to Speaker John Boehner. \u201cAt a certain point, issues are important enough to fight for. My argument about yesterday\u2019s election is not that there was too little politics \u2013 there was too little conviction about what was right,\u201d Obama said at a fundraiser in Boston, according to a press pool account. \u201cWe need to get immigration reform done.\u201d The flood of hundreds of unaccompanied children crossing into this country daily and overflowing holding centers is an issue that could further hasten the administration to act, immigration legal experts say. Obama has called the border situation involving children \u201can urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response\u201d and has established a group that will work across federal agencies to help address the problem. In the meantime, supporters also want the President to do more to slow the record number of deportations during his presidency. There have been roughly 2 million deportations under Obama, a number that far eclipses previous presidencies and led the head of the National Council of La Raza to dub him \u201cthe deporter-in-chief.\u201d He has directed the administration to reexamine its deportation policy. Immigration reform advocates also want the administration to make noncriminals and minor offenders the lowest deportation priorities and extend amnesty to the parents and guardians of Dreamers. \u201cJust because Cantor lost doesn\u2019t mean that all of those other conversations and criticisms about not doing something about immigration goes away,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. \u201cThe likelihood was that the President was planning to use executive action anyway regardless of what happened to Cantor.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Cantor's loss is sending \"shivers\" through the House Republican Party House leadership shakeup - Cantor is expected to resign as majority leader With Cantor's defeat, the tea party is not dead, but immigration reform probably is Political climate in Washington already poison, but Cantor loss likely will make it harder to do anything A day after House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s almost unprecedented primary loss, his defeat is being felt far from his central Virginia congressional district. Aftershocks from Cantor\u2019s loss at the hands of a little known and underfunded tea party supporter and economics professor rocked the political world \u2013 from the campaign trail to the halls of Congress and the White House. The ouster of the No. 2 House Republican, who was seen by many as the next speaker, overturns the chamber\u2019s leadership hierarchy, and effectively kills any chance of immigration reform. \u201cIt\u2019s just sending shivers throughout the Republican conference,\u201d veteran GOP Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash. Source: Eric Cantor to step down July 31 Gergen: Cantor loss signals lose of hope Cantor loss 'sending shivers' among GOP And Dave Brat\u2019s David vs. Goliath win will embolden a tea party movement that\u2019s experienced more defeats than victories so far this primary season. \u201cThis is a major shot in the arm for the tea party movement,\u201d said Adam Brandon, a top official at FreedomWorks, a leading organizer of grassroots conservatives. 7 reasons Eric Cantor lost Here are five things we learned from the political upset of the year: 1. Showing up matters: Cantor apparently took things for granted. How Eric Cantor\u2019s \u2018House of Cards\u2019 fell apart \u201cEric Cantor lost this race as much as Dave Brat won it. He simply violated rule number one of politics: go home,\u201d said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. \u201cThis is Eric Cantor\u2019s fault. He was in Washington on primary day. Not back in his district.\u201d He also turned down last-minute help from political allies. \u201cHis confidence, his arrogance, his smugness cost him his seat,\u201d King added. Cantor didn\u2019t read the pulse of conservatives in his Republican-dominated district. \u201cMy sense from talking to people in the 7th is that he had lost touch with the base of the Republican Party there, and by the time he realized it and tried to make amends, it was too late,\u201d Virginia political analyst Quentin Kidd said. \u201cCantor\u2019s loss proves Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill\u2019s point about all politics being local. The tea party movement may be stumbling in some places, but there was a lot of local tea party frustration at Eric Cantor. He is seen as removed from the issues they care about, such as on immigration. They saw him as trying to have it both ways, and they called him on it,\u201d added Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Contrast that with GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent target of conservatives, who easily bested six primary challengers from the right on Tuesday. \u201cTo Graham\u2019s credit, he ran a great campaign. I think the assumption among a lot of people was that he\u2019d solely wage an air war, but I was impressed with the way he also ran a traditional, grassroots-focused campaign in addition to a compelling broadcast message. And Lindsey himself spent a lot of time on the ground here holding events and interacting one-on-one with voters,\u201d South Carolina Republican consultant Joel Sawyer told CNN. Graham tended to the folks back home. Apparently Cantor didn\u2019t go home enough. 2. The tea party is alive and well: Remember all those stories earlier this spring about the demise of the tea party. Forget about that. Cantor challenger, Dave Brat, \u2018shocked\u2019 as results rolled in The five-year-old anti-establishment grassroots conservative movement suffered a string of high profile defeats to incumbents and other mainstream Republicans earlier in the primary season. But the tide may be turning a bit. And with a bunch of tea party vs. establishment primary battles yet to come, what happened in Virginia will only embolden the grassroots. Cantor becomes the second member of Congress running for re-election this year to go down to defeat in the primaries, following Republican Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas, who lost a runoff contest two weeks ago. Hall is 91. Longtime Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi may soon become the third. He\u2019s fighting for his political life as he faces a primary runoff in two weeks against a tea party backed state senator who narrowly edged him in last week\u2019s primary. FreedomWorks, which is among the groups supporting Cochran challenger Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel, says the Cantor defeat will only help their efforts. \u201cWhat happened last night in Virginia is just like adding jet fuel on that fire. Our grassroots person is getting inundated with requests from activists to help. They\u2019re saying \u2018what can we do.  What can we do,\u2019\u201d said Brandon of FreedomWorks. Mainstream Republicans also agreed that Cantor\u2019s defeat will give the tea party more mojo. \u201cThis victory is the \u2018Pulp Fiction\u2019 equivalent of the adrenaline needle plunged into the chest of the tea party,\u201d said GOP consultant Ron Bonjean, who served as a top strategist and adviser top House and Senate Republican leaders. Who said the tea party was dead? 3. There will be a House leadership shakeup: House GOP members and aides say they are still reeling from the news and it\u2019s still sinking in. There were a flurry of calls between leadership offices and small gatherings of House GOP members on Tuesday night as the results came in, but multiple GOP leadership aides say it\u2019s still unclear what happens next. \u201cIt\u2019s just stunning,\u201d GOP Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re trying to analyze what really happened here.\u201d Cantor\u2019s expected to announce he will step down as Majority Leader effective July 31, a senior House Republican source told CNN\u2019s Bash. And the move could trigger a fight to replace him. Cantor\u2019s stunning upset does make it more likely that House Speaker John Boehner stays in office.  According to a GOP source, Boehner reaffirmed his colleagues Wednesday that he was \u201call in for speaker\u201d in the next Congress and then got a standing ovation. Current House GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy of California is expected to announce his intention to move up the leadership ladder and run for majority leader. He is popular and helped raise money and elect many of the new members of the conference. Cantor said if McCarthy runs, he would be \u201can outstanding Majority Leader\u201d and would back him. But conservative members are already demanding someone from a red state be elected to represent their views at the leadership table. Several House conservatives have pointed to Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, who currently heads the group of fiscal conservatives in the House, Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, and Georgia Rep. Tom Price as possible candidates for leadership jobs. Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas told reporters Wednesday that he\u2019s planning to run for majority leader. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington State, the House Republican conference chair and top women in the leadership team, announced that she will stay put in her current position and not bid for the majority leader position. Chaos at Cantor headquarters after loss GOP 'earthquake': Cantor loses 4. Immigration reform is dead for now: The vast majority of House Republicans already decided they didn\u2019t want to vote on any immigration bills before the midterm election.  Those advocates who were pushing for action conceded that even the most minor steps would have to wait until primary challenges were over. But after a low-profile and underfunded tea party candidate who ran almost solely on railing against Cantor\u2019s embrace of \u201camnesty\u201d beat him soundly any prospects for action have evaporated. Cantor embraced some of the most minor immigration reforms so House Republicans fearful of losing their own jobs won\u2019t want to touch the issue. \u201cThe members who want immigration reform will still be pushing it, but last night\u2019s election makes the road they must travel much steeper,\u201d said GOP strategist John Feehery, who was a top aide to one-time Speaker Dennis Hastert and Tom DeLay when he was majority whip. 2014 midterms: What\u2019s at stake Complete midterm coverage 5. If you can believe it, gridlock on Capitol Hill will get worse: The partisan toxic pre-midterm election atmosphere in Washington was already bad. Just getting the most basic bills passed to keep the government running has been a Herculean task. Terry told CNN\u2019s Bash the loss will mean members will have less motivation to work across the aisle. Terry added that the message to House GOP members is \u201cnegotiation or compromise could get you beat.\u201d Feehery added that the Cantor loss throws the Republican conference into chaos and makes it harder to get anything done. CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen agreed. \u201cFor Cantor to be knocked off by a tea party conservative over his efforts to push for immigration reform and his earlier efforts to lift the debt ceiling, I think it will send shockwaves through Republican ranks. Look at the price he paid for doing things the majority of Americans support,\u201d said Gergen a senior adviser to both Democratic and Republican presidents.

            "article_content": "Cantor lost a primary battle in Virginia on Tuesday in a stunning upset The loss shakes up the Republican leadership picture in the House Cantor was thought to be a likely successor to House Speaker John Boehner NEW: Boehner reaffirms his intention to remain speaker Vanquished at the polls in a primary upset, Rep. Eric Cantor said on Wednesday that he would step down as House majority leader, triggering a scramble among conservatives to replace him. Cantor\u2019s loss to a college professor and political novice on Tuesday in the Richmond-area campaign energized tea party supporters in a midterm year and obliterated his ambition to lead the House. Critics and analysts said he neglected his base at home in Virginia and paid the price. Cantor called the stunning loss a \u201cpersonal setback\u201d at a news conference and appealed for party unity before announcing his decision to vacate the No. 2 job in the GOP hierarchy on July 31. Behind closed doors, however, he addressed fellow Republicans at an emotional meeting where some colleagues were said to have cried and John Boehner reaffirmed his intention to remain speaker. Surprising political upsets GOP 'earthquake': Cantor loses Chaos at Cantor headquarters after loss Boehner called Cantor, 51, a \u201cgood friend\u201d and a \u201cgood leader\u201d for Republicans. 5 aftershocks from Cantor\u2019s stunning upset loss The heavily favored Cantor lost to college professor and political novice Dave Brat, who ran a spartan effort in Virginia with tea party support. He said negative ads aired by Cantor actually wound up hurting the incumbent because it raised awareness of a race most believed the challenger had no chance to win. He characterized Cantor as more interested in leadership than in the needs of his constituents. Turnout was low, and Cantor lost by 10 points. \u201cEric Cantor lost this race as much as Dave Brat won it. He simply violated rule No. 1 of politics: go home,\u201d said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. \u201cThis is Eric Cantor\u2019s fault. He was in Washington on primary day, not back in his district.\u201d But Cantor disputed that analysis. \u201cI was in my district every week, so there\u2019s a balance between holding a leadership position and serving constituents at home but never was there a day did I not put the constituents of the 7th district of Virginia first,\u201d he said. Opinion: Goodbye, GOP; the tea party has won Musical chairs The election by secret ballot for Cantor\u2019s GOP position is next Thursday, and conservatives are already demanding someone from a red state be selected to represent their views at the leadership table. Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas told reporters he\u2019s planning to run for Cantor\u2019s post. Current House GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy of California also is expected to do so and would be considered the frontrunner, but Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, the top woman on the leadership team, will stay put. Cantor gave his full-throated support to McCarthy should he run. Cantor said he \u201cwould make an outstanding majority leader.\u201d If he wins, then it would open up the No. 3 spot for someone else. So far Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois plans to run for the whip job if it\u2019s available, but would face at least one challenger, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana. More names could emerge. 7 reasons Cantor lost Harder to get something done GOP strategist John Feehery, formerly a top Republican congressional aide, said Cantor\u2019s defeat throws the GOP conference into chaos and will make it harder to get anything done. The immediate fallout focused on immigration, one issue that clearly illustrates divisions between establishment Republicans and arch-conservatives. Brat pushed the hard-line conservative position on undocumented workers in his anti-establishment campaign, slamming Cantor\u2019s support for proposals on issues around legal status. Cantor made a final defense. \u201cMy position on immigration has not changed. It didn\u2019t change from before the election, during the election, or the way it is today. You know, I have always said the system is broken, it needs reforms. I think it is much more desirable and frankly doable if we did it one step at a time, working towards where we have common ground and believe things in common,\u201d he said. Brat faces another little-known college professor in the November election, Democrat Jack Trammell. The district is reliably conservative. A Boehner bypass?

            "article_content": "Not long ago, Cantor was seen as the tea party voice within House leadership To some, Cantor embodied the arrogance of power Cantor gets blamed for being in Washington on Election Day, not in his district Dave Brat made up for the fund-raising shortfall by rallying his staunchest supporters The man in line to be the next speaker of the House lost his primary Tuesday in Virginia. The outcome of the race shocked Eric Cantor, challenger Dave Brat and political pundits and analysts. The day after Cantor\u2019s devastating defeat, those same people are trying to answer the critical questions: Why and how did a well-funded, powerful, conservative member of Congress lose to a political novice? 1. Too much political calculation: Cantor is known for smart political calculations and ambition, but this year those attributes may have cost him his job. One thing that\u2019s been lacking throughout Cantor\u2019s career is loyalty among his constituents, says Russell Berman, reporter with The Hill. \u201cHe has always been seen as somewhat calculating,\u201d Berman said, noting Cantor changed his position on immigration in the final weeks of the campaign. CNN political editor Mark Preston agreed, adding that Cantor tried to have it both ways. \u201cIt was only just a couple years ago that Eric Cantor was seen as the voice, so to speak, for the tea party within the leadership. The past couple of years, he seemed to have been moderating his views a little bit,\u201d Preston said. Eric Cantor: It's disappointing Lemon: 'Can we say holy you know what' Cantor failed to 'pay attention at home' Dave Brat: 'This is a miracle' 2. Too much ambition: CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger noted that as the No. 2 Republican in the House, Cantor was in line to become speaker, a position he wanted. \u201c(He) was seen as very ambitious, somebody who spent a lot of time fund-raising for the Republican Party,\u201d Borger said. Cantor \u2018earthquake\u2019 rattles Capitol Hill Republican strategist Ben Ferguson said Cantor \u201cforgot that his job was to go to Washington and fight for conservative ideas.\u201d \u201cHe embodied \u2013 from many of their perspectives \u2013 sort of the arrogance of power. That I think has a lot to do with it. And along those lines \u2026 he didn\u2019t tend to the district,\u201d CNN chief congressional correspondent Dana Bash said 3. Disconnected: Ambition and calculation lead to being disconnected. \u201cThis is Eric Cantor\u2019s fault. He was in Washington on Election Day, not back in his district,\u201d CNN chief national correspondent John King said. \u201cHis confidence, his smugness, his arrogance cost him his seat.\u201d Borger agreed. \u201cThis is a repudiation of Eric Cantor personally, that he failed Politics 101, which is to keep in touch with your district,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that was an issue,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cWhen you start having your operatives deal with the little people in your district \u2013 like, oh, you take their phone calls, oh, you e-mail them back, I\u2019m too busy for that, I\u2019m this big dog in the GOP \u2013 the way that Eric Cantor, John Boehner, John McCain have acted, you get your rear end kicked eventually.\u201d 4. Turnout/enthusiasm: Brat\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t come close to matching Cantor\u2019s deep pockets, but Brat made up for the fund-raising shortfall by rallying his staunchest supporters. \u201cMoney can\u2019t buy enthusiasm,\u201d  Bash said. CNN political analyst John Avlon said the difference may lie in voter turnout, which stood at just 12% on Tuesday. Cantor, Cantor, Cantor GOP 'earthquake': Cantor loses Should Cantor resign? \u201cWhen you get these very low turnout primaries and the people are not paying attention to, they can be easily hijacked by activists. There is no question Eric Cantor would have won a general election in his district,\u201d Avlon said. 5. The role of the right: Brian Stelter, CNN senior media correspondent, said conservative media corralled the troops to vote for Brat in numbers that Cantor did not match. \u201cLaura Ingraham, for example, to name one talk radio host, was very supportive of Brat, even held a rally for him in Virginia this time last week. The top of her website today said, \u2018Vote Dave Brat today.\u2019 Other radio hosts also supported him. Ann Coulter supported him. And I think they are going to be getting credit in the days to come. Tonight on Fox News, Megyn Kelly called Ingraham instrumental to this victory,\u201d Stelter said. 6.  \u2026 and the left: Larry Sabato, diirector of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said Democrats, who make up 43% of the district, played a role as well. \u201cThere was a major outreach to Democrats in that district,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cYou had Brat operatives going to Democratic Party committees, even on election eve, asking them to go to the polls to get rid of Eric Cantor. It had nothing to do with Dave Brat. There were robocalls to Democrats in that district, wanting \u2013 telling Democrats come out to the polls.\u201d 7. He was a casualty of a bigger battle: \u201c(Cantor had been) taking conservative position after conservative position after conservative position, but almost 100% wasn\u2019t enough for these folks. And I think of it as a major message to Republican leadership,\u201d Avlon said. Borger said that Cantor\u2019s loss to a challenge from the right, despite rock-solid conservative credentials, puts the GOP at a crossroad. \u201cI think they\u2019re kind of at the proverbial fork in the road. They can either be a congressional party and win these congressional seats by going further to the right, or they can become a presidential party in which you have to move to the middle.\u201d Cantor was not only an establishment figure, GOP Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska noted, but was deeply involved in negotiating with the White House to end the government shutdown last fall. \u201cAnd that was used against him. And so the message to us is, negotiation or compromise could get you beat,\u201d Terry said.

            "article_content": "Upstart Dave Brat beat heavily favored incumbent Eric Cantor Brat raised less than $300,000 compared to Cantor's $5 million Challenger's main argument was that Cantor had turned his back on conservative principles Dave Brat, an economics professor and former seminary student, pulled off the biggest political upset of the year by ousting the No. 2 House Republican Eric Cantor in a primary challenge on Tuesday night. \u201cThis is the happiest moment, obviously, of my life,\u201d Brat told his supporters at a post-election event in Glen Allen, outside Richmond, on Tuesday night. \u201cThe reason we won this campaign, there is just one reason, and that\u2019s because dollars do not vote \u2013 you do.\u201d Brat, who raised less than $300,000 to the House majority leader\u2019s campaign war chest of $5.4 million, said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about David Brat winning tonight, it\u2019s about returning the country to its principles.\u201d Cantor failed to 'pay attention at home' Just how surprising were the results? A close ally of Brat\u2019s told CNN shortly before the results were in that he was \u201cshocked\u201d and that senior campaign officials didn\u2019t believe he could pull in more than 40% of the vote. Brat ended up besting Cantor 56%-44%. Lemon: 'Can we say holy you know what' Cantor\u2019s team included some veteran Virginia political hands while some of Brat\u2019s top campaign staffers hadn\u2019t worked on a major campaign before. Many political pundits were quick to credit the tea party for boosting Brat\u2019s campaign, but his campaign did not get any significant financial support from conservative groups because they were funneling money into other primary challengers they believed had a better shot at beating GOP incumbents. Opinion: Who said the tea party was dead? \u2018A shock on your hands\u2019 In an interview a day before the vote, Brat made a prediction most political candidates make to try to energize their supporters, telling CNN, \u201cOn Tuesday you\u2019re going to have a shock on your hands.\u201d Brat joked that he expected to see a CNN van in his driveway to cover his victory on Wednesday. Brat\u2019s main argument in the race was that Cantor lost touch with his conservative principles. He told CNN, \u201cMy beef with Cantor isn\u2019t not a right- or left wing thing.\u201d Citing his expertise on economics, Brat said the GOP leader and other top congressional Republicans in Washington had set aside their \u201cfree market principles\u201d when they backed the bailout legislation that helped bolster Wall Street banks after the fiscal crisis in 2008. But the longshot candidate centered most of his attacks against Cantor on the issue of immigration, arguing that the majority leader\u2019s support for small measures allowing some type of legal status for children of undocumented immigrants was \u201camnesty.\u201d  Much of the media coverage about the race focused on Brat\u2019s attacks that Cantor wasn\u2019t pushing the conservative position. Eric Cantor: It's disappointing Cantor worked to reassure Republicans that he would not allow any legislation to come up for a vote that provided \u201camnesty.\u201d  He sent out mailers to Republicans in the district with the message \u201cconservative Republican Eric Cantor is stopping the Obama Reid plan to give illegal aliens amnesty.\u201d But Brat told CNN the issue of \u201camnesty\u201d resonated more than other issues like Obamacare and jobs \u201cbecause it shows Eric flip-flopping and being unprincipled.\u201d Jack Trammell is the Democrat who no longer has to face Eric Cantor Ad spending In addition to the top GOP leaders\u2019 position on immigration, Brat repeatedly touted his experience as an economist, and criticized both political parties for ignoring proposals to address Medicare and Social Security. \u201cNeither side of the aisle will talk about the most important issues because that is going to involve pain.\u201d While he is a political neophyte, Brat has served on state and local government boards and was a president of the Virginia Association of Economists. Despite being the overwhelming favorite, there were signs that Cantor\u2019s campaign sensed a threat. It spent more than $1 million on television and radio ads that attempted to paint Brat as a liberal. They noted that he was appointed to one of those boards by then-Democratic Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine. But Brat argued that Cantor\u2019s aggressive ad spending did him the favor of boosting his name identification around the district at a time when he didn\u2019t have the resources to run his own ads. Brat, 49, grew up in the Midwest and moved to Henrico in 1996 to begin teaching economics and ethics at Randolph-Macon College, a small liberal arts institution. He has chaired the school\u2019s Economics and Business department for the past six years. He and his wife Laura have two children.

            "article_content": "Cantor's loss shakes up GOP leadership, kills hope for immigration reform in House Challenger's win also gives jolt of energy to tea party movement Cantor's problem was that base grew distrustful of him, analyst says It\u2019s the earthquake that rocked the GOP. In a year when mainstream Republicans have mostly bested tea party-backed challengers, a little-known and little-funded tea party challenger in Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District pulled the upset of the year, defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor by 10 percentage points. The victory by economics professor Dave Brat gives the tea party an instant jolt of energy, sends shock waves through Capitol Hill, shakes up the GOP House hierarchy \u2013 as Cantor was seen by many as the next speaker \u2013 and effectively kills any chance of immigration reform passing through the House any time soon. \u201cI think this is a scale eight earthquake. I think it will shock the Washington establishment; it will shock the House Republicans,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said. Cantor failed to 'pay attention at home' Dave Brat: 'This is a miracle' Eric Cantor: It's disappointing Immigration reform protests at Cantor HQ \u201cIt certainly upsets the balance of power inside the Republican conference. And combined with the results last week in Mississippi, it sends a pretty strong signal that while money matters, voters may matter more, and people have to have a little respect for the right of the voter to have attention paid to them, and the right of the voter to throw people out if they\u2019re not happy with them,\u201d added Gingrich, a 2012 Republican presidential candidate and co-host of CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire.\u201d Cantor becomes only the second member of Congress running for re-election this year to go down in defeat in the primaries, following 91-year-old Republican Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas. Longtime Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi may soon become the third. He\u2019s fighting for his political life as he faces a primary runoff election in two weeks against a tea party-backed state senator who narrowly edged him in last week\u2019s primary but not by enough to win outright. \u201cThis victory is the \u2018Pulp Fiction\u2019 equivalent of the adrenaline needle plunged into the chest of the tea party,\u201d said GOP consultant Ron Bonjean, who served as a top strategist and adviser to House and Senate Republican leaders. \u201cThey had largely conceded most of the Republican primaries to the establishment.\u201d Brent Bozell, an anti-establishment leader and \u201cForAmerica\u201d chairman, proclaimed that \u201cEric Cantor\u2019s loss tonight is an apocalyptic moment for the GOP establishment. The grass-roots is in revolt and marching.\u201d Eric Cantor loses primary in big upset; Lindsey Graham avoids runoff How Cantor lost In the primary\u2019s closing days, aides close to Cantor said they expected the majority leader to win around 60% of the vote in his primary. He didn\u2019t come close. \u201cObviously, we came up short,\u201d the seven-term congressman told supporters as he conceded the race. Cantor apparently didn\u2019t read the pulse of conservatives in his Republican-dominated district, which is anchored in the Richmond area but stretches some 100 miles from the Tidewater to the outer reaches of the Washington exurbs. \u201cEric Cantor lost this race as much as Dave Brat won it. Two years ago, Eric Cantor got 37,000 votes in his primary. Nine thousand fewer votes this time. He simply violated rule number one of politics: Go home,\u201d said CNN chief national correspondent John King. \u201cThis is Eric Cantor\u2019s fault. He was in Washington on primary day, not back in his district.\u201d Cantor also turned down last-minute help from political allies. \u201cHis confidence, his arrogance, his smugness cost him his seat,\u201d King added. \u201cMy sense from talking to people in the 7th is that he had lost touch with the base of the Republican Party there, and by the time he realized it and tried to make amends, it was too late,\u201d Virginia political analyst Quentin Kidd said. \u201cThe real problem that the (tea party) base had with Cantor is that they got to where they didn\u2019t trust him,\u201d added Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. \u201cThe issue that broke the bank for him was immigration. They saw him say one thing in Washington, then say something else to them, and it caused deep distrust in the district.\u201d Cantor\u2019s campaign shelled out a couple of million dollars in television and radio ads to send its message that Cantor was \u201ca strong conservative.\u201d It outspent Brat\u2019s by more than 10 to 1. To put it another way, Cantor spent well over $100 for each vote that he won. Brat spent around $5 per vote. In his victory speech, Brat told supporters, \u201cDollars do not vote \u2013 you do.\u201d Brat framed his challenge as another case of a grass-roots conservative taking on the GOP establishment, a major theme in Republican contests this year. And Brat made immigration reform the central issue and said Cantor\u2019s position would hurt the economy. \u201cThe amnesty issue is the symbolic powerful expression about the difference between Eric and I on jobs,\u201d Brat said. Cantor has publicly supported proposals allowing children of those who enter the country illegally \u2013 so-called Dreamers \u2013 the ability to obtain some type of legal status. But Cantor opposed the bill passed by the Senate last year that included a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. Cantor\u2019s team pushed back, calling Brat, a \u201cliberal college professor.\u201d That worked against him, Kidd said. \u201cHis negative turn played into this narrative that Cantor couldn\u2019t be trusted \u2026 that he was out of touch with the conservative principles of the district, and was using Washington-style campaign tactics to beat his opponent down.\u201d Brat\u2019s victory may have also been fueled by popular conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, who was an early supporter. \u201cThe seeds for Brat\u2019s upset were sown on right-wing radio talk shows, particularly Laura Ingraham\u2019s,\u201d CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter said. \u201cThis time last week, Ingraham was busy headlining a giant rally for Brat. On Tuesday, her website implored fans to vote for him.\u201d Two pieces of irony: Cantor\u2019s defeat comes just three days after Virginia Republicans, meeting at their state party convention, nominated Ed Gillespie \u2013 the poster boy for \u201cinside the beltway\u201d Republicans \u2013 as the party\u2019s U.S. Senate nominee. And Cantor\u2019s loss also came on the same night that GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent target of conservatives, easily bested six primary challengers from the right. Aftershocks on Capitol Hill In his 13 years in Congress, Cantor has rocketed up the ranks, all the way to majority leader, the No. 2 spot in the House Republican leadership. And Cantor was seen by many as biding his time until the eventual retirement of House Speaker John Boehner. Now that succession is upended, and Cantor\u2019s defeat will only embolden the powerful tea party wing in the House. Conservatives will most likely demand that Cantor be replaced with someone on the right. \u201cIt\u2019s going to speed up the process of tea party members positioning themselves for a leadership run. This stunning news could be the first shot in an all-out war between the establishment and tea party over leadership control,\u201d said Bonjean, the GOP consultant. The No. 3 House Republican, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, is popular among members and has chits from many of the freshman and sophomores he helped elect. But because he\u2019s part of the current GOP leadership lineup, many tea party groups and members on the right of the conference don\u2019t trust him as a solid conservative. He is likely to want to move up to Cantor\u2019s post, but could draw a challenge. Some are floating House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan\u2019s name, but a source close to the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee calls those rumors \u201cbaseless and unfounded\u201d and notes that Ryan batted down questions about his interest in any run for the top spot. But because the news of Cantor\u2019s defeat is still sinking in, members are still calling around and testing the temperature for what should happen next. Cantor\u2019s defeat also effectively kills any hopes that the House will pass an immigration reform bill. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough case to make that immigration is going to be brought to the House floor anytime soon,\u201d Bonjean said. CNN senior political analyst David Gergen agreed. \u201cFor Cantor to be knocked off by a tea party conservative over his efforts to push for immigration reform and his earlier efforts to lift the debt ceiling, I think it will send shock waves through Republican ranks.\u201d Look at the price he paid for doing things the majority of Americans support,\u201d said Gergen, a senior adviser to both Democratic and Republican presidents.

Cutter presses Graham on climate change Graham: W.H. believes 'we're all dumb' In red-state South Carolina, Graham will be considered the strong favorite in November\u2019s general election, when he faces Democratic state Sen. Brad Hutto, who easily won his party\u2019s primary. South Carolina is not Mississippi Graham\u2019s victory also stood in contrast to Republican Sen. Thad Cochran\u2019s fight for his political life in Mississippi. Last week, Cochran was forced into a runoff against a challenger backed by the tea party. But for Graham, any comparison with Cochran was short lived, even though many tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives in South Carolina despise him and other local organizations in the state have censured him in recent years. Graham had some advantages heading into the contest: He had a massive war chest \u2013 around $8 million cash on hand, which gave him a huge campaign cash advantage over his primary opponents \u2013 and outside groups have steered clear of the race, unlike in Mississippi where establishment and tea party groups fought. South Carolina Republican consultant Joel Sawyer told CNN that Graham was facing off  \u201cagainst an incredibly weak field of competitors, and of course he benefited by having the \u2018not Lindsey\u2019 vote split among several folks.\u201d \u201cSecond, to Lindsey\u2019s credit, he ran a great campaign. I think the assumption among a lot of people was that he\u2019d solely wage an air war, but I\u2019ve been impressed with the way he also ran a traditional, grassroots-focused campaign in addition to a compelling broadcast message. And Lindsey himself spent a lot of time on the ground here holding events and interacting one-on-one with voters,\u201d Sawyer added. Graham debated his opponents for the first and only time this past weekend. They slammed him over his 2008 vote in favor of the Wall Street bailout, his votes in favor of President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominations, and especially for his support of immigration reform. Obama: Midterm elections will decide the fate of immigration reform Maybe immigration reform isn\u2019t dead after all Graham was a member of the bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d senators who pushed immigration reform through the chamber last year. The bill was never taken up by the GOP-controlled House. Heading into Tuesday\u2019s contest, polls showed Graham close to the 50% threshold.  He spent Monday on a bus tour through the conservative, voter-rich upstate region. In his final campaign commercial before the primary, Graham touted his conservative credentials, which he said included support for \u201cbuilding the Keystone pipeline, opposing Obamacare, looking for answers on Benghazi, standing up for our military.\u201d And in the ad, which his campaign said was a six-figure statewide buy on TV, radio and digital, Graham said he is a \u201cconservative leader you can count on to get things done.\u201d South Carolina and Virginia were among five states that held primaries on Tuesday. 2014: What\u2019s at stake Key races to watch Primary calendar Special Coverage: The 2014 Midterms",

            "article_content": "Close race in Mississippi shows tea party is far from dead Little-known state senator turns ads into win in Iowa Mitt Romney has had more success promoting candidates than he did as a candidate The tea party movement is an important step closer to doing something it\u2019s done only three times before: Oust an incumbent Republican senator in a GOP primary. Tea party backed state Sen. Chris McDaniel forced incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran into a runoff in Mississippi\u2019s Republican primary. The challenge could give the 5-year-old grass-roots conservative movement - which so far this year has suffered a string of high profile primary defeats - a much needed injection of energy. In Tuesday\u2019s other marquee showdown, a candidate who enjoyed both tea party and mainstream Republican backing won big in the Iowa GOP Senate primary, thanks in part to some clever ads that went viral. Ben Carson defends Obamacare comments Political firestorm over Bergdahl Dems attacked over veterans And in California, which now uses an open primary system where the top two finishers advance to the November election regardless of party affiliation, a moderate Republican edged out a tea party-backed conservative for the honor of facing off in the midterms against heavily favored Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown. Here are the top takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s primaries: 1. Round 2: Tea party vs. establishment in Mississippi: While candidates with tea party support have struggled to claim major victories this year, McDaniel\u2019s ability to force Cochran, 76, into a runoff indicates the grass-roots conservative movement is still rumbling \u2013 and powerful enough to nearly take out a six-term incumbent senator. Since the tea party started gaining steam in 2009, the far right has defeated only three incumbent senators in GOP primaries: Bob Bennett of Utah (2010), Lisa Murkowski of Alaska (2010) and Dick Lugar of Indiana (2012). Murkowski, however, later won the general race with a write-in campaign. McDaniel, 42, and his supporters say Cochran, who\u2019s running for a seventh term, has been in Washington far too long. He especially irked grassroots conservatives when he said earlier this year, \u201cthe tea party is something I don\u2019t really know a lot about.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear who has more momentum going forward. McDaniel certainly rallied his supporters Tuesday night, vowing to claim victory in the June 24 runoff. \u201cI promise you this, whether it\u2019s tomorrow or whether it\u2019s three weeks from tonight, we will stand victorious in this race,\u201d he said. But Cochran supporters also say they\u2019re ready for another round. Henry Barbour, who runs the pro-Cochran PAC Mississippi Conservatives, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that they\u2019re \u201cgoing to get up and rethink\u201d their message. \u201cReally organize from the ground up,\u201d he added. Barbour said \u201ccomplacency\u201d among Cochran voters \u201churt us,\u201d and he thinks \u201cthey got outshouted.\u201d Stuart Stevens, a Cochran adviser and former adviser to Mitt Romney, told Bash that three weeks allows more time to scrutinize McDaniel\u2019s record and ask tough questions. Tea Party roundup in Texas Mississippi GOP primary down to the wire 5 primaries worth watching today But supporters of McDaniel may point to the 2012 Senate primary in Texas, where a political newcomer known as Ted Cruz came from behind to push the establishment candidate, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, into a runoff. The extra time gave Cruz a longer window to build his profile. That summer, he rose to national fame and attracted support from high-profile figures like Sarah Palin. Two months after the primary, Cruz defeated Dewhurst in the runoff. McDaniel won\u2019t have nearly as much time to solidify a victory, but being so close to a win may only make his supporters want it that much more. No matter who has more momentum, the runoff certainly seems poised to become another supercharged fight between the establishment and tea party Republicans. Race gets ugly in the Mississippi mud 2. Hog wild in Iowa: The free-for-all that was the Iowa Republican Senate primary turned into a landslide victory for Joni Ernst over three other major GOP candidates. Ernst went from a little-known state senator to the front-runner who enjoyed support from major mainstream GOP groups and anti-establishment and tea party organizations. She also won endorsements from such high-profile Republicans as Palin, Romney and Marco Rubio. The big question going into Tuesday\u2019s primary was whether Ernst would crack the 35% threshold and avoid a runoff. If not, the nomination would have been decided a week later by some 2,000 delegates at the Iowa GOP convention. The final public opinion poll going into the primary had Ernst at 36%. When the primary results were in, Ernst grabbed 56% of the vote. So how did she do it? Some provocative ads definitely helped. \u201cI\u2019m Joni Ernst. I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington, I\u2019ll know how to cut pork,\u201d Ernst said in the first TV commercial of her campaign. That spot, which first aired in late March, not only made Ernst more recognizable in the Hawkeye State, but also across the nation. A second commercial showed Ernst, a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard, riding up to a gun range on a motorcycle. \u201cWith little name ID and even less money to introduce herself to Iowans earlier this year, her clever ads were undoubtedly the spark that fueled tonight\u2019s impressive victory,\u201d Iowa Republican consultant Matt Strawn, a former chairman of the state GOP, told CNN on Tuesday night. And Iowa Republican strategist Tim Albrecht, who is supporting Ernst, said \u201cthe ads were successful because they were genuine Joni. She has been under-estimated from the beginning, and proved tonight she is a candidate to be reckoned with in November.\u201d Ernst joked about her now-famous hog castration commercial in her victory speech, saying \u201cI grew up \u2026 canning food and feeding hogs on our family farm, and yes, some of you may know I did more than just feed the hogs.\u201d Ernst hopes to make history in November as the first woman to represent Iowa in Congress. In the midterm elections, she\u2019ll face Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who was unopposed in his party\u2019s primary. The winner of November\u2019s general election will succeed longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who is retiring at the end of the year. Republicans feel they have a good shot at flipping Harkin\u2019s seat, in their drive to retake the Senate. GOP candidate gets mainstream and anti-establishment backing 3. Open primaries have consequences No one questioned whether Democrat Jerry Brown, who\u2019s bidding for an unprecedented fourth term as California governor, was the overwhelming favorite in Tuesday\u2019s Golden State primary. The big question was whom the incumbent would face off with come November. For the first time in a gubernatorial race, California held an open, or \u201cjungle,\u201d primary, where all candidates compete in a single contest and the first and second place finishers, regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election. Second place went to former Bush administration treasury official Neel Kashkari,  who edged out  state Rep. Tim Donnelly, a fellow Republican. Kashkari\u2019s a moderate who is best known for managing the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), better known as the Wall Street bailouts, during President George W. Bush\u2019s last year in office. He\u2019s also a supporter of immigration reform, same-sex marriage and abortion rights. The tea party-backed Donnelly is an outspoken supporter of the rights of gun owners and a fierce opponent of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Kashkari\u2019s victory could make a difference for the party\u2019s chances in the general election. Some GOP strategists told CNN they were concerned that if Donnelly won, it would hurt Republican candidates in down-ballot races in a state where the general election electorate is much more moderate than that of the GOP primary. It\u2019s also more than fair to say that in a traditional GOP primary, which is dominated by conservatives, Kashkari would have had a much tougher time beating Donnelly. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to study it and find things to love and hate about the open primary system,\u201d said CNN chief national correspondent John King. \u201cThere are some grass-roots conservatives who think establishment Republicans are looking for every way under the sun to weaken them. They will now point to the open primary system as an example, since their party\u2019s gubernatorial nominee in California is a man who not only supported the Wall Street bailouts, but actually administered them,\u201d King added. 4. Romney\u2019s candidates clean up: Romney has the Midas touch this election season. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee continued his winning streak Tuesday with three of the GOP candidates he endorsed winning their primaries. Romney campaigned with Ernst in Iowa and cut an online ad for the Chamber of Commerce supporting her candidacy.  His endorsement adds some establishment GOP backing to the conservative favorite, who also enjoys support from tea party power players like Palin. In California, Romney backed Kashkari, who came in second and now advances to November\u2019s general election. Also in California, Romney threw his support behind former state Rep. Tony Strickland, who co-chaired both of his presidential bids, in the state\u2019s 25th Congressional District. Strickland came in first in the vote count, which sends him on to the general election. The winner of that contest will go on to succeed retiring GOP Rep. Buck McKeon, chairman of the Armed Services Committee. After failing to nab the White House from President Barack Obama, Romney backed away from the spotlight briefly before jumping back into the political fray, surprising many with his involvement in the 2014 election cycle. So far this election cycle, he\u2019s endorsed or donated money to some 20 candidates, many of them GOP establishment favorites who backed Romney in his White House runs. Two weeks ago, two other candidates he had backed scored high-profile primary victories. Romney endorsed and recorded a robocall for Dr. Monica Wehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon who won the GOP Senate primary in Oregon over a more conservative state lawmaker. The same night, eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho beat back a serious primary challenge from a tea party-backed candidate. Romney had endorsed Simpson and starred in a television commercial put out by the Chamber of Commerce that backed Simpson. Asked last week about his winning track record when it comes to primary endorsements, Romney told reporters: \u201cI wish I can take credit for that. The candidates take credit for that, and I am sure we will have some successes and some that are not successful.\u201d Mississippi GOP primary race too close to call Primary problems: GOP women struggle to come out on top",

            "article_content": "Boehner has been speaker since 2011 and has said he's not going anywhere Hensarling says he's flattered by the attention, but is not thinking about being speaker But he's leaving the door open as some conservatives have been unhappy with Boehner's leadership Some conservatives unhappy with House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s leadership are looking for a replacement, and recent moves by Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling are fueling speculation he wants Boehner\u2019s job in the next Congress. Hensarling, who was part of Boehner\u2019s leadership team two years ago but left to chair the House Financial Services Committee, gave an expansive speech last week hosted by Heritage Action for America, a group that frequently and publicly clashes with Boehner. Asked afterward if he was interested in running for speaker, Hensarling initially said he was \u201cflattered,\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ve aspired to. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d Boehner at war with conservative groups Boehner: The far right is using Americans Photos: John Boehner's political career But then he left the door open, saying, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t been Shermanesque, again I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any opportunity I want to foreclose.\u201d While Heritage Action\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Michael Needham told CNN that his group doesn\u2019t get involved in leadership races, the conservative group gave Hensarling a high-profile platform to outline his own conservative philosophy for governing. Needham said there is a \u201creal need to take on sacred cows in Washington at time when the party too often looks after K Street,\u201d a reference to the downtown D.C. address for corporate lobbyists. He said, \u201cJeb Hensarling is a great spokesman and fighter for conservative values.\u201d Boehner has said he\u2019s staying put Boehner, in his 12th term in Congress and in his second as speaker, continues to insist he\u2019s not going anywhere and expects to remain in charge next year. But he raised questions earlier this month when he wouldn\u2019t commit to serving out another full term as speaker. At the beginning of the current Congress in January 2013, a dozen House GOP members voted for someone other than Boehner, or voted \u201cpresent,\u201d an expression of no confidence. Many in that small group are convinced Boehner won\u2019t run for his post after this year\u2019s midterms or that he won\u2019t have the votes to keep that title. If Boehner decides to step down from the position, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is popular among conservatives, and most expect him to move up and take the speaker\u2019s gavel. In that scenario conservatives could wage an effort to fill in top House GOP posts. Boehner on the establishment and the tea party Multiple House Republicans \u2013 some who voted for Boehner in 2013 and some who didn\u2019t \u2013 praised Hensarling as a solid conservative, but also told CNN there\u2019s a short list of others who are viable candidates. Many House Republicans interviewed by CNN declined to talk openly about potential leadership challenges, but admitted there are informal discussions about options. The names repeatedly raised include Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, who like Hensarling is a former chairman of the fiscally conservative Republican Study Committee; Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who currently heads that group; and Georgia Rep. Tom Price, another former study group leader who also served in Boehner\u2019s leadership team in the last Congress. \u201cThe one consensus point is that we\u2019d like to see more conservatives in future leadership posts,\u201d Louisiana Republican John Fleming told CNN. But he cautioned for now there\u2019s no single alternative emerging to Boehner \u2013 or anyone who might want to challenge the speaker\u2019s current top lieutenants \u2013 Cantor and GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy.  He said he expected more serious discussions to ramp up by the end of the summer. Hensarling\u2019s recent speech at Heritage may be a way to ensure his name gets in the mix. The Texas Republican used the speech to position himself firmly on the right.  He called out his own party for breaking with its free market roots, arguing that the party should be shifting away from policies designed to help big business and the well-connected and instead champion policies to help the \u201cMain Street competitive economy.\u201d The thrust of Hensarling\u2019s speech lines up with the message many on the right flank of the House GOP conference have been pushing.  Idaho Republican Raul Labrador has publicly criticized House GOP leaders for pushing a legislative agenda that positions the GOP as the \u201cparty of big business\u201d and doesn\u2019t resonate with small businesses and entrepreneurs. Challenging the party Hensarling argued those on Main Street are \u201cnot looking for a subsidy, earmark, tax preference or legislated advantage.\u201d On a series of issues \u2013 tax reform, farm policy, reform of mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae \u2013 Hensarling challenged his party to hold votes on legislation that would restructure current federal systems. The bulk of Hensarling\u2019s ire was directed at the Export Import Bank, the 80-year-old credit agency that gives out loans to companies to promote U.S. exports.  The bank\u2019s lending authority is due to expire at the end of the year. Hensarling defended 2013 GOP shutdown strategy Hensarling held it up as the poster child of corporate welfare, citing that the vast majority of its taxpayer backed loans go to companies like aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing.  He said getting rid of the bank \u201cis a defining issue for our party and our movement.\u201d If Hensarling or anyone else is serious about mounting a challenge, the Republicans that CNN interviewed all agree that if they are serious they need to move soon. \u201cIt seems to me that the odds of there being some type of change within the leadership team seem to be more likely than less, and so as long as there are members talking about it it\u2019s better to do so early than late,\u201d Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King told CNN. North Carolina Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who opposed Boehner in the last election, told CNN that he hears from Republicans in his district that it\u2019s time for a leadership change in Washington. \u201cThere is a great deal of frustration,\u201d Jones said. He wasn\u2019t sure if Hensarling or someone else was the right fit, but said a successful campaign required several months or preparation. A few months ago unhappiness about Boehner\u2019s handling of government spending fights and concern he would negotiate with Democrats on a major immigration bill roiled the conference.  But because members aren\u2019t coalescing around a single alternative, the vacuum gives Boehner some job security for now. Fleming said tension is down between conservatives and Boehner because the speaker agreed to form a select committee on the deadly Benghazi terror attack and hold a House vote that held former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt for the controversy around her agency\u2019s targeting of conservative groups. He said \u201cthere are less things that divide us \u2013 but the one question would be immigration.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Establishment Republicans continued winning streak against tea party Rand Paul went one step further in support of Mitch McConnell After divisive races, GOP looking for party unity Margolies comeback falters despite high-profile help Six states held primaries on Tuesday, and once again anti-establishment candidates came up short in high-profile Republican showdowns. That\u2019s a sharp difference with what we have seen over the last two election cycles, when establishment Republicans were overwhelmed by the insurgency in their own party and did little to stop it. But they appear to have turned the tables on the conservatives so far in this election cycle and have a string of victories to show for it. Here are five things we learned Tuesday night: 1. Establishment GOP has learned to play ball: Since its birth in 2009, the tea party has had successes in primaries but those have given the GOP plenty of headaches and hurt its chances of winning back the Senate, effectively costing Republicans five winnable elections over the last two cycles. This year, the establishment has had the upper hand in most contests against tea party-backed challengers. Showdowns on Tuesday in Kentucky, Idaho, Georgia, and Oregon kept that winning streak going. Bevin: Attacks eroded faith in leaders What's on the horizon for Sen. McConnell? Gov. Deal and Sen. McConnell secure wins In Kentucky, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell easily dispatched Matt Bevin, who enjoyed the support of tea party activists and anti-establishment groups. It was a similar story in Idaho, where eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson also beat back a similar challenge from the right. In Georgia\u2019s free-for-all Republican Senate primary, the two finishers who now move onto a July runoff were considered the most acceptable to the establishment. And in Oregon,  pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Monica Wehby, who enjoyed support from the GOP establishment, defeated a more conservative candidate for the state\u2019s Republican Senate nomination. How did they do it? The winners all ran smart campaigns and were fortunate that the losers stumbled. And outside help also made a difference. The pro-business U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent more than $4 million to support McConnell, Simpson and Rep. Jack Kingston, who will face off with businessman David Perdue in the Georgia runoff. One reason for the winning streak: The establishment has learned how to play ball with the tea party. \u201cEvery establishment candidate ran like a tea party candidate. It\u2019s hard to tell the difference this time around, because they had a uniting factor in opposing Obamacare but also united on issues like immigration and trade and climate change. The establishment Republican Party ran to the right this time,\u201d said CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. What\u2019s at stake in 2014? While Democrats argue that the move to the right will backfire on the GOP come November, midterm elections are traditionally low turnout affairs compared to presidential elections. And in such contests, the key to victory is often getting out the base. 2. Is Rand Paul now all in for McConnell?: Sen. Rand Paul endorsed McConnell in the primary, but his support seemed tepid at best. In February, Paul said he backed his fellow Kentucky senator simply \u201cbecause he asked me.\u201d His lukewarm support wasn\u2019t all that surprising. After all, McConnell didn\u2019t back Paul in the GOP primary in 2010, though he made amends and endorsed Paul in the general election. Still, Paul\u2019s endorsement this cycle was strategically a big deal for McConnell. It helped boost the five-term senator\u2019s conservative cred in a race that ultimately pitted him against a tea party challenger. Paul hasn\u2019t been McConnell\u2019s most vocal surrogate, but on Tuesday night he delivered an enthusiastic video message at McConnell\u2019s election night headquarters, preaching his theme of party unity, and couching his support for McConnell as a chance to help Republicans take the Senate. Jones: The Tea Party has taken over GOP A look at the midterm primary elections Senate race heats up in Kentucky \u201cFour years ago, after a contentious primary, Sen. McConnell pulled the party together. Republicans united to forge a big victory and allow me to be a U.S. senator. Republicans must now come together again. We must unite to stop Harry Reid and his liberal allies from controlling the Senate,\u201d he said. Paul said he\u2019ll \u201ccrisscross\u201d Kentucky over the next six months to help campaign for McConnell and other Republican candidates in the state. But if he runs for president \u2014 possibly starting as early as next year \u2013 he\u2019ll still have to think about that grassroots establishment base, and that may keep him at arm\u2019s length from McConnell. Key races in the 2014 midterms 3. Putting down the swords: Speaking of unity, Paul wasn\u2019t the only one calling for a more cohesive GOP. Conservatives seemed to be keenly aware Tuesday night that McConnell is heading into a tight race against Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes. Despite disagreeing with the longtime senator on some big issues, a number of conservative groups were quick to offer an olive branch and call for unity after Bevin lost to McConnell. They made it clear that potentially losing Kentucky\u2019s Senate seat to a Democrat is much worse than losing it to an establishment Republican. The Senate Conservatives Fund, which spent big bucks for Bevin, congratulated McConnell in a statement and said, \u201cit\u2019s time for Republicans to unite for victory in November.\u201d Erick Erickson, the editor of the influential conservative website RedState, announced Tuesday before the results were in that he \u201cproudly\u201d supported McConnell and sent his campaign $250 to help with the general election. \u201cPeople tell me I\u2019m a leader in the conservative movement. Sometimes leading means going where I\u2019d prefer not to,\u201d he wrote. The Madison Project, another group that backed Bevin, also asked \u201call Republicans to come together to defeat\u201d Grimes. And in his concession speech, Bevin didn\u2019t back McConnell, but he said he has no intention \u201cof supporting the Democratic platform over the Republican platform.\u201d But not everyone was singing quite the same tune. The group FreedomWorks, which plays a major role in the tea party movement, didn\u2019t call for Republicans to unite around McConnell, but they didn\u2019t attack him either. \u201cCompetition always breeds stronger candidates, and there is an improved conservative candidate heading into the general election as a result,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Matt Kibbe, said in a statement. The questions is: Will conservatives be ready to hold hands with the establishment every time their candidate loses? Or is this simply a strategic alliance to boost the chances of a GOP win in November? 4. Clinton support is no guarantee: Marjorie Margolies, a former congresswoman from Pennsylvania who was seeking a comeback, lost Tuesday night in a Democratic House primary, despite having support from some of the most popular Democrats in the country: Bill and Hillary Clinton. They also happen to be Margolies\u2019 in-laws. Her son, Marc Mezvinsky, married Chelsea Clinton in 2010, and the couple are expecting their first child this fall. Margolies was running in a competitive four-way Democratic primary for Pennsylvania\u2019s 13th Congressional District. Hillary Clinton appeared at a private fundraiser for Margolies last week, making it the only 2014 race she\u2019s gotten involved with this year so far. The former president appeared on the trail for her and made robocalls for the candidate this past weekend. Their support for Margolies was by far the Clintons\u2019 most visible campaign activity this year. But Tuesday night\u2019s race, which went to Brendan Boyle, indicated that support from the Clintons isn\u2019t necessarily a golden ticket. Margolies represented the eastern Pennsylvania seat for two years in the early \u201990s. She ended up losing her seat after being the deciding vote in favor of Clinton\u2019s budget. Bill Clinton didn\u2019t forget the price she paid. He campaigned for Margolies in April and noted that he \u201cwould be here if her son was not my son-in-law.\u201d Margolies told Borger that she knew it was a risky move to have the Clintons publicly supporting her. \u201cWe always knew that if they came in too much, we would be blamed for their coming in too much. If they don\u2019t come in enough, then people would say they didn\u2019t come in enough. You\u2019re kind of damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t,\u201d Margolies said. \u201cThey have done everything we\u2019ve asked them to do, and I am running on what I have accomplished in the last 20 years and not on my affiliation with the Clintons.\u201d On the comeback trail with help from the Clintons 5. What happens in May matters in November: We already knew this, but it\u2019s worth repeating: Primary results have major consequences. The victories by McConnell in Kentucky, and Wehby in Oregon, and with Perdue and Kingston advancing to the runoff in the Georgia Senate race ahead of three more conservative candidates, the GOP improved its chances come November. By nominating candidates who have a better shot of appealing to the wider electorate that votes in November, Republicans now upped their odds when it comes to winning the six Democratic-held seats the party needs to win back the control of the Senate. The victories on Tuesday followed establishment Senate primary wins in North Carolina two weeks ago and in Texas in March. With establishment candidates in most of the remaining primaries leading in the public opinion polls, the trend should continue.",

            "article_content": "Tea party's success rate far different than in 2010, 2012 election cycles Establishment Republicans have flooded key races with cash and support Mainstream GOP says tea party has hurt chances from taking control of Senate Establishment Republicans, backed by business-friendly outside groups, launched a counter-offensive this year against conservative Senate challengers after two election cycles of hard-right candidates winning GOP primaries but losing in November. Republicans need to flip six seats this year to win back the majority and don\u2019t want the same scenario to play out again. The tea party\u2019s scorecard this year is far different than in 2010 and 2012, when it knocked off several establishment-backed candidates. Short-lived tea party victories It\u2019s too early to say if the party\u2019s over, but as Stuart Rothenberg of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report wrote earlier this month, \u201cit\u2019s already clear that the pragmatist conservatives have stopped the anti-establishment\u2019s electoral momentum.\u201d Midterm users guide: 15 things to know March 4 \u2022 Firebrand Republican Rep. Steve Stockman launched a last-minute bid against Texas Sen. John Cornyn, but he never seriously challenged the incumbent. Cornyn won by more than 40 points. Inside Politics: $100 million Senate seat IP Obama VA Fallout Democrats optimistic about \"The Marks\" May 6 \u2022 North Carolina state House Speaker Thom Tillis won big against his top two conservative opponents, winning enough of the vote in the primary to avoid a costly runoff that would have delayed his general election face-off against Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, one of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents. May 13 \u2022 The primary in solidly red Nebraska might have been the high-water mark for the tea party in this cycle. Ben Sasse, a former Bush administration official who was endorsed by high-profile conservatives like Ted Cruz and Sarah Palin as well as the Club for Growth and other well-funded conservative groups, beat his two primary opponents and will likely coast to victory in November. \u2022 At the same time, no challenge emerged from the right against moderate Rep. Shelley Moore Capito in West Virginia, and she easily won the GOP primary there. Republicans hope to pick up the seat of retiring longtime Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller in November. What\u2019s at stake in 2014? May 20 \u2022 After promising that the establishment would \u201ccrush\u201d the tea party in 2014, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appears likely to do just that against challenger Matt Bevin. But McConnell faces a serious challenge from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, who\u2019s already campaigning with Democratic stars and getting support from outside groups in what could be the most expensive Senate race ever. \u2022 In Georgia, businessman David Perdue, Rep. Jack Kingston, and former state Secretary of State Karen Handel are the frontrunners, while two fiery conservative congressmen, Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey, trail in the race for retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss\u2019 seat. The winner of the GOP primary will likely face Michelle Nunn, the daughter of longtime Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn. \u2022 In Oregon, Portland pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Monica Wehby is the frontrunner over a more conservative state representative, Jason Conger, in the race for the GOP Senate nomination. The winner of that contest will face first-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who Republicans think might be vulnerable if 2014 turns into a wave election for Republicans. Key races to watch in 2014 June 3 \u2022 Six-term Sen. Thad Cochran is facing a serious challenge from state lawmaker Chris McDaniel in Mississippi. Polling shows Cochran with a comfortable lead, but the establishment isn\u2019t taking the race for granted. \u2022 Thanks to a pair of quirky TV ads, state Sen. Joni Ernst has surged ahead of a pack of Republican candidates vying for retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin\u2019s seat in Iowa. Ernst is supported by the state\u2019s Republican establishment, but she also has support from Palin and other notable conservatives. If no candidate in the primary earns more than 35% of the vote, the nominee will be selected at a convention, which could favor a conservative. The GOP nominee will face off against Democrat Bruce Braley in the fall. 2014 primary calendar June 10 \u2022 In South Carolina, Sen. Lindsey Graham has long been vulnerable to a challenge on the right because of his calls for immigration reform, his support for President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees and his willingness to work with Democrats on some issues. But conservatives have not coalesced around any of his six primary challengers. If Graham is held under 50% in the primary, he will face off against the second-place finisher in a two-week runoff. August 5 \u2022 Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts has faced questions about his residency and the amount of time he\u2019s spent in his home state, but he\u2019s still in the driver\u2019s seat in his primary against radiologist Milton Wolf. August 7 \u2022 Tennessee conservatives have made noise about unseating longtime Sen. Lamar Alexander, lining up behind state Rep. Joe Carr. But Carr has failed to gain much traction statewide. ",

Return of the establishment Republicans: But will it mean GOP victories in the fall? The tea party\u2019s candidates have failed to catch on in Kentucky, North Carolina and Mississippi, to name a few. Absent any onetime witches in the field, there\u2019s no guarantee that the tea party faithful will turn out in droves to push Sen. Mitch McConnell over the finish line to re-election in November. 2014 primary calendar 2. Wherefore art thou, independents? Are they disenfranchised conservatives or middle-of-the-road voters who are thoroughly ticked off at Washington? Either way, will they vote? Can the tea party stand the test of time? Obama admits Democrats have a problem GOP Candidates Balk at Sen. McConnell 3. Minimum wage/minimum gain? Will Democrats get a minimum return on the time they have invested on the issue? President Barack Obama continually pushed for an increase in the minimum wage throughout the year. He\u2019s been taking it to voters outside the Beltway. But is the issue doing what Democrats are hoping for and energizing their base? 4. Boehner and the border: Will House Speaker John Boehner take immigration reform to the floor? Will he buck his caucus\u2019 most conservative members? And if so, will it have any effect on who turns out to vote? 5. Embrace the Act: Can Democrats effectively run on the parts of the Affordable Care Act that the public likes? Will the public still like any of it as the year wears on? Who\u2019ll run away from it, and who\u2019ll run on it? And with polls showing almost half of the country now wanting to tweak it instead of throwing it out, can running on the anti-Obamacare theme gin up the conservative base as much as some in the GOP expect? 6. The 2016 GOP field: Fired up and ready to go \u2026 but to where? 2014 midterms: What\u2019s at stake 7. Meet the Clintons: Where will they campaign? Will they focus their efforts on early primary states, or will they leapfrog directly to the 2016 purple states? And when they\u2019re campaigning, will we hear them selling the Obama years or laying out their rationale for Hillary\u2019s expected 2016 run? 8. The other ones: Where, if anywhere, on the campaign trail will we see the 2016 Democrats-in-waiting like Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar? What are they selling? 9. Who\u2019ll rise from the masses? If the Republicans are looking outside the Beltway for their 2016 champion, who\u2019ll most effectively use 2014 to stand out from the rest? 2014 key races to watch 10. The economy, the economy, the economy: There are only five more jobs reports between now and Election Day; is there a silver lining or a sliver of hope for Democrats that Obama\u2019s economy will be their life raft rather than their anvil? N.C.: GOP establishment wins Recreational reefer in California? Mr. Castro comes to Washington 11. The first couple: As Obama seems relegated to collecting checks at Democrats\u2019 fundraisers, will the first lady hit the hustings? 12. Where\u2019s Joe?: Keep track of how many times Vice President Joe Biden pops up in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina and Florida in the next six months. Potential 2016 candidates 13. Chris Christie\u2019s Republican Governors Association: How successful will the New Jersey governor be at getting Republican governors elected? Will he have gathered enough chits and contacts within the GOP\u2019s donor class to revitalize his vision of sitting in the Oval Office? 14. Marijuana on their mind? Will there be a \u201chigher\u201d turnout in Alaska and Oregon, where voters will get the chance to legalize pot? Could those states keep the Senate blue? 15. Benghazi backlash: Is it a cold that could develop into a flu for Democrats? While they might brush aside Rep. Trey Gowdy\u2019s special committee as a joke, the GOP base will eat it up.

            "article_content": "After spending much of the last year dodging 2016 talk, Marco Rubio re-emerges Rubio follows up high-profile events with swing through Sunday talks shows Florida senator takes shots at President Obama, potential 2016 candidates It looks like Marco Rubio isn\u2019t laying low anymore. The senator from Florida and possible 2016 Republican presidential candidate followed up a Friday swing through the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire with some candid comments on Sunday talk shows about the next race for the White House. And following a White House report that declared the effects of climate change are upon us, Rubio said in numerous interviews that he doesn\u2019t believe that humans are causing global warming, and doesn\u2019t think any action can reverse that course. The moves by Rubio put him back in the 2016 spotlight, which he\u2019s avoided for much of the past year. Inside Politics: Rubio says he\u2019s ready to be president \u201cIt\u2019s a completely wide open GOP field.  None of our fruit is ripe: To move from long shot to frontrunner, every potential GOP candidate  has to grow, develop, or overcome a debility and Marco Rubio has as good a shot at doing that as anybody at this point,\u201d says Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist and CNN contributor who last year founded NewRepublican.org. Another GOP strategist said Rubio\u2019s political persona is still a work in progress. \u201cBuilding a presidential profile isn\u2019t a sprint, it\u2019s a marathon. Showing up in New Hampshire will no doubt stoke public speculation, but Rubio has spent his time in the Senate working hard on issues that matter to Florida, but they also matter to a majority of folks across the country,\u201d said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, a CNN contributor who was a senior adviser and spokesman for the 2008 and 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaigns. Poll numbers slip Early last year, Rubio\u2019s name was near or at the top of public opinion polls of Republicans for the party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination. But Rubio\u2019s numbers slipped after his high-profile support for a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate last June. The measure, which stalled in the House, included an eventual pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants, which is strongly opposed by many conservatives. Rubio\u2019s numbers in 2016 polls quickly faded, and have remained in the single digits in follow-up surveys. Rubio stood in ninth place, at 6%, in the most recent  CNN/ORC International Poll, which was conducted just over a week ago. While many of the other potential Republican White House hopefuls, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, have made numerous trips to all or some of the early primary and caucus states such as New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina, over the past 18 months, Rubio has not. (While he hasn\u2019t visited Iowa since 2012, Rubio isn\u2019t forgetting about the state votes first in the road to the White House. Rubio recently decided to focus the resources of his Reclaim America PAC on three big Senate races this year. One is the crucial Senate battle in Iowa, where Rubio\u2019s backing conservative Joni Ernst, whose stock is on the rise.) The visit to the Granite State was his first trip to any of those key states since the last presidential election, other than an appearance at an event for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad soon after the 2012 election, which Rubio indicated he agreed to attend months earlier as a favor to Branstad. Rubio sounded like a presidential candidate as the headliner for the Rockingham County Republican Committee\u2019s annual \u201cFreedom Founders\u201d dinner, held at the historic Wentworth-By-The-Sea hotel just outside of Portsmouth. He slammed Democrats and in particular former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who\u2019s seriously considering a White House run and is considered the favorite for the Democratic nomination should she launch a candidacy. \u201cTheir ideas never worked in the 20th century, much less the 21st, and they\u2019re threatening to nominate someone now who wants to take us to the past, to an era that is gone and is never coming back,\u201d Rubio told the audience. A good first impression A veteran Republican strategist in New Hampshire who attended the party dinner said Rubio connected with the crowd. \u201cMarco Rubio made a powerful first impression with New Hampshire Republicans on Friday, speaking passionately about his uniquely American story and with conviction about his optimistic vision for our country\u2019s future, bringing an enthusiastic overflow crowd to their feet at night\u2019s end in New Castle,\u201d said Jim Merrill, who was a top adviser to Mitt Romney in the Granite State in his presidential campaigns. \u201cWhile Senator Paul and (New Jersey) Governor (Chris) Christie, each impressive in their own right, are both perceived as having early advantages here, New Hampshire\u2019s upcoming \u201cFirst in the Nation\u201d primary is the most wide open that we\u2019ve ever seen, with no heir apparent,\u201d Merrill said. The dinner was just one stop during a busy day for Rubio in New Hampshire. Earlier, he headlined a fundraiser for the state GOP, held private meetings with some influential Republicans, and sat down for interviews with local media. \u201cI want people to look at the Republican Party as the party that shows them the way to a new American century versus a Democratic Party that shows us how this is the new normal and we just have to get used to it, that the cashier at Burger King will always be a cashier, and all he or she can hope for is an increase in the minimum wage,\u201d Rubio said in an interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader. Another New Hampshire-based Republican strategist said Rubio\u2019s \u201ctaking all the necessary steps that someone would take if they were considering a presidential run.\u201d Rubio quickly followed his New Hampshire swing with an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d where he said that he\u2019s ready to be commander in chief. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s true for multiple other people that would want to run.\u201d Dig at fellow senator? In the interview, Rubio appeared to take a shot at Rand Paul. Rubio said if someone wants to be president, they should fully commit to just that, adding that candidates shouldn\u2019t try to hold their congressional seats while pursuing the White House. Should he decide to launch a 2016 campaign, Rubio said he won\u2019t run simultaneously for re-election for his Senate seat. Poll: Bush, Paul at top of wide-open 2016 GOP race \u201cI believe that if you want to be president of the United States, you run for president,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t run for president with some eject button in the cockpit that allows you to go on an exit ramp if it doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d Rubio has noted that Florida law prohibits candidates from being on the ballot for two offices, a rule he described as \u201cthe right law.\u201d But in Kentucky, allies of Paul have pushed a bill that would allow a federal candidate to simultaneously seek more than one office. Climate change controversy In the same interview, Rubio set down a marker on climate change. \u201cI do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy,\u201d he added. In the week since the Obama administration released a   national climate change report that named Miami as the city most vulnerable to rising sea levels, Rubio has been critical of the White House push on global warming. \u201cI think it\u2019s an enormous stretch to say that every weather incident that we read about or the majority of them are attributable to human activity,\u201d he told CNN. Among other things, President Barack Obama has proposed new programs to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, which most scientists say are the major cause of global warming. \u201cThe President is, he\u2019s not a meteorologist. Here\u2019s what the President needs to be focused on. He\u2019s proposing a certain set of policies that he would have to admit if questioned will do nothing. If in fact these scientists are right and it\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions that are changing our climate, none of the things he\u2019s proposing would do anything to change that whatsoever, but it would have a devastating impact on our economy,\u201d Rubio told CNN. Rubio: No \u2018eject button\u2019 if he runs for president While the latest polling indicates most Americans say that human activity is causing the earth to heat up, there\u2019s a wide partisan gap, and such comments could benefit a candidate among conservatives, who dominate voting in the GOP presidential primaries and caucuses. Building a resume And Republican strategists say Rubio\u2019s resume building can only benefit him if he runs for higher office. \u201cMany voters believe President Obama\u2019s inexperience has hurt him. In their next president, they are going to be looking for maturity,\u201d Castellanos said. \u201cRubio has to prove that he\u2019s mature enough to be president and he\u2019s beginning to do that by rather fearlessly taking on some tough foreign policy and domestic issues, from Crimea to global warming.\u201d Rubio: Candidates should only run for one office at a time And Madden says that\u2019s just what Rubio\u2019s doing. Rather than spending much of the past year traveling across the country, Rubio\u2019s been on Capitol Hill, putting policy ahead of politics. \u201cYou can\u2019t just invent presidential buzz, at least not presidential buzz that lasts or translates into something real.  You have to be involved in shaping the debate and fighting on the big issues that matter.  Rubio has done that, so he\u2019s a part of the conversation,\u201d Madden added. But with the midterm election campaigns in full swing, giving potential GOP 2016ers plenty of opportunities to hit the trail in support of fellow Republicans, Rubio may soon be spending more time on the stump. Next month, he joins other possible GOP White House contenders at the annual Faith and Freedom Coalition \u201cRoad to Majority\u201d Conference in Washington.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Clay Aiken holds a slim lead in U.S. House race in North Carolina Thom Tillis says the \"primary mission\" is \"to beat Kay Hagan\" The North Carolina House speaker wins his GOP primary for U.S. Senate Tillis bested several tea party candidates and won establishment endorsements In the intraparty battle for the GOP, score Round 1 for the Republican establishment over the tea party. CNN projects that North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis has won the state\u2019s GOP Senate primary. Tillis, who was backed by many mainstream Republicans, topped 40% of the primary vote Tuesday, avoiding a runoff in July. Tillis beat a bunch of more conservative candidates for the chance to face off this November against first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, who is considered very vulnerable in the general election. Flipping her seat and five others held by Democrats would give Republicans control of the Senate. In his victory speech, Tillis slammed Hagan\u2019s record, tying her to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and calling them \u201can echo chamber for President Obama\u2019s worst ideas.\u201d Inside Politics: GOP attacks tea party McConnell: 'Crush' the tea party Inside Politics: GOP civil war? \u201cWe need to be clear, it\u2019s not the end of a primary, it\u2019s really the beginning of a primary mission, which has been the mission all along and that is to beat Kay Hagan and to make Harry Reid irrelevant,\u201d he said. Rand Paul stumbles and four other takeaways from election night \u201cYou know, their failures, both Obama\u2019s and Kay Hagan\u2019s, are obvious,\u201d Tillis added. \u201cWe know a lot of them \u2013 our government is borrowing too much money and it\u2019s dangerously in debt to China. Obamacare is not working. And Obama and Hagan\u2019s left-wing political agenda is driving up our energy prices and making our country less safe. \u201cFor six years, she\u2019s voted with Obama and against North Carolina,\u201d he said. Trailing Tillis is tea party activist Greg Brannon. He enjoyed the support of many tea party groups, other influential conservative organizations and endorsements from the likes of Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who joined Brannon on Monday at a rally in Charlotte. Mark Harris, a prominent Baptist minister who helped drive the 2012 passage of a constitutional amendment that strengthened the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban, is on his way to a third-place finish. Harris was backed by a high-profile fellow pastor, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a 2008 Republican presidential candidate who may run again in 2016. Since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009, primary challenges from the right have produced major headlines and headaches for the GOP and hurt the party\u2019s chances of winning back the Senate from Democrats in the past two election cycles. Candidates backed by the tea party movement and other grass-roots conservatives effectively cost the GOP five winnable Senate elections the past two cycles in Nevada, Delaware, Colorado, Indiana and Missouri. The establishment strikes back This election cycle, mainstream Republicans don\u2019t want another sequel. In North Carolina, Tillis won recent endorsements from two high-profile Republicans: 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a potential 2016 White House hopeful. More importantly, while none of the candidates in the GOP primary, including Tillis, raised or spent a lot of money in the campaign, the state House speaker won the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Crossroads, two outside groups that combined have spent millions this cycle to run ads in support of Tillis and other establishment picks that they feel are \u201celectable\u201d come November. Last week, in what was described as a major buy, the pro-business Chamber launched a television commercial that described Tillis as \u201ca bold conservative who balanced our budget and reduced regulations. A businessman who delivered tax relief.\u201d And Crossroads, the big-spending outside group co-founded and steered by Karl Rove, says it has spent nearly $2 million in support of Tillis. That spending dwarfed the money shelled out by outside conservative groups that backed Brannon. \u201cIt was clear from the start that Thom Tillis is the only proven conservative who can defeat Kay Hagan and take on President Obama\u2019s liberal agenda, and tonight\u2019s victory is the first step toward making that happen,\u201d said American Crossroads President and CEO Steven Law. Paul was quick to back Tillis. \u201cNow that the primary is over, it is time for our side to unite to defeat the Democrat who cast the deciding vote for Obamacare, Kay Hagan, in November. I endorse Thom Tillis and look forward to working with him in the Senate,\u201d Paul wrote on Facebook. And a top tea party leader who had backed Brannon sounded conciliatory. \u201cWhile we obviously aren\u2019t happy with the outcome, we congratulate Speaker Tillis for his win,\u201d said Tea Party Patriots\u2019 Jenny Beth Martin. \u201cThe important thing now is to pick up a U.S. Senate seat that\u2019s been in liberal hands for the last six years.\u201d National Democrats argue that the competitive primary pushed Tillis too far to the right for the more mainstream electorate in November. \u201cThom Tillis spent this primary moving far to the right, embracing positions that, paired with his record, make him a deeply flawed candidate,\u201d said Mike Czin, Democratic National Committee press secretary. Clay Aiken has slim edge in North Carolina primary More rounds to come The voting Tuesday in North Carolina, as well as Indiana and Ohio, kicks off five straight weeks of primary contests that should give a clearer indication of whether establishment Republicans have gained the upper hand against the tea party movement for control of the party. Two more showdowns between establishment and grass-roots conservatives come on May 20, as the action moves to Georgia and Kentucky, where Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell faces a long-shot challenge from businessman Matt Bevin, who is backed by many tea party groups and by some influential conservative organizations. In Georgia, there\u2019s a wide-open, free-for-all fight to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss. The candidates considered to be more moderate are polling ahead of the more conservative candidates. Two weeks later, on June 3, the establishment-vs.-tea party faceoff shifts to Mississippi, which is one of eight states holding primaries that day. Six-term Sen. Thad Cochran is facing a serious challenge from state lawmaker Chris McDaniel, but private polling indicates the incumbent has a comfortable lead. Victories by the more moderate mainstream candidates improve the GOP\u2019s odds of recapturing the Senate this November. Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the chamber but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up in November. Half of those Democratic seats are in red or purple states, such as North Carolina. Tea party leaders say they\u2019ve \u2018changed the narrative\u2019 Leaders of the grass-roots movement disagree that their defeat in the North Carolina Senate primary suggests that the tide has turned against them. \u201cI think the establishment is taking its victory lap a little early,\u201d said Kevin Broughton, spokesman for the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund. And regardless of the outcome of the primary contests, Amy Kremer says the tea party is already victorious. \u201cThe tea party has already won because we have changed the narrative and the political landscape in Washington. Now, both sides of the aisle express concern about our ballooning national debt,\u201d said Kremer, who just stepped down as chairwoman of the Tea Party Express and is now helping Bevin in his bid to unseat McConnell in Kentucky. \u2018American Idol\u2019 star holds slim lead While the Senate contest in North Carolina landed in the national spotlight, some House primaries also grabbed attention. Two-term GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers faced a primary challenge from a conservative talk radio host because of her being open to considering some limited immigration reform. But she cruised to victory in the GOP primary in the state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Her re-election bid may grab even more national attention if former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d star Clay Aiken wins the Democratic nomination in the district. The race between Aiken and two other Democratic candidates is still too close to call. With all precincts reporting, Aiken has 40.83% of the vote, with Keith Crisco just behind at 39.4%. If the margin holds up, Aiken would exceed the 40% threshold needed to avoid a runoff. And while only 369 votes separated them, Aiken\u2019s tiny advantage is still outside the 1% margin to stave off a recount. Aiken told supporters Tuesday night that he was \u201cconfident\u201d his campaign would be victorious. \u201cI said earlier tonight, I sort of preferred when they just open the envelope,\u201d he said, a reference to his days on the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d stage. In the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, CNN projects that 10-term Republican Rep. Walter Jones, an anti-war libertarian, has won a hard-fought primary against establishment pick Taylor Griffin, a former George W. Bush administration official who also had a senior role in Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election campaign. Ohio showdowns In Ohio, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. FitzGerald, a former FBI agent, mayor and assistant county prosecutor, easily topped Larry Ealy, a former tow-truck driver from the Dayton area. FitzGerald will now face off in November against Republican Gov. John Kasich, who\u2019s running for re-election. The contest could turn into a marquee gubernatorial battle. House Speaker John Boehner easily won his primary. The 12-term Republican lawmaker, who represents Ohio\u2019s 8th Congressional District, a GOP stronghold in the southwest part of the Buckeye State, topped two tea party-backed challengers.

            "article_content": "GOP establishment passes early test in family feud with tea party Democrats quick to label Senate candidate an \"extremist\" Rand Paul moves quickly to save face after curious endorsement Fight over immigration turns out to be fizzle rather than fury Republicans avoided a major headache on Tuesday night when Thom Tillis, the North Carolina house speaker and establishment favorite, won the Republican Senate nomination outright, dodging a protracted summer runoff fight against a grassroots-backed opponent. With an assist from big-spending outside groups, Tillis dispatched his two main primary rivals, tea party-backed Greg Brannon and the Baptist pastor Mark Harris, with relative ease, clearing the 40% mark needed to skirt a July runoff election. Tillis moves on to face Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, one of the Senate\u2019s most endangered incumbents, in what\u2019s certain to be among the most negative \u2013 and expensive \u2013 races of 2014. 2014 midterms: Six factors between now and election day But that wasn\u2019t the only story line unfolding on Tuesday. Here are five takeaways from primary night in North Carolina. 2016: Jeb up, Hillary down Primary day in North Carolina Are Democrats in for a 'schellacking'? 1. Republican establishment passes early test: The GOP establishment \u2014 that galaxy of Washington-based political operatives, national party committees and business groups who care first and foremost about winning \u2014 promised early on that they wouldn\u2019t let controversial candidates jeopardize their chances of re-taking the Senate this year. North Carolina was the first test in their mission to make sure that no Todd Akins, Christine O\u2019Donnells or Richard Mourdocks would be on the Senate ballot in 2014. The Chamber of Commerce and the Karl Rove-backed American Crossroads spent north of $2 million propping up state House Speaker Thom Tillis when the candidate himself lacked the resources to go on statewide television. A few weeks ago, most Republicans in North Carolina were predicting that Tillis would not be able to break 40% of the vote, thereby forcing a July runoff election. But with the help of outside spending, a largely error-free campaign and the inability of his underfunded grassroots challengers to land a punch, Tillis surged late and cleared the runoff hurdle easily. Republicans are breathing easier, confident they have the candidate with the best shot to beat Democrat Hagan. Key races to watch in 2014 2. Democrats open up the extremist playbook: The Democratic National Committee fired off a memo to reporters right after Tillis secured the GOP nomination. \u201cThom Tillis: Extreme, Scandal Plagued Conservative: Bring It On,\u201d it was titled. No surprise there: For the better part of a year, Hagan\u2019s campaign has been planning to paint Tillis as a right-wing ideologue who, as state house speaker, curtailed voting rights, slashed education budgets and fought to limit women\u2019s access to contraception and abortion. They were just hoping he\u2019d have to slog through a nasty Republican-on-Republican runoff first. Now the general election begins. Democrats will work overtime to render Tillis unacceptable to suburban women and middle class voters by hitting him on issues like women\u2019s health and wages. Tillis plans to tie Hagan to President Obama and his health care law at every turn. If that sounds like the dynamic of pretty much every other federal race in the country so far this year, well, that\u2019s because it is. 3. Rand Paul stumbles: Rand Paul gambled \u2014 and lost. After spending much of the last two years making nice with the GOP establishment as he lays groundwork for a 2016 presidential bid, Paul confounded Republicans by making a last minute trip to Charlotte to campaign for Brannon, a controversial tea party candidate who turned out to be Tillis\u2019 most serious primary opponent. Paul called Brannon a \u201chero\u201d and a \u201cdragon slayer\u201d at a rally outside the NASCAR Hall of Fame on Monday, saying he would shake up the status quo in Washington. Brannon supporters hoped it would bring a last minute burst of energy to their upstart campaign. But for Paul-watchers, the appearance was a head-scratcher. A bloody Tillis-Brannon runoff was precisely the scenario that Washington Republicans who might help Paul in 2016 \u2014 including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, his fellow Kentuckian \u2014 were hoping to avoid. And while Paul had already endorsed Brannon, he was further grafting himself onto a flawed candidate who was recently found liable by a jury for misleading investors in a failed tech firm. The Kentucky senator said his endorsement was about principle. But Paul has also developed a reputation as a canny political operator who is taking a methodical approach to the presidential race. He didn\u2019t look very savvy in North Carolina, where he put his political muscle to the test but couldn\u2019t pull his favored candidate over the finish line. Paul was quick to save face. He endorsed Tillis on Facebook soon after the race was called, and urged Republicans to unite behind him. 4. Immigration fight fizzles: Rep. Renee Ellmers is a rare specimen: A House Republican who backs immigration reform, including a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants. She calls it \u201can earned legal work status.\u201d Conservatives, of course, call it \u201camnesty.\u201d Ellmers, a nurse from North Carolina\u2019s 2nd District who was elected in 2010 with tea party support, has been unapologetic, tangling with her constituents over the issue in town hall meetings and calling conservative radio talker Laura Ingraham \u201cignorant\u201d during a recent on-air debate about immigration. Her immigration reform cheerleading drew the attention of a pro-immigration reform group backed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, which ran television ads on her behalf. But she also drew a conservative primary challenger: a radio talk show host and GOP perma-candidate named Frank Roche. Roche hit Ellmers hard, framing his entire candidacy as a referendum on Ellmers\u2019 support for immigration reform and her willingness to work with the GOP establishment. Roche\u2019s poorly funded campaign gave Ellmers a scare, but in the end she skated to a primary win. 5. Anti-war Republican survives: Rep. Walter Jones, a 20-year incumbent from the state\u2019s coastal 3rd District, faced perhaps the toughest challenge of his long career from Taylor Griffin, a Republican strategist and former George W. Bush administration official from Washington who returned to New Bern to run for the seat. Griffin\u2019s critique of Jones centered on the congressman\u2019s libertarian drift. Jones famously broke with his party over foreign policy during the Iraq War, calling it a mistake and predicting that former Vice President Dick Cheney will someday rot in hell. Jones became an ardent supporter of Ron Paul, voted to regulate Wall Street, and has been a regular thorn in the side of House Republican leaders like John Boehner, who kicked him off the House Financial Services committee in 2012. Griffin labeled Jones the \u201cmost liberal\u201d Republican in Congress, a questionable line of attack considering Jones\u2019 fierce social conservatism. But Griffin worked hard and had the support of hawkish outside groups who ran blistering television and radio ads against Jones, and he picked up a a late endorsement from Sarah Palin. But it was probably too late. Jones, with his deep ties to the district, survived. Republicans in North Carolina, however, believe Griffin scuffed Jones up enough to make him vulnerable in 2016. That\u2019s if he doesn\u2019t retire first. GOP establishment 1, tea party 0 after NC Senate primary Clay Aiken has slim edge in NC primary",

            "article_content": "Establishment Republicans are fighting back more strongly against challenges from the right With a number of vulnerable Democrats in the Senate, GOP thinks it can win control North Carolina primary seen as a key test of establishment-vs.-tea party scenario Voters in North Carolina, Indiana and Ohio on Tuesday kick off five straight weeks of primary contests that could give us a clearer indication of whether establishment Republicans have the upper hand against the tea party movement for control of the party. The results could back up recent tough talk from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who predicted big wins for incumbents facing primary challenges from the right, saying, \u201cI think we are going to crush them everywhere.\u201d And they may have a major impact in determining whether Republicans retake the majority in the Senate. Since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009, primary challenges from the right have produced major headlines and headaches for the GOP and hurt the party\u2019s chances of winning back the Senate from Democrats in the past two election cycles. Candidates backed by the tea party movement and other grass-roots conservatives effectively cost the GOP five winnable Senate elections the last two cycles in Nevada, Delaware, Colorado, Indiana and Missouri. Complete coverage: 2014 midterm elections Poll: Skeptical of Obama, Economy Rand's gamble 2014: The Obama drag Two months ago, McConnell, whom the right sees as part of the problem in Washington, told The New York Times that when it came to tea party challenges, \u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country.\u201d His prediction might come true. Establishment leaders say they have learned their lessons from the past two elections and are better at counterattacking this time around. So why do incumbents and establishment-backed candidates appear to have the upper hand this time around? \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say that the tea party movement is dead, but there seems to be less enthusiasm among their activists and supporters this year,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, a top campaign handicapper. \u201cEstablishment Republicans and incumbents have learned to run against tea party-backed candidates.\u201d And outside help this time may be making a difference. \u201cI think the Republican establishment is fighting back more than in previous cycles. There is more organization and involvement from outside groups in some of these primaries. I think in the past, it was too often an incumbent running against an anti-establishment challenger and a host of outside groups,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. 2014 midterms: Key races to watch Tea party \u2018changed the narrative\u2019 But leaders of the 5-year-old grass-roots movement disagree with the suggestion that the tide has turned against them. The 'Inside Politics' Forecast: May 4 2016: Jeb up, Hillary down Are Democrats in for a 'schellacking'? \u201cI think the establishment is taking its victory lap a little early,\u201d said Kevin Broughton, spokesman for the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, who added that \u201cThere are more wins to come.\u201d And regardless of the outcome of the primary contests, Amy Kremer says the tea party is already victorious \u201cRegardless of the outcome in the primary races, the tea party has already won because we have changed the narrative and the political landscape in Washington.  Now, both sides of the aisle express concern about our ballooning national debt,\u201d said Kremer, who just stepped down as chairwoman of the Tea Party Express and is now helping Matt Bevin in his bid to unseat McConnell in Kentucky. Primary calendar: Who votes when Vulnerable Democrats put control of the Senate in play In North Carolina, first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is vulnerable. Flipping her seat and five others held by Democrats would give Republicans control of the Senate. GOP establishment nervously watches North Carolina The Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up in November, with half of those Democratic seats in red or purple states, such as North Carolina, which will be the first indicator whether things will be different this time. The establishment is rallying around state House Speaker Thom Tillis, the front-runner in a multi-candidate field for the Republican Senate nomination. Tillis was endorsed Monday by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and late last week by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who\u2019s seriously considering a bid for president in 2016. The most recent polling indicates Tillis hovering right around the 40% mark, which he needs to crack in order to avoid a July runoff. The two most serious challengers are Greg Brannon, a tea party activist and first-time candidate who enjoys the support of some major tea party groups, as well as other influential conservative organizations and endorsements from the likes of Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who joined Brannon on Monday at an rally in Charlotte on the eve of the primary. The other major candidate is Mark Harris, a prominent Baptist minister who helped drive the 2012 passage of a constitutional amendment that strengthened the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban. Harris enjoys the support of a high-profile fellow pastor: former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a 2008 Republican presidential candidate who may run again for the White House in 2016. While none of the candidates, including Tillis, have raised or spent a lot of money in the campaign, the state House speaker enjoys the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Crossroads, two outside groups that combined have spent millions this cycle to run ads backing Tillis and other establishment picks. Last week, in what was described as a major buy, the pro-business Chamber launched a television commercial that described Tillis as \u201ca bold conservative who balanced our budget and reduced regulations. A businessman who delivered tax relief.\u201d And Crossroads, the big-spending outside group co-founded and steered by Karl Rove, says it\u2019s spent nearly $2 million in support of Tillis. That spending dwarfs the money shelled out by outside conservative groups backing Brannon. And in a sign that Tillis is seen as the most feared of the GOP candidates, the pro-Democrat Senate Majority PAC put out a spot critical of two of his aides. Overall, 90% of all the ad spending in the Senate race in North Carolina has so far come from outside groups rather than the actual campaigns. \u2018Idol\u2019 star seeks congressional seat While the Senate battle is the marquee race in North Carolina on Tuesday, some House primaries are also grabbing attention. Two-term GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers is facing a primary challenge from a conservative talk radio host because of her being open to consider some limited immigration reform. And in North Carolina\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d star Clay Aiken is in a heated primary for the Democratic nomination. Aiken\u2019s star power put to test in N.C. primary In the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, 10-term Republican Rep. Walter Jones, an anti-war libertarian, is once again fighting for his political life, this time against establishment pick Taylor Griffin, a former George W. Bush administration official who also had a senior role in Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election campaign. Can Mr. Jones stay in Washington? More showdowns over coming weeks Next Tuesday, the tea party could score what could end up its only win in Senate primary showdowns this year. Conservative Ben Sasse of Nebraska, president of Midland University, has been showered with support and endorsements recently from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, and Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, as well as the backing of FreedomWorks, the Senate Conservatives Fund and Club for Growth. Some polling suggests that Sasse is now all tied up with Shane Osborn, the former state treasurer who\u2019s considered the establishment favorite. But on the same day, seven-term Rep. Shelley Moore Capito is expected to easily win the GOP Senate nomination in West Virginia, where the party hopes to snatch the seat long held by retiring Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller. Capito\u2019s considered a moderate, and while some conservative groups criticized her early in her bid, she\u2019s faced no serious opposition from the right for the nomination. A week later, on May 20, the action moves to Kentucky, where McConnell faces a challenge, and Georgia, where there\u2019s a wide-open, free-for-all fight to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Republican Reps. Phil Gingrey, Paul Broun and Jack Kingston, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, and businessman David Perdue are the major candidates in the race. Kingston and Perdue, rather than the more conservative Broun and Gingrey, are considered the frontrunners in the contentious Republican primary. The winner will face off against Michelle Nunn, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee and daughter of the longtime Georgia U.S. senator. McConnell faces challenge of his own McConnell faces a challenge from tea party-backed Bevin. While this race has seen big spending \u2013 both by the campaigns and from outside groups \u2013 the five-term McConnell is expected to cruise to renomination. But he faces a serious challenge in November from rising Democratic star Alison Lundergan Grimes, whom big-name Democrats are already campaigning for. On the same day in Oregon, Portland pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Monica Wehby is considered the frontrunner over more conservative state Rep. Jason Conger in the race for the GOP Senate nomination. The winner of that contest will face off in November against first-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who Republicans think might be vulnerable if 2014 turns into a wave year for the GOP. And in Idaho, there\u2019s a high-profile incumbent-vs.-tea party challenge primary in the House, where eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson faces a serious primary challenge from conservative favorite Bryan Smith. A week later, on June 3, the establishment-vs.-tea party contest shifts to Mississippi, which is among eight states holding primaries that day. Six-term Sen. Thad Cochran is facing a serious challenge from state lawmaker Chris McDaniel in Mississippi. Private polling shows Cochran with a comfortable lead, but outside establishment groups are taking nothing for granted.",

Howard Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and his organization, Democracy for America, endorsed Van de Putte for lieutenant governor of Texas in an e-mail to the group\u2019s 1 million members, including more than 38,000 in Texas. \u201cThis year we have the best opportunity in a generation to turn Texas blue,\u201d Dean said, referring to Van de Putte and Wendy Davis, the Texas gubernatorial candidate and liberal star. \u201cIn Wendy Davis and Leticia Van de Putte, we have the right team to seize that opportunity and defeat the extreme right.\u201d The organization endorsed Davis immediately after she announced her candidacy in October. But the group waited six months before giving Van de Putte the nod.  The organization wanted to ensure that Van de Putte\u2019s campaign, with its much lower profile, was capable of winning in the reliably red state. \u201cWe decided to back Leticia Van de Putte after running our endorsement process and seeing \u2026 how excited our members in Texas are about a Davis-Van de Putte one-two punch and watching her put together the kind of grassroots campaign that we\u2019re confident can win in the Lone Star State,\u201d Neil Sroka with Democracy for America wrote in an e-mail. Van de Putte welcomed the endorsement, thanking Democracy for America for its \u201cgrass-roots support.\u201d Democrats are cautiously optimistic about their chances in Texas this year, noting that they have two top-notch candidates who could pull off an upset. While Davis has excited progressives around the country with her 13-hour filibuster last June over abortion access, Van de Putte has her own lengthy legislative record, and Democrats insist she, as a Latino, is the ideal candidate to motivate women and Latinos to vote. Meet the woman who could turn Texas purple Persuading Texas Democrats to vote is its own challenge. The Lone Star State, where more than one-third of the population is Hispanic, is plagued with low voter turnout. Nearly two-thirds of eligible Latino voters stayed home in 2012. And the numbers get worse in nonpresidential election years. Van de Putte\u2019s challenger is still undetermined. Current Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and state Sen. Dan Patrick are locked in a runoff contest for the Republican nomination. Both candidates are running to the right, making immigration a central component of their campaigns, which Democrats say could also help drive Latinos to the polls. Van de Putte must raise significant amounts of money to be competitive in the vast, populous state. The latest fund-raising figures available are old \u2013 from January \u2013 but total a mere $290,000. Democracy For America raised more than $50,000 for Davis in the first 24 hours after its endorsement. That\u2019s an extremely high bar to match for a Van de Putte endorsement, but obviously one her campaign hopes is reached.",

And they still have to brace themselves for a long to-do list that remains frozen in election-year politics. 2014 midterms: What\u2019s at stake Key races to watch Think of the rest of 2014 as the \u201ccould do\u201d but probably \u201cwon\u2019t do\u201d Congress. The Calendar Most American look at the calendar and see eight months left in the year. Members of Congress see the three months left until August, when they leave on a month-long recess and most transition to full-time campaigning. Leaders could plan significant votes in September and will likely hold a \u201clame-duck\u201d session after the election, but outside of emergency action, expectations for significant legislation after August are low.

First up: replenishing the multibillion-dollar Highway Trust Fund, which is within months of running out of money and then causing work stoppages on federal road projects. \u201cThat\u2019s something that has to happen,\u201d said Joel Friedman, vice president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The D.C. think tank leans left, but shares the view of most on the highway fund: at the least Congress must pass temporary spending to keep transportation projects alive until a longer-term deal. \u201cIt could be one of those things that they just punt, just do something to get us into the next year and leave it to the next Congress.\u201d Also must pass: keeping government running.  Yes, again.  The current federal spending bill runs out at the end of September. But there is no appetite for another shutdown. And October is prime-time campaign season. As a result, many expect some kind of temporary funding bill, or continuing resolution, which could be passed as soon as the end of July.

Some of these are critical to business decisions, including the research and experimentation credit. As long as Congress delays action on the so-called \u201ctax extenders,\u201d millions of businesses have no guidance on whether certain spending will be deductible or not. \u201cHow can a small company that needs (the tax credit) and wants it, how can they make plans when they don\u2019t when or whether it\u2019s going to be (put into law)?\u201d asked the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Steve Bell. The Republican worked for more than two decades in the Senate, including years as the staff director for the Senate Budget Committee. Others in the need-to-pass and possibly-could-pass category: the annual defense authorization bill and renewing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which backs up the insurance market for terrorism-related losses. Do Be Do Be Not Done Otherwise, a universe of major issues will go unresolved this year. A sort of doo-wap chorus of problems put on political repeat in recent years. Immigration. Mental health. Major jobs legislation. Long-term unemployment. Medicare insolvency. Future, exploding debt. Boehner mocks House GOP colleagues on immigration Maybe immigration reform isn\u2019t dead after all \u201cIt\u2019s not unsurprising that nothing major is happening in an election year,\u201d said Friedman.  \u201cThat said, obviously with the split houses,\u201d he laughed, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been a huge success rate coming up to ths point.\u201d Who will win the battle for the Senate? Fired up and ready to go in 2014? Congressional approval hovers at 13% May do: smaller things The big, tough issues seem out of play, despite leaders of both parties often publicly recognizing the problems. But some smaller things could happen. Senate Democratic leaders are considering bringing a few bipartisan bills to the floor in coming weeks.  One tackles energy efficiency. Another manufacturing. Both of those sync up with general efforts also underway by the House. Otherwise, expect Congress to fill its days with votes that are mostly statements, likely to pass one chamber and then be killed by the opposing party in the other. Examples? Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat of Nevada,  has set a Wednesday vote on raising the minimum wage. Minimum wage: Congress stalls, states act In the next two weeks, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican of Virginia, has told his members that they will vote on charter school reform. And House Republicans continue to swing punches at Obamacare, vowing to propose their own health reform proposal later this year. Will GOP\u2019s Obamacare focus pay off? Why are some Dems running from Obamacare? Obama: Republicans \u2018were wrong\u2019 about Obamacare It is still chilly in Washington. But the weather, it seems, is likely to change more quickly than the politics. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the Congress to get to work,\u201d said the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Steve Bell. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll just plant my tomatoes and watch them grow.\u201d Biden goes on offense over GOP economic agenda Can Mr. Jones stay in Washington?

            "article_content": "Democrat Van de Putte is running for lieutenant governor in solidly GOP Texas She played a powerful role during Wendy Davis' abortion rights filibuster She's the ideal demographic for Texas voters: a Hispanic woman Her fundraising totals so far have been weak When Leticia Van de Putte walked into the storied Willard Hotel one block from the White House last month, she didn\u2019t invoke the stares of gaping tourists or eager handshakes from power-seeking staffers. Instead, she rolled her own suitcase wearing Texas Longhorn cowboy boots \u2013 an accessory she was happy she brought from Texas on that snowy March day in the nation\u2019s capital. Van de Putte gave no hints that she was running for lieutenant governor, the second-highest office in Texas \u2013 and some would argue the most powerful. She was deferential to hotel staff and eagerly arranged oversized chairs to set up for the interview \u2013 rare in a town where elected officials have staff at their beck and call, even to dial numbers on their mobile phones. Her profile is on the rise The San Antonio state senator could accomplish what no Democrat has done in 20 years: win statewide office. The pharmacist has been a power broker during her nearly 25 years in the state legislature. In 2003, she led the dramatic 45-day walkout that Senate Democrats staged over the Republican redistricting plan. The lawmakers bolted to New Mexico, delaying a vote on the plan, although Republicans were eventually able to pass it. Meet woman who could turn Texas purple Obama: Pay inequality's an embarrassment Inside Politics: Koch addled Van de Putte doesn\u2019t elicit the same star power or national intrigue as Wendy Davis, her state Senate colleague at the top of the ticket. Davis grabbed national headlines last June when she staged an 11-hour filibuster in the Texas Senate that blocked restrictive abortion legislation from being passed. Democrats seize on equal pay as a midterm issue The turning tide That day was a big moment for Davis, propelling her into the national spotlight and into the gubernatorial race. It also re-established some relevance for Texas Democrats in a state dominated by Republicans. For Van de Putte it was a defining day. As Davis\u2019 filibuster charged on into the night, Van de Putte missed most of it because she was at the funeral of her father, who had been killed in a car accident. After a mournful day, she decided to join her colleagues at the State House. \u201cI remember her walking onto the Senate floor. I could see it in her face. She was just drained,\u201d said Grace Garcia, a friend and political ally who was in the spectator gallery. \u201cShe did it because she wanted to support the women in Texas.\u201d The emotionally exhausted Van de Putte attempted to speak on the Senate floor but the Republican majority had turned off her microphone. Finally she raised her voice to be heard, asking, \u201cDid the President hear me or did the President hear me and refuse to recognize me?\u201d \u201cAt what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over her male colleagues?\u201d she continued. The gallery, filled with women\u2019s rights advocates, erupted in prolonged cheers and applause, igniting a new wave of energy into the fierce debate over abortion restrictions. \u201cSomething was unleashed at that moment. It just exploded. People started clapping and it didn\u2019t stop,\u201d Garcia said. Van de Putte was energized from the cheers of support that June night. But her political profile received an even greater boost as political operatives in the state increasingly looked to her for higher office. Tragic loss But the lieutenant governor\u2019s job was not at the forefront of her mind. Her father\u2019s sudden death was the latest in a series of family tragedies. Just a month earlier her 5-month old grandson died in his sleep. And her mother-in-law also died the same year. \u201cWhen you lose so much, you realize what your priorities are,\u201d she said. So when Garcia, her longtime friend who also runs Annie\u2019s List, an organization that works to elect women to office in Texas, met Van de Putte to ask her to run for lieutenant governor, Van de Putte refused to commit. During their two-hour lunch at El Mirador restaurant in downtown San Antonio last August, Van de Putte told Garcia she was worried about her family. \u201cMy family had a really, really tough, tough year,\u201d Van de Putte told CNN as tears welled up in her eyes. \u201cI was honestly trying to keep my family together \u2026 to heal.\u201d Van de Putte, a mother of six and grandmother of six, said she didn\u2019t know if her family \u201cwas strong enough\u201d to withstand personal political attacks on her during such a fragile time. Decision time But three months after her lunch with Garcia, Van de Putte announced that she was going to jump into the race against a cadre of Republican candidates who Van de Putte adamantly disagreed with. During the campaign, her Republican opponents have touted the expansion of school vouchers, teaching creationism in schools and demonizing illegal immigrants. Complete 2014 midterm coverage \u201cThe topics they are talking about are certainly not what Texas voters are talking about,\u201d Van de Putte said. Her Republican opponent could be one of two people who are currently engaged in a runoff for the Republican nomination. One is current Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. The other is state Sen. Dan Patrick. While Dewhurst has the support of establishment Republicans, as he did in his unsuccessful primary against now-Sen. Ted Cruz in 2010, he is shifting his policies further to the right, trying to overtake Patrick, the front-runner. Patrick is running to the far right, making immigration and his self-described \u201cillegal invasion\u201d a central tenet of his campaign. \u201cAs a Latino, we\u2019re over it,\u201d Ramiro Cavazos, president and CEO of the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, said of the Republican candidates\u2019 platforms. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very backward approach.\u201d Van de Putte called Patrick\u2019s campaign \u201centertaining\u201d and decried the use of immigration as a wedge issue to divide the Republican base and suppress Democratic, especially Latino, turnout. She promises to run a business-friendly campaign focused on education, water and transportation. No-vote Texas But Latino turnout in Texas is already suppressed. A term heard over and over again when talking about Texas politics is that the state is not a Republican one or a Democratic one but a nonvoting one. The problem for Democrats is would-be Democratic voters stay home on Election Day at a far higher rate than Republicans. Many of the people who don\u2019t vote are Latino, a key demographic for the Democratic Party. In the last election, President Barack Obama received 70% of the Latino vote nationally. But in Texas, where more than one-third of people are Hispanic, 61% of those eligible did not vote. Contrast that with the statistic that shows that 61% of eligible whites did, according to the group Latino Decisions. \u201cThe reason Texas doesn\u2019t elect Democrats is because the biggest portion of the base of the Democratic Party doesn\u2019t vote,\u201d Gilberto Hinojosa, chair of the Texas Democratic Party, said. Increasing voter turnout, however, is facing a major uphill battle as new voter ID laws have made it more difficult to vote. Van de Putte said she had to vote with an affidavit because her name didn\u2019t match the voter database. The sleeping, Latina giant But Texas Democrats believe Van de Putte is the answer. \u201cLeticia\u2019s candidacy can help energize the part of the base that has not been participating in elections,\u201d Hinojosa said. That\u2019s because Van de Putte is the perfect demographic: a Hispanic woman. She entered Texas politics when few women and even fewer Latinos were elected to office. She has deep roots in the state. She is a sixth-generation Texan, or Tejano, whose grandmothers are from Mexico. \u201cHer family is a part of the cultural landscape of San Antonio,\u201d Democratic National Committee finance chair Henry Munoz said. Her mother was a leader of a culturally important and community-centered mariachi groups in the country, he said. \u201cThis is an important moment in the history of Texas,\u201d Munoz added. \u201cThe demographics of the state are changing. We need leaders who look like us and understand who we are.\u201d Supporters believe that Van de Putte will also appeal to women in Texas \u2013 Latino and others. Republicans hit a nerve when it comes to Obamacare Garcia, with Annie\u2019s List, said that the Democratic ticket featuring two women at the top \u2013 Davis and Van de Putte - is a stark contrast to the all-male Republican ticket for  the other statewide races this election year. Garcia said women in the Democratic Party are re-energized since Davis\u2019 filibuster, momentum that could carry into Election Day in November, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great opportunity for both Leticia and Wendy to have a very important conversation with women in Texas,\u201d Garcia said. Challenges mount But Van de Putte has challenges to overcome. While she is immensely popular in San Antonio as its state senator and a pharmacist in the city\u2019s culturally rich Hispanic and Tejano west side, she is largely unknown outside of the city. She has a lot of work to do to raise her profile and introduce herself to voters in the vast expanse of the second largest state in the country that consists of more than 254 counties and 20 media markets. Van de Putte is her married name \u2013 a Belgium surname that doesn\u2019t completely describe her background. Although she said she has no regrets in taking her husband\u2019s Belgian last name more than 30 years ago, a name is the first way to impression voters, especially the low propensity or \u201cvirgin\u201d voter. She insists that Latinos will know that she is Latina. \u201cVan de Putte is not a Latino name, but Leticia is,\u201d she said. If that fails, she invokes her maiden name: \u201cI\u2019m Leticia San Miguel Van de Putte,\u201d she said. Why is this  man running for governor of California? But Van de Putte is acutely aware of the uphill battle she faces. \u201cFirst thing we need to do is raise the resources so I can get that message out,\u201d Van de Putte said. Introducing Leticia Van de Putte to Texas voters is an expensive venture. And while Wendy Davis, the woman at the top of the Texas ticket, has done a good job raising funds, raising more than $12 million as of the last fundraising report in January, Van de Putte\u2019s fundraising has been less impressive, raising about $290,000 the first two months of her campaign. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to be able to raise \u2013 not what the Republicans can raise \u2013 but will be able to raise enough to compete,\u201d Hinojosa said. Van de Putte just completed  a multiweek bus tour across Texas that included multiple fundraisers per week. And in Washington to participate in a women\u2019s empowerment event hosted by Politico, she used the trip to raise national dollars. She met the staff of numerous political action committees, including the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s PAC. But Cal Jillison, political science professor at Southern Methodist University, injected a dose of reality into the equation. \u201cI suspect that the Democratic ticket will rise or fall \u2013 most likely fall \u2013 with Davis,\u201d he said. \u201cVan de Putte could help Davis with Hispanics, but is unlikely to win if Davis loses.\u201d Optimism mounts, too Her supporters say her ability to build coalitions and appeal to many different types proves that she\u2019s one of the best chances Texas Democrats have. Democrats unveil agenda aimed at keeping Senate When she speaks, her easy transition from humor to wonkish policy is speckled with hints of a Texas drawl and bursts of Spanish idioms. Munoz, her long-time friend and DNC finance chair, said she is known for walking into a crowd and saying, \u201cBuenos Noches, ya\u2019ll.\u201d Hinojosa tells a similar story. He said she can walk into a room of skeptical West Texas farmers and connect with them. Her appeal to both Hispanics and women, combined with the Democratic Party\u2019s and allied groups\u2019 invigorated efforts at registering and persuading people to vote, could be the key ingredients for a successful campaign. \u201cIf we don\u2019t elect her, shame on us. If we don\u2019t vote, shame on us,\u201d Munoz said.",

            "article_content": "Immigration reform could get a second life under the threat of executive action President Barack Obama has suggested he might act to curb deportations Some Republicans backing reform worry the President will act by late summer The next few months offer a narrow window for the GOP to sidestep executive action Conventional political wisdom suggests that immigration reform in a midterm election year has a snowball\u2019s chance in July of getting any traction. But maybe that wisdom isn\u2019t so conventional. Some Republicans say they are warily preparing for the possibility that President Barack Obama could use executive action this summer to bypass congressional gridlock and act on immigration reform. Those changes could include making noncriminals and minor offenders the lowest deportation priorities, a recommendation the Congressional Hispanic Caucus stressed in its meeting earlier this month with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Republicans have good reason to worry, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell University Law School. \u201cIf I had to predict, I think the president will make some administrative fine tuning of his immigration policies in the hopes of pacifying the immigration activists,\u201d said Yale-Loehr. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Florida, worries that day will come in August when lawmakers have headed home to their districts to campaign. Diaz-Balart and his staff are cranking up the pace on crafting a measure that would help some undocumented immigrants gain their citizenship through currently existing channels, said Cesar Gonzalez, the congressman\u2019s chief of staff. He declined to say which existing channels the bill would use. He added that the measure would also strengthen border security and try to address the backlog of green card applications for permanent status. The White House has directed the Homeland Security Department to reexamine the administration\u2019s deportation policy following criticism over the roughly 2 million deportations that have occurred during Obama\u2019s tenure. As recently as last week, the president declined to give a timeline on when those immigration policy reforms might occur. Should Obama use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform? Is race holding up immigration reform? Rubio on Bush's immigration comments Cruz counters Bush on illegal immigration \u201cThe only way to truly fix it is through congressional action,\u201d Obama told reporters on Thursday.\u201d We have already tried to take as many administrative steps as we could. We\u2019re going to review it one more time to see if there\u2019s more that we can do to make it more consistent with common sense and more consistent with, I think, the attitudes of the American people, which is we shouldn\u2019t be in the business necessarily of tearing families apart who otherwise are law-abiding.\u201d Obama could take matters into his own hands Still, some Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, a potential 2016 presidential candidate who had a key role in helping write a Senate-passed immigration reform bill, have said they are concerned Obama will soon tire of congressional inaction and use executive action. Diaz-Balart hopes to have his measure ready for a debate by June or July. \u201cWe think that\u2019s the last window for our bill,\u201d Gonzalez said. That \u201clast window\u201d would likely close because, as House Republican leadership has indicated, using the presidential pen and phone on immigration reform would further sour the relationship between the Obama administration and the GOP. While the Senate passed its sweeping immigration package last year, the measure has stalled in the GOP-controlled House. Republicans in that chamber have followed a more incremental approach with lawmakers \u2013 like Diaz-Balart \u2013 offering their own measures. But Republicans might be gun-shy about taking up this type of measure, political experts say. \u201cThere\u2019s a general wariness in the Republican caucus to take up immigration reform \u2013 even incrementally,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cTaking up immigration has the potential to divide the caucus. There are some who want to move forward with immigration reform, but there are also Republicans who represent Republican districts who don\u2019t feel the pressure to take it up.\u201d That\u2019s because immigration reform is a thorny topic and not one Republican lawmakers are likely to want to embrace in an election year. \u201cRepublicans are trying to balance the prospect of potentially doing very well in the midterms with bringing up legislation or pieces of legislation that could potentially divide the caucus,\u201d Gonzales said. Tensions between Obama and GOP on immigration The looming threat of executive action also does little to soothe tensions between Obama and Republicans. \u201cThat will make it almost impossible to ever do immigration reform, because he will spoil the well to the point where no one will trust him by giving him a new law that he will implement the way the Congress intended,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner told Fox News earlier this month. A tale of two Republicans: A story of the GOP and immigration reform According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Boehner also told industry groups and campaign donors in March at a Las Vegas fundraiser  that, when it comes to immigration reform, the House Speaker is: \u201chellbent on getting this done this year.\u201d In response to media questions about this statement, Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck emailed reporters on Friday saying \u201cEveryone can tell their editors to chill.\u201d McCain 'won't give up' on immigration Gov. Jindal: Secure the border first A tale of two districts \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Buck said. \u201cAs he\u2019s said many times, the speaker believes step-by-step reform is important, but it won\u2019t happen until the president builds trust and demonstrates a commitment to the rule of law.\u201d Still, some Democratic operatives are banking that Republicans \u2014 who lost big among African-Americans, women and Latinos in the 2012 presidential race \u2014 will feel pressure to act on immigration reform. The Service Employees International Union said last year it was spending $500,000 to help defeat more than a half-dozen House Republicans who the group believes are vulnerable on immigration in November. Earlier this month, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said race was part of the reason Republicans in that chamber are blocking immigration reform efforts. \u201cI think race has something to do with the fact that they\u2019re not bringing up an immigration bill,\u201d she said. Republicans who have pushed immigration reform and political experts both say there is now a narrow window for the GOP to get something done. Late spring and summer \u201cmight open a small window of time for Republicans to act,\u201d Yale-Loehr said. \u201cIf the primaries in spring and summer show immigration is not that big an issue with activists, then Republicans will feel they can go out on the limb and support reform.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is a transcript of President Barack Obama\u2019s news conference Thursday in Washington. President Barack Obama: Hello, everybody.  Before I begin I just want to express on behalf of the American people our deepest condolences to the Republic of Korea, and the families of all those who\u2019ve seen their loved one last when I ferry sank within the last couple of days. Obviously information is still coming in.  We know that many of the victims of this terrible tragedy were students, and American Navy personnel and Marines have already been on the scene helping with search and rescue. As one of our closest allies, our commitment to South Korea is unwavering, in good times and in bad, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll underscore during my visit to Seoul next week. Before I take questions, I\u2019d also like to say a few words about how the Affordable Care Act is now covering more people at less cost than most would have predicted just a few months ago.  The first open enrollment period under this law ended a little over two weeks ago. And as more data comes in, we now know that the number of Americans who\u2019ve signed up for private insurance in the marketplaces has grown to 8 million people.  Eight million people.  Thirty-five percent of people who enrolled through the federal marketplace are under the age of 35. All told, independent experts now estimate that millions of Americans who were uninsured have gained coverage this year, with millions more to come next year and the year after. We\u2019ve also seen signs that the Affordable Care Act is bringing economic security to more Americans.  Before this law added new transparency and competition to the individual market, folks who\u2019ve bought insurance on their own regularly saw double-digit increases in their premiums.  That was the norm. And while we suspect that premiums will keep rising, as they have for decades, we also know that, since the law took effect, health care spending has risen more slowly than at any time in the past 50 years. In the decade before the Affordable Care Act, employer-based insurance rose almost 8 percent a year.  Last year, it grew at half that rate. Under this law, real Medicare costs per person have nearly stopped growing.  The life of the Medicare trust fund has been extended by 10 years.  And the independent Congressional Budget Office now expects premiums for plans on the marketplace to be 15 percent lower than originally predicted. So those savings add up to more money that families can spend at businesses, more money that businesses can spend hiring new workers, and the CBO now says that the Affordable Care Act will be cheaper than recently projected.  Lower costs from coverage provisions will shrink our deficits by an extra $100 billion. So the bottom line is, under the Affordable Care Act, the share of Americans with insurance is up, the growth of health care costs is down, hundreds of millions of Americans who already have insurance now have new benefits and protections, from free preventive care to freedom from lifetime caps on your care.  No American with a pre- existing condition, like asthma or cancer, can be denied coverage.  No woman can be charged more just for being a woman.  Those days are over. And this thing is working.  I\u2019ve said before, this law won\u2019t solve all the problems in our health care system.  We know we\u2019ve got more work to do.  But we now know for a fact that repealing the Affordable Care Act would increase the deficit, raise premiums for millions of Americans, and take insurance away from millions more, which is why, as I\u2019ve said before, I find it strange that the Republican position on this law is still stuck in the same place that it has always been. They still can\u2019t bring themselves to admit that the Affordable Care Act is working.  They said nobody would sign up; they were wrong about that.  They said it would be unaffordable for the country; they were wrong about that.  They were wrong to keep trying to repeal a law that is working when they have no alternative answer for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions who\u2019d be denied coverage again or every woman who\u2019d be charged more for just being a woman again. I know every American isn\u2019t going to agree with this law, but I think we can agree that it\u2019s well past time to move on as a country and refocus our energy on the issues that the American people are most concerned about, and that continues to be the economy, because these endless, fruitless repeal efforts come at a cost. The 50 or so votes Republicans have taken to repeal this law could have been 50 votes to create jobs by investing in things like infrastructure or innovation, or 50 votes to make it easier for middle-class families to send their kids to college, or 50 votes to raise the minimum wage or restore unemployment insurance that they let expire for folks working hard to find a new job. The point is, the repeal debate is and should be over.  The Affordable Care Act is working.  And I know the American people don\u2019t want us spending the next two-and-a-half years re-fighting the settled political battles of the last five years.  They sent us here to repair our economy, to rebuild our middle class, and to restore our founding promise of opportunity, not just for a few, but for all.  And as president, that\u2019s exactly what I intend to keep doing as long as I\u2019m in this office. With that, I\u2019ll take some questions.  Let\u2019s see who we\u2019ve got. Kathleen Hennessey of the L.A. Times? Question:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I \u2013 it just sounds like there\u2019s been some development on the \u2013 in the Ukraine talks in Geneva.  I\u2019m just wondering if you could describe your level of confidence in what this agreement is and how you can be sure that Russia will follow through, given some of the remarks from President Putin this morning. Obama: I don\u2019t think we can be sure of anything at this point. I think there is the possibility, the prospect that diplomacy may de- escalate the situation and we may be able to move towards what has always been our goal, which is let the Ukrainians make their own decisions about their own lives. There was a meeting in Geneva, representatives of the Ukrainian government, the Russian government, the E.U., as well as the United States.  It was a lengthy, vigorous conversation.  My understanding is, is that the Ukrainian prime minister gave a detailed and thorough presentation about the reforms that they intend to introduce, including reforms that provide assurances for Ukrainians who live in eastern and southern Ukraine that they will be fully represented, that their rights will be protected, that Russian speakers and Russian natives in Ukraine will have the full protection of the law. And my understanding, based on what I\u2019ve heard, is that there was an acknowledgement within the meeting that the Ukrainian government in Kiev had gone out of its way to address a range of the concerns that may have existed in southern and eastern Ukraine. There was a promising public statement that indicated the need to disarm all irregular forces and militias and groups that have been occupying buildings.  There was an offer of amnesty to those who would willingly lay down their arms, evacuate those buildings, so that law and order could be restored in eastern and southern Ukraine.  The Russians signed on to that statement. And the question now becomes, will, in fact, they use the influence that they\u2019ve exerted in a disruptive way to restore some order so that Ukrainians can carry out an election, move forward with the decentralization reforms that they\u2019ve proposed, stabilize their economy, and start getting back on the path of growth and democracy, and that their sovereignty will be respected? We\u2019re not going to know whether, in fact, there\u2019s follow-through on these statements for several days.  And so today I spoke with Chancellor Merkel.  Later on in the day, I\u2019m going to be speaking to David Cameron.  We\u2019re going to be consulting with our European allies. Over the last week, we have put in place additional consequences that we can impose on the Russians if we do not see actual improvement of the situation on the ground. And we are coordinating now with our European allies.  My hope is that we actually do see follow-through over the next several days, but I don\u2019t think, given past performance, that we can count on that, and we have to be prepared to potentially respond to what continue to be, you know, efforts of interference by the Russians in eastern and southern Ukraine. If, in fact, we do see improvements, then that will obviously be a positive.  In the meantime, we\u2019re going to make sure that we continue to help the Ukrainian government, working with the IMF, the Europeans and others, to stabilize their economy and to start reforming it.  We\u2019re going to continue to work with our NATO allies to make sure that they are assured that we\u2019re going to meet our Article 5 obligations and that they are secure. And, you know, as I\u2019ve said before \u2013 I think I had an interview with Major yesterday in which I mentioned \u2013 this whole exercise by the Russians is not good for Russia, either.  There are, I think, a number of articles today indicating the degree to which an economy that was already stuck in the mud is further deteriorating because of these actions. And in my conversations with President Putin, I\u2019ve emphasized the same thing, that, you know, we have no desire to see further deterioration of the Russian economy.  On the other hand, we are going to continue to uphold the basic principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity for all countries and that there is a way for Ukraine to be independent, to be sovereign, and to have positive relationships with both the West and the East, with both its European neighbors and its Russian neighbors.  And that\u2019s our primary concern. Maria Pena, La Opinion? Question: Yes, thank you, Mr. President (OFF-MIKE) for you here in the U.S.  House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said \u2013 or claimed that you haven\u2019t learned how to work with them and he\u2019s angry that you\u2019re attacking the GOP on the lack of movement on immigration reform.  So I was wondering if \u2013 how you respond to that. And the second part to that, right now you have hunger-strikers across the street demanding relief for undocumented immigrants.  And I was wondering if you can dispel the rumors or if there\u2019s a leak from the White House that you will make some sort of announcement in the coming weeks to expand that relief for the undocumented.  Thank you. Obama: Well, I actually had a very pleasant conversation with Mr. Cantor yesterday. Question: Really? Obama: I did.  You know, I\u2026 (LAUGHTER) You know \u2013 you know, you\u2019re always kind of surprised by the mismatch between press releases and \u2013 and the conversation.  I wished him happy Passover. And \u2013 and what I said to him privately is something that I would share with him \u2013 that I\u2019ve said publicly, which is, there is bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform.  It would strengthen our economy, it would help with our security, and it would provide relief to, you know, families who \u2013 many of whom have lived here for years and who have children and family members who are U.S. citizens, and that Congress should act, and that right now what\u2019s holding us back is House Republican leadership not willing to go ahead and let the process move forward. So it \u2013 it was a pretty friendly conversation.  I think, in his press release, I gather he was referring to the observation that we\u2019d made a day earlier, that it had now been a year since the Senate had passed a strong bipartisan bill and that, although we had heard a lot of talk about the House Republicans being interested in doing something, nothing had happened yet, and suggesting that we need some urgency here.  I still feel the same way. I know there are Republicans in the House, as there are Republicans in the Senate, who know this is the right thing to do.  I also know it\u2019s hard politics for Republicans, because there are some in their base that are very opposed to this. But what I also know is that there are families all across the country who are experiencing great hardship and pain because this is not getting resolved.  I also know that there are businesses around the country that could be growing even faster, that our deficits could be coming down faster, that, you know, we would have more customers in our shops, if we get this thing resolved. We know what the right thing to do is.  It\u2019s a matter of political will.  It\u2019s not any longer a matter of policy.  And I\u2019m going to continue to encourage them to get this done. As far as our actions, Jeh Johnson, our new head of Department of Homeland Security, has been talking to everybody \u2013 law enforcement, immigrant rights groups \u2013 to do a thoroughgoing review of our approach towards enforcement.  And we\u2019re doing that in consultation with Democrats and Republicans and with any interested party. I do think that the system we have right now is broken.  I\u2019m not alone in that opinion.  The only way to truly fix it is through congressional action.  We have already tried to take as many administrative steps as we could.  We\u2019re going to review it one more time to see if there\u2019s more that we can do to make it more consistent with common sense and more consistent with, I think, the attitudes of the American people, which is we shouldn\u2019t be in the business necessarily of tearing families apart who otherwise are law-abiding. And so \u2013 so let me \u2013 you know, I won\u2019t get into timing right now, because, you know, Mr. Johnson is going to go ahead and do that review. Tamara Keith? Question: Yes.  So you \u2013 regarding the Affordable Care Act, Ithink\u2026 Obama: Yeah, let\u2019s talk about that. Question: (OFF-MIKE) I think everyone agrees that it has flaws, but Democrats have been sort of reluctant in Congress to \u2013 to reopen the conversation, and Republicans have been more than happy to reopen the conversation, but in a different way.  Now that, as you say, it\u2019s here to stay, there are so many people that signed up, in this environment, is it possible to do the kind of corrections that \u2013 that the business community and many others would like to see, sort of small, technical corrections? Obama: It is absolutely possible, but it will require a change in attitude on the part of the Republicans.  I have always said from the outset that on any large piece of legislation like this, there are going to be things that need to be improved, need to be tweaked.  I said that, I think, the day I signed the bill. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any hesitation on our part to consider ideas that would actually improve the legislation.  The challenge we have is, is that if you have certain members in the Republican Party whose view is making it work better is a concession to me, then it\u2019s hard in that environment to actually get it done. And I recognize that their party is going through, you know, the stages of grief, right?  Anger and denial and all that stuff.  And we\u2019re not at acceptance yet.  But at some point, my assumption is, is that there will be an interest to figure out, how do we make this work in the best way possible? We have 8 million people signed up through the exchanges.  That doesn\u2019t include the 3 million young people who are able to stay on their parent\u2019s plan.  It doesn\u2019t include the 3 million people who benefited from expansions in Medicaid.  So if my math is correct, that\u2019s 14 million right there.  You\u2019ve got another 5 million people who signed up outside of the marketplaces, but are part of the same insurance pool. So we\u2019ve got a sizable part of the U.S. population now that are in the first \u2013 for the first time, in many cases, in a position to enjoy the financial security of health insurance. And I\u2019m meeting them as I\u2019m on the road.  Met with \u2013 saw a woman yesterday, a young woman, maybe 34, with her mom and her dad, she\u2019s got two small kids, and a self-employed husband, and was \u2013 was diagnosed with breast cancer.  And this isn\u2019t an abstraction to her. She is saving her home.  She is saving her business.  She is saving her parents\u2019 home, potentially, because she\u2019s got health insurance, which she just could not afford. And the question now becomes, if, in fact, this is working for a lot of people, but there are still improvements to make, why are we still having a conversation about repealing the whole thing?  And why are we having folks say that any efforts to improve it are somehow handing Obama a victory?  This isn\u2019t about me. And my hope is, is that we start moving beyond that.  My suspicion is that probably will not happen until after November, because it seems as if this is the primary agenda item in the Republican political platform. But here\u2019s what I know:  The American people would much rather see us talk about jobs, would much rather see us talk about high college costs, would much rather see us discussing how we can rebuild our roads and our bridges and our infrastructure and put people back to work.  They\u2019d much rather see us talk about how we boost wages and boost incomes and, you know, improve their individual family bottom lines. And if the Republicans want to spend the entire next six months or a year talking about repealing a bill that provides millions of people health insurance without providing any meaningful alternative, instead of wanting to talk about jobs and the economic situation of families all across the country, that\u2019s their prerogative.  At some point, I think they\u2019ll make the transition.  That\u2019s my hope, anyway. If not, we\u2019re just going to keep on doing what we\u2019re doing, which is making \u2013 making it work for people all across the country. I\u2019m sorry.  I\u2019m going to say one last thing about this\u2026      (LAUGHTER)      \u2026 just because this \u2013 this does frustrate me, states that have chosen not to expand Medicaid for no other reason than political spite.  You got 5 million people who could be having health insurance right now, at no cost to these states \u2013 zero cost to these states \u2013 other than ideological reasons, they have chosen not to provide health insurance for their citizens.  That\u2019s wrong.  It should stop.  Those folks should be able to get health insurance like everybody else. Isaac, from Politico.  Where are you, Isaac?  There you are. Question: Hi, thank you, Mr. President.  Given all that you were just saying about the Affordable Care Act, do you think it\u2019s time for Democrats to start campaigning loudly and positively on the benefits of Obamacare?  Will you lead that charge? And on Ukraine, you\u2019ve said in other situations \u2013 Iran, for example \u2013 that the military option remains on the table, even as talks go on.  Is the military option on the table with Russia?  And if so, would that be through NATO forces, through lethal aid to Ukraine? Obama: Now, keep in mind, I think I\u2019ve been very clear that military options are not on the table in Ukraine, because this is not a situation that would be amenable to a clear military solution.  What we have to do is to create an environment in which irregular forces disarm, that the seizing of buildings cease, that a national dialogue by Ukrainians \u2013 not by Russians, not by Americans, or anybody else, but by Ukrainians  - takes place, they move forward with reforms that meet the interests of the various groups within Ukraine, they move forward with elections, and they start getting their economic house in order.  That\u2019s what\u2019s going to solve the problem. And so, obviously, Russia right now still has its forces amassed along the Ukrainian-Russian border as a gesture of intimidation.  And it is our belief \u2013 and not ours alone, but I think broad portions of the international community \u2013 believe that Russia\u2019s hand is in the disruptions and chaos that we\u2019ve been seeing in southern and eastern Ukraine. But there is an opportunity for Russia to take a different approach.  We are encouraging them to do so.  In the meantime, we\u2019re going to prepare additional responses, should Russia fail to take a different course.  We\u2019ve already had an impact on their economy.  That is well-documented.  It could get significantly worse. But we don\u2019t have an interest in hurting ordinary Russians just for the sake of it.  Our strong preference would be for Mr. Putin to follow through on what is a glimmer of hope coming out of these Geneva talks, but we\u2019re not going to count on it until we see it.  And in the meantime, we\u2019re going to prepare what our other options are. With respect to the Affordable Care Act, my point is that we\u2019ve been having a political fight about this for five years.  We need to move on to something else.  That\u2019s what the American people are interested in.  I think the Democrats should forcefully defend and be proud of the fact that millions of people, like the woman I just described who I saw in Pennsylvania yesterday, we\u2019re helping because of something we did.  I don\u2019t think we should apologize for it.  I don\u2019t think we should be defensive about it.  I think there is a strong, good, right story to tell. I think what the other side is doing and what the other side is offering would strip away protections from those families and from hundreds of millions of people who already had health insurance before the law passed, but never knew if the insurance company could drop them when they actually needed it or women who were getting charged more just because they were a woman. I\u2019m still puzzled why they\u2019ve made this their \u2013 their sole agenda item when it comes to our politics.  It\u2019s curious. But what I intend to talk about is what the American people are interested in hearing, our plans for putting people back to work, our plans for making sure our economy continues to innovate, our plans to make sure that, as I discussed yesterday, we\u2019re training people for the jobs that are out there right now, and making better use of our community colleges and linking them up with businesses, and how we\u2019re going to continue to bring manufacturing back the way we have over the last several years, and how we\u2019re going to put more money in the pockets of ordinary people. So if they want to \u2013 if Republicans want to spend all their time talking about repealing a law that\u2019s working, that\u2019s their business. I think what Democrats should do is not be defensive, but we need to move on and focus on the things that are really important to the American people right now. David Jackson? Question: Yes, sir, thank you.  One reason the Republicans (OFF- MIKE) is that there are people who object to the law, who\u2019ve said they\u2019ve had problems with the law, and there are a significant \u2013 a significant number of opponents to the law.  I guess my question is, what makes you think a significant majority of the American people, of voters, will accept this law?  Or are we destined to health care as a 50-50, red state-blue state argument for years to come? Obama: No, I think you\u2019re mixing up two things here, David.  You said there are people who have seen problems with the law.  That\u2019s not 50 percent of the American people.  There may have been folks who have been affected in ways that they weren\u2019t happy about by the law.  That is a far smaller number than the millions of people who\u2019ve been signed up. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be concerned about it.  That\u2019s an area where, as I said to Tamara, we should be open to, are there ways that we can make it even better?  So, you know, that\u2019s objective facts and \u2013 and real problems out there. The other side of it is just polling, right?  What\u2019s the general opinion of the law, which is attached to general opinions about me or about Democrats and partisanship in the country generally.  My view is that the longer we see the law benefiting millions of people, the more we see accusations that the law is hurting millions of people being completely debunked, as some of you in the press have done, and the more the average American who already had health insurance sees that it\u2019s actually not affecting them in an adverse way, then it becomes less of a political football, which is where I want it to be. This shouldn\u2019t be a political football.  This should be something that we take for granted, that in this country, you should be able to get affordable health care, regardless of how wealthy you are. Now, the larger issue about whether we can move past the polarization and \u2013 and sort of the bitter political debates between Democrats and Republicans, of which Obamacare is just one small part, you know, that\u2019s going to take more time.  But it\u2019s not for the lack of trying on my part.  And I think that I speak for all Democrats in saying we would much prefer a constructive conversation with the Republicans about how do we get some stuff done, and let\u2019s focus on some areas that the American people really care about. On jobs, we know that infrastructure would put people back to work right now and would improve our economy for the long term.  It didn\u2019t used to be a partisan issue.  Why aren\u2019t we coming up with a way to make sure that we\u2019re rebuilding our roads and our bridges and improving our air traffic control system?  There\u2019s no reason that has to be political.  There really isn\u2019t any ideological disagreement on that. And I guarantee you, after this winter, if you look at the potholes that are the size of canyons all across big chunks of the United States, that people would like to see an infrastructure bill. Let\u2019s get it done. Question: How long before health care ceases to become a political football, you think?  Are we talking years? Obama: Well, you know, the \u2013 I think it\u2019s hard to say.  It\u2019s interesting, I spoke at, you know, the LBJ Library the other day. And, you know, most us weren\u2019t around to pay real close attention to those debates.  They\u2019re pretty distant now in the past.  Apparently, it took, you know, several years before people realized, hey, Medicare actually works and it\u2019s lifting a lot of seniors out of despair and \u2013 and poverty. So we\u2019ve been through this cycle before.  It happens each and every time we make some strides in terms of strengthening our commitments to each other and, you know, we expand some of these social insurance programs.  There\u2019s a lot of fear-mongering and a lot of political argument and debate and a lot of accusations are flung back and forth about socialized medicine and the end of freedom, and then it turns out that, you know, it\u2019s working for a lot of folks, and we still live in a free-market society, and, you know, the Constitution\u2019s intact, and then we move on. And I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take, but in the meantime, how about us focusing on some things that the American people really care about? All right.  Thank you, everybody.",

            "article_content": "Activists, some Democrats want Obama to use executive action to stem deportations Republicans warn that using the pen will risk broader immigration reform efforts Immigration and political analysts say Obama could do more but must tread carefully Some Democratic lawmakers, immigration activists expect the President to act soon Immigration champion Rep. Luis Gutierrez feels confident that President Barack Obama will use his executive powers to push through reform. House Speaker John Boehner feels confident that doing so will tank what little support the President has among Republicans on immigration reform. They\u2019re both right, immigration law experts say. After pushback from immigration activists and some members of his party, the President has directed his administration to reexamine its deportation policy. The administration could shift noncriminals and minor offenders to the lowest deportation priorities. \u201cI think the President has a difficult decision to make here,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell University Law School. \u201cThe courts have upheld wide discretion on immigration matters. He could make noncriminals the lowest deportation priorities. \u2026 But there is a penalty he could pay through using executive action rather than waiting for Congress to act on immigration reform.\u201d Rubio on Bush's immigration comments Bush: Illegal immigration is 'act of love' Cruz counters Bush on illegal immigration McCain 'won't give up' on immigration That political price, Boehner told Fox News last week, is \u201cthat will make it almost impossible to ever do immigration reform, because he will spoil the well to the point where no one will trust him by giving him a new law that he will implement the way the Congress intended.\u201d \u201cThe American people want us to deal with immigration reform,\u201d Boehner said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cKelly File\u201d during the same interview. \u201cBut every time the President ignores the law, like the 38 times he has on Obamacare, our members look up and go, \u2018Wait a minute: You can\u2019t have immigration reform without strong border security and internal enforcement. How can we trust the President to actually obey the law and enforce the law that we would write?\u2019\u201d Legislation stuck in the House Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform package \u2013 which includes a citizenship path for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Roughly one-third of that chamber\u2019s Republicans supported the measure, but the legislation has been stymied in the Republican-controlled House as lawmakers there hammer out more incremental approaches to such things as a path to legalization. Dems to Obama: Suspend deportations In the meantime, Obama has faced increasing pressure from immigration activists and members of his own party to use the power of his pen to help stem the high number of deportations that have occurred during his administration. Under this President, there have been roughly 2 million deportations, a number that far exceeds that of previous administrations and led the head of the National Council of La Raza to dub him \u201cthe deporter-in-chief.\u201d There are things Obama could do right away, experts say. Currently, law enforcement agents along the border and those investigating national security matters can engage in ethnic or racial profiling. Federal agents elsewhere in the country can profile based on a person\u2019s religion, national origin, sexual orientation or gender identification if they suspect  immigration or national security laws have been broken. Obama could, through executive action, expand a ban on any kind of profiling, according to a report released Tuesday by the Brennan Center at New York University\u2019s School of Law, which would reduce the amount of people taken into custody and reduce deportations. \u201cThis is something the President has known he could do since the beginning of his administration,\u201d said Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program. \u201cAnd I do think the renewed commitment to doing executive action should help push things forward.\u201d The Justice Department is reviewing racial profiling in federal law enforcement, and the White House recently directed the Justice Department to include Homeland Security in its review. Why hasn\u2019t Obama acted on immigration? The President\u2019s apparent reluctance to use the power of his office to more heavily push immigration reform is a bit baffling, immigration and political analysts say. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery,\u201d said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. \u201cHe clearly cares, but he hasn\u2019t fought the issue. Public opinion is still malleable on this. \u2026This is an opportunity for the President to get back into this fight and embrace the Jeb Bush spirit,\u201d Gergen said of the former Florida governor\u2019s \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d approach to immigration, which includes understanding the impact of deportation on families. Obama said in November that he does not have the power to halt the record number of deportations that have occurred under his watch. But he does have some latitude in implementing such laws, immigration law experts say. Using prosecutorial discretion, the executive branch has the \u201cinherent power to choose which cases to act on,\u201d Richard A. Boswell, an immigration law professor at the University of California\u2019s Hastings College of the Law, told CNN. Obama said he can\u2019t stop deportations of immigrants, but maybe he can Some prominent Democrats agree and point to his executive action in 2012 in halting the deportations of \u201cDreamers,\u201d the children of undocumented immigrants dubbed for the DREAM Act, which would have provided amnesty for them. \u201cMr. President, you do have the power to stop what\u2019s going on,\u201d Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York, said at a news conference in December calling for an end to the deportations. Rangel and Gutierrez were among the 30 Democratic lawmakers who signed a letter telling the President that not only did he have the authority to halt the high number of deportations, but \u201cour efforts in Congress will only be helped by the sensible and moral step of stopping deportations.\u201d Obama netted 71% of the Latino vote in the last election, while Republican nominee Mitt Romney garnered 27%. Hispanics are the fastest-growing minority group. GOP wants to expand appeal beyond its base After the GOP\u2019s losses among African-Americans, women and Latinos, the party performed an autopsy of sorts and has since redoubled efforts to make better inroads with those groups. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi last week said race was part of the reason Republicans in that chamber are blocking immigration reform efforts. \u201cI think race has something to do with the fact that they\u2019re not bringing up an immigration bill,\u201d she said. However, despite the popularity the President enjoyed among Hispanics, a minority group that has been vocal about the record-high deportations, using executive action to do more on immigration reform could have negative political consequences, said Yale-Loehr, the Cornell University Law School professor. \u201cIn the short term for Obama himself, it might not matter, but what\u2019s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,\u201d Yale-Loehr said. \u201cIf a Republican president made an executive action and used Obama as an example to say \u2018I could do what I want,\u2019 it could hurt Democrats.\u201d Still, strong signals from the White House recently in directing Homeland Security to look into how it can apply immigration laws \u201cmore humanely\u201d give members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and their constituents hope. Gutierrez took to the House floor recently to warn Republicans that when it comes to immigration, a day of reckoning is coming. \u201cIf you refuse to give the President a bill he can sign because you do not trust him to enforce immigration laws \u2026 he will act without you,\u201d Gutierrez, a Democrat who hails from the President\u2019s home state of Illinois, said on the House floor this month. \u201cHe has alternatives under existing law. There are concrete ways within existing law to help keep families together and spare U.S. citizens from losing their wives, their husbands and their children to deportation. In spite of your lack of action,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cAnd I believe the President is going to use those tools.  I saw it in his eyes when I met with him.\u201d CNN\u2019s Leigh Ann Caldwell contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "New survey shows number of Latino evangelical Protestants is on the rise Influential pastor says the group is \"what the country needs right now\" Republican Party needs to be more proactive in community, Latinos say Almost a third of Latinos believe neither party cares about them, survey shows \u201cIt\u2019s the hour for us in this country to turn it back toward the Lord. We\u2019re much more than \u2018hallelujah\u2019 people. We\u2019re into government, and we are into politics. We are a force to be reckoned with.\u201d Wilfredo De Jesus wants his message heard loud and clear: Evangelical Latino Protestants in the United States are more relevant than ever. And they\u2019re up for grabs ahead of the 2014 midterm elections. One of the leading voices of the fast-growing evangelical Protestant Latino voting bloc, in the past 14 years as the senior pastor of New Life Covenant Ministries in Chicago, De Jesus has seen the church grow from \u201c68 people in one of the worst parts of the nation to over 20,000.\u201d Last year, he was named one of Time magazine\u2019s 100 most influential people in the world. \u201cWe\u2019re very vocal now,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last 10 years, you\u2019ve seen this bloc of people has grown. And we have tremendous influence. Especially in politics.\u201d A new study by a nonpartisan research institute based in Washington suggests that he\u2019s right. The 2013 Hispanic Values Survey released recently by the Public Religion Research Institute showed a sharp shift in religious demographics among Latinos. It\u2019s that complex religious divide that could be the key to the Republican Party making inroads in the community during the next election cycle. \u201cThe number of evangelical Protestants nearly doubled from 7% to 13% when you compare childhood religious affiliation to current religious affiliation,\u201d said the institute\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Robert P. Jones. That\u2019s between 7.5 million and 8 million \u201cquintessential swing voters.\u201d An \u2018affinity for the Republican Party\u2019 The door is the most open to Republican candidates and the Republican Party, Jones said. \u201cEvangelicals have the most affinity for the Republican Party. While nearly half lean towards the Democratic Party, almost as many lean towards the Republican Party at 43%.\u201d The findings were taken from a random sample survey of 1,563 respondents who identified as Hispanic living in the U.S. De Jesus \u2013 or \u201cPastor Choco,\u201d as he is more commonly known \u2013 believes that evangelical Protestants are \u201cwhat the country needs right now\u201d and could be the key not only for the GOP winning big during the midterms, but also for Republicans to get back to the White House. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned from the Bible that when the righteous govern, the people rejoice. And (Latinos) haven\u2019t seen our people rejoice for quite some time,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the core of evangelicals is the fear of God and the institution of family. These are things we feel we can bring back to this nation.\u201d \u2018We need to do a better job communicating\u2019 Latino evangelicals might be ripe for Republican influence, but getting them to vote red is a different story. Angel Garcia, president of the Chicago Young Republicans, said that although the survey gives the GOP reason to be hopeful, the party needs to be more proactive within the community. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a bad job of managing our brand. We\u2019ve let a handful of people in our party, that have made some unfortunate statements, control the party\u2019s message,\u201d Garcia said. The 38-year-old attorney and lifelong Republican said that as the son of Mexican immigrants, \u201cit\u2019s disappointing as a Latino when you hear people making ignorant statements (in the party). But both sides make ignorant statements. I am a leader in the party. I have lived the Latino culture. It\u2019s my job to show the voters and pretty much the entire party that we need to do a better job communicating.\u201d He\u2019s talking about statements like this one by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, describing his plan to deal with undocumented immigrants during a 2012 primary debate: \u201cThe answer is self-deportation, which is people decide they can do better by going home because they can\u2019t find work here because they don\u2019t have legal documentation to allow them to work here.\u201d \u201cWhen he said that, I looked over at my wife and said, \u2018He just lost thousands, if not millions, of us.\u2019 Immigration \u2026 it\u2019s a preeminent issue for us,\u201d said the Rev. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition. A focus on immigration reform Much like his friend De Jesus, Salguero believes that Latino evangelicals are the key to victory for any politician. Nowhere is this more evident than on the issue of immigration reform. \u201cEvangelicals are coming to a boiling point on this issue. We\u2019ve prayed about this, held meetings with the White House; we\u2019ve done all we can,\u201d he said from Newark, New Jersey. \u201cLet me be clear: We face the issue of immigration every day, as pastors, as caretakers, as Latinos. This is on the top of our political agenda. It would be disingenuous of me to say it doesn\u2019t carry heavy electoral gravitas.\u201d Both Salguero and De Jesus were advisers to President Barack Obama on the immigration issue. It\u2019s an area where they feel he\u2019s failed. Republicans have the chance to capitalize on it, according to De Jesus. \u201cBarack flipped on us,\u201d De Jesus said. \u201cI traveled for Obama for 14 months as a surrogate. I talked to the White House, and I said, \u2018the president cannot speak from both sides of his mouth.\u2019 It\u2019s only right for the Republicans to say, \u2018let\u2019s win back this Latino bloc, at least the evangelicals.\u2019 That starts with the immigration issue.\u201d The dismal Latino turnout for Romney was a stark contrast to the momentum developed for years under President George W. Bush, who won 44% of the Latino vote in 2004, compared with the 27% Romney received eight years later. After the 2012 election, the GOP held a postmortem emphasizing Hispanic outreach, but it\u2019s still unclear how much of a priority Republicans have made Latino voters. At the latest Conservative Political Action Conference, a panel on minority outreach had dismally low attendance. Disapproval of both parties The Hispanic Values Survey showed that while there is \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d among Latino voters with the Democratic Party on issues like record deportation numbers under Obama, there is \u201cdistrust\u201d of the Republican Party within the Latino community. \u201cThe Democratic Party has a less bumpy road ahead,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe clearest word of caution to Democrats \u2026 one phrase that is a bellwether question of how well to gauge voters is, \u2018How well does the party care about people like you?\u2019 \u201c Nearly three in 10, or 29%, said \u201cneither party cares about them,\u201d according to the survey. \u201cDemocrats certainly don\u2019t have this community locked down. That\u2019s a pretty clear indication that there\u2019s significant dissatisfaction among Latinos with both parties,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a reason for us to be optimistic. We have to be realistic and more proactive,\u201d said Daniel Ballori, president of the Young Republican Federation of Puerto Rico. The 31-year-old said the focus for the Republicans in winning more Latino votes should be on the economy, whether they are courting evangelical Protestants or others in the community. \u201cJobs and unemployment. The figures show that U.S.-born Latinos care about the same issues that non-Latino Anglos care about. Right now, that\u2019s jobs and unemployment,\u201d Ballori said. He may be on to something. Though the issue of immigration reform was ranked high among the concerns of Latino voters, it was in a four-way tie for the third most important issue behind the economy and affordable health care, according to Public Religion Research Institute research. Garcia said the solution to courting more Latino voters comes down to the rhetoric. \u201cRegardless of party, Hispanics will go to the candidate that supports them. We\u2019re the party of (Marco) Rubio, (Brian) Sandoval and (Susana) Martinez. Our message should be one of inclusion,\u201d Garcia said. The question then becomes, how do they do that? \u201cThese politicians are so full of it to get elected,\u201d De Jesus said. \u201cGive us someone who is real and speaks the truth and is going to do what they say and mean it. We\u2019ll vote for them, whatever party they\u2019re from.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Between Obamacare numbers and meeting the Pope, Obama has a good week Democratic strategists say don't expect too much from this high point Democrats rally around Obama, knowing their future is tied to his mojo Republicans will continue to hammer Obamacare to keep their base energized Here\u2019s a sentence you haven\u2019t seen much, if at all, this midterm election year: President Obama is ending the week on a high note. On the world stage, an almost can\u2019t-lose meeting and photo opportunity with Pope Francis. And at home, there\u2019s word that enrollment in the President\u2019s health care plan has passed the 6 million mark, short of the administration\u2019s initial goal, but still a healthy number considering the disastrous early rollout of Obamacare insurance exchanges. The seeds of an Obama political recovery? Worth watching but don\u2019t bet on it, suggest a handful of leading Democratic strategists. One widely admired Democratic sage, speaking on condition of anonymity because he did not want to publicly criticize his party\u2019s leader, put it this way when asked if Obama could engineer a rebound or was stuck in a rut: Inside Politics: Is six million enough? Inside Politics: BBall follows McConnell Inside Politics: More Clinton documents \u201cRut. Voters are not paying attention to Barack Obama.\u201d Republicans think likewise, though they argue their base is motivated by the President. GOP pollster Neil Newhouse says views of the health care law, especially in states with the biggest Senate races this year, continue to favor Republicans. And his view is that \u201can Obama photo-op with the Pope means next to nothing for the President\u2019s approval ratings.\u201d Poll: GOP has a 2014 enthusiasm advantage Democrats know an Obama recovery is their best hope in a midterm cycle that history shows is driven first and foremost by the President\u2019s political standing. So White House allies rushed to cast the health care numbers as a turning point. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is working,\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a prepared statement. Then came the wishful thinking: \u201cRepublicans should abandon their reckless pursuit of new milestones in the number of votes to repeal or undermine this historic law.\u201d To the contrary, Republicans argue the administration is hyping the numbers. They rightly note the 6 million-plus is the number of people who have enrolled \u2013 the administration has not released, and says it doesn\u2019t have, the number of those who have actually taken the critical step of paying for their coverage. Also unknown at the moment: the age breakdown of those who have enrolled; the administration hopes the level of younger Americans gets to 40% of the pool, but it was running behind that target heading into the final enrollment push. Inside Politics: Undocumented Americans? Boehner: 'What the hell is this, a joke?' Inside Politics: Moms for Obamacare On firmer footing than rocky rollout Still, the program is on firmer policy footing, by far, than it was in the early rollout days. Especially if expanding access and coverage is the test applied to the Affordable Care Act. Again, the numbers are a bit squishy, but when you add 3.5 million new Medicaid recipients to the Obamacare enrollment numbers, there is little doubt the percentage of Americans without health care coverage is shrinking. CNNMoney: Obamacare\u2019s amazing comeback The political question is whether Democrats can use those numbers to make it less of an issue in this year\u2019s campaigns. To that end, there is little evidence Democrats in the big competitive Senate races are ready to talk up the health care law. Instead, many of them are pushing election-year fixes. So the improved enrollment numbers are unlikely to be enough to calm the health care jitters of vulnerable Democrats. But it\u2019s worth watching to see if public opinion moves at all over the next several weeks, and worth watching Republicans to see if they alter their health care messaging at all. In the meantime, Democrats hope to improve their midterm political standing with a push on economic issues with appeal to Democratic base constituency groups \u2013 from raising the minimum wage to immigration reform. Veteran Democratic strategist Paul Begala says a focus on the minimum wage and equal pay can sell in places where the health care law might be unpopular. \u201cThey are not asking voters to believe in government; they are asking them to stand up to corporate elites,\u201d Begala said. Inside Politics: \"Thin Crust GOP\" Jeb, Christie & others courting Adelson Inside Politics: GOP attacks Tea Party The odds of passing legislation are slim to none. Leader Pelosi conceded as much when she said a House Democratic effort to force a vote on immigration reform was more to make a political point than any hope of enacting a law. Democrats aim at key, critical constituencies Broadly, the Democratic push is designed to show, in their view, the Republican obsession with Obamacare has blocked action on a meaningful economic agenda. More narrowly, each of the Democratic priority items is aimed at appealing to a critical midterm constituency, with special emphasis on women, African-Americans  and Latinos. Doing something to motivate Latinos this year is a Democratic imperative. Consider this from the Pew Research Center: \u201cToday, as many Hispanics approve as disapprove (47%-47%) of the new health care law. That\u2019s down markedly compared with the 61% approval just six months ago.\u201d In that same time period, Pew says, Obama\u2019s job approval rating has slipped 15 points among Hispanics; 48% approve of Obama\u2019s job performance today, down from 63% in September 2013. That\u2019s a recipe for low midterm turnout, something Democrats can ill afford. So Republicans aren\u2019t surprised. \u201cThey are trying to rejuvenate the voters that supported Obama in 2012 and who have either moved away from him or grown less enthused\u201d about the President, said Newhouse, the GOP pollster. \u201cThey are running a turnout campaign focused on their base.\u201d Which is exactly what Republicans are doing with their constant focus on Obamacare: The attacks play well with conservatives critical to GOP midterm odds, and in some cases have the added effect of demoralizing Democrats. The party out of power has an advantage in this game of midterm intensity chess. No matter how successful Democrats are at orchestrating votes on their top election-year issues, the single biggest factor come Election Day will be the President\u2019s standing. In 2006 \u2013 his \u201csix-year itch\u201d midterm election \u2013 President George W. Bush had slipped to a 36% approval rating, and climbed to just 37% by Election Day, according to Gallup numbers.  Democrats gained 30 House seats that year. Now, Gallup has Obama\u2019s job approval rating at 44% \u2013 with 221 days to Election Day. Better than Bush at this point in 2006, but still too far below 50% for Democratic comfort. More than any votes in Congress, that is the number most worth watching. Democrats unveil plan to keep the Senate",

            "article_content": "The meeting is called a step toward smoothing tensions with Catholics Abortion and Obamacare mandates on contraception are areas of disagreement One place for common ground: the plight of immigrants and the poor Pope Francis' popularity could give President Obama a small bump in the polls President Barack Obama gave Pope Francis a box of seeds as a gift, a fitting token as their first-ever meeting provided a fresh start of sorts between the administration and Catholic leadership after years of strained relations. \u201cThese, I think, are carrots,\u201d Obama told the Pontiff, showing him a pouch from the box, which was made from timber from the first cathedral to open in the United States, in Baltimore. The Pope gave the President two medallions \u2013 one symbolizing the need for peace and solidarity between the two hemispheres \u2013 and a copy of \u201cEvangelii Gaudium,\u201d or \u201cThe Joy of the Gospel.\u201d  The book was penned by the Pope and calls for a new era of evangelization and a renewed focus on the poor. The tokens of goodwill underscored the goal of the meeting: Focus on areas where two of the world\u2019s most influential men agree, and gently tread ground where they differ. Popes and U.S. presidents President Obama meets Pope Francis Photos: Pope Francis' first year Rock star Pope shakes up the Vatican The two men greeted each other with a smile and a handshake and posed for pictures before sitting down across a table from each other. They spoke privately for nearly an hour. When they emerged from the meeting, the President and the Vatican had slightly different takes on the tenor of their discussions, especially when it came to issues that have frayed the relationship between the Obama administration and American Catholic leaders. \u201c\u2026 (I)t was hoped that, in areas of conflict, there would be respect for humanitarian and international law and a negotiated solution between the parties involved,\u201d the Vatican said in a statement. \u201cIn the context of bilateral relations and cooperation between Church and State, there was a discussion on questions of particular relevance for the Church in that country, such as the exercise of the rights to religious freedom, life and conscientious objection. \u2026\u201d Obama, in a news conference that followed, told reporters that such issues were \u201cnot a topic of conversation\u201d with the Pope and instead were discussed with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin. According to the Vatican, the two men also discussed the issue of immigration reform and \u201cstated their common commitment to the eradication of human trafficking throughout the world.\u201d On this point, the President and the Pope were simpatico. \u201cI was grateful to have the opportunity to speak with him about the responsibilities that we all share to care for the least of these, the poor, the excluded,\u201d Obama told reporters after the meeting. \u201cAnd I was extremely moved by his insights about the importance of us all having a moral perspective on world problems and not simply thinking in terms of our own narrow self-interests.\u201d The meeting took place two days after the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on a contraception mandate included in the President\u2019s signature health care reform law. The law exempts churches and houses of worship from the requirement, but nonprofit, religiously affiliated groups are required either to provide contraception coverage to their employees directly or through a third-party insurer. Pope Francis' most irresistible moments Jimmy Carter for Catholic women priests Lampedusa: Italian gateway for migrants, refugees The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has been vocal in its opposition to the provision, said Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a spokeswoman for the organization. \u201cReligious liberties and right-to-life issues are a concern,\u201d she said of the tension between American Catholic leadership and the administration. However, \u201cthe U.S. bishops have appreciated the administration\u2019s cooperation on issues of mutual concern.\u201d 5 things you didn\u2019t know about popes and presidents Those areas of \u201cmutual concern\u201d include immigration and poverty \u2013 issues on which the President and the Pope could find common ground. In an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Obama pointed to the Pope\u2019s concern for income inequality, saying, \u201cGiven his great moral authority, when the Pope speaks it carries enormous weight.\u201d Continuing to focus on income inequality, Obama said, \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t just an economic issue, it\u2019s a moral issue. I think the Pope was speaking to the danger that over time we grow accustomed to this kind of inequality and accept it as normal. But we can\u2019t.\u201d The President said he admires the Pope\u2019s courage to speak out on economic and social issues. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we agree on every issue, but his voice is one that I think the world needs to hear. He challenges us,\u201d Obama told the newspaper. \u201cHe implores us to remember the people, especially the poor, who are affected by the economic decisions we make.\u201d Immigration issues Francis underscored his commitment to the plight of immigrants during a trip last year to the Italian island of Lampedusa, a place where thousands of African migrants desperately fleeing political upheaval and poverty pour onto European shores. Many die in the attempt to cross. Next month, a group of American Catholic leaders, including Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston, will follow suit and travel to the U.S.-Mexico border to highlight immigration concerns. On Wednesday, the administration renewed its public call for immigration reform by backing an effort by House Democrats to force a vote on the matter. \u201cImmigration reform is the right thing to do for our economy, our security, and our future,\u201d the White House said in a statement. Barack Obama and Pope Francis: Unlikely comrades? Tensions between the administration and many leaders in the American Catholic community began early in the President\u2019s tenure over his support for abortion rights. A number of bishops criticized the University of Notre Dame\u2019s decision in 2009 to award Obama an honorary law degree and invite him to give the commencement address. Relations frayed further over the contraception coverage requirement in Obamacare, leading the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to pan the law. \u201cIt was a very tough year,\u201d said Christopher Hale, a senior fellow with Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good who helped lead national Catholic outreach for Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign. \u201cIt was hard to find any reasonable Catholic who thought the Health and Human Services mandate was handled well.\u201d Differences over same sex-marriage only added to the strained relationship. Seeking unity, approval Religious experts said Francis would not have been likely to wade into politically charged conversations during the meeting. \u201cThe Vatican has to be very careful to not create a gap between what they\u2019re saying and the bishops are saying,\u201d said Steve Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies at the Catholic University of America. \u201cThey will be very careful not to undercut the American bishops in that regard.\u201d Pope accepts resignation of German \u2018Bling Bishop\u2019 The meeting with Francis, whose approval ratings are in the high 80s, might also boost Obama in that regard. His standing with the public has hovered in the low 40s. After all, the Pope\u2019s name and quotes have been invoked in everything from discussions over unemployment insurance, the minimum wage and the bigger issue of income inequality. \u201cIf I was advising President Obama, I would say the No. 1 spokesperson on American immigration reform should be Pope Francis,\u201d Hale said. \u201cHe has so much capital in this city. You have Catholics, Jews and atheists on the Hill quoting him.\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican and a Catholic, recently invited the Pope to address a joint session of Congress. \u201cEverybody on the planet would like to have their picture taken with the Pope these days,\u201d Schneck said. \u201cOne of the things that would delight Obama is if some of that popularity would rub off. Given the President\u2019s current low numbers, he is hoping for a bit of a boost.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ed Payne contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Jan Brewer, who took on President Obama over homeland security, will not seek reelection She became famous for signing the \"show me your papers\" law A conservative firebrand, Brewer also has a moderate side on some issues Pen, veto stamp still have \"plenty of ink,\" Brewer warns It\u2019s not clear who might try to succeed Jan Brewer as governor of Arizona next year, but chances are good that whoever it is won\u2019t be quite as flamboyant. The finger-wagging, gun-loving politician, known as a firebrand who exhibits flashes of moderation, announced on Wednesday that she would \u201cpass the torch of leadership\u201d and not run for reelection. Her term ends in January. Feisty on immigration A feisty Republican who rose up through local politics to the state\u2019s highest office, Brewer generated national headlines in recent years for her public opposition to President Barack Obama on border security and immigration reform. \u201cFirst entering public service as a mother concerned about the workings of her local school board, Governor Brewer has served with distinction at every level of state and local government over the last three decades,\u201d veteran Republican Sen. John McCain said Wednesday, calling her \u201ca great champion for our state.\u201d Ariz. gov.: 'I have vetoed SB 1062' Protesters celebrate the SB-1062 veto As secretary of state, Brewer automatically ascended to the gubernatorial gig in 2009 when Gov. Janet Napolitano left the job to head the Department of Homeland Security under Obama. Brewer then easily won election to a full term in 2010. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer won\u2019t seek reelection Just over a year into her tenure, she rose to national prominence by signing SB1070 into law. The strict immigration measure, also known as the \u201cshow me your papers\u201d act, allowed law enforcement to ask people for legal documents. \u201cShow me your papers\u201d law Critics complained the measure would lead to racial profiling, and the U.S. Supreme Court eventually struck down some provisions of it but left intact the controversial section allowing police to check immigration status while enforcing other laws. The issue gained Brewer the reputation of conservative firebrand, and she enhanced it in 2012 when she famously wagged her finger at Obama during a face-to-face encounter on an airport runway when he visited Arizona. In her bid for reelection that year, she won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association even though her primary opponent sat on the organization\u2019s board of directors. The NRA gave Brewer an A+ rating and under her leadership, Arizona became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. In addition, people can take concealed weapons into restaurants or bars with a permit if no alcohol is consumed. Inside Politics: Is Brewer part of a GOP evolution? However, her conservative credentials took a hit in 2013 when she decided Arizona would participate in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. A moderate side Some other conservative governors chose for their states to opt out instead of accepting federal money to pay for the expansion, but Brewer called it a \u201cmoral\u201d obligation to provide health care for the poor and uninsured. In February, Brewer vetoed a controversial state bill that would have allowed business owners asserting their religious beliefs to deny service to gay and lesbian customers. If she had accepted the measure, Arizona could have faced litigation and a boycott, potentially harming Arizona\u2019s economy and tourism industry as well as the 2015 Super Bowl to be played there. Protesters celebrate Ariz. governor\u2019s veto Brewer cited the business community\u2019s opposition to the bill in announcing her veto. Arizona law dictates that a governor can\u2019t run for more than two consecutive terms, and her time in office before she was elected in 2010 would count as a full four-year term.

            "article_content": "John King and a panel of top political reporters discuss Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, the Clinton documents, and the tea party vs. the GOP establishment on \u201cInside Politics\u201d at 8:30 a.m. Sunday ET. Arizona governor's hard line on immigration hurt GOP's chances of winning White House Gov. Jan Brewer's veto of anti-gay bill was applauded for adapting to changing times But praise from the left won't help conservatives accept unpopular decision With the stroke of her pen a few years ago, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer took the lead in a GOP immigration retreat that made it harder for Republicans to win the White House in 2012. Now, she is again at the center of a big national debate, but this time might her signature be part of an evolution helpful to GOP chances in 2016? At issue then: her support for Arizona\u2019s tough immigration law. Brewer signed SB 1070 into law in 2010 and its tough provisions became a national flashpoint and contributed to President Barack Obama\u2019s huge advantage among Latino voters. And now? A Brewer veto is at issue: The governor rejected legislation that would have allowed Arizona businesses to deny services to gay people on grounds of religious beliefs. Veto follows business backlash over anti-gay bill Tolerance is an issue for Republicans among key voting blocs, especially independents and younger voters. So some GOP strategists were quick to applaud Brewer for a move they say shows Republicans are listening and adapting to changing times \u2013 and changing views on gay rights. Catholic: 'We're being besieged' Ariz. gov.: 'I have vetoed SB 1062' Rep.: Veto 'a wake-up call for Arizona' \u201cIt tells us the Republican Party is learning the difference between standing for principle and standing in the middle of a busy intersection,\u201d said GOP strategist Alex Castellanos. \u201cIn other words, we are learning that futile gestures that have only symbolic impact do the GOP cause more harm than good.\u201d Who\u2019s behind the religious freedom push? Many social conservatives critical to GOP success vehemently disagree with that take, however, and the shifting tides of the immigration debate in recent years suggest we have hardly heard the last word. Effects of immigration revolt still felt Remember, some of the toughest proposals for new immigration steps were a response to a Republican president \u2013 George W. Bush \u2013 and a Republican presidential nominee \u2013 Sen. John McCain. They favored a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented workers, setting off a revolt among conservatives who consider that granting amnesty to lawbreakers. And that revolt had ripple effects that continue to this day. Arizona\u2019s 2010 legislation was a conservative-led rebuke to the views of Bush, McCain and by then, Obama. Brewer was hardly known as a conservative firebrand, but she signed the law and avoided a backlash from the right as she readied for a re-election campaign. In 2012, it was Mitt Romney, once a supporter of the Bush-McCain-Kennedy approach, embracing the Arizona law and saying with tough measures those here illegally would \u201cself deport.\u201d Now, House Speaker John Boehner, also in general agreement with the Bush-McCain-Kennedy approach, won\u2019t bring such a measure to a vote because he knows a vocal minority in his caucus would revolt. Veto a bump in the road for \u201creligious freedom\u201d movement Brewer\u2019s veto on the latest Arizona bill drew praise from the Obama White House and from Hillary Clinton, which tells you all you need to know about whether social conservatives will press the issue in the next White House campaign. \u201cLooking ahead to 2016, there are only going to be more clashes and court cases which will make \u2018judges\u2019 an even bigger issue in the GOP primaries and caucuses,\u201d said conservative strategist Keith Appell. Strategist: Debate is about limiting government reach Where are Arizona's discrimination cases? Protesters celebrate the SB-1062 veto Religious freedom or discrimination? Castellanos agrees but sees a changing tone. \u201cWe will still have the debate in the primaries, but it will be less intense,\u201d he predicts. \u201cThe party isn\u2019t changing its values but is learning that we can\u2019t be big government conservatives, even when it is convenient for us, on social conservative issues. \u201cIn short, the debate is increasingly about limiting the role of government, where social conservatives and libertarians agree, than about gay marriage, where Republicans don\u2019t.\u201d This finding in a recent New York Times/CBS News poll reinforces that latter point: \u201cOver all, Republican support for same-sex marriage is on the rise. In the fall of 2012, just 24% of Republicans backed legalizing the unions; now 40% of Republicans do so.\u201d Romney and Florida Gov. Rick Scott were among major GOP voices who urged Brewer to veto the Arizona gay rights law. But if we have learned anything in recent years, when leading GOP establishment figures say one thing, vocal voices in the tea party and social conservative movement will urge another \u2013 and try to punish those who disagree. So what happens the 2014 election year \u2013 in the courts and at the ballot box \u2013 will have as much if not more influence on the 2016 intra-Republican debate as Brewer\u2019s veto. \u201cThese instances where gay rights clash with free exercise of faith,\u201d the conservative strategist Appell said, \u201cwill only gin up and activate the conservative base even more in 2014.\u201d Castellanos believes the growing libertarian streak within the GOP will push the party to an eventual resolution of these tensions. \u201d \u2018Freedom nationally, values personally,\u2019 is where the GOP is going,\u201d Castellanos argues. But, mindful of the continuing immigration divide, what Castellanos doesn\u2019t argue is that any GOP evolution on gay rights and same-sex marriage specifically will happen smoothly.",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama in Maryland and Pennsylvania on Wednesday NEW: Obama visits retailer, pushes increase in minimum wage Republicans complain the President pushes same, tired policies Another State of the Union address, another road trip for President Barack Obama to push now-familiar policies that he said he would pursue on his own if Congress won\u2019t cooperate. At a Costco in suburban Maryland on Wednesday, Obama amplified his call for an increase in the minimum wage. He then traveled to Pennsylvania for another event staged around the economy. \u201cAmericans overwhelmingly agree, nobody who\u2019s working full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty,\u201d the President said. \u201cAnd that is why I firmly believe it is time to give America a raise.\u201d Obama heads to Wisconsin and Tennessee on Thursday, continuing a tradition of selling his policy prescription directly to the public after the ceremonial report to the nation. Vintage Obama 2014 State of the Union Obama: I want to expand opportunity Real People Go To Washington GOP Response: Focus on opportunity gap In his address on Tuesday, the President talked a good game of acting on his own if necessary, but his words also showed he knows that true progress depends on cooperation with a divided and recalcitrant Congress. \u201cSometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged,\u201d he said near the end, seeming to describe 2013 - when his approval ratings dropped. \u201cBut for more than 200 years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress.\u201d It was vintage Obama, blending hopeful calls for a unified approach with declarations of presidential independence through executive orders. There were the now familiar calls to recalibrate the tax code, spend more to rebuild roads and bridges, bolster education and avoid war if at all possible. He said what? Obama\u2019s speech explained Oratorical skills He brought many to tears with a tribute to Sgt. First Class Cory Remsburg, a disabled war veteran who sat next to First Lady Michelle Obama and waved with wounded limbs to a prolonged standing ovation. Even Republicans relentlessly critical of the President conceded his oratorical skill. \u201cA speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex,\u201d said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \u201cThe worst there ever was is still excellent.\u201d According to a snap CNN/ORC International poll, 44% of respondents had a \u201cvery positive\u201d response to Obama\u2019s speech, while 32% described a \u201csomewhat positive\u201d response and 22% didn\u2019t like it at all. Last year, 53% of respondents in a similar poll rated their response to the 2013 address as very positive. An optimistic goal The underlying theme of Obama\u2019s fifth State of the Union address was his call for the government to work on behalf of all Americans in 2014, and his pledge to do so even if Congress refused to join him in an election year. \u201cLet\u2019s make this a year of action,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s what most Americans want \u2013 for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.\u201d It\u2019s an optimistic goal for a President with a 43% approval rating entering his sixth year in office and facing a determined opposition in the Republican-led House of Representatives with congressional elections looming in November. Search the transcript of Obama\u2019s speech Quotes from State of the Union speeches War hero honored at State of the Union \u201cWhat I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSome require congressional action, and I\u2019m eager to work with all of you. But America does not stand still, and neither will I.\u201d Obama: End 'Mad Men' workplace policies Going it alone On issue after issue, he invited Congress to work with him but said he also would go it alone. Obama called for more government support to rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure, but also said that \u201cI will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.\u201d The President also promised an executive order to raise the minimum wage for some government contract workers. While the action is relatively narrow and affects less than half a million people, Obama urged Congress to follow suit for all low-wage workers in America. Opinion: Can Obama deliver action on inequality? GOP responds Earlier Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner chafed at such unilateral action, telling reporters that Republicans are \u201cjust not going to sit here and let the President trample all over us.\u201d In the official Republican response, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington complained that Obama\u2019s policies \u201care making people\u2019s lives harder.\u201d \u201cWe hope the President will join us in a year of real action \u2013 by empowering people \u2013 not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs,\u201d she said. Agreeing on immigration One area of possible progress is immigration reform. Obama got a long ovation when he urged Republicans in the House to join Democrats in passing a Senate plan that got bipartisan support. Gender equality big part of SOTU speech McMorris Rodgers also brought up the issue backed by some Republicans as a way to bolster their weak support among Hispanic Americans, the nation\u2019s largest minority demographic. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a step-by-step solution to immigration reform by first securing our borders and making sure America will always attract the best, brightest, and hardest working from around the world,\u201d she said in describing the more limited GOP approach to the comprehensive Senate measure that includes a path to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the country. CNN Poll: Speech watcher reaction less positive than previous years Cruz on Obama's 'imperial presidency' Disagreeing on Obamacare On another major reform issue, Obama chided Republicans for trying to undermine his signature health care law that passed in 2010 without GOP support. He cited the millions of people helped by the reforms that ended denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions among its benefits. \u201cThe American people aren\u2019t interested in refighting old battles,\u201d Obama said. \u201cLet\u2019s not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that\u2019s already helping millions of Americans. \u2026The first 40 were plenty. \u2026 We all owe it to the American people to say what we\u2019re for, not just what we\u2019re against.\u201d In her response, though, McMorris Rodgers continued the GOP attack line on the health care reforms as big government run amok and causing harm to people by raising costs and limiting their personal choices of doctors and medical treatment. This year\u2019s State of the Union is a defining test for Obama The CNN/ORC poll indicated 59% of respondents thought Obama\u2019s policies as presented in the speech would help the economy, a lower figure than in recent years. Laying out goals Obama said he will order the U.S. Treasury to create a new federal retirement savings account called MyRA, a savings bond that would guarantee \u201ca decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.\u201d It will be available to those whose jobs don\u2019t offer traditional retirement savings programs, he said. Additionally, Obama called for: \u2013 Eliminating $4 billion in tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industries \u201cthat don\u2019t need it\u201d and instead \u201cinvest more in fuels of the future.\u201d \u2013 Equal pay for women, noting they make 77 cents for each dollar a man earns, which he called \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201can embarrassment\u201d to prompt loud and long applause. \u2013 Setting new fuel standards for American trucks to help reduce U.S. oil imports \u201cand what we pay at the pump.\u201d \u2013 Reworking the corporate tax code. He urged Congress to work with him to close \u201cwasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here\u201d and instead \u201clower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home.\u201d \u2013 Congress to lift restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay so the prison can be closed in 2014. Obama also reiterated that he will veto any new sanctions bill from Congress that would derail talks on preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, adding that \u201cfor the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.\u201d Brazile: Obama\u2019s message: A dysfunctional Congress, but we\u2019ll get it done anyway Increasing minimum wage Even as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits, Obama said average wages have been flat. Along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts, Obama asked Congress to get on board with a Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 per hour. Republicans largely oppose any federal increase, saying it will place a burden on employers. \u201cThis is definitely the President\u2019s agenda and has been for some time now,\u201d said CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, who added it was hard to see how Republicans would respond any differently than before and therefore, it was hard to see big things happening in 2014.

Arizona lawmakers pass controversial anti-gay bill Will Gov. Brewer sign anti-gay bill? In an exclusive interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Monday, Brewer addressed the aspects she must consider. McCain: Anti-gay law hurts Arizona Owner: Ariz. bill 'not gays vs religion' AZ Sen.: Arizonians don't discriminate \u201cI have a history of deliberating and having an open dialogue on bills that are controversial, to listen to both sides of those issues, and I welcome the input and information that they can provide to me. And certainly I am pro-business, and that is what\u2019s turning our economy around, so I appreciate their input, as I appreciate the other side,\u201d she said. Earlier, Brewer told CNN that her decision will come after she returns this week to Arizona from Washington, where she has been attending National Governors Association meetings. \u201cI have to look at what it says and what the law says and take that information and do the right thing,\u201d she said. The bill was sent to Brewer on Monday and she has five days to sign it, veto it, or do nothing and it would become law. She has been a conservative champion for much of her five years in office. And if that\u2019s any indication, the measure could very well become law. But it\u2019s not that straightforward. Her conservative creds As secretary of state, Brewer landed the gubernatorial gig in 2009 after previous Gov. Janet Napolitano left her job to head the Department of Homeland Security. Just over a year into her tenure, Brewer rose to national prominence after signing SB1070 into law, a strict immigration measure also known as the \u201cshow me your papers\u201d law that allows law enforcement to ask people for legal documents, which critics say leads to racial profiling of Latinos. She made national headlines again for wagging her finger at President Barack Obama on a Phoenix tarmac after he stepped off of Air Force One over immigration. In her bid for re-election in 2012, she won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, even though her primary opponent sat on the organization\u2019s board of directors. The endorsement was well-earned, as was her A+ rating. Under her, Arizona became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit.

Arizona lawmakers pass anti-gay bill But her conservative credentials took a bit of a beating last year when she said Arizona would participate in the controversial expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Many conservative governors chose to opt out, but Brewer called it a \u201cmoral\u201d obligation to provide health care for the poor and uninsured. LGBT record While social and religious conservatives hope her conservative principles continue to guide her action regarding the LGBT measure, her record on lesbian and gay issues is thin. Nathan Rhoton, vice president of Equality Arizona, said that Brewer\u2019s record on related issues is \u201clargely unproven.\u201d While she vetoed a similar measure last year, it had nothing to do with the content of the bill, but political power plays inside the Arizona state Capitol. The one substantive time she acted was not on the side of gay rights. She ended domestic partner benefits for state employees, which was a measure her predecessor implemented. Brewer said the state couldn\u2019t afford it, and she defended her decision in court. \u201cShe\u2019s been mostly silent on the issue of marriage equality and those types of things,\u201d Rhoton said. LGBT rights: The patchwork states of America Some insight Where Brewer has a proven record is in the area of Arizona businesses, cutting regulations and taxes. And that could provide the clearest signal on what Brewer might do this week. Some influential business groups in Arizona oppose SB1062, the \u201creligious freedom bill.\u201d A letter that numerous business leaders sent Brewer on Monday encouraged her to oppose it. \u201cAfter analyzing the bill, we are very concerned about the effect it could have on Arizona\u2019s economy,\u201d said the letter, signed by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, among others. \u201cWe cannot support measures that could expose our businesses to litigation, nor do we want to send a message that our state is anything but an open and attractive place for visitors and the top talent that will be the cornerstone of our continued economic growth.\u201d And Brewer is well liked in the business community. \u201cWe believe she\u2019s done more than any governor nationwide to improve the economic competitiveness in her state,\u201d said Garrick Taylor, a spokesman for the Arizona Chamber. \u201cWe know this governor always does what she believes is in the best interest of the state.\u201d And LGBT rights groups hope that her close ties with the business community is enough to persuade her to oppose it. \u201cThis is where we hope her pro-business stance will prevail,\u201d Rhoton said. Growing support Brewer is also facing growing support for a veto. Is same-sex marriage no longer a political issue? Public pressure is mounting. Another major protest took place Monday evening outside the state Capitol. Businesses are hanging signs in their windows that read \u201copen for business to everyone!\u201d Both Arizona senators, Republicans John McCain and Jeff Flake, have publicly urged Brewer to veto. And according to the local newspaper in Prescott, state Sen. Steve Pierce, who voted for the measure, is now urging Brewer to pick up her veto pen. While the measure is not about same-sex marriage, a likely indicator of where Arizonans stand on the SB1062 is a Behavior Research Center\u2019s Rocky Mountain Poll from last year. It found that a majority of Arizonans support same-sex marriage. Kim Fridkin, an Arizona State University professor of political science, noted that \u201cit\u2019s an extreme measure even for (conservative) Arizona.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll be viewed more reasonable than liberal\u201d if she vetoes it, Fridkin said. A spokesman for the NFL, which will host Super Bowl XLIX, in Glendale next February, said the league is watching developments in Arizona. \u201cOur policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard,\u201d Brian McCarthy said.

A letter sent to Brewer on Monday by numerous business leaders encouraged her to oppose the measure. \u201cAfter analyzing the bill, we are very concerned about the effect it could have on Arizona\u2019s economy,\u201d said the letter, signed by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, among others. \u201cWe cannot support measures that could expose our businesses to litigation, nor do we want to send a message that our state is anything but an open and attractive place for visitors and the top talent that will be the cornerstone of our continued economic growth.\u201d And Brewer is well liked in the business community. \u201cWe believe she\u2019s done more than any governor nationwide to improve the economic competitiveness in her state,\u201d said Garrick Taylor, a spokesman for the Arizona Chamber. \u201cWe know this governor always does what she believes is in the best interest of the state.\u201d And LGBT rights groups hope that her close ties with the business community is enough to persuade her to oppose it. \u201cThis is where we hope her pro-business stance will prevail,\u201d Rhoton said. Growing support Brewer is also facing growing support for a veto. Is same-sex marriage no longer a political issue? Public pressure is mounting. Another major protest took place Monday evening outside the state Capitol. Businesses are hanging signs in their windows that read \u201copen for business to everyone!\u201d Both Arizona senators, Republicans John McCain and Jeff Flake, have publicly urged Brewer to veto. And according to the local newspaper in Prescott, state Sen. Steve Pierce, who voted for the measure, is now urging Brewer to pick up her veto pen. While the measure is not about same-sex marriage, a likely indicator of where Arizonans stand on the SB1062 is a Behavior Research Center\u2019s Rocky Mountain Poll from last year. It found that a majority of Arizonans support same-sex marriage. Kim Fridkin, an Arizona State University professor of political science, noted that \u201cit\u2019s an extreme measure even for (conservative) Arizona.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll be viewed more reasonable than liberal\u201d if she vetoes it, Fridkin said. A spokesman for the NFL, which will host Super Bowl XLIX, in Glendale next February, said the league is watching developments in Arizona. \u201cOur policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard,\u201d Brian McCarthy said.

Both Obama and Boehner dropped high-profile initiatives to keep base happy For Boehner, his commitment to immigration reform was sacrificed Obama dropped his idea to tweak inflation adjustments for Social Security Both moves show a shift to election-year positioning We now know President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner agree on at least one thing: In 2014, keeping the political base happy matters more than advancing once-critical policy initiatives. For the GOP speaker, a personal commitment to big immigration changes, including a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers, was sacrificed after it became clear there would be a conservative revolt. The argument from the right: turning out conservatives is the key to 2014 midterm success, and big immigration changes would anger the base. And now the President\u2019s counter move: dropping from his new budget an idea he said was essential just a year ago \u2013 a more modest calculation of inflation adjustments for Social Security. Then, it was a critical piece of entitlement reform and deficit reduction. Now, the calculation is simple: liberals hate the idea, and pushing it in 2014 would anger a base the Democrats need in November. When Boehner retreated on immigration, it was the White House and its allies who said he was being shortsighted and putting politics ahead of the national interest. Inside Politics: Boehner says \u2018never mind\u2019 on immigration A Democratic civil war? Obama: GOP scared of immigration blowback Boehner: Wage increase will hurt people Now, the flipside, from Boehner\u2019s office: \u201cThe President has no interest in doing anything, even modest, to address our looming debt crisis. \u2026 With three years left in office, it seems the President is already throwing in the towel.\u201d A bit of hyperbole in that last part \u2013 and the speaker has his own immigration flip-flop as a lesson in context: the President on Social Security, just like the speaker on immigration, is only throwing in the towel for this year, hoping it puts him in a stronger position politically next year. A lot can happen between February and November, but the best bet at this early juncture is that Republicans keep their House majority. The battle for control of the Senate is the big 2014 struggle, and the President has made clear protecting the fragile Democratic majority there is his top priority. Organizations focused on deficit reduction and structural budget reforms applauded Obama when he embraced the Social Security shift last year \u2013 it is estimated to save $233 billion over a decade. Those same centrist organizations were quick to criticize his decision to abandon the Social Security change this year as a clear political shift left. \u201cThe withdrawal by the President on this specific issue, and his general pivot away from focusing on the nation\u2019s medium and long-term fiscal challenges, reflects a dangerous trend,\u201d the Campaign to Fix the Debt said in a statement after the White House outlined the budget proposal. CNNMoney: Obama drops controversial Social Security proposal The so-called \u201cchained CPI\u201d shift for Social Security will likely return as a debating point next year anyway, but Obama could face even more choices anathema to liberals if the GOP manages to take control of the Senate. What\u2019s the big deal about \u2018chained CPI\u2019? Mindful of the stakes, it\u2019s clear leadership in both parties is moving away from any environment of major policy compromise and toward full scale-election positioning. To that end, Obama on Tuesday attends a 2014 Organizing for Action summit. The organization is the grassroots offshoot of the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaign. The summit goal: try to defy the midterm historical odds and protect Democratic seats.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Gingrich calls Kerry \"delusional\" for climate change remarks President Obama follows through on promised climate change action Extreme weather always raises concern about the impact of climate change Decisions coming on limiting power plant emissions, building the Keystone pipeline In the space of 48 hours, Secretary of State John Kerry likened climate change to a weapon of mass destruction, Newt Gingrich called Kerry delusional, Sunday talk shows argued about it and President Barack Obama announced another executive action to combat it. After what seemed like a lull in political focus on the issue, why is everyone talking about it this week? A convergence of events and factors \u2013 blizzards in the East and drought out West, an administration acting on oft-stated intentions, the pending Keystone pipeline decision \u2013 have renewed debate on a topic that alternately captures attention or numbs the public. Here are five reasons why it is being discussed now: Gingrich defends Kerry resignation call The science behind our extreme weather Farmers facing drought disaster 1) Obama walks the talk The President had pledged action on climate change since before he entered the Oval Office five years ago, and he renewed his commitment in his second inaugural address as well as last month\u2019s State of the Union address. However, he spent his first-term political capital on stimulus programs in response to the recession and then health care reforms, instead of carbon cap legislation sought by his liberal base. Faced with relentless Republican opposition to his agenda in a divided Congress, Obama promised to take more executive action in 2014 to get around what Democrats call an obstructionist GOP strategy. He also brought on stronger voices for combating climate change, including Kerry, who became secretary of state last year, and John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who headed the liberal Center for American Progress think tank. \u201cBefore there were certainly many people in the administration, including the President, who had a public commitment to the notion of doing something about climate change,\u201d noted David Goldston, the director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a major environmental group. \u201cNow there\u2019s a plan. \u2026 They are ready to move.\u201d In his first term, Obama set tougher emissions standards for cars and trucks and on Tuesday, he instructed environmental and transportation agencies to work on the next round of higher gas mileage requirements for big trucks that he said comprise 4% of all vehicles on the road but cause 20% of their carbon pollution. The presidential moves don\u2019t require congressional approval, unlike a new $1 billion climate change preparedness fund that Obama proposed last week. With elections coming in November, congressional approval of such a funding proposal looks impossible. \u201cThere\u2019s no way on Earth he\u2019s going to get $1 billion out of this Congress to do anything, let alone fight climate change,\u201d USA Today columnist Kirsten Powers told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Climate change: 10 countries most at risk Explaining recurring weather patterns Expert: Sea levels make flooding worse Climate change, costing the Earth 2) Extreme weather Frigid temperatures and heavy snow up North, ice storms down South and drought out West instigated a new round of the now familiar debate over whether climate change causes such extreme weather. Opponents of aggressive action against climate change, such as Republicans protecting the oil and coal energy industries, question if any link to weather exists and how much human activity contributes to it. \u201cWhat we have to look at is the fact that you don\u2019t make good laws, sustainable laws when you\u2019re making them on hypotheses or theories or unproven sciences,\u201d GOP Rep. Marsha  Blackburn of Tennessee argued Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Her comment brought a sharp response from Bill Nye, known as the Science Guy from the PBS program. \u201cThere is no debate in the scientific community, and I can encourage the congresswoman to really look at the facts,\u201d Nye said on NBC. \u201cYou are a leader. We need you to change things, not deny what\u2019s happening.\u201d To Nye, the benefits from reducing carbon emissions should be obvious to anyone, whether or not they agree that climate change contributes to the increasing weather extremes. \u201cThe fewer very dirty coal-fired power plants we have, the better,\u201d he said. \u201cThe less energy we waste, the better. The less inefficient our transportation systems are, the better. The more reliable our electricity transmission systems are, the better.\u201d Powers, the USA Today columnist, said on Fox that the environmental lobby and the politicians supporting tougher climate change action should emphasize the benefits of reducing pollution, rather than talking about the weather. \u201cLess pollution is definitely a good thing, so that might be a better way to make the argument rather than claiming that climate change is the cause of every single thing that happens with the weather,\u201d she said. 3) Kerry\u2019s trip to climate change hotbeds On an extended trip to Asia, the longtime advocate for firm action to reduce carbon emissions went to two countries at the center of the debate \u2013 China and Indonesia. China is the world\u2019s biggest carbon emitter, with the United States close behind, and the two global powers have so far balked at working out new global emissions limits as part of an international climate change treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. Last week, Kerry announced in Beijing that the two nations would work together on efforts to \u201cmove the climate change process forward\u201d in advance of the next major global climate change conference \u2013 in France in 2015. On Sunday, he delivered one of the strongest speeches on climate change by any American official while visiting Indonesia, which has lost more than 40% of its tropical forests that store carbon absorbed from the atmosphere. Anyone still arguing against the reality of climate change was \u201csimply burying their heads in the sand,\u201d Kerry said, adding that he and President Obama \u201cbelieve very deeply that we do not have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society.\u201d In one sense, he continued, \u201cclimate change can now be considered another weapon of mass destruction, perhaps the world\u2019s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.\u201d Kerry also called it \u201cthe greatest challenge of our generation.\u201d His speech evoked a protest from Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker and GOP presidential candidate, who posted on Twitter that \u201cevery American who cares about national security must demand\u201d Kerry\u2019s resignation, adding that \u201ca delusional secretary of state is dangerous to our safety.\u201d \u201cThis is not some U.S. senator just having some wild speech to please the left,\u201d Gingrich, a host of CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire,\u201d said Tuesday. He argued that Kerry, a former senator who now is the top U.S. diplomat, should be held to a \u201chigher level of seriousness.\u201d Kerry: Climate change as big a threat as terrorism, poverty, WMDs 4) Keystone decision pending A Republican attack on Kerry comes as no surprise, because as secretary of state, he will make his department\u2019s decision on whether to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada that has become a political lightning rod. The issue has loomed for years, prompting supporters of the project to accuse the Obama administration of stalling to appease his liberal base. It pits the oil industry and its Republican backers against environmentalists and liberal Democrats who complain the project bolsters the especially dirty fossil fuel production from the tar sands of northern Alberta. However, the politics get messy for Democrats, because organized labor supports the project that will create several thousand jobs. Kerry\u2019s history makes it appear highly unlikely he would approve the pipeline project, but the final call will certainly come from Obama. His chief of staff, Denis McDonough, recently said a decision would likely take months while the full review process plays out. Republicans impatient with what they consider to be a political stall, now until after the congressional elections in November, have urged Obama to use his executive authority to approve the project. U.S. report on Keystone indicates little climate impact 5) It\u2019s an election year Election-year politics always harden positions, and the bitter partisan divide in Washington means little chance for progress on any major initiatives such as immigration reform or deficit reduction. In that political environment, climate change becomes an easy issue for either side to use to attack the other. Goldston of the NRDC noted that another major environmental decision is likely in 2014 \u2013 the administration\u2019s new limits on carbon emissions for existing power plants. Under Obama, the EPA in January proposed new rules for emission levels at future plants, which opponents called an effort to prevent additional coal-fired power plants from being built. A further step to also limit emissions from existing plants, which is expected as soon as June, could shut some of them down and would certainly inflame the debate. \u201cAll this stuff has been in the works,\u201d Goldston said, noting that such administrative steps get opponents \u201cmore publicly active\u201d and spawns more raucous exchanges. \u201cObviously, controversy gets attention,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all part and parcel of forward movement on the policy side.\u201d U.S. sets up \u2018climate hubs\u2019 to help rural communities affected by extreme weather CNN\u2019s Steve Almasy, Kevin Liptak and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

If the White House is hosting the big dance, Latinos are holding the guest list at the door, and if a candidate isn\u2019t on the VIP list, there will be no fiesta in the Oval Office. But how do you get an invitation? It is a question that has baffled many contenders-in-chief, Republicans in particular, in recent years. Granted, it is no easy task. For one, there is no one size fits all strategy. Latinos are not monolithic. There are great socioeconomic, educational, cultural and demographic variations that exist both between and within Latino ethnic groups. An approach that might work with Dominicans may not fly with Colombians. A sombrero and a pava jibaro may both be hats, but beware if a candidate wears the wrong one to the Mexican Independence Day Festival or the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Here is what some folks have done, and refrained from doing, to win the seemingly coy, not easily cajoled, Latino vote. Call it, if you will, \u201cThe politician\u2019s guide to wooing Latinos.\u201d Learn Espa\u00f1ol \u201cHola Newo Yorko! El stormo grande is mucho dangeroso,\u201d read the first tweet from @ElBloombito, a popular parody account aimed at poking fun at former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Spanish speaking alter ego, Miguel Bloombito. Bloomberg, a Republican turned independent, was frequently lampooned for his Spanish pronunciation, or lack thereof.  Yet, despite his frequently mangled, oftentimes hilarious, attempts at communicating with the city\u2019s Spanish-speaking residents, Bloomberg found a way to connect. Latino New Yorkers didn\u2019t always agree with the policies of the billionaire, outspoken mayor, but they appreciated his efforts and found them endearing. \u201cThere was nothing funnier than Bloomberg having a press conference in Spanish,\u201d said Luis Miranda, a managing partner at MirRam Group, a political consulting firm, \u201cbut now it\u2019s the standard for mayoral press conferences in NYC.\u201d Despite an overwhelmingly Democratic electorate, Latinos in 2009 gave Bloomberg almost half the vote in an unexpectedly close race against Democrat William Thompson Jr. \u201cLatinos, even those that are English dominant, see it as a sign of \u2018respeto\u2019,\u201d meaning respect, Miranda said. \u201cA couple of words in Spanish can go a long way; fluency is gold!\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus also recently noted that speaking Spanish, while not essential, would certainly be a bonus for any 2016 presidential candidate. He announced that the GOP is willing to spend $10 million to reach Latino voters. A word of caution, however: Use this strategy wisely. You can\u2019t just put a sweater on a Chihuahua, call it Tequila and get a sexy Latina to comment on your man parts, even if she does it in Espa\u00f1ol. California Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Donnelly and the Latina actress he featured in a controversial campaign ad that did just that only managed to get an onslaught of criticism from the Latino community. Get to know the familia Latinos tend to have strong family bonds. Most family gatherings center around food and usually the entire clan shows up, invited or not. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that during New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign, he spent a lot of time in Union City, home to the state\u2019s largest Hispanic population. Whether it was sipping a cortadito Cubano, taking voter questions or announcing a major initiative at many of the area\u2019s restaurants, Christie aggressively pursued Latinos and found a meaningful way to get their vote: show up, listen and always answer \u201csi\u201d when someone offers a caf\u00e9cito. Christie won 51% of the Latino vote,  a 19% improvement over four years, to defeat Democrat Barbara Buono and her Hispanic running mate in a Democratic-leaning state. \u201cThe most successful candidates show up in Hispanic communities and don\u2019t wait for campaign season to begin. Christie worked on Latino engagement for years,\u201d said Bob Quasius, president of the national Latino group Caf\u00e9 Con Leche Republicans. After his victory, Christie said, \u201cFind me another Republican who\u2019s won the Latino vote recently. It\u2019s about the relationships.\u201d So much so that, despite the recent scandals that have rocked Christie\u2019s administration, most Latinos say that for now, they\u2019re sticking by the Republican governor. At the opposite end of the spectrum, however, is \u201cTaco Mayor\u201d Joseph Maturo of East Haven, Connecticut, who taught us all a lesson on how not to incorporate food into a discussion about Latinos. When asked what he would do for the Hispanic community after four East Haven police officers were arrested for discrimination and abuse against Latinos, Maturo responded, \u201cI might have tacos when I go home, I\u2019m not quite sure yet.\u201d A few days later, offended community groups delivered hundreds of tacos to his office. Speak to the corazon So, now that you\u2019ve shown up and picked up a few key Spanish phrases, it is time to speak to the heart. \u201cFor Latinos, immigration is an issue \u2018prendido en nuestro corazon\u2019 (or \u2018pinned to our hearts\u2019),\u201d Miranda said. A majority of Latinos are either immigrants themselves or one or two generations removed. Immigrants and their children are expected to make up as much as 93% of the U.S. working-age population growth between now and 2050, according to a 2008 report by the Pew Research Center. Thus, a successful suitor, er, politician, will be one who speaks to this emotional issue. \u201cI predict that any candidate that does not support an immigration bill that creates a path to citizenship will fail to make inroads into the Latino electorate,\u201d Miranda said. In 2012, President Barack Obama made immigration reform a focus of his campaign and introduced initiatives that eased deportation policies for young undocumented immigrants. That year, he won 72% of the Latino vote, though lately the President has gotten flak for failing to deliver on comprehensive immigration reform and for deporting nearly 2 million people since taking office. Republicans, however, have struggled, mostly by allowing the most conservative wing of their party to control the message. \u201cA small minority of Republicans uses rhetoric about immigration that alienates many Hispanic voters, and because this minority is particularly shrill, they are often perceived as the voice of the GOP,\u201d Quasius said. It was George W. Bush, the last Republican president to win a significant share of the Latino vote, who set the standard for capturing the hearts of Latinos. In 2004, he outlined a comprehensive immigration initiative that was the perfect balance between immigration law and human compassion. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be content with laws that punish hardworking people,\u201d Bush said then, \u201cIt\u2019s time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers \u2026 rejects amnesty \u2026 and closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.\u201d This, coupled with a massive \u201cViva Bush\u201d Latino outreach campaign, has today\u2019s GOP leaders reaching for the George W. playbook. With that said, however, expressing deep concern for the plight of immigrants shouldn\u2019t come with an invitation to self-deport, as former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney suggested. Romney got the lowest share of the Latino vote of any GOP presidential candidate since 1996, 27%. Watch out with \u201ccon quien andas\u2026\u201d There is a popular phrase in Spanish that says, \u201cDime con qui\u00e9n andas y te dir\u00e9 qui\u00e9n eres,\u201d which means, \u201cJudge a man by the company he keeps.\u201d Solely mastering the first three steps is not enough, as evidenced by Cuban-American Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. At first glance, he seems to be the perfect date for the dance: speaks Spanish, probably enjoys a good plate of pernil (Cuban style-roasted pork) and recently has lent support to immigration reform. It doesn\u2019t hurt that he has devilish good looks and boyish charm, either. Yet Latinos have not been able to fully embrace Rubio. He was a darling of the tea party and at times has adopted positions that Latinos consider extreme on issues of concern to them and has prompted many to label him a traitor. Presente.org, a Hispanic advocacy organization, formed an online campaign called \u201cNo Somos Rubios\u201d (\u201cWe Are Not Rubios\u201d). And, Latino bloggers have nicknamed Rubio Mark Blond. Rubio is also the Spanish word for blond. Before lending support to an immigration reform bill, Rubio opposed measures that would not first secure the border and more strictly enforce the laws already in place. He has also supported initiatives that promote English as the country\u2019s official language. \u201cThe people you associate with is key in politics. You want to be associated with respected Latino leaders and validators of our community,\u201d  Miranda said. Some say, however, that Latinos can shake images of Rubio living it up at tea party rallies in time for the next election. \u201cRubio only recently appeared on the national stage but has shown terrific leadership on immigration reform. We believe he\u2019ll gain traction among Hispanic voters if he enters the race and becomes better known,\u201d said Quasius. Rubio also has shown signs of breaking with the tea party, which recently called Rubio a sellout for his central role in an immigration reform bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. A Judas to Latinos and a double-crosser to tea partiers. Who will Rubio choose as his dance partner? That\u2019s yet to be seen. Vive la vida Lastly, vive la vida, which simply means have some fun. Politicians have few opportunities to show off a more relaxed, fiesta-loving side, but voters seem to value these genuine, unrehearsed moments. Take Hillary Clinton, for example. In the throes of an uncertain, possibly dwindling  presidential primary campaign in 2008, she headed to Puerto Rico. Obama was polling ahead of the former first lady in most of the remaining key states, so Clinton decided to shed her traditional pantsuit, throw on a festive top and groove to a lively salsa beat and toasted to her newfound amigos. That same weekend, Obama was also on the island but spent his time shaking hands, praising veterans and marching with supporters. Clinton, on the other hand, quite literally let her hair down, immersed herself in local culture and gave everyone a glimpse of her human side.  Although she didn\u2019t win in the long run, she claimed a 2-1 primary victory over Obama among Hispanic voters both on the island and the mainland. The key here, though, is to keep it classy. When former New York Democratic mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner headed to last year\u2019s Dominican Day Parade in a guayabera \u2013 a men\u2019s shirt popular in Latin America \u2013 and bright red pants while running around with a bullhorn, he was largely dismissed as ridiculous. There is such a thing as trying too hard, and in Weiner\u2019s case, actually wearing pants should not have been what got \u201cCarlos\u201d in danger.",

The next day, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and 11 GOP colleagues voted with the Democratic majority to reject an attempted filibuster of the same legislation by fellow Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Minutes later, all 12 of the GOP senators who helped defeat the filibuster bid voted with Cruz and the rest of the Senate Republicans against final approval of the debt-ceiling plan, which passed anyway due to unanimous Democratic support. Is Cruz leading GOP 'cannibalism?' In other words, Republican leaders in Congress sided with Democrats to push through legislation opposed by most of their colleagues. In the Senate, they then voted against the proposal that their earlier support ensured would pass. Senate passes debt-ceiling plan in blow to tea party Election year politics Here\u2019s the really strange part \u2013 it all makes sense, at least in the context of a divided Republican Party less than nine months before congressional elections in which every House seat and 36 of the 100 Senate seats will be contested. The situations in the House and Senate differed in specifics but shared a common root \u2013 more extreme conservatives foiled plans by GOP leaders to avoid a politically damaging showdown over the debt ceiling while still registering Republican opposition to increased federal borrowing. According to public statements, nobody wanted another debt-ceiling stalemate like those of the past three years that unsettled financial markets and caused the first downgrade of the U.S. credit rating in 2011. A recent CNN/ORC International poll found that 54% of respondents would blame congressional Republicans for a failure to raise the debt ceiling, while 29% would blame President Barack Obama and 12% would blame both. Fresh memories of public blame for the 16-day government shutdown in October also motivated Republican leaders to try to steer clear of another standoff. However, conservative disdain for anything smelling of more federal borrowing \u2013 especially in an election year \u2013 torpedoed Boehner\u2019s efforts to forge a compromise that would include some deficit-reduction provisions. Boehner\u2019s dilemma His final attempt was to tack on a politically popular proposal that repealed cuts to military pensions in the recent budget agreement. When Boehner\u2019s caucus rejected it, the Ohioan decided to violate his own rule by holding a vote on a \u201cclean\u201d debt-ceiling plan with no accompanying spending cuts, which passed on Tuesday because of strong Democratic support. The House result offered McConnell a face-saving chance to avoid any Senate Republicans from having to vote for the debt-ceiling measure. He and other GOP leaders urged their colleagues to let Democrats pass the House version while Republicans opposed it, but Cruz\u2019s filibuster bid meant that at least five GOP votes would be needed to prevent another Washington impasse. In a dramatic moment Wednesday on the Senate floor, McConnell and fellow GOP leader Sen. John Cornyn of Texas cast the two votes needed to reach the threshold of 60 to overcome the filibuster attempt. Other GOP colleagues then changed their votes to provide some political cover, but the damage was done. Both McConnell and Cornyn \u2013 longtime conservatives considered Obama\u2019s harshest Senate foes \u2013 face primary challenges from further to the right this year. Shortly after Wednesday\u2019s votes, the campaign of McConnell\u2019s primary opponent in Kentucky, tea party conservative Matt Bevin, highlighted how the senator helped defeat the filibuster against the debt limit measure. Boehner says \u2018never mind\u2019 on immigration Political pragmatism Some GOP colleagues praised Boehner and McConnell for putting party welfare ahead of personal political risk. \u201cIt was a very courageous act, especially Sen. McConnell, who we all know is in a very tough race,\u201d said GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, one of the Republicans who changed his vote to help overcome the filibuster bid. \u201cHe\u2019s the elected Republican leader and it\u2019s up to him to cast the right vote.\u201d Fellow Republican Sen. Mike Johanns of Nebraska said the debt-ceiling issue had to be resolved to prevent harmful financial and political fallout. \u201cThat\u2019s just the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can deal with it with 60 votes or a majority, but at the end of the day, you had to deal with it.\u201d Cruz was unapologetic, attacking his fellow Republicans and Democrats as unresponsive to the rising federal debt. \u201cToday was a classic victory for Washington establishment interests, and the people who lost today were the American people,\u201d he said. As expected, Democrats offered a different assessment. \u201cA real civil war\u201d \u201cIt is encouraging that some of my Republican colleagues seem to be regaining their grip on sanity this week,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said before Wednesday\u2019s votes, while fellow Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri told MSNBC that Republicans have \u201ca real civil war on their hands.\u201d \u201cThey have rigid ideologues that are pushing a very narrow agenda, a very narrow view of what America is, and then they\u2019ve got a lot of Republicans that are not that extreme, and they\u2019re in a big battle right now,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you see it every day around here.\u201d To CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, Cruz put his own agenda of appealing to the tea party right ahead of the GOP leadership\u2019s strategy. She noted he did the same thing to cause last year\u2019s government shutdown by trying to link federal spending to efforts to dismantle Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms, which conservatives detest. Republicans still smarting from that defeat \u201care looking at Ted Cruz today and going, \u2018Oh my God, didn\u2019t you learn the lesson of the government shutdown?\u2019\u201d Borger said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s about him.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Ted Barrett and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "John King and a panel of top political reporters look at the prospects for immigration reform in an election year on \u201cInside Politics \u201d on Sunday at 8:30 a.m. ET. A week ago, House Speaker Boehner said he wanted to try to act on immigration On Thursday, Boehner said it wouldn't happen this year Trust gap between Republicans and White House won't close in election year Immigration debate between House Republicans would give Democrats a weapon Whatever you think of his politics, House Speaker John Boehner has a great sense of humor. So perhaps he won\u2019t mind the question framed this way: What happened, in the course of just one week, to make Speaker Boehner the Miss Emily Litella of immigration reform? (If I have lost you already, take a moment and search the Web to understand the reference \u2013 you won\u2019t regret it.) \u201cNever mind,\u201d was the trademark closing line of a character the late Gilda Radner made famous as a cast member on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d And \u201cnever mind,\u201d is what Speaker Boehner might just as well have said Thursday when he all but declared the immigration reform legislative debate dead for 2014. \u201cListen, there\u2019s widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws,\u201d Boehner told reporters, suggesting White House executive actions to change provisions of the health care law had many conservatives worried the administration wouldn\u2019t feel bound by any immigration legislation passed by Congress. Is immigration reform dead? A tale of two districts Gov. Jindal: Secure the border first Citing that trust deficit, the Speaker added: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes.\u201d There is without a doubt deep mistrust of the Obama White House in the Republican congressional ranks. But is that mistrust any greater than just a week ago? Of course not, and it was just a week ago that the same Speaker Boehner said this of the same immigration debate: \u201cThis problem has been around for at least the last 15 years, it\u2019s been turned into a political football. I think it\u2019s unfair, so I think it\u2019s time to deal with it.\u201d To be fair, the Speaker a week ago was candid about the disagreements and skepticism within the Republican ranks \u2013 and among Republican base voters critical to 2014 midterm success. \u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d he said a week ago, \u201cdoing immigration reform in a common sense, step by step manner helps our members understand the bite size pieces and helps our constituents build more confidence that what we\u2019re doing makes sense.\u201d But to that point, again just a week ago, the word from House GOP leadership aides was that Boehner wanted to try to see if the House could act this year. And President Obama tried to create some space for compromise, angering some liberals by telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper he would not prejudge the final product \u2013 opening the door to accepting a measure that provided legal status, but not a fast track, to citizenship for the estimated 11\u00bd million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Now, it appears testing that spirit of compromise will have to wait until 2015 or beyond. What changed in a week? Nothing, say key Boehner lieutenants. They insist people, primarily immigration activists and the media, read too much into what the Speaker said a week ago. House leaders outline immigration plan Obama: GOP made progress on immigration GOP sell out of Tea Party? \u201cNothing \u2018happened\u2019 per se,\u201d a top Boehner aide said in an e-mail exchange. \u201cWe just got started and getting started requires taking a sober view at the challenges that we face. All he did today was outline the challenges we need to overcome.\u201d Those challenges \u2013 the trust deficit as outlined by the Speaker \u2013 are most unlikely to be overcome in a heated election year. Veteran GOP strategist Alex Castellanos, who for years has been urging the GOP to act on immigration, said the politics behind Boehner\u2019s shift were easy to understand. \u201cNothing the House would do would ever become law,\u201d Castellanos said \u2013 meaning that even if the House passed something, it was unlikely that differences with the Senate could be worked out this year. So a House debate now, Castellanos said, \u201cwould divide Republicans and become a political weapon Democrats could use against Republicans in 2014.\u201d There is no doubt a vocal slice of the House GOP conference was against acting on immigration this year \u2013 arguing their biggest priority is turning out conservative base voters, many of whom view even legal status as amnesty. And on the Senate side, GOP leader Mitch McConnell had already served notice he had little appetite for revisiting the issue in that chamber before the election. Not only does McConnell face a tea party primary challenge but, as we illustrated last Sunday on \u201cInside Politics,\u201d most GOP strategists see action on immigration this year \u2013 whatever the long-term good it might do Republicans \u2013 as potentially harmful to GOP prospects this year. The raw politics behind that view: In the 11 states where Senate seats now held by Democrats that are top GOP 2014 targets, conservative turnout is critical and the Latino population tiny to small. (West Virginia is lowest with just a 1% Latino population; North Carolina is the highest at 9%.) \u201cMcConnell saying it wasn\u2019t going to get done \u2013 burst the balloon,\u201d said GOP strategist Ana Navarro, another voice who consistently stresses the urgency of acting on the immigration issue, yet sees the short-term political rationale of waiting. So does Castellanos, again despite his longer-term worries about the GOP and the Latino vote. \u201cRight now, the spotlight is center stage on the Democrats, the President and Obamacare,\u201d said Castellanos. \u201cAnd the GOP wants to do nothing to distract from that, certainly not start a food fight on immigration.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In the 2016 election, the GOP could present a more diverse cadre of presidential hopefuls By contrast, the presumed Democratic likely frontrunners are older and white GOP focused on diversity after it lost big among minorities in 2012 Though their candidates are diverse, the party still has work to do in minority voter outreach Take a look at the more diverse slate of potential 2016 Republican presidential contenders and one thing becomes quite clear: this is not your daddy\u2019s GOP \u2013 at the top anyway. There are Latino Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas. There is an Indian American: Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. And joining Jindal, Rubio and Cruz from the Generation X ranks are Gov. Scott Walker and Rep. Paul Ryan, both of Wisconsin. Boomers potentially in the mix include Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Sen. Rand Paul of Texas and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Three out of the past four Republican nominees were all well into their 60s, while the Democrats over the same period went with younger candidates. Now look: Democrats are taking a page from Ronald Reagan, the oldest president ever on Inauguration Day at 69. Hillary Clinton would be that age on Election Day 2016, if she runs and wins, while Vice President Joe Biden might be considered historically \u201cyoung\u201d for a senator at 73 at the same point, but breaking new ground for the Oval Office. Both are quite pale, too, and so is most of \u201cthe bench\u201d of the party that embraced history in 2008 and nominated the first African American for President in Barack Obama, who was at the time merely in his 40s. GOP race for 2016 is wide open \u201cDemocrats are known as having great policies (for minorities) on paper, but it\u2019s harder to rise through the ranks,\u201d said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. \u201cThe Republicans don\u2019t have great policies on paper, but they are often more supportive of their minority candidates.\u201d Obama\u2019s election meant that many of the Democratic old guard, folks like Clinton and Biden, had to bide their time and wait until the next cycle. But his time around people like Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick are barely a consideration, she said. \u201cIf you want to present something different, young, charismatic black guy isn\u2019t it,\u201d Gillespie said. The Republican Party was blasted during the 2012 presidential election as the party of old, white, men for their presidential and congressional candidate lineups. The GOP lost among young people, minorities and women in large numbers and was forced to do some serious soul searching in preparation for the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential elections. GOP problem: \u2018Their voters are white, aging and dying off\u2019 House Republicans split on immigration GOP struggles to redefine itself Is the Republican party leaderless? But even as the Republican Party was taking a beating over its lack of diversity and tin ear on issues important to minorities, a class of young guns who more closely resembled the broader American electorate made headlines for their edgier brand of conservatism. \u201cThese candidates have been very shrewd and extremely media savvy and have been able to garner a lot of attention very quickly,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cIt\u2019s partly their own skill and being in the right place at the right time. But it\u2019s also the Republican Party not wanting to look like the party of old white men.\u201d As a tea party darling, Rubio has earned nods from conservative corners for his criticism of Obamacare, but is also seen as a more moderate voice in the debate over immigration reform. Cruz and Paul rode that same anti-establishment, tea party wave into Congress and have since garnered attention for their fiery rhetoric about the ills of big government and willingness to challenge the status quo. Christie rose to prominence because of his swaggering conservative style tempered by his willingness to reach across the aisle in his state. He made a splash, too, by giving Obama and his administration credit on Superstorm Sandy recovery efforts. Meanwhile, Santorum, Ryan, Jindal and Walker\u2019s clear and direct conservative approach to fiscal and governance matters is seen in right wing circles as a refreshing change from what some in the Republican Party have felt is a watered down version. \u201cThe fact that the Democrats don\u2019t have the depth of diverse talent like the Republicans do might be an indication that, despite what they might have you believe, their party is old and stale,\u201d said Orlando Watson, the Republican National Committee communications director for black media. RNC highlights strategy for building \u2018new generation of black Republicans\u2019 The slate of potential 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls\u2014and to be clear, no one on either side of the aisle has officially announced a bid\u2014may be younger and more diverse. But the broader party is still too old, too white and too out of touch with the rest of America, said Lionel Sosa, a veteran Latino GOP strategist who has helped advise candidates since 1980. \u201cI think our party is stone deaf on the issue of Latinos and immigration. We\u2019re turning off not only Latinos, but also women, young people and Asians with stupid, intensive comments,\u201d Sosa said. He pointed to anti-immigration comments by recent Republican candidates and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\u2019s comments about Democrats thinking women \u201ccan\u2019t control their libidos\u201d as \u201cequally stupid.\u201d \u201cGOP candidates who cater to the extreme right in the primaries, don\u2019t realize the long term damage they\u2019re doing to the Republican brand in terms of alienating the segment of voters who are growing the fastest,\u201d Sosa said. \u201cThis damage will be hard to overcome in the general election.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Two neighboring California Republicans represent the GOP's challenge on immigration Rep. Jeff Denham backs immigration reform while Rep. Tom McClintock is fighting it An estimated 2 \u00bd million of the 11 million undocumented immigrants live in California House Speaker John Boehner recently unveiled immigration principles to his caucus The similarities are plentiful. Both congressmen are Republican. Both represent central California \u2013 their districts share a border. Both are recently elected to Congress. Both have outspoken positions on immigration reform. And that\u2019s where the similarities end. Republican v. Republican Rep. Jeff Denham, who represents California\u2019s 10th Congressional District, is actively lobbying his Republican colleagues to get on board behind immigration legislation that includes a path to legalization. \u201cThe entire system is broken,\u201d Denham said in a recent interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a big issue for our nation. It is a big issue for California and for my home district.\u201d But Denham\u2019s views don\u2019t cross district lines. His congressional neighbor and fellow Republican, Rep. Tom McClintock, couldn\u2019t disagree more. While his 4th District is next to Denham\u2019s, a wide gap exists between the two on this issue. \u201cWe have a path to citizenship and it\u2019s a path that has been followed by millions of legal immigrants who have obeyed all of our laws,\u201d McClintock said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to have 11 to 20 million illegal immigrants cut in line ahead of them.\u201d House leaders outline immigration plan Gov. Jindal: Secure the border first GOP sell out of Tea Party? Denham was the first Republican to come out in favor of comprehensive legislation. He signed on to the Democrats\u2019 proposal, which includes a path to legalization for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the country. It\u2019s a controversial position within Republican circles. In his first week back in Washington after the holiday break, Denham got right to work. He met with 20 Republican members to hash out their differences on immigration. But McClintock is working on his own immigration campaign. He vowed to \u201cspeak out at every opportunity\u201d in opposition to a path to legalization. John King: Obama at odds with himself on immigration Boehner\u2019s haul Denham and McClintock epitomize the challenge that lies before House Speaker John Boehner regarding immigration reform \u2013 a divided party with divergent views on immigration. The establishment and moderate components of the party want to overhaul the immigration system because it\u2019s broken and because it would help a party unpopular with the fastest-growing segment of the population. Meanwhile, conservatives know what\u2019s popular with the base \u2013 and in their district. The principles Boehner unveiled at last week\u2019s Republican retreat sought a middle ground \u2013 a path to legalization but not citizenship, and only after those already in the country get in the back of the line and the federal government provides proof that work is continuing to secure the border. So close yet so far About 2\u00bd million of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country are in California. So how did two vocal Republicans, both from central California, emerge with such different positions? Their districts help tell the story. McClintock represents a predominately Republican district, which overwhelmingly voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. His district is 78% white and wealthy, with residents earning a median income of more than $61,000 per year. James Lai, Santa Clara University associate professor of ethnic studies, describes McClintock\u2019s district as the \u201cwhite flight\u201d  district, meaning that wealthier, older, white residents move to the Sacramento suburbs or Lake Tahoe to retire or get away from congested urban areas. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many districts like that in California,\u201d Lai said of the profile of McClintock\u2019s district, which allows him to have a conservative, anti-immigration position. Denham\u2019s district, which is adjacent to McClintock\u2019s, is so close in proximity yet so far in ideology. Denham represents \u201cthe nation\u2019s salad bowl,\u201d an agriculture mecca that supplies much of the country\u2019s produce. Forty percent of the residents are Latino and only 47% voted for Romney. McClintock and Denham \u201creflect the complex topography of California, but at the same time, their positions are reflected in their constituents,\u201d Lai said. Re-election at stake While McClintock coasted to victory, Denham had a tough re-election bid 2012 and could have another tough race against a Democrat in 2014, a threat that could be compounded if Republicans fail to act. Denham\u2019s constituents are very aware. Many of them are agriculture workers, and they and their families are directly impacted by any action \u2013 or inaction \u2013 on immigration. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in my own home district where families have been torn apart,\u201d Denham said, describing the current maze of immigration laws and enforcement. Once fearing deportation, immigrant among first lady\u2019s guests Republican Party leaders are acutely aware, acknowledging that the party must address the issue to prevent becoming irrelevant as Latinos and Asians grow to a larger percentage of the electorate. But in a deeply divided Congress, with more than 200 safe Republicans, immigration is hardly worth upsetting the base. McClintock says his view is in line with his constituents\u2019. \u201cI can tell you the sentiment in my district is very strongly for the rule of law and assuring that those who come to our country come with the intention of becoming Americans,\u201d he said. A difficult race for McClintock is much more likely from a primary challenger than from a Democrat. Rosemary Jenks, executive director of Numbers USA, a group that favors a reduction of immigration, said McClintock is more in line with Republican voters\u2019 views. \u201cI think the majority of Republicans understand that their constituents do not want this and can\u2019t afford this,\u201d she added. Special interest support Jenks said Republican leaders are being pushed by business groups who want institutionalized cheap labor. The California Chamber of Commerce has been active, pushing Republicans to get on board with immigration reform. Like the national Chamber of Commerce, the California outpost has sent letters to the California delegation, held news conferences and lobbied Congress. \u201cThis is so important to California\u2019s economy. This is more important here than anywhere else,\u201d CalChamber President and CEO Allan Zaremberg said in July. \u201c(California\u2019s representatives) can\u2019t let somebody else, who doesn\u2019t have a stake in this, determine the outcome.\u201d But giving McClintock cover, however, is the local chapter of the Chamber.  Michael Ayala, CEO of the Tuolomne County Chamber, located in California\u2019s 4th District, says immigration isn\u2019t a priority for county residents. \u201cIf the federal government would enforce existing law, we wouldn\u2019t have the problems we currently have,\u201d Ayala said, a position that McClintock echoes. Work in Washington While Denham might be a minority in his caucus, that minority might have the momentum. States take the lead in immigration game House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has been advocating his KIDS Act proposal to address the status of children of parents who came to the country illegally. And Boehner unveiled Republican principles last week, an indication that he is testing the waters on possibly moving an immigration bill this year. Denham called discussions at the Republican retreat productive and said he\u2019s pleased that Boehner floated a starting point. He\u2019s trying to convince McClintock and like-minded Republicans that the United States has \u201cde facto amnesty\u201d and that the Republican Party should \u201cfix the system.\u201d McClintock doesn\u2019t seem likely to buy it. \u201cThe Republican Party has always stood for the rule of law and it has welcomed legal immigrants to the country with the desire to come and be Americans and I believe we should continue to do so,\u201d he said. The tale of two Republicans will have an ending. It\u2019s just unclear what it will be.",

Are Democrats embarrassed of Obama? Will Sen Mark Udall campaign with Obama? Tapper: \u201cIt\u2019s possible that you might be able to get an immigration reform bill on your desk that has legal status for the millions of undocumented workers who are in this country, but not citizenship. Would you veto that?\u201d Obama: \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m not going to prejudge what gets to my desk.\u201d CNN exclusive: Obama says he\u2019s not recalibrating expectations On its own, maybe that\u2019s just a conciliatory tone so as not to become part of the GOP\u2019s debate about immigration. But the timing makes the President\u2019s open mind more significant. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi just Wednesday said of the immigration debate: \u201cIn our caucus there has to be a path of citizenship.\u201d And speaking to The Washington Post, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, whose unions are vital to Democratic midterm campaign chances, said of a GOP plan that provides legal status but not a guaranteed path to citizenship for illegal immigrants: \u201cIt\u2019s a joke. It\u2019s a hoax, is what it is. It\u2019s like fool\u2019s gold.\u201d So Obama is now on record saying he won\u2019t prejudge an idea that is a nonstarter to the top House Democrat and a \u201cjoke\u201d to organized labor. And he is not only at odds with those two traditional allies \u2013 he is at odds with himself. A year ago, speaking in Las Vegas, the President laid out his bottom line: \u201cFor comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship,\u201d he said then. Obama: Time to fix immigration system Reid: Dems shoudn't fear Obama Obama: GOP made progress on immigration The President\u2019s refusal to draw a veto line on the citizenship question will make his liberal base anxious, and those tensions could hurt in an election year. Frustrated liberals start to look beyond Obama But whether liberal disappointment now turns into a political problem closer to Election Day depends in large part on whether Republicans can test the President\u2019s openness by getting a bill to his desk. And that remains a giant question mark. Speaker John Boehner wants the House to pass, in several pieces, immigration changes that would include citizenship for so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2013 younger undocumented people who were brought illegally into the United States by their parents \u2013 but guarantee only legal status for older undocumented individuals. House Republican leaders unveil immigration standards If the House were to act, it would then need to try to reconcile its ideas with already passed Senate legislation. Democrats control the Senate, and finding common ground, again assuming the House acts, likely would prove difficult. But, for now, the biggest question is whether the House will act. Boehner not only believes the changes are good economic policy, he also is trying to help his party deal with a Latino voter crisis that significantly complicates any Republican White House aspirations. The State of the Union in 2 minutes CNN's exclusive Obama interview Ryan to Obama: Go through Congress But many Republican members of Congress are worried more about their 2014 races and angering the conservative base, whose turnout is critical in the midterm environment. Most House Republicans believe any immigration debate distracts attention from Obamacare. And on the Senate side, there is less urgency as well because of the states the GOP is targeting in its effort to retake control. The 11 seats now held by Democrats that are the top GOP targets have relatively small Latino populations. But in each of those, conservative GOP base turnout would be critical if the race is close come November. The speaker understands that he is at center stage at the moment, and that any chance to see the Democratic immigration tensions in full force depends on whether the House can first advance something meaningful. \u201cIt\u2019s been turned into a political football,\u201d the speaker said Thursday of the immigration debate. \u201cSo I think it is time to deal with it. But how we deal with it is going to be critically important.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Obama's road show informally launches the mid-term election campaign Obama sounds themes benefiting Democrats in his State of the Union address The goal: highlight differences with Republicans on issues important to ordinary Americans Both parties seek to strengthen their support among women voters Equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage, immigration reform, combating climate change and virtually swearing off extended wars. All are catnip for the political left, and all were highlighted by President Barack Obama this week as he informally launched the November election campaign for 36 Senate seats and a new House of Representatives. By flying the Democratic banner so high in Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address and subsequent road show to four states, Obama tried to signal unity with his liberal base and provide the party\u2019s candidates with ammunition for elections certain to be \u201cspirited\u201d \u2013 the Washington euphemism for fierce and nasty. \u201cThe president wants to highlight differences between the parties and show that Democrats are on the side of ordinary people,\u201d said Darrell West, the vice president for governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThat\u2019s how he won in 2012, and that\u2019s the strategy in 2014.\u201d Exclusive: Obama: Companies pledge help for long-term jobless Obama: End 'Mad Men' workplace policies Focus on women, minorities Hence the emphasis on policies that benefit women and minorities and appeal to younger voters. On Tuesday and in subsequent speeches in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Tennessee, Obama called for equal pay for women and made sure to include references to the popular first lady. \u201cWhen women succeed America succeeds,\u201d he said Thursday in Waukesha, Wisconsin. \u201cAnd by the way, when women succeed, men succeed.  I don\u2019t know about all the guys here, but you know when Michelle is doing good and happy, I am happy, too. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019.\u201d The President also called in his State of the Union speech for raising the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10, taking the first step himself by announcing he will unilaterally give the raise to workers under federal contracts. Republicans oppose the move in allegiance to their business supporters. According to Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller, Obama is focusing \u201con all the things that can help folks immediately, even if the impact is small.\u201d \u201cPositioning the Democrats as the party of the working man and woman is old school but absolutely necessary if they are going to successfully counter the Republican resurgence among working class and independent voters, especially women,\u201d Schiller told CNN. Obama\u2019s \u2018Mad Men\u2019 remark She cited a remark from Obama\u2019s speech Tuesday that received prolonged applause from legislators jamming the packed House chamber \u2013 the President\u2019s call for ending unfair workplace policies for women \u201cthat belong in a \u2018Mad Men\u2019 episode.\u201d \u201cWhen both the Democratic and Republican members of Congress stood up and applauded after the  famous \u2018Mad Men episode\u2019 quote, it was clear that each party sees women as the crucial swing factor in the 2014 elections,\u201d Schiller said. On the GOP side, she described the choice of Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington to deliver the party\u2019s formal response Tuesday night as \u201csmart politics.\u201d Obama\u2019s re-election victory in 2012 owed much to a solid majority among women voters, including independents turned off by hardline anti-abortion policies of Republicans. The Democratic-fueled accusation of a GOP \u201cwar on women\u201d gained traction with infamous missteps by Republican candidates such as former Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri, who claimed that women rarely get pregnant from \u201clegitimate\u201d rape. Akin lost his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in the Show Me State. Now a concerted Republican outreach to women voters means Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t just count on another Todd Akin to save the Senate in 2014,\u201d Schiller said, adding that \u201cthey all have to work to produce federal policies that help working families in order to sustain that advantage.\u201d GOP must walk the talk West said Republicans must follow stated intentions with action when it comes to diversifying their policies and supporters. \u201cThey have to become something other than the party of angry white men,\u201d he said, adding the GOP also must make \u201cmeaningful changes in public policy\u201d because \u201cthey can\u2019t spin their way out of political problems by highlighting women and minorities.\u201d While specifying issues advantageous to Democrats, Obama also has jabbed at Republicans this week on another matter that resonates with voters \u2013 the perception that political intransigence led by tea party conservatives stymies progress in Washington. Republicans got the blame for last year\u2019s highly unpopular 16-day government shutdown when conservatives led by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tried to link a funding measure to dismantling the 2010 health care reforms they detest. To Obama, Republicans must decide \u201cwhether they\u2019re going to waste time creating new crises that slow things down, or whether they\u2019re going to spend time creating new jobs and opportunity,\u201d he said Thursday. In what he depicted as a presidential declaration of independence from congressional dysfunction, Obama said \u201cI want to work with them, but I can\u2019t wait for them.\u201d Immigration reform Another topic: reforming the immigration system, with Obama and Democrats seeking a path to legal status for the millions of people living illegally in the country. Republicans are desperate to reduce the Democratic advantage among Hispanic Americans, the nation\u2019s largest minority demographic. But House Republicans remain unlikely to support a comprehensive Senate plan that passed with bipartisan support and has Obama\u2019s backing. Instead, House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans call for a piecemeal approach to try to show empathy with Latinos while avoiding a backlash by conservatives that would worsen an already damaging internal GOP rift. On other issues, Obama reiterated his push for unspecified action against climate change and made clear that with the Afghanistan war finally winding down, he has no intention of committing America to another prolonged engagement. \u201cI will not send our troops into harm\u2019s way unless it is truly necessary; nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us.\u201d He also refused to back down from withering criticism from the political right about the health care reforms known as Obamacare, offering a strong defense of the benefits and telling Republicans to quit trying to undermine the law. Democratic unity? Schiller said Democrats need to remain unified on Obamacare and other issues, to run as a national party as much as possible even though the November elections are at the state and district level. \u201cWhen Obamacare was brought up in the State of the Union, they all stood up and applauded, even Democratic senators who could be in trouble on the issue in their re-election races,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there are any cracks in that united front for the Democrats as champions of middle class and working folks, it undermines not only their 2014 chances, but the remainder of the Obama presidential agenda.\u201d While unity may exist in policy, some Democratic candidates facing tough elections don\u2019t want to campaign with Obama due to public opposition to Obamacare and slower-than-desired economic growth and job creation. On Thursday, Republican Gov. Scott Walker welcomed Obama to his state with an airport handshake, but Walker\u2019s Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, was nowhere to be seen. Republicans believe they can win control of the Senate by taking six seats from Democrats in November. The House is likely to remain in Republican hands, with the outcomes of 90% of the races considered safely predictable and Democrats needing to win most of the others to regain the majority, according to West. \u201cIt\u2019s an uphill battle for Democrats to retake the House,\u201d he said, calling the situation \u201cpretty much a matter of arithmetic.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers relied heavily on themes of family and compassion to draw divisions with President Barack Obama on Tuesday in the Republican response to his State of the Union address. In her nationally televised appearance, she knocked him for policy proposals that \u201cwon\u2019t solve the problems actually facing Americans.\u201d Rodgers touched on different policy issues, including immigration reform, abortion, jobs and health care, but her comments lacked specifics. Instead, Rodgers used the appearance to introduce a softer face for the Republican Party and convey a tone noticeable in its departure from past Republican responses. \u201cWe hope the President will join us in a year of real action \u2013 by empowering people \u2013 not making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cThat is what we stand for \u2013 for an America that is every bit as compassionate as it is exceptional.\u201d Rodgers looked to distance her response from the Congress by telling viewers that \u201cThe most important moments right now aren\u2019t happening here, they\u2019re not in the Oval Office or in the House Chamber, they\u2019re in your homes.\u201d Rodgers, who was tapped to deliver the Republican response earlier this month, is the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress. She has served her eastern Washington state district since 2005. Can Obama deliver action on inequality? Her appearance was widely seen as an attempt by the Republican Party to appeal more to women, a demographic it has struggled with in recent elections. To do that, she pulled from her own personal story as a wife and mother of three, including a long passage about how her son, Cole, was born with Down syndrome. Past Republican responses were often delivered in a stately room, and served as a counter to points made by the President at the time. Rodgers, by contrast, was seated on a couch in a room with a fireplace. An aide close to her said the idea was to  imitate \u201ca living room type situation.\u201d The aide said she didn\u2019t want to give a policy speech or get into a back-and-forth with the President, as some Republicans had done in years past. \u201cYou realize that you are never going to compete with the spectacle of the State of the Union. You just can\u2019t,\u201d the aide said. \u201cWe opted for,  given the tone and the message she is looking to deliver, just a more casual conversation.\u201d Though, she did have a response to Obama\u2019s call for comprehensive immigration reform \u2013 the most substantive part of her address \u2013 and she did raise the issue of health care, as did the President. Obama calls for action, with or without Congress It\u2019s an Obama priority that passed the Senate last year but has since stalled in the House. \u201cYes, it\u2019s time to honor our history of legal immigration,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a step-by-step solution to immigration reform by first securing our borders and making sure America will always attract the best, brightest, and hardest working from around the world.\u201d Republicans in the House have said they hope to deal with immigration reform in several small bills, instead of one comprehensive piece of legislation. Democrats have been tepid in their support for this approach and some have said they won\u2019t sign on to any bill that doesn\u2019t clearly establish a patch to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. While Rodgers did not use the word \u201cObamacare\u201d once during the address, she did about health care, an issue her party hopes to exploit politically in the midterm election campaign. \u201cNot long ago, I got a letter from Bette in Spokane, who hoped the President\u2019s health care law would save her money \u2013 but found out instead that her premiums were going up nearly $700 a month,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t go back to the way things were, but this law is not working. Republicans believe health care choices should be yours, not the government\u2019s.\u201d Her appearance came after Obama said he was prepared to move forward with his agenda without Congress, if necessary. \u201cLet\u2019s make this a year of action,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s what most Americans want \u2013 for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.\u201d A number of Republicans also had something to say following the speech, including Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who taped his own response, and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah delivered the Tea Party reaction. Although the speeches had a number of similar themes, there were vastly different in both substance and tone. Paul, who stood behind a Senate lectern in a room with wood paneled walls, spoke at length and in detail about the economy and tax policy. Lee, likewise, delivered a detailed response for the Tea Party. The Utah Republican spent a substantial amount of time on Obamacare, a law he called \u201can inequality Godzilla\u201d that has robbed Americans of their insurance.",

There were the now familiar calls to recalibrate the tax code, spend more to rebuild roads and bridges, bolster education and avoid war if at all possible. He brought many to tears with a tribute to Sgt. First Class Cory Remsburg, a disabled war veteran who sat next to first lady Michelle Obama and waved with wounded limbs to a prolonged standing ovation. Even Republicans relentlessly critical of the President conceded his oratorical skill. \u201cA speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex,\u201d said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \u201cThe worst there ever was is still excellent.\u201d According to a snap CNN/ORC International poll, 44% of respondents had a \u201cvery positive\u201d response to Obama\u2019s speech, while 32% described a \u201csomewhat positive\u201d response and 22% didn\u2019t like it at all. Last year, 53% of respondents in a similar poll rated their response to the 2013 address as very positive. The underlying theme of Obama\u2019s fifth State of the Union address was his call on Tuesday for the government to work on behalf of all Americans in 2014, and his pledge to do so even if Congress refused to join him in an election year. \u201cLet\u2019s make this a year of action,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s what most Americans want \u2013 for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.\u201d It\u2019s an optimistic goal for a President with a 43% approval rating entering his sixth year in office and facing a determined opposition in the Republican-led House of Representatives with congressional elections looming in November. Search the transcript of Obama\u2019s speech Quotes from State of the Union speeches Obama: Time to fix immigration system Obama: End 'Mad Men' workplace policies Obama makes a case for healthcare reform \u201cWhat I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSome require congressional action, and I\u2019m eager to work with all of you. But America does not stand still, and neither will I.\u201d On issue after issue, he invited Congress to work with him but said he also would go it alone. Obama called for more government support to rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure, but also said that \u201cI will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.\u201d The President also promised an executive order to raise the minimum wage for some government contract workers. While the action is relatively narrow and affects less than half a million people, Obama urged Congress to follow suit for all low-wage workers in America. Earlier Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner chafed at such unilateral action, telling reporters that Republicans are \u201cjust not going to sit here and let the President trample all over us.\u201d In the official Republican response, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington complained that Obama\u2019s policies \u201care making people\u2019s lives harder.\u201d \u201cWe hope the President will join us in a year of real action \u2013 by empowering people \u2013 not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs,\u201d she said. One area of possible progress is immigration reform. Obama got a long ovation when he urged Republicans in the House to join Democrats in passing a Senate plan that got bipartisan support. McMorris Rodgers also brought up the issue backed by some Republicans as a way to bolster their weak support among Hispanic Americans, the nation\u2019s largest minority demographic. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a step-by-step solution to immigration reform by first securing our borders and making sure America will always attract the best, brightest, and hardest working from around the world,\u201d she said in describing the more limited GOP approach to the comprehensive Senate measure that includes a path to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the country. On another major reform issue, Obama chided Republicans for trying to undermine his signature health care law that passed in 2010 without GOP support. He cited the millions of people helped by the reforms that ended denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions among its benefits. \u201cThe American people aren\u2019t interested in refighting old battles,\u201d Obama said. \u201cLet\u2019s not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that\u2019s already helping millions of Americans. \u2026The first 40 were plenty. \u2026 We all owe it to the American people to say what we\u2019re for, not just what we\u2019re against.\u201d In her response, though, McMorris Rodgers continued the GOP attack line on the health care reforms as big government run amok and causing harm to people by raising costs and limiting their personal choices of doctors and medical treatment. This year\u2019s State of the Union is a defining test for Obama The CNN/ORC poll indicated 59% of respondents thought Obama\u2019s policies as presented in the speech would help the economy, a lower figure than in recent years. Obama said he will order the U.S. Treasury to create a new federal retirement savings account called MyRA, a savings bond that would guarantee \u201ca decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.\u201d It will be available to those whose jobs don\u2019t offer traditional retirement savings programs, he said. Additionally, Obama called for: \u2013 Eliminating $4 billion in tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industries \u201cthat don\u2019t need it\u201d and instead \u201cinvest more in fuels of the future.\u201d \u2013 Equal pay for women, noting they make 77 cents for each dollar a man earns, which he called \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201can embarrassment\u201d to prompt loud and long applause. \u2013 Setting new fuel standards for American trucks to help reduce U.S. oil imports \u201cand what we pay at the pump.\u201d \u2013 Reworking the corporate tax code. He urged Congress to work with him to close \u201cwasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here\u201d and instead \u201clower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home.\u201d \u2013 Congress to lift restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay so the prison cna be closed in 2014. Obama also reiterated that he will veto any new sanctions bill from Congress that would derail talks on preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, adding that \u201cfor the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.\u201d Brazile: Obama\u2019s message: A dysfunctional Congress, but we\u2019ll get it done anyway Even as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits, Obama said average wages have been flat. Along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts, Obama asked Congress to get on board with a Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 per hour. Republicans largely oppose any federal increase, saying it will place a burden on employers. \u201cThis is definitely the President\u2019s agenda and has been for some time now,\u201d said CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, who added it was hard to see how Republicans would respond any differently than before and therefore, it was hard to see big things happening in 2014.

And 43%, of course, is Obama\u2019s job approval rating \u2013 a reminder that his political standing is weak, though up slightly from its recent low point, as he stands before a closely divided Congress \u2013 and country \u2013 to lay out his agenda for year six of his presidency. Obama raising minimum wage to $10.10 for... Crunch time for President Obama Manchin: hope Obama focus on Economy Bachmann: Obama created war on women \u201cOne of the greatest powers a president has is the power to set the agenda,\u201d said veteran Democratic strategist and wordsmith Paul Begala, a close adviser to former President Bill Clinton. \u201cHe (Obama) will use that power to great effect in the State of the Union address.\u201d Here\u2019s how we see the state of the Union Another Clinton White House veteran disagreed, arguing this president is too weakened and the 2014 campaign landscape too troublesome to seize the initiative. \u201cState of the Union means nothing,\u201d this Democrat said, speaking only on condition of anonymity. \u201cRe-read last year\u2019s address. How relevant was it last year in terms of how 2013 turned out?\u201d In fact, Obama failed to get any of his top 2013 State of the Union priorities through Congress. Congress ignored his calls for a new jobs program, for new gun controls and for sweeping immigration reform. Because of that, the 2014 speech is viewed by strategists in both parties as part of a defining test: Can Obama rebuild his standing enough to force action on some of his priorities, or will 2014 instead be remembered as another frustrating year of gridlock and the gateway to \u201clame duck\u201d status? To that end, many see this speech \u2013 this wish list \u2013 as potentially his last chance for significant action. 8 memorable State of the Union moments \u201cAt this stage of a presidency, a State of the Union address cannot be expected to have much, if any, consequence in terms of public opinion,\u201d said leading Republican pollster Bill McInturff. Despite all the attention, McInturff called the speech \u201can ephemeral event that is perhaps a short-term focus of the ultimate D.C. policy insiders.\u201d As always, the State of the Union is a policy address, a chance for the President to lay out his wish list to the Congress and the American people. But it is always a political stage as well, a dramatic nationally televised theater for the President to frame his argument. A peek behind the White House doors WH: Obama ready to act without Congress Will Boehner remain Speaker? This year, even as he asks Congress to act on economic and other initiatives, President Obama will distance himself from an unpopular Congress and promise to use executive powers to implement some of his priorities. The stakes are enormous: As the President delivers his speech, the odds \u2013 and the early election year data \u2013 suggest Republicans will not only keep their House majority but also have a good chance to capture control of the Senate. How would complete Republican control of Congress alter the final two years of the Obama presidency?  It is a debate worth having, yet one that can wait a bit, as we first test whether the President has better luck with Congress in 2014 than he did in 2013, and whether he can bend the political climate back more in his favor. Gingrich: Obama playing a weak hand at State of the Union Which is where those numbers come in. The White House says its No. 1 political goal this year is protecting the Democratic majority in the Senate. Yet that goal \u2013 blocking Republicans from a net six-seat gain \u2013 could significantly complicate the President\u2019s policy agenda. Several of the most vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbents are from states Obama lost badly in 2012: Arkansas, Alaska and Louisiana to name three.  Those and other Democrats are opposed to some things the President wants \u2013 like new gun controls \u2013 and in favor of ideas the White House is against, including modifications to the President\u2019s health care law. Zelizer: Six ways to fight inequality Begala acknowledges the tough political environment facing the President. But he says he can navigate it with a smartly crafted 2014 State of the Union wish list. \u201cHow can he help red-state Democrats running in places where he lost badly?\u201d Begala said. \u201cBy raising issues that play well in places he doesn\u2019t.  So you will hear a lot about middle-class economics: raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance, pay equity and workplace fairness for working women, greater access to child care for working moms, pre-K for young kids and college aid for young adults. \u201c New plan from Obama at State of the Union Obama changing game plan for 2014 Obama plans for 'year of action' The House Republican majority opposes most of the President\u2019s ideas, though there have been some discussions testing whether compromises can be reached on the minimum wage, unemployment insurance and, from time to time, even immigration policy. The historical average for a two-term president\u2019s party in this sixth year midterm is a loss of 30 House seats. Even the most optimistic Republicans view that as unlikely, given the shrinking number of competitive House districts. But Republican flexibility in policy discussions could depend on their own November midterm calculations, and at the moment top party strategists predict GOP gains in the high single digits on the House side. Republicans say Obama has a lot of explaining to do \u201cThey will oppose his popular economic agenda at their own political peril,\u201d Begala said, holding out hope the President would have an opportunity either to score policy successes or bend the political momentum back in his favor. The 43% number is the one worth watching as the year unfolds \u2013 midterm elections are shaped most by the President\u2019s standing. If Obama can climb closer to 50%, Democratic chances improve significantly. If he slips closer to 40% or below, then a GOP takeover of the Senate becomes more and more likely. A little history: In 2006, President George W. Bush had an identical 43% job approval rating at the time of his State of the Union address. There was little fear of the President in Congress then, in either party, and as a result little of his agenda was enacted \u2013 immigration and Social Security changes were among the goals Bush laid out. Come November 2006, Republicans lost 30 House seats, and their majority. 7 things you didn\u2019t know about the State of the Union Bill Clinton, on the other hand, had a 59% approval rating to begin his sixth year in office, and Ronald Reagan was at 64% around his 1986 State of the Union. Democrats defied the historical averages in the Clinton \u201csix-year itch\u201d election; Republicans actually lost five House seats, and the Senate balance of power was unchanged. In 1986, then-majority Democrats made only modest gains in the House (plus five seats), but did pick up eight Senate seats to take control of that chamber. Outside of Washington, observers like New Hampshire GOP activist Thomas Rath see an opportunity if the President \u201cacknowledge(d) at the outset that overwhelmingly Americans share a common belief \u2013 Washington does not work. He should acknowledge that both parties share that blame; both are responsible.\u201d Rath\u2019s advice? \u201cHe needs to listen to the mood of this country and understand that folks do not want to hear a partisan harangue but rather want a strong message of leadership and cooperation from the man they elected to do just that.\u201d And Rath\u2019s election-year State of the Union prediction: \u201cHe will do nothing of this sort.\u201d Obama to raise minimum wage for federal contractors",

            "article_content": "After losses in 2012, RNC Chair Reince Priebus ordered a review of the GOP at the national level In 2013, the RNC released a report titled the \"Growth & Opportunity Plan\" Nearly a year after the report's release, the GOP has increased minority outreach efforts But it hasn't embraced immigration reform and is struggling with messaging directed at women voters For far too long, according to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, his committee was nothing more than \u201ca U-Haul trailer of money for a presidential nominee\u201d who lacked a permanent, sustainable presence in crucial states. \u201cWe had been a party that has shown up once every four years about five months before an election,\u201d Priebus told CNN, arguing that no matter how much money you have, that model won\u2019t work and hasn\u2019t worked in recent years. So after the drubbing the party took at the ballot box in 2012 \u2013 failing to win the White House and losing seats in the House \u2013 Priebus ordered a much-talked about top-down review of the party in an effort to stop Republicans for taking big losses during presidential elections. The report \u2013 titled the \u201cGrowth & Opportunity Plan\u201d \u2013 was stark and blunt, challenging the Republican Party to make substantial changes to the way it interacted with voters. Republicans want to end perception as \u2018stuffy old men\u2019 Less than a year after the report was released and as Republicans nationally venture to Washington for the group\u2019s winter confab, Priebus and other Republican leaders are looking back on 2013 and heralding the moves they made in implementing their plan. Huckabee wades into birth control debate Huckabee: Women don't need 'Uncle Sugar' GOP plans on using abortion in 2014 \u201cA lot of it comes down to mechanics,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cHere is the point, if you are not in Hispanic communities on a year-round basis. If you don\u2019t represent those congressional districts, if you don\u2019t represent those Senate districts, who is there? Who is there telling the story of the Republican Party, of opportunity and freedom.\u201d There are fundamental areas that RNC re-tooling has focused on: improving a lackluster ground game, growing Republican standing in minority communities, investing in a data infrastructure and revamping the GOP primary system. All of this, Priebus and others said, is in an effort to turn into a year-round organization with a sustainable presence in crucial states. After President Barack Obama beat Republican nominee Mitt Romney on the way to winning reelection in 2012, many in the party felt changes needed to be made. As the GOP report touts on one of its first pages, it had \u201clost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections\u201d and Obama just won the Hispanic vote by a whopping 44%, African Americans by over 80% and Asians by 47%. In response to these losses, according to Jennifer Korn, the RNC\u2019s deputy political director and the head of demographic specific outreach, the party has put minority engagement staff in sixteen states. The RNC is especially proud of that - pointing out that 78% of the RNC\u2019s political staff is outside of Washington, D.C., \u2013 but not fully satisfied. If they had their way, the RNC would have this demographic specific staff in all 50 states. And Korn believes this plan has already been a success, pointing to the fact that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey won 50% of the Hispanic vote on the way to his reelection in 2013. Korn, who came to the RNC after running similar outreach programs in the George W. Bush White House, said the results were particularly stark in heavily Hispanic Passaic County, New Jersey, a county Christie turned red in 2013. \u201cThis is a permanent, year round effort,\u201d Korn said. \u201cWe will be in these communities to not only ask for their vote, but to build relationships and listen to their concerns.\u201d But not all recommendations outlined in the report have been followed. On the top of that list: the report\u2019s suggestion that Republicans should \u201cembrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d \u201cIf we do not, our party\u2019s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only,\u201d wrote the five Republican authors of the report, which also stated that the RNC believes \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d is \u201cconsistent\u201d with Republican policies to \u201cpromote job growth and opportunity for all.\u201d After passing the Senate, immigration reform has stalled in the Republican controlled House. What\u2019s more, Republican\u2019s who supported the measure - like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio - have taken a beating with the party\u2019s base for that support. Reid: Boehner will compromise on immigration reform The other much talked about suggestion, that Republicans need to alter their tone when talking about certain issues, has proven hard to change. \u201cIt\u2019s not just what we say; it\u2019s how we say it,\u201d Priebus said when the report was published. But a number of high profile comments have undermined the GOP effort. Examples: When Rep. Steve King of Iowa told Newsmax that Mexican immigrants have \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert\u201d or when Rep. Trent Frank of Arizona said \u201cthe incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.\u201d Priebus, who has called out some of the more outlandish comments, seems to just shrug this off with the fact that the RNC has only been at this for less than a year. \u201cThis idea that somehow the committee itself is taking on the entire world upon its shoulders and has to carpet the world\u201d is not realistic, Preibus told CNN on Wednesday, the first day of the meeting. \u201cIn one year, is the world carpeted? No. But we are making fundamental changes at a historic level that no one can deny.\u201d Democrats have watched this rebranding with amusement. Every time someone like King makes an eye-popping statement or when the RNC, like it is doing this week, considers a resolution that encourages candidates to be more vocal on the anti-abortion stance, Democrats have questioned the validity of the plan. In an e-mail on Tuesday, Marcy Stech, spokeswoman for Emily\u2019s List, a liberal woman\u2019s group, said the RNC abortion proposal shows the party is \u201cmisfiring on that rebrand\u201d and \u201cRepublicans are yet again focusing on rhetoric over reason.\u201d \u201cThis is yet another example of the Republican Party being tone-deaf to American voters and trying to solve a policy problem with a fake, PR solution,\u201d Stech wrote. \u201cMaybe, in 2014, they should be taking a stronger look at the policies that women and their families actually want, and not how much or how little to talk to them about the ones they don\u2019t.\u201d Priebus, quite expectedly, doesn\u2019t see it that way. Instead of saying the resolution pushes Republicans to talk about their pro-life stances, the chairman said the idea is that \u201cthe point of the resolution is don\u2019t stand there like s sitting duck, like a fool, and get punched in the face\u201d when Democrats challenge Republican on abortion. While tone and demographic outreach have been the most talked about aspects of the RNC changes, the committee has also tried to shore up other deficiencies that hurt them in 2012. Kirsten Kurkowski, the RNC\u2019s spokeswoman, said the party has \u201cfundamentally reshaped our ground game structure to be community-based and bottom up,\u201d is \u201cclosing the digital divide with a multi-million dollar investment in technology\u201d and has \u201cunited behind the need for changes in the debate system.\u201d The debate system as been an important, albeit quiet, focus of the RNC after the 2012 loss. For much of 2013, a handful of party officials pushed batch rules aimed at streamlining a chaotic presidential nominating process that many party insiders viewed as damaging to the their campaign for the White House in 2012. Those rules are to be considered and voted on at this week\u2019s RNC meeting. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need a six-month slice and dice festival on our party,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cI think we need some compression on both ends to shorten the time period of the primary. And like I said, look I can\u2019t always control people\u2019s mouths but we can have some control over how long we have to kill each other. \u201c As for more comments that strike a tone the RNC would rather not take, most GOP committee members in Washington for the winter meeting know they are inevitable. \u201cWe wrote a report and certainly we advocated people being smart about what they say, but we don\u2019t have a magic wand,\u201d said RNC Committeeman Henry Barbour. \u201cI think that is where we have to keep fighting that fight. We have to keep educating our members, or governors, as well as our candidates, to think about what you say and how you say it.\u201d His advice to members who have a penchant for strong statements: \u201cSpeak in a way that unites people and is not shrill. Shrill doesn\u2019t sell.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Embattled New Jersey governor seeks to sound presidential in inaugural address Christie emphasizes his broad-based support in winning re-election He offers some conservative red meat with more moderate stances A political scandal could undo his 2016 presidential ambitions Chris Christie used about 2,000 words to deliver different messages to different audiences Tuesday in his second inaugural address, this one under the specter of scandal. The embattled New Jersey governor made no mention of the multiple investigations into alleged political retribution exacted by his administration. Instead, he spoke as a re-elected governor to his state and the early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, if he decides to run, to a cheering crowd in the Trenton War Memorial. Most importantly, Christie emphasized themes of unity and moving beyond partisan politics to try to reassure crucial Independent voters shaken by the controversy over traffic gridlock as alleged political payback. Who's who in the Christie controversies Here is what he said, and what he really was saying: \u201cA tough New Jersey. A resilient New Jersey. A proud New Jersey.\u201d Christie was talking about himself as much as his state when, early in the speech, he spoke of the bond established with the people of New Jersey during his first term. \u201cWe have endured the worst economic recession of our lifetimes and we have begun to triumph over it,\u201d he said, establishing the \u201call-in-this-together\u201d theme of the speech that sought to also boost state pride. \u201cWe have survived the worst natural disaster in our state\u2019s history and we have worked together to restore, renew and rebuild the state that we love,\u201d he added, noting that \u201ceach one of these challenges has been met by a new, unified force in public life - a New Jersey setting the tone for an entire nation.\u201d Then came the triple kicker, received with lengthy applause: \u201cA tough New Jersey. A resilient New Jersey. A proud New Jersey.\u201d Low profile for Democrats as Christie inaugurated \u201cA New Jersey that has put aside political partisanship on the important issues \u2026 \u201c With polls showing public disgust with the partisan politics of Washington, Christie portrayed himself as a leader who can overcome ideological divisions. His goal was to contrast his record in a politically divided state with Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s inability to divine much partisan progress from a similarly divided Congress. New Jersey Democrats note their control of the state legislature means every law passed and signed by Christie must be bipartisan, by definition. To the governor, the victor gets the spoils and he hailed \u201ca New Jersey that has put aside political partisanship on the important issues to our people to take advantage of the opportunities each of these challenges has presented us with every day.\u201d Later in the speech, Christie expanded on that theme,saying \u201cwe cannot fall victim to the attitude of Washington, D.C.\u201d \u201cThe attitude that says I am always right and you are always wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attitude that puts everyone into a box that they are not permitted to leave. The attitude that puts political wins ahead of policy agreements. The belief that compromise is a dirty word.\u201d Hot piece of land in Hoboken at center of Christie-Zimmer dispute \u201cEach vote cast is an act of faith and trust.\u201d In a key message of the speech, Christie presented himself as a leader able to win support across the political spectrum, which will be the most necessary attribute for a Republican presidential candidate. Obama won re-election in 2012 by thumping GOP challenger Mitt Romney in key demographics such as women, young voters, Hispanic Americans and African Americans. It appears that Christie hopes to generate broad-based support and fundraising by claiming the title as most electable Republican from the start. \u201cYou see, elections are about more than TV ads and debates and rallies. Each vote cast is an act of faith and trust,\u201d he said to set up the bond between candidate and citizen. Referring to his November re-election, Christie said \u201cit wasn\u2019t just some of our people who affirmed this course.\u201d \u201cIt was not a vocal plurality like four years ago,\u201d he continued to growing applause and cheers. \u201cNo, this time, it was the largest and loudest voice of affirmation that the people of our state have given to any direction in three decades.\u201d One by one, he listed the elements of his broad-based support \u2013 an enviable collection for any candidate of any party. \u201cSuburbanites and city dwellers. African Americans and Latinos. Women and men. Doctors and teachers. Factory workers and tradesmen. Republicans and Democrats and independents,\u201d Christie said. Later in the speech, he made sure to mention how the state passed an immigration law on his watch that gave some children of immigrants living illegally in New Jersey a break on their tuition. The issue is paramount to Hispanic Americans and the subject of major political division in Washington. To CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, Christie was declaring to GOP backers and independents looking to get behind a winner that he can attract a \u201cvery broad\u201d coalition like the one that gave him his second term. Don\u2019t trash Jersey until you\u2019ve traveled it \u201cNow we have no moral option but to heed the voice of the voters \u2026 \u201c With this line, Christie sought to seal the bond with New Jerseyans and also convince people nationwide that he could be trusted with their votes come 2016, if he runs. A new national poll released Tuesday showed Christie losing ground to the early Democratic presidential frontrunner in 2016, Hillary Clinton. The biggest shift in the Quinnipiac University survey was among Independent voters, who were split between Christie and Clinton in December but now go for Clinton by a 15-percentage point margin. It also indicated that Christie\u2019s standing among voters has dropped since the controversies facing his administration became more prominent in the past two weeks. \u201cHe\u2019s paying a political price with those Independents,\u201d Borger said, adding that on the issue of voter trust, \u201che\u2019s got a lot of work to do there.\u201d It\u2019s not impossible, she noted, saying Independent voters \u201ccan always shift back, but he has to win them back.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s speech tried to do exactly that. \u201cNow we have no moral option but to heed the voice of the voters and that is exactly what I intend to do,\u201d Christie said to applause. \u201cToday, I thank all those who have once again placed their faith and trust in me and I make this promise: I will not let up, I will insist we work together and I will make this government truly work for those who pay for it,\u201d he continued to another ovation. Trump: Christie \u2018one email away from a disaster\u2019 \u201cI do not believe that New Jerseyans want a bigger, more expensive government \u2026 \u201c While Christie\u2019s poll numbers among Republicans remain strong, he remains vulnerable to conservative criticism that he is too moderate for the hardliners on the GOP right. Some will never forgive him for buddying up with Obama when they toured the Superstorm Sandy devastation a few days before the 2012 election, a break in final campaign coverage considered beneficial to the President\u2019s victory. His speech offered some red meat to conservatives by stressing his opposition to tax hikes sought by Democrats who control the state legislature. \u201cI do not believe that New Jerseyans want a bigger, more expensive government that penalizes success and then gives the pittance left to a few in the name of income equity,\u201d Christie said, delivering a conservative mantra. \u201cWhat New Jerseyans want is an unfettered opportunity to succeed in the way that they define success. They want an equal chance at the starting line; not a government guaranteed result.\u201d His applause followed by calling for policies \u201cthat believe in the effort, the talent and the optimism of New Jerseyans, not in the power of almighty government to fix any problem, real or imagined.\u201d \u201cSo, let\u2019s be different than our neighbors,\u201d Christie said to cheers. \u201cLet\u2019s put more money in the pockets of our middle class by not taking it out of their pockets in the first place.\u201d Opinion: How Christie could rebound - and come out stronger \u201cThe ways we divide each other \u2026 is neither permanent nor necessary.\u201d While he needs at least some conservative support to survive the GOP primaries for 2016, Christie knows that any chance in a general election requires the support of independent voters and perhaps even some disenchanted Democrats. So he tried to tread a somewhat tricky middle ground by proposing both conservative and moderate policies and ideas. \u201cThis election has taught us that the ways we divide each other \u2013 by race, by class, by ethnicity, by wealth, and yes by political party \u2013 is neither permanent nor necessary,\u201d Christie said. \u201cYou see, our dreams are the same: a good job, a great education for our children, safe streets in our neighborhood and core values which give lives real meaning. Those dreams are not unique to any one group in our state.\u201d He then sounded like a conservative-tinged populist by encouraging personal responsibility to help each other. \u201cWe have to be willing to play outside the red and blue boxes that the media pundits put us in,\u201d he said to applause. \u201cWe have to be willing to reach out to others who look or speak differently than us; we have to be willing to personally reach out a helping hand to a neighbor or a friend suffering from drug addiction, depression or the dignity stripping loss of a job.\u201d Continuing the theme, Christie outlined policy directions on education and drug enforcement that straddled the ideological spectrum. \u201cWe will make it our priority to have every child in New Jersey have a chance to get a good education,\u201d he said, again prompting applause and cheers by adding that \u201cno matter what adult we have to offend, no matter where you came from, no matter what sacred cow we must slay, no matter how much we have to change the conventional thinking, we will no longer stand for the achievement gap which exists between our best and least educated children.\u201d Then he became more liberal, saying \u201cwe will end the failed war on drugs that believes that incarceration is the cure of every ill caused by drug abuse.\u201d \u201cWe will make drug treatment available to as many of our non-violent offenders as we can,\u201d Christie said, \u201cand we will partner with our citizens to create a society that understands this simple truth: every life has value and no life is disposable.\u201d Is this what \u2018Jersey-style\u2019 means?

            "article_content": "In a major magazine profile, President Obama emphasizes historical context Ten years after bursting onto the national scene, Obama's vision sounds less lofty Still pushing for equal opportunity, he says in the end things will be better than worse Obama: Chances for final treaties in talks on three Middle East issues less than 50% So there\u2019s this guy, Barry, who seems pretty liberal. Used to smoke pot and doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s as dangerous as alcohol. Says he wouldn\u2019t let a son play pro football. Some call him one of those late Baby Boomers who believe they can save the world. Maybe he used to be, but the last year has been pretty tough and he\u2019s sounding a bit more grounded these days when you actually sit down and talk to him. Barry could be any number of Americans \u2013 an educated, white-collar guy having his idealistic vision blunted by midlife realities such as raising two daughters. In this case, he\u2019s the President of the United States on the fifth anniversary of his inauguration as the nation\u2019s first African-American commander in chief. An expansive profile by The New Yorker magazine shows Barack Obama as both impatient with and accepting of the political, social and personal limitations on his ability to achieve the bold hopes and dreams described in his now famous 2004 Democratic National Convention speech that elevated him to the national stage. \u201cI believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity,\u201d he said that night in Boston. \u201cI believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs, and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.\u201d A decade later, now-President Obama bears the political scars and graying hair of five years in the White House, and David Remnick\u2019s profile reveals the burden he carries. Obama would not let his son play football \u201cEvery morning and every night, I\u2019m taking measure of my actions against the options and possibilities available to me, understanding that there are going to be mistakes that I make and my team makes and that America makes; understanding that there are going to be limits to the good we can do and the bad that we can prevent, and that there\u2019s going to be tragedy out there and, by occupying this office, I am part of that tragedy occasionally,\u201d Obama says in the profile. He continues the thought by adding \u201cthat if I am doing my very best and basing my decisions on the core values and ideals that I was brought up with and that I think are pretty consistent with those of most Americans, that at the end of the day things will be better rather than worse.\u201d The profile, which included one-on-one interviews, made news on some issues. Obama revealed a middle-ground stance on pot, saying he warns his daughters against smoking it as he did, but also complaining that too many young people face lengthy prison terms for something he says is less dangerous to the user than alcohol. He has no son, but if he did, he would stop the boy from becoming a pro football player because of the chronic debilitating injuries, says the Chicago Bears fan. On political and policy issues, Obama acknowledges he completed his evolution from noncommittal to fully supportive of gay marriage before making his stance public in 2012, a few months before his re-election for a second term. It was \u201cfair to say that I may have come to that realization slightly before I actually made the announcement,\u201d Obama admits in the profile. \u201cBut this was not a situation where I kind of did a wink and a nod and a 180-degree turn.\u201d Regarding the trifecta of international negotiations involving thorny Middle East issues \u2013 Syria, Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \u2013 Obama concedes the chances for completing final treaties in any of them are less than 50%. Obama says marijuana \u2018no more dangerous than alcohol\u2019 \u201cIn all three circumstances we may be able to push the boulder partway up the hill and maybe stabilize it so it doesn\u2019t roll back on us,\u201d he says in the profile. \u201cAnd all three are connected. I do believe that the region is going through rapid change and inexorable change. Some of it is demographics; some of it is technology; some of it is economics. And the old order, the old equilibrium, is no longer tenable. The question then becomes, \u2018what\u2019s next?\u2019 \u201c The theme of historical context and taking the long view runs through many of Obama\u2019s remarks in the profile. While he spent the 2012 election campaign touting his accomplishments \u2013 recovery from the recession, health care reform, ending the Iraq war and winding down combat operations in Afghanistan \u2013 Obama sounds more reflective now after a first year in his second term mired in political stalemate with recalcitrant Republicans over immigration reform, gun control and the endless battles over spending and taxes. Referring to the famous line from the film version of Mario Puzo\u2019s \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d  Obama says that \u201cit turns out Marlon Brando had it easy, because, when it comes to Congress, there is no such thing as an offer they can\u2019t refuse.\u201d While he ascribes some of the relentless political opposition he faces to race, he also points out that he gets some benefit as the first African-American President. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black President,\u201d Obama says. \u201cNow, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I\u2019m a black President.\u201d He evokes the name and legacy of Abraham Lincoln in providing his own long view of both the role of a president and his own efforts in the Oval Office. \u201cDespite being the greatest president, in my mind, in our history,\u201d he says of Lincoln, \u201cit took another 150 years before African-Americans had anything approaching formal equality, much less real equality.\u201d To Obama, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t diminish Lincoln\u2019s achievements, but it acknowledges that at the end of the day we\u2019re part of a long-running story,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cWe just try to get our paragraph right.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Conservatives fear Boehner will play \"prevent defense\" ahead of midterms They feel that presenting a contrast with Democrats is a winning strategy Conservatives have used their numbers and influence to stymie Boehner on policy House conservatives are putting House Speaker John Boehner on notice: The 2014 agenda needs to be about more than railing on the President and the failures of Obamacare. They say it\u2019s time to lay out a bold GOP vision and hold votes on a series of issues to show a contrast with Democrats. \u201cRepublicans right now think that all we have to do is talk about how bad the Obama economy is and how bad Obamacare is and we\u2019re going to win in 2014,\u201d Idaho GOP Rep. Raul Labrador told reporters at a forum of House conservatives on Capitol Hill this week. Labrador said he believes this strategy is what prevented Republicans from winning the White House in 2012 and predicted if the party adopts the same game plan this year it won\u2019t take back the Senate or win the White House in 2016. Congress acting like a divorced couple? GOP governors want to reclaim their party Congress to-do list, unemployment benefits Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who heads a group of more than 170 conservatives called the Republican Study Committee, also said he\u2019s worried top GOP leaders don\u2019t have a more proactive agenda ahead of the midterm elections. \u201cThere\u2019s some people that think that they might want to play prevent defense this year and sit back,\u201d Scalise said. In rare bipartisan action, Congress approves $1.1 trillion budget Since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, those on the right have wielded their growing numbers and influence to stymie Boehner\u2019s plans on major policy debates. As Republicans head to the eastern shore of Maryland for a closed-door retreat later this month to chart strategy, Wyoming GOP Rep. Cynthia Lummis said. \u201cThis is no time to duck in a foxhole. This is the time for Republicans to lead.\u201d Boehner has said he believes the 2014 election will hinge on jobs and the problems with Obamacare.  House Republican leaders are again expected to push similar versions of the jobs bill they pushed in 2013 to keep the focus on the economy, along with some more bills tweaking Obamacare, according to GOP aides. But Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, a tea party favorite who is retiring this fall, said, \u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d and House Republicans need to give more concrete answers for what they\u2019ll do for working-class Americans. \u201cYou can chew gum and walk at the same time,\u201d Bachmann said. Obama makes case for not adding sanctions on Iran Asked about conservatives\u2019 demands for votes on a host of issues, Boehner agreed in principle, saying at his weekly session with reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s important for us as a \u2013 as a party, especially in an election year, to tell people what you\u2019re for.\u201d What's 'in' and 'out' for 2014? Congress moves on after forgettable 2013 Poll: This is worst congress ever Perhaps in response to growing calls from his own members, the speaker committed that House Republicans would come forward this year with their own proposal to replace Obamacare.  But he didn\u2019t guarantee a vote on it before the election. The refrain \u201crepeal and replace\u201d was a central GOP message right after the President signed the health care law in 2010.  Although there have been more than 40 votes to roll back the entire law or parts of it, there has been no vote on a plan to take its place. But what do conservatives want? Even those Republicans demanding a \u201cbold vision\u201d from their leaders aren\u2019t articulating what that means. Several House conservatives admit there are splits about what should be included on the 2014 to-do list, and that divide could take a while to sort out. \u201cThis is clearly going to be an internal struggle of the Republican party: Are we going to just be the party that says \u2018hey the other side is worse\u2019 or are we going to show why our side is actually better for the American people or the public?\u201d Labrador asked. He and other conservatives are worried that the national party has become too closely aligned with big business, and instead should be targeting its agenda and message at small businesses and individuals. In addition to the party laying out its own health care plan, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan outlined several areas he said voters want to see Congress tackle this year. He held up tax reform that helps promote new jobs as a must-do priority, something Republicans put on their agenda for every new congressional session. New spot in ad wars over Obamacare Perhaps as a response to the Democrats\u2019 laser focus this year on income inequality issues, Jordan said the GOP should focus on policies aimed at lower-income Americans, suggesting welfare reform should be revisited.  He also said Americans want Congress to deal with the worries people have about privacy protections. \u201cThese are four things that help every single family in this country,\u201d Jordan said, and insisted leaders should schedule votes on bills covering all those conservative priorities. One issue that is guaranteed to set up a clash between conservatives and Boehner is immigration reform.  The speaker is expected to release a set of principles on immigration reform later this month.  He has said repeatedly it\u2019s important for Congress to fix the broken system, including addressing what to do about the 11 million undocumented workers in the United States. Boehner and other top House GOP leaders are adamant they won\u2019t take up anything resembling the comprehensive legislation the Senate passed last year.  But even moving the piecemeal bills Boehner has said he supports will be politically messy, because a majority of his own members are reluctant to sign off on any measure that grants eventual citizenship. GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a longtime opponent of any measure granting legal status to undocumented workers in the United States, doesn\u2019t think an immigration debate does anything but help Democrats. \u201cEvery day that we discuss immigration, that helps Barack Obama change the topic from Obamacare.\u201d The first fight is the debt ceiling. Election year makes Washington even more confusing A big test for Boehner\u2019s ability to assuage conservatives comes soon: House Republicans need to decide how they will approach the debate over the debt limit.  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the nation\u2019s borrowing authority will run out at the end of February. Last fall\u2019s government shutdown was a public display of the fight between conservatives who demanded any spending bill defund Obamacare and establishment Republicans who worried it was a no-win situation.  But that episode did have a silver lining for Boehner, who warned the standoff over Obamacare would backfire.  It served as a teachable moment for conservatives about the limits of what they can demand in a divided government. Scalise said he wants to address the long-term debt as part of the debt debate, but he\u2019s not sure yet what Republicans should negotiate in return for supporting another increase in the debt ceiling.  But he didn\u2019t seem to think that debate was the best place to take another stand on Obamacare. \u201cIt has to be something achievable and we ought to start with that.  It ought to be something we can rally the country around and ultimately sign into law that addresses the problem,\u201d Scalise said. How Boehner handles the delicate relationship with conservatives will be key to the prospects for his 2014 legislative agenda. But the speaker is also the top GOP leader in Washington of a party still struggling to regroup after losses at the national level in 2012, so the direction he takes will also have an impact on the political message in this fall\u2019s midterm elections.",

            "article_content": "NEW: The House easily approves a federal budget through September How can there be a budget deal and a fight over debt at the same time? Old battles continue over unemployment insurance and immigration reform Republicans want Obamacare to be the main issue in November Deciphering election-year politics in Washington is like viewing an impressionist painting \u2013 things that are blurry up close get clearer when you stand back for a broader look. How else do you explain a full-blown spending measure poised to pass Congress while a partisan showdown looms over increasing how much the federal government can borrow to pay its bills? Despite the ballyhooed bipartisanship of the compromise spending plan, deep enmity remains over other high-profile issues such as immigration reform and Obamacare. Even matters that had previously sailed through the legislative wrangling, such as extending long-term unemployment benefits, remain stalled by political intransigence. Congressional elections in November add to the impressionistic prism required to fully understand what is going on. Here are some of the major issues as described through that prism: Government spending At long last, a respite from the seemingly endless budget brinksmanship of the past two years. A compromise worked out late last year by the leaders of the House and Senate budget committees \u2013 Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington \u2013 set the parameters for the $1.1 trillion spending measure that easily passed the House on Wednesday and now is expected to win Senate approval. Such agreement in the heightened political environment of an election year seems antithetical, until you consider the benefits to both sides. Polls show record public dissatisfaction with Congress for dysfunction that has repeatedly failed to pass a budget or spending bills, instead extending previous appropriations levels time after time. In addition, Republicans got hammered for forcing a government shutdown last year by linking spending approval to conservative efforts to dismantle President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms. Those two factors combine to motivate legislators in both parties to temporarily sideline for now their ideological wars over the size and cost of government, at least in terms of spending. Debt ceiling The issue of how much the government can borrow to pay bills run up in part by congressionally approved spending is another matter. Republicans insist they will need concessions in the form of some kind of spending reductions to agree to increase the federal debt ceiling when the current borrowing limit is reached in March. With Obama saying he won\u2019t negotiate over upholding the full faith and credit of the United States, the matter appears headed to another episode of brinkmanship that the public hates. However, Republicans know their conservative base hates the concept of increased national debt even more, so picking this fight in an election year makes sense for GOP candidates in safe districts. The calculus could change if the impasse results in an unprecedented U.S. default that shoots up interest rates and damages the nation\u2019s credit rating. Just the notion of a possible default in a similar debt ceiling fight in 2011 caused the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Unemployment insurance More than 1 million Americans lost their long-term jobless benefits in late December when Congress was unable to agree on an extension. In the Senate this week, Democrats and Republicans continued their dysfunctional political dance over the issue. A GOP filibuster blocked separate proposals to extend benefits for almost a year or just three months, with the measures failing to clear procedural votes on Tuesday after apparently fruitless negotiations between Democratic leaders and a handful of Republicans. On the surface, the question involves whether the additional cost of the extended benefits should be offset by spending cuts elsewhere, but there is more to it than that. Conservative Republicans want to scale back jobless benefits in the wake of the Great Recession as part of overall austerity moves to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. \u201cUnfortunately, instead of helping to create jobs, the President is focused on making it easier to live without one,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said Wednesday. Democrats know they can portray the GOP opposition as heartless rejection of needed benefits, and therefore are happy to hold \u201cshow\u201d votes on the matter that they can use to attack Republicans in upcoming election campaigns. Hence the two procedural votes Tuesday that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid knew his Democrats would lose. According to a Quinnipiac University survey released last week, voters supported by a 58%-37% margin extending unemployment benefits for three months. However, the poll showed a majority of Republicans opposed the extension, while most Democrats and independents supported it. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky argued Democrats were purposely trying to scuttle the bill so they could blame Republicans for blocking benefits. Immigration reform Obama and Democrats want the House to take up a major Senate-passed immigration measure that would provide a pathway to legal status for millions of immigrants living illegally in the country. Some Republicans also want to pass an immigration reform bill because they know their party lacks support from the nation\u2019s largest minority demographic group \u2013 Hispanic Americans. In the 2012 presidential vote, Obama got overwhelming support from Hispanic Americans that helped him win re-election. Analysts warn that a GOP failure to cut into the Democratic advantage with Latino voters portends an inability to reclaim the White House any time soon. However, conservative Republicans oppose the Senate immigration plan as a form of amnesty for immigrants who unlawfully entered the country. With conservative groups wielding influence in GOP primaries by backing anti-immigration reform candidates against incumbents, the chances are slim that the House will pass the Senate measure. Obamacare Republicans will continue their relentless attempts to undermine the 2010 Affordable Care Act, but they failed to stop it before full implementation occurred on January 1. The appropriations bill expected to pass this week includes funding for the health care reforms, ending for now the GOP strategy of cutting off money for Obamacare. Nevertheless, the issue will be big in November with Republicans and their conservative backers attacking Democrats who pushed the reforms through Congress without any GOP votes. Attack ads against Democratic candidates already have started, funded by conservative groups, and the Republican National Committee has made clear it will hammer Obamacare all year. The botched rollout of the Obamacare website in October fit the Republican narrative that the reforms amounted to big government run amok. Obama and Democrats hope that full implementation of the reforms eases public opposition and concerns expressed in polling, making the issue a benefit instead of a detriment by the time voters decide in November. CNN\u2019s Lisa Desjardins and Virginia Nicolaidis contributed to this report.",

Who's who in Christie bridge scandal Quotes from Christie apology Photos: Political dirty tricks The party\u2019s conservative base has never warmed to Christie. And he angered other Republicans with his 2012 Republican National Convention speech that was more about him than the party\u2019s nominee Mitt Romney. And some will never forgive him for his public embrace of President Barack Obama who was surveying damage in New Jersey from Superstorm Sandy just days before the presidential election.

The lane closings caused massive traffic jams in Fort Lee. Christie drops swagger amid heat of scandal With scandal, Christie loses his top enforcer Following Thursday\u2019s news conference, a top national tea party leader questioned whether Christie had put the controversy behind him. \u201cGovernor Christie held some subordinates accountable. Time will tell whether this is enough,\u201d wrote Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder and national coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots. Judson Phillips, who heads the Tea Party Nation, went a step further. \u201cThis incident is proof that once again the most dangerous place on the earth is the spot between Chris Christie and his presidential ambitions,\u201d Phillips told CNN. Will scandal affect Christie's job? Holt: There is more to Christie scandal Does Christie need to tone down image? How damaging is bridgegate to Christie? \u201cI strongly suspect there will be litigation as a result of this and the beauty of litigation is the truth will come out.  I strongly suspect there is much more to this than what Chris Christie let on in his news conference.\u201d Grassroots conservatives are skeptical of Christie because of his praise for Obama over the federal government\u2019s assistance to New Jersey for Sandy damage, and because of his criticism of some congressional Republicans over their initial reluctance to support federal relief aid to Garden State following Sandy. Christie has also angered conservatives with his willingness to work with Democrats on such issues as immigration reform, and his criticism of some on the right, including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a tea party favorite who\u2019s a possible rival for the 2016 GOP nomination. Christie heralds NJ DREAM Act as message to Washington Will Christie\u2019s immigration bill haunt him in 2016? Thursday, following the Christie news conference, Paul seemed to take a dig at Christie, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know who e-mailed whom, who works for whom. I have been in traffic before and I know how angry I am, and I\u2019m always wondering, who did this.\u201d Erick Erickson, co-founder of RedState.com and leading voice on the right, wrote Wednesday in an article titled \u201cThe Politics of A-Holes\u201d that \u201cThere\u2019s more here and it is going to be the problem that haunts Chris Christie.\u201d And Breitbart\u2019s Matthew Boyle, who\u2019s also influential among conservatives, tweeted Wednesday that \u201cChris Christie is not a conservative. Don\u2019t delude yourself into thinking he is.\u201d But the conservatives couldn\u2019t resist an opportunity to get in a dig at their real nemesis. \u201cThe contrast between Barack Obama and Chris Christie in terms of owning a mess and fixing it is now pretty stark,\u201d tweeted Erickson. Ft. Lee Mayor: I'm on your radar now Ft. Lee mayor: This is not over Gov. Christie's glass case of emotions Is 'bridgegate' part of a bully pattern? \u201cThis could end being a positive for Christie though. People like accountability. They\u2019re not getting that with Obama,\u201d wrote Boyle on Twitter. Jenny Beth Martin made the same point in her statement, writing, \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for President Obama to hold anyone accountable.\u201d Christie\u2019s re-election team actively sought out the endorsements of Democratic officials, such as Fort Lee\u2019s mayor, in its push to win a major gubernatorial victory as a prelude or launching pad to any 2016 White House bid. They succeeded, as Christie won in a landslide over little known state Sen. Barbara Buono. But the current controversy, born during that re-election drive, gives opponents an opportunity to spin Christie persona of a tough-talking politician into one of a political bully who\u2019s not above petty politics. \u201cThis is the other side of the double-edged sword that is Chris Christie\u2019s heavy-handed persona and governing style.  At one level there\u2019s an appeal about it, but underneath it you sense it could blow up,\u201d Republican communications strategist Keith Appell told CNN. \u201cThe boss sets the tone for those around him and beneath him.  I don\u2019t think this is the last story we\u2019re going to see about problems with Christie\u2019s governing style, and even GOP establishment power brokers and money people will be concerned about how this plays in the 2016 primaries and caucuses \u2013 where the GOP field will be more substantive than it was in 2012,\u201d added Appell, a senior vice president at CRC Public Relations, a Washington public relations firm that has had many conservative and Republican clients. While there\u2019s concern, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a groundswell of conservative criticism right now. \u201cI do not believe there\u2019s going to be any retribution from conservatives over this,\u201d Jon Brabender, a Republican strategist and a longtime senior political adviser to former GOP Sen. Rick Santorum, a 2012 presidential candidate, told CNN. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a single person tell me that the news is great because it\u2019s going to hurt Christie. I don\u2019t think there will be a piling on by conservatives.\u201d Christie, who\u2019s now criss-crossing the country, campaigning for fellow GOP governors as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, is seen as prime target of Democrats, especially since three national polls, starting with a CNN/ORC International survey in November, showed Christie as the early frontrunner among possible 2016 Republican contenders. And national and state Democrats have been relentless the past two months in highlighting the George Washington Bridge controversy. But the bigger concern for Christie going forward is not Democrats, but opponents in his own party.",

            "article_content": "Immigration reform remains a litmus test among GOP primary voters Possible 2016 candidate Chris Christie will sign New Jersey's version of the DREAM Act Bill allows undocumented immigrants who attended high school to pay in-state rate GOP operative says as long as Christie is up front about his position, it might not hurt him In late May 2011, Mitt Romney made his first campaign jaunt to South Carolina, a primary state that bedeviled him during his first presidential campaign and would prove just as vexing in his second. Romney\u2019s difficulties with the conservative base are now well-documented. But among his many problems on the right, immigration wasn\u2019t one of them. On that May afternoon in South Carolina, Romney, his sleeves rolled up and shirt tucked neatly into bluejeans, came prepared to answer a range of tough questions. He delivered a defense of his health care law and equivocated on a controversial Medicare plan being debated in Congress. He didn\u2019t expect to have to talk about immigration, But one activist who felt like a party crasher in the small, hand-picked audience wanted to know if Romney backed amnesty for \u201cillegals.\u201d Romney said no, matter-of-factly outlined his positions, and the voter departed seeming satisfied. Obama responds to immigration heckler GOPer to vote with Dems on immigration Sen. McCain: Millions live in the shadows The point is this: Even if immigration fails to register as a top issue in the polls \u2013 only 3% of Americans called it the country\u2019s \u201cmost important problem\u201d in a recent Gallup survey \u2013 the topic continues to burn white hot as a litmus test among a passionate and vocal slice of the GOP primary electorate. Opinion: Big surprise ahead on immigration Even when immigration reform is not on the calendar in Congress \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t during the 2012 campaign \u2013 it routinely bubbles up in Republican primary campaigns, popping up in town hall meetings, on talk radio and online. And it\u2019s not just the dreaded \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration reform effort that roils grassroots activists; for a defiant portion of the GOP base (looking at you, Steve King), any kind of reform is non-negotiable. Despite efforts by top Republicans in Washington to improve the party\u2019s miserable image among Hispanic voters, not much has changed since the 2012 primary campaign, when GOP voters tore down Texas Gov. Rick Perry for telling a debate audience that they didn\u2019t \u201chave a heart\u201d if they opposed in-state college tuition for young illegal immigrants. Undocumented immigrant lawyer speaks out A sweeping Senate immigration bill is stalled in the House, effectively dead and nailed into its coffin by its own Republican co-sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio, who now opposes it. House Speaker John Boehner says he is open to passing a series of smaller fixes. At the same time, numerous elected GOP officials made intemperate comments about Hispanic immigrants. This is the party that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who will ceremonially sign a New Jersey version of the DREAM Act this week, must face if he decides to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. And at first glance, his support for the bill, which allows undocumented immigrants who have attended New Jersey high schools for three years to pay in-state college tuition rates, is problematic. Christie reaches immigration deal with New Jersey Democrats Having won re-election last November with a majority of Hispanic voters, Christie\u2019s support for the so-called tuition equality bill is another notch in his belt as he cultivates an image as a Republican who can appeal to independent voters and nontraditional constituencies. He is, his supporters believe, a GOP candidate who can actually win a national election. But in the hothouse context of a Republican primary, which he must win to get to a national election, signing the tuition bill seems like yet another example of Christie unfurling a giant middle finger to the very voters whose support he will need once the presidential race begins in earnest this November. The biggest sin conservatives point to when discussing Christie is symbolic: his arm-in-arm tour of the New Jersey coastline with President Obama after Hurricane Sandy, lending the president a veneer of bipartisan street cred just days before the 2012 presidential election. There are other apostasies: Gun control measures signed in Trenton, a gushing buddy-buddy appearance with Bill Clinton at a policy conference in Chicago last summer, and his spirited defense of the country\u2019s surveillance and drone efforts, a position that rankles libertarians. Brandon Patterson, a 23-year-old student at the Pat Roberston-founded Regent University in Virginia, summed up the prevailing conservative attitude toward Christie at last summer\u2019s Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Washington. \u201cHe is not very popular here,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cNobody is excited to support him at all. Nobody that I know of. He\u2019s a moderate.\u201d Talk to any strategist backing his potential GOP opponents, and you\u2019ll hear a similar take on Christie\u2019s decision to sign the DREAM Act: Supporting tuition breaks for illegal immigrants burnishes his reputation with the Amtrak corridor pundit class, but it cements Christie\u2019s status as persona non grata at the Pizza Ranches of western Iowa and diners of New Hampshire. \u201cThis amnesty bill is just another in a really, really long list of reasons why Republican primary voters don\u2019t trust Christie,\u201d said a national GOP operative working for a likely 2016 rival. \u201cFrom guns, to Sandy spending, to hugging Obama, he\u2019ll have a tough time winning any early state primaries. Unless, of course, \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 holds an early state Republican primary that I\u2019m unaware of.\u201d But there\u2019s another way to look at it: The conservatives who despise Christie for signing the tuition bill probably wouldn\u2019t support him anyway. They might not like him, but he doesn\u2019t need them, either Let those conservatives flock to Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and Rick Santorum. The silent plurality of Republican primary voters \u2013 the blue hairs, the country clubbers, the Rotarians \u2013 don\u2019t garner the kind of media attention ginned up by tea party groups and outspoken pastors, but they vote. After all, Mitt Romney, that squishy scion of the hated \u201cestablishment,\u201d lost the Iowa caucuses by only 34 votes. And whatever failings Christie may have, few dispute that he has natural political talents and a rapport with voters that Romney never had. Reid says Boehner will compromise on immigration reform The dynamics of the 2012 race were different than they will be in 2016; a fiscal conservative like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker could clog Christie\u2019s lane in the business community. But early state operatives sympathetic to Christie are hopeful that there will be even more space in 2016 for a candidate who wants the party to expand its popular appeal. Tim Albrecht, a Republican operative in Iowa and former adviser to Gov. Terry Branstad, pointed out that the Iowa House passed a version of the DREAM Act way back in 2004. (The bill, however, did not become law.) \u201cLed by a Republican majority, the Iowa House unanimously passed the Dream Act in 2004,\u201d Albrecht said in an e-mail. \u201cIowa has been ahead of the curve on this issue, and Republicans value fairness. While there will be a vocal minority speaking out against immigration reform, a majority of Republicans and caucus-goers will not take issue with Gov. Christie\u2019s position on the DREAM Act, and in growing circles it will gain him support.\u201d And for those without long memories, one only needs to look back to 2008 to find a Republican candidate who bucked the party faithful on a range of issues, including immigration, and won the presidential nomination. John McCain ran for president while the immigration overhaul he backed was collapsing in Congress. His campaign fell apart in the process, but McCain recovered and mounted a remarkable comeback, facing questions about immigration all the while. In a crowded Republican field, he even won South Carolina, that conservative bastion, by courting the party establishment and cobbling together a coalition of coastal newcomers, moderate suburbanites and national security hawks in a state loaded with military families and veterans. Ever since the Barry Goldwater wipeout of 1964, no Republican candidate has won the Republican nomination without having at least one foot planted firmly on the establishment side of the party divide. This is the bet Christie is making, so don\u2019t expect him to back away from signing the tuition bill, or any of piece of legislation, once he makes his barely concealed presidential campaign official. As long as Christie is up front about where he stands, his positions may not hurt him as much as the right claims, said Robert Cahaly, a longtime Republican operative in South Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s running over a political speed bump, not into a brick wall,\u201d Cahaly said of Christie\u2019s support for the tuition bill. \u201cHe\u2019s got to do what he thinks is right and not apologize for it. Sort of his schtick.\u201d \u201cNow is as good a time as any to get it out of the way,\u201d Cahaly said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like that fight you\u2019ve got to have with your bother over that lawnmower he wrecked. Don\u2019t put it off all summer. It\u2019s better for the Thanksgiving table. South Carolina GOP voters have forgiven and forgotten much more. Ask John McCain.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Congress kicks off new year with fight over extending jobless benefits 1.3 million people lost those benefits when Congress failed to act last month Partisan, midterm election year politics will further complicate the debate Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid plans a first vote Tuesday morning toward renewing unemployment benefits for about 1.3 million Americans who lost them when they expired at the end of December. Democrats and President Barack Obama support the extension \u2013 which had been scheduled for a vote Monday evening but Reid delayed the vote until Tuesday \u2013 while Republicans generally oppose extending those benefits. And with Democrats in control of the Senate and Republicans having a majority in the House, the issue doesn\u2019t seem to be one that will be easy to resolve. 1. The check\u2019s not in the mail Roughly 1.3 million long-term unemployed were affected when Congress failed to continue a 2008 recession-era federal law providing nearly a year of benefits, paid for by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out. As Gene Sperling, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council told CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201c(Monday) is actually the day that 1.3 million Americans will go to the mailbox and find that check missing, the check that they rely on to put food on their table.\u201d 2. New year, old fight Expect a repeat performance of years past when Democrats and Republicans clashed in often dramatic showdowns rife with fiery rhetoric and lengthy filibusters. Democrats argue the program is needed to sustain economic recovery and offer a lifeline to those struggling to keep their head above water financially. Republicans counter the benefits are an economic drain and a disincentive to looking for work. The Congressional Budget Office estimates continuing them for another year will cost about $26 billion. Republican leaders say they would consider extending the benefits but insist that the $26 billion comes from making cuts elsewhere. Reid said Sunday that the government normally doesn\u2019t have to make \u201coffsets\u201d for emergency funding like these benefits and called the Republican demands \u201cfoolishness.\u201d Hillary Clinton encourages extending benefits for jobless 3. Politics at play The legislative fights will take place against the backdrop of a midterm election year. Democrats are refocusing on issues relating to economic inequality, which is important to their base. Many Republicans, including potential 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, have long insisted that the Great Recession-era extension of emergency federal benefits deter job-hunting and are unnecessary as the economy rebounds and unemployment declines. \u201cWhen you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for 99 weeks, you\u2019re causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy,\u201d Paul said on Fox News last month. \u201cAnd it really \u2013 while it seems good, it actually does a disservice to the people you\u2019re trying to help.\u201d CNNMoney: Job search: One year and counting 4. White House wades into the fray The message from the White House on this issue: Bring it on! In his weekly address over the weekend, President Barack Obama blasted Republicans in Congress who \u201cwent home for the holidays and let that lifeline expire.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my New Year\u2019s resolution \u2013 to do everything I can, every single day, to help make 2014 a year in which more of our citizens can earn their own piece of the American Dream,\u201d Obama said in his address. 5. The honeymoon\u2019s over The tone set by this first political showdown could foreshadow the tenor of future fights over funding the federal government, raising the debt ceiling, efforts to try and repeal or roll back portions of the President\u2019s signature health care law and the long-postponed fight over immigration reform.

But redistricting has made it more difficult for Democrats to retake control of the chamber for the first time since 2010. With fewer seats in play, they must capture 17 held by Republicans. Adding to the challenge for Democrats is that a traditionally older midterm electorate tends to favor Republicans. Regardless, they are still making a play and Republicans are defending their turf. Big political fights on horizon for 2014 New info on Benghazi; Obamacare enrollment Media year in review: Politics Here are 5 key races to watch: 5 Senate races to watch in 2014 Florida 13 Take a vacant House seat in a swing district in a purple state and you get what many see as a March 11 special election that could serve as a bellwether for midterms. The national political spotlight will shine on the 13th Congressional District race to fill the remainder of the term of Republican Rep. Bill Young of Florida, who died in October. The district covers most of Pinellas County and parts of St. Petersburg and it\u2019s up for grabs: While Young grabbed 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district. Obama also won it 2008, grabbing 51% support. \u201cIt almost goes without saying, but this is the type of seat and race Democrats have to win in order to have any chance of gaining the 17 seats they need in 2014 to get back to the majority,\u201d wrote Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. Alex Sink, the former chief financial officer of Florida and the 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, is her party\u2019s consensus candidate. David Jolly, who served as a former general counsel for Young and also worked as a lobbyist, will face off against state Sen. Kathleen Peters in the January 14 Republican primary. Arizona 2 A rematch in swing district in southern Arizona will receive plenty of national media attention in 2014. Democratic Rep. Ron Barber is running for re-election in the Tucson area district that he won by less than 2,500 votes in 2012. Barber will face off against the same Republican challenger he edged out last time - retired Air Force Col. Martha McSally. The top 12 campaign questions of 2014 While Barber came out on top in the 2012 contest, GOP nominee Mitt Romney narrowly captured Arizona\u2019s 2nd Congressional District in the presidential election. It\u2019s been in the headlines the past four years. Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords pushed back against the GOP wave in the 2010 midterms and won re-election. But two months later, Giffords was seriously hurt in a shooting that left six people dead. She left Congress in 2012. Barber, a top Giffords aide and who was also injured in the shooting, won the special election to succeed her. Democrats are determined to keep the seat, but Republicans see it as a prime pickup opportunity. Massachusetts 6 This is a race in the Northeast that could produce a lot of intrigue. Incumbent John Tierney has held the solidly Democratic Massachusetts seat since 1997, but nearly lost it in 2012 after his wife\u2019s conviction for her role in her brother\u2019s illegal gambling venture. Displeased Democrats saw an opening after Tierney\u2019s narrow victory, so now he faces a primary test from Seth Moulton, a Marine who served four tours in Iraq and has been able to raise a significant amount of money. The primary winner could face Tierney\u2019s rival last time out, Republican Richard Tisei. He is a longtime state legislator and would be the first openly gay member of the GOP to be elected to Congress. Mostly ignored, shifts emerge in the politics of poverty Idaho 2 There is no question that a Republican is going to win this race but who will it be? The contest in Idaho\u2019s 2nd Congressional District illustrates the deep friction within the Republican Party. Incumbent Mike Simpson has served in the House for 14 years, leads an Appropriations subcommittee, and is a close friend of Speaker John Boehner. But the tea party wing of the GOP wants him out. The influential outside group, Club for Growth, has listed Simpson as one of its primary targets. One of the many things it doesn\u2019t like about him is his vote to reopen the government following the 16-day shutdown in October. The group is backing tea party activist and Idaho Falls attorney Bryan Smith. But Simpson has his friends. The Main Street Partnership, run by former Rep. Steve LaTourette, has vowed to spend $1 million dollars helping him win re-election. When moderates fight back: GOP civil war could be brutal in 2014 elections \u201cThis May 2014 GOP primary has already turned into an all-out proxy war between the GOP\u2019s ideological purists like the Club for Growth .. .and Speaker John Boehner,\u201d Cook Political Report wrote. This is likely to be one of the most expensive - and closely watched - primary House races. California 10 This electoral mood in the central California district currently favors Republican incumbent Jeff Denham. But this race is interesting because it could be closely tied to what happens \u2013 or doesn\u2019t happen \u2013 in Washington this year. The 10th Congressional District includes the city of Modesto and parts of the San Joaquin Valley. It is largely farm land. More than 40% of its residents are Latino, so immigration reform is going likely to be a critical factor for these residents. 4 ways immigration reform could happen - or not Denham has been pushing fellow House Republicans to take up the issue but its fate is uncertain. Bee farmer Michael Eggman has already jumped in the race, running as a Democrat, and Denham\u2019s 2012 challenger, Jose Hernandez, the first Latino NASA astronaut in space, could also be a factor. While Obama won the district with just over 50% of the vote, Cook Political Report predicts the electorate will be more Republican in a non-election year. Honorable mention\u2026 Utah 4 The election in Utah\u2019s 4th Congressional District will be in the national spotlight not because it\u2019s considered a close contest - it\u2019s not - but because of the candidate who\u2019s expected to come out on top come November. Republican Mia Love, an African-American Mormon, lost the 2012 race in the district that stretches from central Utah to the southern suburbs of Salt Lake City to longtime Democratic Rep. Jim Matheson by less than 800 votes. Love, who had the support of tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives, was featured prominently by the national party with a prime speaking slot at the 2012 GOP convention. Love announced in 2013 that she would once again challenge Matheson. But last month, Matheson announced he would retire at the end of his term, making Love the instant frontrunner.

            "article_content": "Rep. Michael Grimm will resign effective Jan. 5, he announced Monday night He plead guilty to tax evasion but had resisted calls to resign The congressman narrowly won re-election after being hit with a 20-count indictment NEW: House Speaker John Boehner called Grimm's decision to step down \"honorable\" Rep. Michael Grimm announced late Monday night plans to resign from Congress, after pleading guilty to a felony tax evasion charge last week. The announcement came just hours after a source familiar with Grimm\u2019s thinking told CNN he would resign \u201csooner rather than later,\u201d after the New York Daily News broke the news of Grimm\u2019s plans to step down. READ: Grimm pleads guilty \u201cAfter much thought and prayer, I have made the very difficult decision to step down from Congress effective January 5th, 2015. This decision is made with a heavy heart, as I have enjoyed a very special relationship and closeness with my constituents, whom I care about deeply,\u201d Grimm said in a statement issued shortly before midnight by his office. The Staten Island congressman was indicted in April on 20 counts relating to his health food restaurant, Healthalicious, including charges that he filed false tax returns; engaged in mail fraud, wire fraud and perjury; and knowingly hired undocumented workers. House Speaker John Boehner called Grimm\u2019s decision to step down \u201chonorable\u201d in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cI know it was made with the best interests of his constituents and the institution in mind, and I appreciate his years of service in the House,\u201d Boehner said. A Republican congressional source said Boehner and Grimm spoke Monday before Grimm announced his plans to resign. During last Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Grimm pleaded guilty to one count of aiding in the filing of a false tax return, a plea that\u2019s expected to bring him months of jail time. In the statement announcing his plans to resign, Grimm said that \u201cthe events which led to this day did not break my spirit, nor the will of the voters,\u201d but that he feels he won\u2019t be able to serve effectively in the new Congress. \u201cHowever, I do not believe that I can continue to be 100% effective in the next Congress, and therefore, out of respect for the Office and the people I so proudly represent, it is time for me to start the next chapter of my life,\u201d he said. The decision to resign marks a change of heart for the Staten Island Republican, who rejected calls to step down after he entered his guilty plea. He apologized for his actions and took responsibility, and said that the unpaid taxes from a New York restaurant he once owned were a mistake. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m able to serve I\u2019m going to serve,\u201d he said. Grimm was re-elected in November and was to be sworn in to a new term in January. While there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution or House Rules barring felons from serving in Congress, the situation created an unwanted headache and negative attention for Boehner as he seeks to head into the new Congress starting with a clean slate. While he gave up his seat on the House Financial Services Committee after he was charged, Grimm repeatedly insisted he would be \u201cfully exonerated.\u201d According to the Daily News, however, Grimm admitted to the conduct alleged in his 20-count indictment in a document to the court. The indictment came down just months before what was already expected to be a tough re-election fight for the perennial Democratic target. His Staten Island-area district went for President Barack Obama in 2012, but despite the cloud of the indictment hanging over his head, Grimm pulled out an easy win over his Democratic challenger in November. His re-election and subsequent guilty plea created problems for Boehner, who \u2014 along with then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor \u2014 in 2010 promised to institute a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for ethics violations within the GOP caucus, which had dogged the party and contributed to its steep losses in the 2006 and 2008 elections. Indeed, in previous situations where House Republicans admitted to criminal or personal ethical lapses, Boehner has worked privately to encourage those members to step aside on their own. But Grimm\u2019s guilty plea wasn\u2019t the only headache he\u2019s caused Boehner over the past year. He drew negative headlines last January when he was caught on camera threatening to throw a reporter off a balcony and break him in half \u201clike a boy,\u201d after the reporter asked about an investigation into his campaign finances. Grimm\u2019s resignation will spark a competitive special election for his seat, and potential contenders have already begun lining up. Former Democratic Rep. Michael McMahon, who narrowly lost to Grimm in 2010, has reportedly expressed interest in a bid for his old seat. Republican candidates, according to the Daily News, could include Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis and state Sen. Andrew Lanza.

            "article_content": "New York Rep. Michael Grimm pled guilty to tax evasion but said he would remain in Congress Prosecutors asked a judge to give the lawmaker between 24 and 30 months of jail time There is no rule against felons serving in Congress, but little precedent for it either After pleading guilty to a judge Tuesday on a felony tax evasion charge, New York Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican, pledged to reporters he would also stay in Congress. Grimm pled guilty in court to one count of tax evasion and was set to submit to a \u201cstatement of facts\u201d that admits to all the conduct alleged in the 20-count federal indictment. Do scandals matter anymore in elections? Reporter threatened by Rep. Grimm reacts How not to ruin your first year in Congress A statement from federal prosecutors in New York released on Tuesday after Grimm\u2019s court appearance noted that in addition to the tax evasion plea, Grimm also publicly admitted to hiring undocumented workers, lying under oath while serving in Congress, obstructing federal and state officials, and cheating employees out of employment insurance claims. FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Venizelos stated, \u201cThe public expects their elected officials at all levels of government to behave honorably, or at a minimum, lawfully.  As his guilty plea demonstrates, Grimm put self-interest above public service.\u201d Grimm apologized for his actions and took responsibility, but said the unpaid taxes from a New York restaurant he once owned were all a big mistake. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m able to serve I\u2019m going to serve,\u201d Grimm said. Reelected in November, he was is set to be sworn in to a new term in January. Prosecutors asked a judge to sentence Grimm on June 8th to 24 to 36 months of jail time. His defense team suggested 12 - 18 months. Can a Congressman serve from behind bars? If recent history is any guide it\u2019s unlikely that Grimm will serve out his third term that starts in January even though there is nothing in the Constitution or House Rules against felons serving in Congress. There isn\u2019t much historical precedent for it either, although one Congressman in the 1990s, Republican Jay Kim, shuffled around Capitol Hill wearing an ankle bracelet after he was convicted of 10 misdemeanors. Grimm\u2019s felony plea is a more serious matter. While Grimm said Tuesday he has talked to House leadership about his situation, he has not yet spoken with House Speaker John Boehner and Boehner has not publicly weighed in on whether Grimm should step down. But Boehner has made it clear during his time in leadership that he has little patience for those members admitting to any wrongdoing. \u201cWe won\u2019t have any announcements until the Speaker discusses the matter with Mr. Grimm,\u201d said Boehner\u2019s spokesman Michael Steel. Calls for Grimm to resign are sure to mount and GOP leaders would prefer not to deal with questions about a felon remaining in the Republican conference when they open up the new session in 2015. In previous cases where House Republicans admitted to ethical lapses \u2013 criminal or personal \u2013 Boehner has worked privately to encourage scandal plagued members to step aside on their own. Former Florida GOP Rep. Trey Radel, who pled guilty to cocaine possession last year, initially sought treatment for drug addiction, but resigned two months later.  When half naked pictures surfaced online of Rep. Chris Lee of New York soliciting an encounter with a woman on Craigslist he quickly stepped down.  Indiana Republican Mark Souder resigned his seat one day after admitting he had an affair with an aide. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called Tuesday on Boehner \u201cto insist that Congressman Grimm resign immediately.\u201d Democrats were frustrated they were unable to defeat Grimm in November\u2019s midterm election, even with the 20-count federal indictment hanging over him.  He also grabbed national headlines last January for threatening to toss a reporter over a balcony on Capitol Hill after being asked about the allegations. If Grimm does eventually decide to resign, Democrats have a good chance to pick up that seat in a special election.  A spokesman for the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm is already accusing Boehner of covering up for Grimm. \u201cAfter Speaker Boehner abetted Grimm\u2019s lies to voters about his guilt in this past election, he owes it to the constituents and the Congress to make sure Michael Grimm doesn\u2019t serve in this next Congress,\u201d Josh Scherwin, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But a senior House Republican leadership aide points out that Pelosi has not forced out those Democrats who faced ethics investigations. \u201cAfter standing behind Reps. Bill Jefferson, Charlie Rangel, Jack Murtha, and many others, Rep. Pelosi has zero credibility of these issues,\u201d the aide told CNN. Jefferson\u2019s trial drug out on Capitol Hill and for a time pitted House leaders from both parties against the Justice Department, which wanted to raid his office after they found $100,000 found in his home freezer. It took some time before Pelosi and Democrats stripped Jefferson of his powerful post on the tax writing committee. He ultimately lost a bid for reelection and is serving a 13-year sentence for bribery. While Murtha and Rangel faced ethics inquiries, neither was indicted for criminal wrongdoing. Rangel was censured by his colleagues in the House for ethics violations, including failing to pay taxes, but continues to serve in Congress. Murtha, who was a top Pelosi soldier, died in 2010 while still in office. If Grimm wants to remain in Congress he\u2019ll likely face some type of punishment handed down from the House Ethics Committee, a process that could drag out for months. The panel deferred its review at the request of the Department of Justice, and under its rules will have to vote to renew its investigation when the next session begins in January. The committee declined to comment to CNN on the Grimm case. Grimm has already given up his seat on the House Financial Services Committee, but depending on his sentence he could be forced under House ethics rules to also refrain from voting on the House floor. If the Ethics committee votes that Rep Grimm\u2019s actions broke House rules he could face punishments ranging from reprimand - the mildest public condemnation -to censure or expulsion.  The last time the House voted to expel a member was in 2002, after Democratic Rep Jim Traficant was convicted of bribery and tax evasion charges. The House has only expelled five members in its entire history. Three of those were during the Civil War era for disloyalty. Another, Rep. Michael (Ozzy) Myers of Pennsylvania was expelled in 1980 after a bribery conviction. CNN\u2019s Evan Perez and Yon Pomrenze contributed to this story",

            "article_content": "New York Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican, is expected to plead guilty to tax evasion, per a source Grimm was indicted in April on 20 counts, including filing false tax returns and mail fraud Grimm will appear before a Brooklyn judge at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, according to a law enforcement official 2:20 p.m. update: Rep. Michael Grimm pleaded guilty to one charge of tax evasion. Update: Rep. Michael Grimm, R-New York, is expected to sign a \u201cstatement of facts\u201d admitting that he evaded taxes as alleged by the federal government in a 20-count indictment, although Grimm will only plead guilty to one count of tax evasion, law enforcement sources said. The sources added that prosecutors will push for Grimm to serve at least some federal prison time after his guilty plea. Grimm is set to be sworn in as a re-elected member of Congress in January, although his colleagues could choose to expel him from the body. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday that Grimm should resign. \u201cNow that the election is over, Congressman Grimm is finally admitting the truth to his constituents,\u201d she said. \u201cClearly, Speaker Boehner must insist that Congressman Grimm resign immediately.\u201d Original post: New York Republican Congressman Michael Grimm will plead guilty to one count of tax evasion on Tuesday in a New York court, according to a U.S. law enforcement official. The charge can bring some prison time, but it\u2019s not clear whether Grimm will be sentenced with any. After being indicted in April on 20 counts of filing false tax returns, mail fraud, wire fraud, hiring undocumented workers and perjury, Grimm insisted he did nothing wrong and pled not guilty. His trial was scheduled to begin in February. READ: Bad boys survive to win re-election But a U.S. law enforcement official tells CNN that Grimm will appear before a Brooklyn judge at 1 p.m. on Tuesday and admit he deliberately misled the Internal Revenue Service, a move that throws his congressional future into jeopardy. Reporter threatened by Rep. Grimm reacts Federal prosecutors say Grimm failed to report $1 million from his restaurant business in Manhattan prior to his 2010 election to Congress. Rep. Grimm: Indictment is a 'witch hunt' Democrats hoped the federal indictment against the House Republican last spring would mean Grimm\u2019s constituents would toss him out. But despite efforts by his Democratic opponent, Domenic Recchia, to paint him as corrupt, Grimm was easily re-elected in November for third term. Rep. Grimm indicted for tax fraud Grimm attracted national attention last year even before his high-profile legal troubles when he threatened to throw a reporter over a Capitol Hill balcony at the end of an interview.  Grimm was captured on a hot mic after the President\u2019s State of the Union speech berating the reporter for pressing him on allegations of wrongdoing. He later apologized for his behavior. Grimm gave up his seat on the House Financial Services Committee after he was charged, but repeatedly insisted he would be \u201cfully exonerated.\u201d The House Ethics Committee began an investigation into Grimm\u2019s activities last spring, but recently announced it was deferring action on the matter at the request of the Justice Department. With Grimm\u2019s new plea, the committee could decide early next year to renew its investigation and consider some type of punishment. There will also likely be pressure on Grimm to step down from Congress. Grimm\u2019s congressional office and his attorney did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Republicans pushing suit over Obama executive actions, 5 Republicans vote no They say the President is violating the law by circumventing Congress Democrats say the suit is just a primer for a Republican-led impeachment of Obama Speaker John Boehner says there are no impeachment plans; Democrats raising money off it The Republican-led House approved a resolution on Wednesday authorizing Speaker John Boehner to sue President Barack Obama over claims he abused his powers at the expense of Congress and the Constitution. The vote was 225-201. Republicans argue Obama\u2019s executive orders in a number of areas were unlawful because it\u2019s the job of Congress to make or change laws. But they believe his handling of the Affordable Care act gives them the best chance at proving their case, and are basing the suit on that issue. House approves lawsuit against Obama An impeachment conspiracy? Boehner: No GOP plans to impeach Obama House authorization now allows GOP-leaders to have the unusual challenge filed in federal court. The time frame for that is not clear and many legal experts question whether any judge would take it on. Obama tells Congress: Stop hatin' Not a single House Democrat voted for the resolution and five Republicans opposed it. They were: GOP members Paul Broun of Georgia, Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Steve Stockman of Texas, and Walter Jones of North Carolina. The vote takes partisan rancor in Washington to a new level less than four months before congressional midterms with control of the Senate at stake. The focus on Obamacare also magnifies politics around the sweeping health law Republicans didn\u2019t support and have tried to derail since its approval in 2010. It also illustrates Obama\u2019s attempts to act on his own with he and Congress getting nowhere on  top-shelf legislative initiatives. Dems claim impeachment coming Democrats quickly seized to turn the debate on the lawsuit, saying prior to the vote that the real desire of the GOP is to ultimately impeach Obama. Boehner, who has repeatedly said he disagrees with those pushing impeachment, attempted to shut down that discussion this week. Insisting that Republicans have \u201cno plans\u201d and \u201cno future plans\u201d to impeach Obama, Boehner denounced the talk of it as \u201ca scam started by Democrats at the White House.\u201d But Democrats seized on polls showing a majority of Americans oppose any effort to remove the President from office, and aren\u2019t letting go of the issue. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the lawsuit was \u201con a path to nowhere or maybe among some in your ranks, a path to impeachment.\u201d Apparently not satisfied with Boehner\u2019s assurance, Pelosi directed this at him: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to hear people use the word impeachment, as your people have done, then tell them impeachment is off the table.\u201d CNN poll on suit, impeachment Obama tweaks GOP on impeachment Obama, himself, tweaked Republicans on Wednesday. In Kansas City, Missouri, he noted the House was about to leave Washington for the month of August, but \u201cthe main vote that they have scheduled for today is whether or not they decide to sue me for doing my job.\u201d During debate, Democrats lined up on their side of the chamber and one after the other requested that GOP leaders allow votes on measures to raise the minimum wage, extend jobless benefits, and ensure pay equity. They knew Republicans wouldn\u2019t hold off on the lawsuit to take any of those issues up, but the the theater was designed to underscore their argument that the majority party was focused on the lawsuit rather than legislating. The campaign arm for House Democrats arm has raised $7.6 million from appeals to supporters citing the suit and tied it to the threat of impeachment. Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,  defended the aggressive public push and pledged Democrats would continue it through the midterm election in November. \u201cYou bet we\u2019re going to run on a Congress that is just obsessed with lawsuits, suing the President, talking about impeaching him, instead of solutions for the middle class,\u201d Israel told CNN. Americans don\u2019t like suit, impeachment A CNN/ORC International poll released last week showed those Americans surveyed, by a 57%-41% margin, opposed the lawsuit. Nearly two-thirds said Obama should not be impeached. Texas Republican Pete Sessions responded to Democratic refrains that the resolution was the first step toward impeachment. He said the House voted in 1998 to impeach Bill Clinton because \u201che lied to an FBI agent, he lied to a federal grand jury, and he violated the federal law which was a felony.\u201d But in Obama\u2019s case, Republicans believe he isn\u2019t \u201cfaithfully executing the laws,\u201d which he has sworn to do, and \u201cthat is an entirely different process.\u201d Oregon Republican Greg Walden, chairman of the House Republican\u2019s political operation, said \u201cimpeachment is not on table.\u201d And he issued a warning to fellow Republicans at a meeting, saying that any time the GOP raised the issue it only helped Democrats. The Obamacare focus When Boehner announced last month that he would sue Obama, he followed a course many tea party members and conservatives had urged for months. They were especially angered by actions Obama took without consulting Congress to change or delay key Obamacare provisions, to allow children of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country, and to release Taliban prisoners from U.S. custody in exchange for Afghan war prisoner Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Initially, Boehner indicated the House would sue over Obama\u2019s decision last summer to delay for a year a central health law requirement for businesses provide health coverage to their employees. The House voted to do the same thing last July, but Republicans argued they did so to protect the integrity of Congress in the face of what they believed was executive overreach. After consulting legal experts, the House resolution was tweaked to give Boehner more flexibility. It specified that the suit can cite the administration\u2019s implementation of any provision of Obamacare. The House\u2019s Office of General Counsel will represent the House in court and the resolution gives it the authority to hire outside lawyers to finalize the legal strategy and file a formal complaint. Many constitutional experts have raised doubts that the courts will take up the case. The legal burden will be on the House to present how it was damaged as an institution by the President\u2019s actions. Analysis: Obama impeachment talk just political theater",

            "article_content": "House Republicans say they'll sue President Obama over his health care reforms Is it a constitutional challenge or election-year politics? Legal experts argue over who is right Challenges exist to getting a lawsuit before a judge They tried in Congress, at the ballot box and in the Supreme Court, but Republicans have been unable to stop Obamacare. Now they have a new angle: suing President Barack Obama over changes in enforcing his signature health care reforms. House Speaker John Boehner framed the issue as a matter of presidential overreach when he announced the focus of the lawsuit on Thursday. \u201cIn 2013, the President changed the health care law without a vote of Congress, effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it,\u201d Boehner said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way our system of government was designed to work. No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own,\u201d he said. Boehner: Why we must sue the President Cutter: Suing Obama a waste of tax money Obama and Democrats called that premise malarkey. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sue me for doing my job?  OK,\u201d the President told an applauding crowd Thursday in Austin, Texas, using the opportunity to take a jab at congressional dysfunction he blames on Republican obstruction. \u201cThink about that,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to use taxpayer money to sue me for doing my job while you don\u2019t do your job.\u201d The issue blends constitutional debate on the balance of government powers with the partisan fervor of election-year politics. Here are some questions that help provide a deeper look: 1) What\u2019s this all about, anyway? Obama and Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 with no Republican votes. Ever since, the political right has tried to derail the law nicknamed Obamacare, with affection by the President and derision by his foes. Conservatives despise the measure that requires Americans obtain health insurance as part of reforms intended to lower the overall cost of U.S. health care, calling it an unworkable government expansion. Lawsuits challenging it as unconstitutional wound their way through the appeals process to the Supreme Court, which ruled it legal in 2012. Republicans led by presidential nominee Mitt Romney ran against it that year, making repeal of Obamacare a major campaign promise. Voters re-elected Obama and kept Democrats in control of the Senate, while Republicans maintained their House majority. House Republicans have voted more than 40 times to repeal or dismantle the law, but their efforts never advanced in the Senate. Now Boehner and his GOP colleagues are focusing on Obama\u2019s 2013 decision to delay a provision in the health care law that requires employers with more than 50 workers provide them with health insurance. The so-called employer mandate originally was to take effect on January 1, but the administration\u2019s move put it off for a year to allow more time for the transition. Another revision in February further extended the mandate\u2019s phase-in. 2) Thanks, but what\u2019s it really about? Election-year politics, mostly. Republicans contend Obama has routinely expanded his executive powers through presidential orders and other actions that usurp the authority of Congress granted by the Constitution. As examples, they cite a decision to stop deporting some young undocumented immigrants, as well as the employer mandate revision. Until now, none of the grievances reached the level of a lawsuit by the GOP-controlled House against the President. Thursday\u2019s announcement of the Obamacare focus came less than four months before congressional elections that Republicans hope will generate a huge conservative turnout to hold their House majority and seize control of the Senate. Boehner denied any political motive, telling reporters \u201cit\u2019s not about Republicans versus Democrats.\u201d \u201cThis is about the legislative branch that\u2019s being disadvantaged by the executive branch,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here are places where the President is basically rewriting law to make it fit his own needs.\u201d On Friday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the move \u201ca taxpayer-funded political stunt\u201d that he said failed to reflect the nation\u2019s priorities. 3) So did Obama overreach? Depends to whom you talk. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told the House Judiciary Committee in December that delaying the employer mandate provision of the health care law \u201ccrossed the constitutional line.\u201d Noting the original start date for the mandate was \u201ca matter of considerable debate within Congress during deliberations,\u201d Turley said \u201cno express power\u201d existed for the President to change it. Not so, countered Simon Lazarus, senior counsel of the at the progressive-minded Constitutional Accountability Center. \u201cThese critics fault the Obama administration for making necessary adjustments in timing and matching enforcement priorities with resources and practical, humanitarian and other exigencies,\u201d Lazarus told the same December hearing. \u201cBut exercising presidential judgment in carrying laws into execution is precisely what the Constitution requires.\u201d 4) Typical lawyers. Please make it simple for me. The question is whether Obama exercised more power than allowed in changing how the health care law works. Reihan Salam, a conservative CNN political commentator, noted the Supreme Court recently voted 9-0 against Obama over recess appointments he made without congressional approval. \u201cThere are many people who agree that this president has gone too far in abusing his executive power,\u201d Salam said Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s not about Democrats and Republicans. That\u2019s about our system of government.\u201d Democrats point out the lawsuit challenges a presidential action similar to steps taken by Obama\u2019s predecessors, such as GOP President George W. Bush\u2019s waiving of penalties for impoverished senior citizens who missed the deadline for enrolling in Medicare Part D in 2006. \u201cPresidents get to deal with the implementation of these laws through the administrative process,\u201d said Democratic strategist and CNN Contributor Donna Brazile. Ironically, House Republicans voted last year to delay the employer mandate just like Obama eventually did, but they are now planning to challenge Obama for it in court. Senate Democrats never took up the matter because it would have reopened debate on the health care law as the administration prepared to fully implement it. Asked about such an apparent reversal, Republicans say they were right back then and now, because Congress \u2013 not the President \u2013 is supposed to make such a change. 5) So what happens next? The House Rules Committee will hold a hearing next week on the proposal to sue Obama, with the GOP-led panel expected to approve it. However, legal experts say challenges remain to getting the case before a judge. For example, House Republicans must establish legal standing to file such a lawsuit, which means proving that Obama\u2019s action harmed the legislature as an institution. Meanwhile, the partisan carping and finger-pointing will continue in Washington. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta and Dana Davidsen contributed to this report.",

Walter Jones has represented his North Carolina district for 20 years Jones, 71, is an anti-war social conservative with a libertarian streak Primary challenger Taylor Griffin, 38, is a former Bush administration official The face off doesn't fit neatly into the tea party-versus-establishment narrative The wind is whipping up as Taylor Griffin stands on a tiny sliver of sand on Cape Hatteras on a recent afternoon, listening to a family whose entire livelihood might soon tumble into the sea. The Atlantic Ocean is just a few feet away, and high tide is coming in. These are the waves that have been steadily eroding one of the country\u2019s most storied beaches for a generation, threatening a pencil-thin stretch of barrier islands, the Outer Banks, that produce hundreds of millions of dollars in yearly tourism revenue for the state. Carol Dawson and her son, Jeff, own several businesses here, including the Cape Hatteras Motel, an oceanfront structure propped up by wooden beams and, these days, piles of sandbags. The Dawsons complain that the federal government \u2014 mainly, the National Park Service and their congressman, Rep. Walter Jones \u2014 have abandoned them. Their beaches haven\u2019t been nourished in decades, crucial access roads have been breached by hurricanes, and endangered sea turtles are offered more protections than the 4,000 or so full-time residents of Hatteras Island. \u201cEveryone on this beach, every building on this beach, is one storm away from losing everything,\u201d Carol Dawson says. Griffin is promising to help. \u201cIf you have a congressman who is focused on your issues, we are going to be able to resolve these things,\u201d he says as his dog, a 2-year old barbet, bounces around in the sand. \u201cA congressman who actually calls the Park Service. If you\u2019re on the Resources Committee, you get the chairman to call a hearing, and you drag them up publicly and have them explain themselves if need be. It\u2019s time to fight back. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do.\u201d IP: Changes to GOP's Obamacare strategy? Are Democrats backing away from Obamacare? The Political Reality of Obamacare 8 million in Obamacare Obama: Time for political fight to end A 38-year-old mop-topped bachelor, Griffin is running to unseat Jones, who has represented North Carolina\u2019s 3rd Congressional District for 20 years, in the May 6 Republican primary. It\u2019s one of the 2014 election\u2019s most intriguing primary fights, a face off that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into the tea party-versus-establishment narrative that\u2019s defined so much GOP infighting over the last four years. Jones, 71, is an anti-war social conservative with a libertarian streak who regularly bucks his fellow House Republicans on big votes. Griffin is the challenger, a first-time candidate, former Bush administration official and Washington political operative who has the backing of big-spending outside groups. It\u2019s a strongly Republican district; the primary winner will likely coast to victory in November. In a year when the GOP establishment is working hard to box out grass-roots insurgents, Griffin is running on a primary challenge premised on the notion that sometimes it\u2019s OK for Republicans to work with the government, and with fellow members of Congress, to get something done. Griffin is a conventional Republican on the big issues of the day, promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, stand up for the military and oppose abortion and \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented immigrants. Will GOP\u2019s Obamacare focus pay off? Why are some Democrats running from Obamacare? But here on the North Carolina coast, the primary is as much about localized issues like federal buoy funding, inlet dredging and protections for fishermen \u2013 and Griffin is attempting to make his grasp of Washington a chief selling point. Unlike Jones, he says he\u2019s willing to cut deals, horse-trade and generally play nice with other elected officials and appointees if his district needs it. \u201cThere is a very practical issue of what being a congressman means,\u201d Griffin says of Jones. \u201cWhen you have a congressman who has been ranked the most liberal Republican, Republicans don\u2019t trust him. And when you are a Republican, Democrats don\u2019t trust you. So you don\u2019t have a lot of allies to get things done. You can congratulate yourself for sticking your finger in (House Speaker John) Boehner\u2019s eye, but the district is going to suffer for it.\u201d No longer a conservative? Griffin is correct that Jones doesn\u2019t have many friends in Washington, at least among the Republican leadership. He was booted off the House Financial Services Committee two years ago for voting against Boehner one too many times. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sacrifice my integrity for anyone or any party,\u201d Jones said after he was removed from the committee, according to The Washington Times. \u201cIt\u2019s the price you pay. I didn\u2019t come up here to be a puppet for anyone. And I think the public back in my district, which is the most important, has seen I\u2019m willing to do what I think is right.\u201d Jones abides some aspects of Republican dogma but flouts others. He is an avowed cultural conservative who wants to trim spending \u2014 unless the cuts affect veterans or the poor. He opposes the Affordable Care Act. But he voted in favor of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, infuriating Wall Street, and he opposed several versions of Paul Ryan\u2019s budget proposals because they did not cut enough foreign aid. \u201cHe has gone out of his way to aggravate not just the leadership but also the rank-and-file members of the Republican caucus in Washington,\u201d says Marc Rotterman, a North Carolina political strategist who advised Jones for more than a decade. \u201cHis ability to get anything done is minimal at best. I can\u2019t think of one piece of significant legislation he has passed that helped the district in the last 20 years.\u201d Rotterman stopped working for Jones in 2008. \u201cHe is no longer a conservative,\u201d he says. \u201cHe has changed from a Reagan, Gingrich Republican to having the most pro-Obama voting record of any Republican in Congress.\u201d In 2012, National Journal magazine rated Jones as the \u201cmost liberal Republican\u201d in Congress, a talking point Griffin lets fly at campaign events. A former Democrat, Jones was first elected to Congress in the GOP tidal wave of 1994. For a decade, he was a loyal Republican, representing a socially conservative district with a heavy population of military retirees and active servicemen. Then the Iraq war rolled around. A foreign policy clash At first, Jones backed the military action; he\u2019s perhaps most famous for proposing that French fries in the House cafeteria be re-named \u201cfreedom fries\u201d in protest of France\u2019s opposition to the war. But after attending a memorial service for a Marine sergeant from his district, Jones had a remarkable change of heart. He became a sharp critic of President George W. Bush\u2019s foreign policy and began supporting Democratic efforts to withdraw troops from Iraq. In private, Jones was writing thousands of apology letters to the families of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the years since, Jones has ramped up his anti-war rhetoric and his fierce opposition to foreign aid, drawing the ire of a hawkish outside group that\u2019s now running blistering television ads against him in the primary. \u201cLyndon Johnson\u2019s probably rotting in hell right now because of the Vietnam War, and he probably needs to move over for Dick Cheney,\u201d Jones said at a Young Americans for Liberty conference in Raleigh. Jones supported Ron Paul, the anti-war libertarian icon, for president. Today, he\u2019s a board member on the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity. The Emergency Committee For Israel, a neoconservative pro-Israel group, has spent more than a quarter of a million dollars on a pair of ominous television ads hammering Jones, saying he \u201cpreaches American decline\u201d and opposes sanctions on Iran. \u201cHe\u2019s changed,\u201d one ad says. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time your vote changed as well?\u201d \u201cJones\u2019 constituents may not be fully aware of just how much he\u2019s changed and just how far he\u2019s gone in terms of support in drastic cuts to the defense budget, an isolationist foreign policy, and forming alliances with kooky and conspiratorial elements of the political scene,\u201d said Noah Pollak, the committee\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe want to make sure that the people of the district understand where he is today and what he stands for.\u201d Jones\u2019 isolationist foreign policy might seem out of step with a district that includes Camp LeJeune, the home to one-fifth of the Marine Corps, and the air station Cherry Point. Jones\u2019 allies are quick to stress that his opposition to military action does not come at the expense of veterans back home. \u201cWalter has always taken care of us,\u201d said Joseph McCammond, an Army and Marine veteran from Morehead City, who said Jones has repeatedly voted to protect benefits for military retirees. McCammond, a friend and confidante of Jones for decades, said plenty of people in the district disagree with the congressman\u2019s views. But they still respect him. \u201cI like people that believe in something and stand for something,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that Walter does. He has always been honest about his convictions.\u201d Aides to Jones did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the race. Another outside group, the Ending Spending Action Fund, a super PAC founded by billionaire businessman Joe Ricketts, has invested even more money attacking Jones on the airwaves and in the mail. \u201cCongressman Jones has opposed the Ryan budget,\u201d said Brian Baker, the group\u2019s president. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. Congressman Jones is the No. 1 supporter of the President in the House Republican Conference, and we oppose his re-election for those reasons.\u201d Jones\u2019 strongest challenge Jones has faced tough primary challengers before, most recently in 2008 against Army veteran Joe McLaughlin, but political leaders in the district are starting to agree that Griffin, buoyed by the outside money clogging the airwaves and mailboxes, represents Jones\u2019 biggest threat since taking office. \u201cI am seeing a lot more coming out of the Walter Jones campaign than I can recall in the past,\u201d said state Rep. Bob Steinburg, an Edenton resident who is not supporting either candidate. \u201cThat would indicate to me that he is taking this challenge very seriously. This is the strongest one.\u201d Like many Republicans here, Steinburg still believes Jones will win. He has an edge for many reasons, not the least of which is his name. Jones\u2019 father represented eastern North Carolina in Congress for almost 30 years before his death in 1992. The younger Jones runs a congressional office with an impressive reputation for constituent services, helping blunt Griffin\u2019s claims that he ignores the district. \u201cWhen I call him with a constituent problem that\u2019s come to me, and when I follow up, I\u2019ve never seen a case when they weren\u2019t helped,\u201d said state Sen. Norman Sanderson. Also complicating matters: The 3rd District is only loosely covered by a trio of small media markets and difficult to penetrate with television ads alone, putting a premium on mail, radio, phone calls, digital efforts and old-fashioned in-person campaigning. Accompanied by his campaign manager, Doug Raymond, a former talk radio host and area campaign operative, and Dan Ronayne, a GOP strategist and friend from Washington, Griffin has racked up tens of thousands of miles in his truck, navigating the back roads that slice through the forests, swamps and farmland of the tough-to-get-around district. He has made an impression. At the district\u2019s annual GOP convention in Havelock earlier this month, Griffin asked the crowd of roughly 200 activists how many of them had been contacted in person by his campaign, either by the candidate or one of his supporters. Nearly everyone in the room raised a hand. He asked the same about Jones. Only a few hands popped up. Griffin\u2019s biggest impediment, aside from introducing himself to voters, is his reputation as a Washington insider. He grew up in Wilson, keeps a home in New Bern and shares a boat, docked in Wilmington, with his brother. But he went to Washington after college to work for Sen. Jesse Helms, and later for the Bush administration and the 2008 presidential campaign of John McCain. After President Obama took office, he joined Hamilton Place Strategies, a Washington public affairs firm that represents a variety of investment management funds and financial interests. Griffin has received campaign contributions from GOP grandees like former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and a raft of former Bush administration officials, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer and national security adviser Juan Zarate. J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America have also given to his campaign. A Washington insider? Jones supporters have used all this against him, deriding Griffin as a carpetbagger in local letters to the editor. Jones punctuates his advertisements with the blunt reminder: \u201cHe\u2019s one of us.\u201d Jones recently enlisted Dot Helms, Jesse\u2019s widow, to star in a radio ad in which she calls Griffin \u201ca fancy Washington insider.\u201d On the stump, Griffin has tried to turn his Washington experience into a plus. In the Bush administration, he says, he worked in the Treasury Department, scrutinizing terrorist financing. In the McCain campaign, he worked for Sarah Palin and helped her fend off \u201cattacks from the liberal media.\u201d \u201cThere are people that are going to criticize me for the time I spent in Washington working for Jesse Helms, or in the White House for George W. Bush after 9/11 tracking down terrorist finances,\u201d he said during a campaign stop at the Shipwreck Grill in Buxton. \u201cSo if you want to call me a Washington insider for that, guilty.\u201d As a campaigner, Griffin is often reserved and polite to a fault, but he becomes noticeably more animated when defending his resume. \u201cThere are a lot of people who have some admiration for my opponent because they say he is independent and he stands up for what he believes in,\u201d Griffin says. \u201cHe also votes with Barack Obama, by the way, more than any other House Republican. Still, some people say that\u2019s a good thing. The bad thing is, he is not working with anyone. There is nobody that\u2019s going to work with him. It\u2019s a team sport. It is.\u201d Beyond the hunches of local political watchers, who believe Griffin is gaining late traction but may come up just short on primary day, it\u2019s difficult to tell if his message is taking hold. There has been no reliable public polling of the race. The Crystal Coast Tea Party Patriots, one of the district\u2019s leading grass-roots organizations, offered a clue this week when it announced its ballot recommendations for primary day. In the U.S. Senate primary, the group endorsed Greg Brannon, a Rand Paul-backed libertarian, over the GOP establishment\u2019s choice, Thom Tillis. In the House primary, they picked Griffin. 2014: What\u2019s at stake Key races to watch Special Coverage: The 2014 midterms",

Two leading GOP 2016 contenders, the freshmen Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, are in a public spat over foreign policy that quickly became framed around what seems to be the perennial GOP question: Who is the heir to Ronald Reagan? And while that plays out, two of the right\u2019s outspoken and at times outlandish voices are in a war of words over whether conservatives should see Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell as a hero or a heretic. These debates are entertaining and interesting, not to mention telling snapshots of the struggle within the Republican Party and conservative movement to find a consensus message \u2013 and acceptable messengers. Potential 2016 presidential candidates Inside Politics: Florida 13 Results CPAC winners and losers Inside Politics: Will he run? Some of it should look familiar to Democrats who remember the years between Mondale \u201984 and Clinton \u201892: a party in exile from the White House has no singular leader, and so has more open, and vocal, competition over policy and personalities. Then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and his merry band of Democratic Leadership Council centrists argued the Democratic Party was too liberal, too tied to big labor and too afraid to talk about things like work requirements in welfare programs. No, perhaps they didn\u2019t have the notoriety of today\u2019s tea party. But those were not exactly days of Democratic unity. \u201cDemocrats for the Leisure Class,\u201d was the label Jesse Jackson put on Clinton and the DLC. It was great political theater, and like the Republican tug-of-war today an instructive look at the tensions in a party that at the time was strong at the congressional level but not credible at the presidential level. My, how the tide has turned. Republicans now control the House and have a good chance to take control of the Senate in this year\u2019s midterm elections. 2014 midterm elections But those successes haven\u2019t eased the demographic crisis that confronts Republicans at the presidential level: If the GOP can\u2019t improve its standing among Latinos, African-Americans and millennials, then the path to 270 electoral votes will get more difficult with each passing day. The demographic changes in America are the GOP\u2019s inconvenient truth. And so their transition plays out now just as it did for Democrats in the late \u201980s and early \u201890s. Cruz sees the tea party message as the GOP\u2019s future. Paul has a more cobblestone or patchwork approach: His dad\u2019s libertarian band as a base, a slice of the tea party pie as a building block, and then outreach, not always successful, to younger voters and African-Americans and \u2013 God forbid \u2013 even to the GOP establishment. Purity vs. pluralism, sort of. They are hardly the only voices. Another freshman senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, had the first crack at being labeled the GOP savior, then rankled some of the base with his support of a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Rubio is stirring anew, with tough talk on foreign policy and a focus on poverty. Texas Gov. Rick Perry is proof that second chances are an American political tradition. He bombed in 2012. But don\u2019t count him out. As Cruz and Paul exchange barbs in the \u201cWho is the next Ronald Reagan\u201d debate, remember Reagan was a governor and an optimist. Perry is both of those. And remember Reagan\u2019s critics, including early competitors within the GOP, wrote him off as not too bright. Reagan had the last laugh and then some. Perry is angling to get that chance in 2016, and should not be discounted. Is McConnell in trouble? Rubio: Obama's foreign policy 'flawed' Can Perry run again for president? GOP preaches to the base at CPAC But as the party decides who its leader should be, it must also answer the question of what its message is. It is there that the integration of the tea party and libertarians into the GOP causes so many interesting policy ripples. This will undoubtedly play out in the 2016 GOP presidential nominating contests \u2013 when the leader question is paramount. But it is playing out now as well, in the fight over McConnell. To the tea party, the question isn\u2019t so much McConnell\u2019s voting record. Instead, its argument is he should be judged by the company he keeps \u2013 or wants to keep. As in former Sens. Robert Bennett and Richard Lugar, both defeated by tea party primary challengers. Or Trey Grayson, who was McConnell\u2019s choice in the Kentucky Senate GOP primary ultimately won by Paul. Or Charlie Crist, a Democrat now but the choice of McConnell and the GOP establishment in the primary. To critics, all are moderates too willing to compromise with Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the candidates McConnell has supported instead of the conservatives,\u201d Red State\u2019s Erick Erickson writes in his latest column urging support for McConnell\u2019s tea party challenger this year. Another vocal and often controversial voice on the right, Ann Coulter, is a leading McConnell defender. She notes his opposition to campaign finance law changes that have helped Democrats; and his disciplined work to get every GOP senator to vote against Obamacare, which she says gives the party a much stronger 2014 midterm message. And she notes his leadership in forcing the Obama White House to accept the forced budget cuts known as the sequester. \u201cEven Ronald Reagan didn\u2019t cut federal spending!\u201d Coulter wrote in a column this week. \u201cMcConnell did \u2013 and that was with a Democratic president and a Democratic majority in the Senate.\u201d She laments  a \u201cright-wing mob\u201d and \u201cnonsensical jeremiads against McConnell on the RedState blog.\u201d Erickson says it isn\u2019t so. \u201cThere\u2019s no right wing mob on the march,\u201d he writes on RedState. \u201cThere\u2019s just a cleaning crew. If we don\u2019t clean up our own side, the general election voters surely will.\u201d McConnell raised eyebrows by telling The New York Times he was confident the establishment would prevail over the tea party challengers and their conservative funding sources, vowing to \u201ccrush them everywhere.\u201d \u201cCrush or be crushed,\u201d was Erickson\u2019s retort. We will see if there is a clear winner in this round as the 2014 primaries play out, and then as we watch the November 2014 results. Whatever the outcome, some of these tensions will carry over into the 2016 nominating contest. Sometimes, as both Reagan and Clinton proved, these internal tensions can only be settled, or at least more neatly managed, by winning the White House.",

            "article_content": "Sen. John McCain says Guantanamo could still be closed But demands Obama administration offer clear plan Congress banned detainee transfers to U.S. mainland in 2010 An unlikely ally is offering a glimmer of hope that President Barack Obama can make good on his vow to close Guantanamo Bay before leaving office. Republican Sen. John McCain, a fierce critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy, is about to take the chairmanship of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee. He says it\u2019s still possible the war on terror camp in Cuba could be shut down \u2013 but warns that the administration will have to come up with a clear plan to overcome Republican opposition. Asked in a CNN interview whether he was prepared to help his old political foe, despite a congressional ban on sending detainees to the U.S. mainland, McCain said, \u201cI am prepared to and I think it can be done.\u201d READ: U.S. transfers 6 detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Uruguay But he warned that ever since he started talking to the administration about Guantanamo Bay in 2009, it had \u201cnever come forward with a plan as to how we treat those individuals that have been judged as too dangerous to ever be released, and that is the hangup.\u201d Former Guantanamo detainee on torture McCain, himself a former prisoner of war, has long favored closing Guantanamo Bay, which critics say stains the reputation of the United States and is a recruiting tool for terrorists. But key players in Congress, including many senior Republicans, have barred funding for the administration to send remaining inmates elsewhere or to build facilities on the U.S. mainland. CIA torture methods 'are war crimes' Speculation about the camp\u2019s future is being stoked by the recent transfers of a group of prisoners to Uruguay last week. The U.S. response to the 9/11 attacks in 2001 is also back in the spotlight because of the recent release of a Senate report on enhanced interrogation tactics critics say equate to torture. Six guantamos detainees released McCain said he thought that Republican opposition could be overcome, if the administration laid out exactly how it believed it could close Guantanamo. Tapes could prove Gitmo inhuman treatment \u201cIf I went to the members of the committee today and said, \u2018Look they are going to be moved to a maximum security prison in some location in the United States of America and we have a plan for that transfer, I think most of them would be perfectly happy about that,\u201d McCain said. Last weekend, the Obama administration sent six Guantanamo Bay detainees to Uruguay for resettlement as refugees as part of its plan to depopulate the camp prior to its closure. Four of the former detainees \u2013 Ahmed Adnan Ahjam, Ali Hussain Shaabaan, Omar Mahmoud Faraj, and Jihad Diyab \u2013 are Syrian nationals, while Abdul Bin Mohammed Abis Ourgy is Tunisian, and Mohammed Tahanmatan is Palestinian, according to Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby. RELATED: GOP congressman: We \u2018ought to rethink\u2019 Gitmo transfer policy I just don\u2019t think that is trustworthy,\u201d McCain said, adding that former inmates needed re-education to ensure they did not return to extremism. \u201cI am very concerned,\u201d he said. Republicans complain that released detainees are not sufficiently monitored when they leave Guantanamo Bay, and cite figures saying that nearly 30 percent of those released are back in the fight against U.S. forces. The transfers leave only 136 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, out of an peak population of more than 750. That\u2019s the lowest number of inmates at the base in Cuba since detainees started arriving in 2002. Gitmo inmate: My treatment shames American flag But that leaves the most problematic prisoners, including those who the administration says are too dangerous to be released, and cannot be tried in civilian courts as they are considered enemy combatants or the evidence against them is seen as tainted because it was obtained under duress. The Wall Street Journal reported in October that Obama remained determined to close Guantanamo Bay, and was prepared to use executive power to do so if Congress would not go along. Since he won re-election in 2012, Obama has appointed special envoys at the Defense and State departments to try to get foreign countries to accept more foreign detainees. He has also lifted the moratorium on lifting sending Yemeni prisoners back home. Nearly all Guantanamo prisoners are being held without charges, and while about half of those are considered high-level threat detainees, the remainder were determined to be low-level threats by a task force of top U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Those in the latter group could gain their freedom, provided security conditions could first be met in their host countries. In December 2010, Congress amended the annual defense budget bill to prevent the transfer of any Guantanamo detainees to the United States. That defeated the Obama administration\u2019s plans announced a year earlier to try several Guantanamo detainees involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks in U.S. federal court.

            "article_content": "The Pentagon transferred six Guantanamo Bay detainees to Uruguay, it announced Sunday House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says the move should be reconsidered Rogers says previously released prisoners have re-engaged in terrorism On Sunday, the Pentagon announced it transferred six Guantanamo Bay detainees to Uruguay for resettlement as refugees, a move which House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says should be reconsidered. \u201cI\u2019ve been opposed to this notion that we\u2019re going to farm out Gitmo to places,\u201d Rogers told Candy Crowley on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d noting most of the detainees sent to Uruguay are not originally from there. According to Rogers, the foreign intelligence services the United States pays to monitor the newly released detainees in countries such as Uruguay are often ill-equipped to handle the job. \u201cWhat we have found in the past is it doesn\u2019t work very well,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that surprises anybody. So I argue that maybe we ought to rethink what we\u2019re doing here.\u201d Rogers: Torture report will cause deaths Echoing the sentiments of many members of Congress, Rogers said some previously released prisoners are now re-engaged in the terrorist fight. Hostages killed in failed rescue attempt \u201cWe knew that was going to happen,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThat\u2019s why those of us who were trying to do the review of this were so concerned, because they were so interested in getting them out, that they forgot to do the due diligence \u2013 I think \u2013 that would allow them to at least protect those that were going to go back into the fight, from getting back into the fight.\u201d Last week, the Obama administration suffered a huge setback in its attempt to close down the detention camp permanently when the House passed a $585 billion defense authorization bill excluding language that would have banned the transfer of any more prisoners to Guantanamo Bay, a stipulation the White House had sought. On Monday, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said it would also likely be absent from the final bill sent to the President\u2019s desk. \u201cOur language (on Guantanamo) \u2026 will not be in,\u201d Levin told reporters last week. The President has sought to close Guantanamo Bay since he took office in 2008 \u2013 and issued an executive order to do so in 2009 \u2013 but has faced fierce opposition from members of Congress, like Rogers, who allege that doing so is a threat to national security. Outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who recently announced his resignation in light of administrative pressure, authorized the prisoner release, according to the Pentagon. His reluctance to approve the mission until now could have been a part of the tension leading to his resignation. But House Intelligence Committee member Adam Schiff, D-California, defended Hagel\u2019s decision to delay the authorization of the mission, citing his continued concerns over the timing of the prisoner release. \u201cThere were a couple of things I think Secretary Hagel had some continued concerns over,\u201d Schiff said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom.\u201d \u201cHe wanted to make sure that he was satisfied that he could sign on the dotted line.\u201d Schiff pointed to Uruguay\u2019s recent presidential election as one of the roadblocks. \u201cThere was an election taking place in Uruguay, and I think the president \u2013 who agreed to accept these detainees \u2013 didn\u2019t want it to be an issue in the presidential campaign,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAnd so it was stayed until after that election was over.\u201d This story has been updated to include additional information Watch State of the Union with Jake Tapper Sundays at 9am ET.

            "article_content": "NEW: Rep. Ed Royce said Thursday he had heard the White House was shifting its Syria strategy Some sources deny a review has been ordered, but cite concerns about strategy Sources tell CNN President Obama wants a review of the administration's strategy in Syria The review suggests the administration will refocus on ousting Bashar al-Assad in Syria President Barack Obama has asked his national security team for another review of the U.S. policy toward Syria after realizing that ISIS may not be defeated without a political transition in Syria and the removal of President Bashar al-Assad, senior U.S. officials and diplomats tell CNN. The review is a tacit admission that the initial strategy of trying to confront ISIS first in Iraq and then take the group\u2019s fighters on in Syria, without also focusing on the removal of al-Assad, was a miscalculation. Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Thursday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that he had also heard that the White House was shifting its strategy, in part because Turkey and other Gulf states \u2013 which are hosting refugees from Syria \u2013 were pushing for the removal of Assad. New ISIS plan to include Assad's removal? Rep. Royce: Allies want Assad removed Was ISIS leader hit in airstikes? ISIS: How did they get here so quickly? In just the past week, the White House has convened four meetings of the President\u2019s national security team, one of which was chaired by Obama and others that were attended by principals like the secretary of state. These meetings, in the words of one senior official, were \u201cdriven to a large degree how our Syria strategy fits into our ISIS strategy.\u201d Related: Obama\u2019s \u201cno strategy\u201d comment sparks uproar \u201cThe President has asked us to look again at how this fits together,\u201d one senior official said. \u201cThe long-running Syria problem is now compounded by the reality that to genuinely defeat ISIL, we need not only a defeat in Iraq but a defeat in Syria.\u201d The U.S. government refers to ISIS as ISIL. Multiple senior administration officials and diplomats spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. The White House referred questions about the review to the State Department. Meanwhile, other sources denied to CNN that Obama has ordered a review, but admit there is concern about some core aspects of the strategy. A senior administration official, responding to a CNN report, says there is an ongoing discussion and \u201cconstant process of recalibration.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no formal strategy review of our Syria policy. What there is is a strategy for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL that requires us to take a hard look at what we\u2019re doing on a regular basis,\u201d said Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. \u201d And, as you know we\u2019ve had regular meetings that the President has joined with his national security team on this issue and Syria has been an important subject at those meetings.  And I think the President wants to make sure that we\u2019re asking hard questions about what we\u2019re targeting in Syria, how we\u2019re able to degrade ISIL but also how we\u2019re supporting opposition and building them up as a counterweight to ISIL but also ultimately of course to the Assad regime.\u201d And Alistair Baskey, spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday evening, \u201cThe strategy with respect to Syria has not changed: While the immediate focus remains to drive ISIL out of Iraq, we and coalition partners will continue to strike at ISIL in Syria to deny them safe haven and to disrupt their ability to project power.\u201d He added, \u201cAssad has been the biggest magnet for extremism in Syria, and the President has made clear that Assad has lost all legitimacy to govern.  Alongside our efforts to isolate and sanction the Assad regime, we are working with our allies to strengthen the moderate opposition \u2026\u201d Gingrich: Obama, you won\u2019t win a war with Congress \u2018Iraq first\u2019 strategy now appears \u2018untenable\u2019 In October the United States stressed an \u201cIraq first\u201d strategy with efforts to degrade ISIS in Iraq as the priority and operations in Syria done to shape conditions in Iraq. Washington hoped that would give time for the U.S. to vet, train and arm a moderate Syrian rebels fighting force to combat ISIS, and ultimately the regime of al-Assad. But with the Free Syrian Army struggling in a two-front battle against al-Assad\u2019s forces and extremists from both ISIS and other extremist groups such as al-Nusra, U.S. officials recognize the \u201cIraq first\u201d strategy is untenable. \u201cDevelopments on the ground have caused the national security team to collectively conclude we may not have time for Iraq first. In an ideal world you would drive ISIL out of Iraq and pivot to Syria. But if by then the moderate opposition has been smacked and ISIL is still there, that doesn\u2019t help,\u201d a senior administration official said. Among the options being discussed are a no-fly zone on the border with Turkey and accelerating and expanding the Pentagon program to vet, train and arm the moderate opposition. Turkey has called for a no-fly zone, both to protect its border and to provide relief to Syrian rebels facing airstrikes from the regime, but officials said Turkey so far has been vague about what troops and other assets it is willing to contribute to the effort. The administration has asked Congress for $500 million to train and equip 5,000 vetted rebels within one year. But efforts to expand the program to build Syrian rebel forces may also be stymied by the slow and complicated of vetting the fighters. More than four months after announcing an effort to train and equip the moderate Syrian opposition, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN the vetting process had not even begun and logistics are still being worked out with the Turks and Saudis, who are hosting the training. \u201cThe vetting hasn\u2019t started. Once it does start, that will be about a three- to five-month process and then it\u2019s about eight to nine months of training after that,\u201d Kirby said in an interview with CNN last week. \u201cSo we still (have) a ways to go.\u201d A review would come as the military starts meeting with more than 30 countries to \u201cfurther develop and refine military campaign plans to degrade and defeat\u201d ISIS, according to a statement from U.S. Central Command, which is overseeing U.S. military efforts in Syria and Iraq. Many of the President\u2019s top national security advisers, including Secretary of State John Kerry, have long argued that Washington\u2019s political strategy was unrealistic. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent a blunt memo to National Security Adviser Susan Rice in October that a senior U.S. official told CNN\u2019s Barbara Starr was \u201cexpressing concern about overall Syria strategy\u201d and expressing a fear that the U.S. is risking its gains in the war against ISIS if adjustments are not made. The official said the focus of the memo was the \u201cneed to have a sharper view of what do about the Assad regime.\u201d Related: Hagel wrote memo to White House expressing concern about Syria U.S., Arab allies strike ISIS in Syria Official: Bomb-maker killed in airstrike U.S. takes aim at ISIS' pocketbook Why Western teenagers become jihadists \u201cIt has been pretty clear for some time that supporting the moderate opposition in the hopes of toppling Assad, isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d another senior official said. In response to the revelations about the Hagel memo, the White House spokesman said his advisers would be \u201cconstantly assessing\u201d the strategy. \u201cThat means they want to consider a wide range of opportunities to make sure we\u2019re doing everything we possibly can to protect and defend American interests around the world,\u201d spokesman Josh Earnest said in an interview with CNN on October 31. Kerry seeks to preserve fraying coalition The U.S. is also trying to preserve a fraying anti-ISIS coalition. Many Arab states have expressed frustration with what they perceive as an ambivalence by the United States toward getting rid of al-Assad. Secretary of State John Kerry and Gen. John Allen, the U.S. envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, have reported back to the White House that key allies such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Turkey are calling for a framework for a political transition in Syria. \u201cWhat really tipped this into a more vigorous reassessment was hearing from our coalition partners that they are not convinced by the Syria part and this strategy only works if there is a more coherent Syria piece,\u201d said a senior official. Efforts by the U.S. and Russia to strike a deal between al-Assad\u2019s regime and the Syrian opposition forces broke down in January after a long-awaited and ultimately unsuccessful peace conference in Switzerland. Now officials and diplomats said Kerry has in recent months intensified discussions with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Russia about the possibility of a diplomatic tract to transition al-Assad and his inner circle out of power, while maintaining large parts of the regime and institutions of the state. Brokered al-Assad transition could take months But any such transition could take time. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be tomorrow and I don\u2019t think anyone even believes that is physically possible. But even if it is a six- or 12-month plan, as long as it has an exit for Assad,\u201d one senior Arab diplomat said. \u201cBut we are glad that we finally see a meeting of the minds with the U.S. that there needs to be a rethinking of the strategy.\u201d American officials and Arab diplomats said that while Russia has tacitly endorsed the idea of a Syria free of al-Assad, Moscow has done little to effect change on the ground. \u201cThe Russians are not our friend here,\u201d one of the senior administration officials said. \u201cThey have given vague expressions of empathy but that is not exactly the same as saying we are with you and are going to rid of him. They are still arming Assad and providing him direct support.\u201d Kerry has also raised the topic with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, officials said. Kerry has met several times in recent months to hammer out a nuclear deal ahead of a November 24 deadline, which officials stressed was the main topic of discussion and was not linked to any potential cooperation in Syria. Last month President Obama sent a letter to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei describing a shared interest in combating ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but it was unclear whether the letter made mention of the three-year civil war in which Iran has backed al-Assad. Officials pointed to a debate within the Iranian regime about al-Assad\u2019s fate, but there is little sign that the supreme leader or the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps are interested in getting rid of him. Related: U.S. opens channels with Iran over ISIS \u201cThe moderates are not calling the shots in Syria,\u201d an official said. \u201cThe Iranians have come up with plans like constitutional reforms and ultimately an election, and it is better than nothing, but it still doesn\u2019t include Assad going and it is not the basis for an agreement.\u201d Russia, Saudi Arabia split on al-Assad Arab diplomats have held out hope that if Saudi Arabia and Russia can agree on a political framework, Iran may rethink its insistence that al-Assad must remain in power and strike a deal on al-Assad\u2019s fate. Saudi Arabia is the dominant country in the region pushing for the Syrian President\u2019s ouster \u201cIt is possible if Russia agrees, the Iranians will feel they are the only ones that who have not played a productive role,\u201d one Arab diplomat said. \u201cWe know if we agree it will be the least common denominator, where you maintain whoever you can from the regime that doesn\u2019t have blood on their hands. That is something we believe the Syrian people can accept.\u201d Ceasefires could provide room for political effort Officials and diplomats said efforts by U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura to secure a series of local ceasefires between the regime and Syrian opposition could help strengthen the administration\u2019s efforts to speed up training of the Syrian rebels and Kerry\u2019s diplomatic efforts to diplomacy to reach a political transition. The United Nations says that de Mistura has proposed incremental freezes in fighting, starting with the city of Aleppo, so that neither side takes advantage of a lull in fighting. A senior U.N. official described the effort as \u201cvery preliminary,\u201d but said de Mistura hopes to increase \u201cfrozen\u201d areas and \u201cknit them together,\u201d which can create the atmosphere for a broader political agreement. \u201cThis is creating the atmosphere from the bottom up,\u201d one senior U.N. official said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to deal with the huge issues of the future of Assad. You can start dealing with a political arrangement in a place like Aleppo so you don\u2019t have to use violence. This would be a way to reduce the suffering and the killing and destruction in the short term, which only helps ISIS.\u201d Former Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford, who left his post in February out of frustration with the administration\u2019s policy, said any reassessment of the strategy in Syria must also reconsider the coalition air campaign in Syria, which is squeezing the beleaguered opposition even further. \u201cThe administration needs to have an honest assessment of whether or not its material assistance to the moderate opposition in northern Syria and the manner in which it has constructed airstrikes in eastern Syria has empowered or disempowered the same moderate opposition upon which it will it will depend to contain the Islamic state in Syria as well as play a vital role in achieving an eventually political solution in Syria,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThe air campaign so far has infuriated the Syrians fighting the regime. For the first time since the Syrian uprising started in 2011 they are burning American flags because they think we are helping the regime instead of helping them.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta and Leslie Bentz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Paul, a potential GOP presidential hopeful, is reaching out to minorities; young voters His message of personal liberty in light of intelligence community scandals resonating Political watchers say Paul has hit on a formula to connect with oft-ignored voters Only time will tell if his outreach resonates and nets him support They don\u2019t see many U.S. senators in ZIP Code 40203. So Markham French, executive director of the Plymouth Community Renewal Center, was stunned when he received a call last year from Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s office asking if the lawmaker could stop by the West Louisville, Kentucky, facility to speak with patrons. French thought hard about what such a visit would mean for his impoverished community, a place with high unemployment and which, a few years ago, was ranked one of the nation\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods because of its high crime and murder rates. \u201cI initially was surprised,\u201d French said. But \u201cI came to understand that he didn\u2019t want to assume what was affecting the African-American community. He wanted to hear from the African-American community what was affecting them.\u201d Paul got an earful. So he listened. And he thought. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how hard it was to pay back child support when you\u2019ve been in prison,\u201d Paul told CNN. Rand Paul fights for felon voting rights Rand Paul: We must watch the watchers Inside Politics: Rand Rising CPAC winners and losers Paul, a tea party favorite, has been listening a lot these days to voices that have long felt unheard by the Republican Party: African-Americans, Hispanics and young voters. And he  has given quite a lot of thought about how to connect his conservative stances on protecting personal liberties to those disparate groups\u2019 concerns about big government overreach. He spoke Wednesday, touching on typically libertarian issues, at the University of California at Berkeley, a campus with a famously progressive culture. \u201cI find it ironic that the first African-American president has, without compunction, allowed this vast exercise of raw power by the NSA,\u201d Paul told the crowd of the intelligence community\u2019s domestic spying practices. \u201cCertainly J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s illegal spying on Martin Luther King and others in the civil rights movement should give us all pause. Now if President Obama were here, he would say he\u2019s not J. Edgar Hoover, which is certainly true. But power must be restrained because no one knows who will next hold that power.\u201d Paul told CNN after his speech that his Berkeley address and speeches across the country to young voters and minorities reflect \u201cissues I believe passionately about that haven\u2019t been discussed a lot in the Republican Party.\u201d Paul\u2019s visit to Berkeley, much like his visits to historically black colleges Howard University in Washington and Simmons College in Louisville and his push for so-called \u201ceconomic freedom zones\u201d \u2013 areas of high unemployment in places like Louisville and Detroit that would reduce federal regulation and taxes to help boost economic growth \u2013 are the actions of a shrewd and ambitious politician. They are the actions of  a lawmaker who is keenly aware of the nation\u2019s shifting demographic, his party\u2019s self-professed struggles to attract minority and young voters and his own desire to see his policy proposals take hold. And while he hasn\u2019t said he\u2019s running to be his party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee, he\u2019s doing all the things that someone who\u2019s running for president would do. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that Rand correctly assesses the changing demographics of our country and the need to broaden our appeal if we\u2019re going to compete in presidential elections and make it clear we want to be a large and inclusive party that includes all sorts of voters,\u201d Kentucky\u2019s senior senator, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, told CNN. McConnell, a veteran lawmaker who early on helped tutor Paul in the congressional art of tactical strategy has watched with interest the junior senator\u2019s rise to the national stage. The potential 2016 GOP presidential hopeful has carefully navigated his path and managed to benefit from an almost prescient sense of timing, close friends and political operatives say. \u201cHe\u2019s a very smart guy with extraordinary political instincts and I think that\u2019s the reason for his rise to political prominence,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cPeople tend to focus on his (filibuster) in the Senate \u2026 but his outreach to groups we haven\u2019t done well with in national elections strikes me as different from what other aspirants are doing.\u201d Inside Politics: \"Thin Crust GOP\" Sen. Paul slams NSA spying at CPAC 'Inside Politics' panel on Paul, Nugent The son also rises Paul is his father\u2019s son. And like Ron Paul, the former Texas congressman known for his devout libertarian following, the younger Paul prides himself on doing things differently. His 2010 campaign for the Senate seat left open by retiring Kentucky Sen. Jim Bunning was a long shot.  He was a political rookie and certainly was not the party establishment \u2013 including McConnell\u2019s \u2013 choice. He also had a few early stumbles including a near campaign-ending misstep when, during an interview, he told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow that private businesses shouldn\u2019t have to adhere to the civil rights laws. He beat a hasty retreat from that comment and issued a statement saying he supports to 1964 Civil Rights Act. It was also the year of the tea party uprising and, with the help of a fed-up conservative electorate, his father\u2019s vast donor list and his own edgy brand of pragmatic libertarianism, the younger Paul defeated secretary of state Trey Grayson, who was groomed by the establishment for the race. Once in the Senate, Paul quickly distinguished himself as unwilling to take the traditional freshman role of keeping quiet. Weeks into his first term he unveiled a plan he argued would trim $500 billion from the federal budget \u2013 a plan that, while it garnered little backing on either side of the aisle and ultimately failed, did receive support from McConnell. That May, Paul led a one-man showdown over extending the Patriot Act which included strident criticism of both Democratic and Republican leadership. The ensuing legislative delay in passage meant President Barack Obama was forced to \u201cautopen\u201d sign the law\u2019s extension while he was in France for the G8 summit just before it expired at midnight. That July he blocked extending FBI Director Robert Mueller\u2019s term by two years until the agency head gave more details about how two Iraqi nationals were able to live undetected in Paul\u2019s hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky, for several years. In October, another block \u2013 this time millions in benefits for disabled and elderly refugees \u2013 based on concerns that the money could benefit terrorists. That year at the Conservative Political Action Conference McConnell dubbed Paul \u201cone of the great freshman conservatives.\u201d And that was just year one. Now just over halfway through his first term, Paul has earned praise for his well-timed push against the intelligence community\u2019s domestic spying practices, for his criticism of the handling of the nation\u2019s mushrooming debt and for his outreach to minority and young voters. He is poised to stand as one of the frontrunners in the potentially crowded field of 2016 presidential hopefuls according to a new CNN/ORC International survey, which found 16% of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents might support his bid. His partnership with McConnell on such issues as pushing back against Obama administration-backed regulations on the coal industry and getting funding for industrial hemp research in the farm bill, illustrates \u201cwhat happens when the tea party guys and the guys who have been around get together and fight together,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a former McConnell aide and senior adviser to Super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership. \u201cAs I watch him move around the country, he\u2019s incredibly well received,\u201d said Ron Kaufman, a veteran Washington lobbyist and former adviser to GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and President George H.W. Bush. \u201cHe\u2019s been incredibly skillful.\u201d Then, last year came what, in hindsight, now seems Paul\u2019s timely 13-hour filibuster on the perilous possibilities of drone strikes on Americans in their own country. The talk-a-thon delayed the confirmation of John Brennan as CIA head and inspired other Republicans, including McConnell, to return to the Senate and rally to his aid. \u201cI remember calling my boss Rep. (Paul) Gosar to ask if he had seen what was taking place and he told me he was headed to join Rand,\u201d said Orlando Watson, a former Paul staffer who now is the communications director for black media for the Republican National Committee. Friend and longtime Paul adviser Trygve Olson put it this way: \u201cPeople hadn\u2019t thought about drones and suddenly a guy doing a \u2018Mr. Smith\u2019 filibuster on this captivated people.\u201d Sen. Paul: NSA lawsuit not a stunt Who is Rand Paul? Rand Paul calls Bill Clinton a sex predator Paul\u2019s possible pitfalls Captivating people is one thing. Winning them over for the long term is another matter, said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist and radio host. \u201cAny of these people \u2013 whether it\u2019s Ted Cruz, Chris Christie, or Rand Paul, they are doing well in the polls right now, but it\u2019s the shiny penny effect,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIt\u2019s being strong when we get to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina that counts.\u201d If he makes a run at the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2016, Paul\u2019s ability to knit together a coalition of diverse views will really be put to the test. In the primaries he\u2019ll face tough questions from conservatives on his non-interventionist foreign policy views. Should he make it to the general election, he\u2019ll likely be grilled about how his opposition to abortion \u2013 though he has said he could see \u201cthousands of exceptions\u201d \u2013 reconciles with his staunch defense of personal liberty. \u201cIf another Republican started making those links in a negative way then it could be a problem,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor with the Cook Political Report. He\u2019ll also have to convince big-dollar donors that he\u2019s more than just a momentary cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. He\u2019s attempted to address that last issue by such trips as his whirlwind Silicon Valley tour last summer meeting with technology industry heads and an address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. \u201cWe did a trip to Silicon Valley \u2026 with some Romney donor-type people. We did a meeting at Facebook and it was unclear whether we\u2019d meet with (Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg),\u201d said Olson, a longtime friend who now works with the American Crossroads Super PAC. Zuckerberg \u201cshowed up and said \u2018I got in late last night from Europe but I wanted to come here and meet you.\u2019 \u201d Paul and the social media guru hit it off. \u201cIt was clear the two smartest guys in the room were having a conversation and the rest of us were just there,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThey would have gone on for quite a while longer and I was the one who finally ended up saying we need to get over to (the venue) or you\u2019re going to miss your speech.\u201d As for his ability to navigate the rarefied air of high powered politics and mingle with ex-cons in Louisville, Paul said, \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot by just showing up.\u201d Reaching out During that June visit to West Louisville, Paul heard from frustrated black men who are banned from volunteering at their children\u2019s schools because of their criminal backgrounds and from voting after completing their prison terms for nonviolent crimes. That visit would later help inform his push to restore felon voting rights and further his views on changing mandatory minimum sentences for some crimes such as marijuana possession \u2013 issues that disproportionately impact blacks and Hispanics. \u201cI think it opens doors to people who haven\u2019t listened to Republicans,\u201d Paul said of his outreach. He has since had regular conversations with the president of a local historically black college and heads of charter schools in African-American neighborhoods. Since he left the community center, Paul has dispatched a staffer who set up a mobile office with hours that coincide with when the food pantry opens. \u201cNo one has been here. No one else has reached out,\u201d French said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t knocking down our door to ask us how they can help.\u201d French was so impressed with Paul that, when he heard the senator was in Shelbyville, Kentucky, he piled into his car and drove 30 miles just to see the lawmaker. \u201cOne of the things I was impressed about is in the short run there isn\u2019t going to be a lot of support from the African-American people for Rand Paul, so I give him a lot of respect for doing this knowing there\u2019s not going to be a rush to the polls for him,\u201d French said. But that type of outreach just might pay off in the long run, Paul said. All it takes is \u201ctime and sincerity,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople know when you\u2019re genuine as opposed to showing up during the last six weeks to try and get votes.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Once the South's dominant party, Democrats suffered devastating losses in 2014 One longtime observer says he can't remember it being any gloomier for Southern Dems \"The party has been demonized by Republicans. It's very bleak,\" says Curtis Wilkie Now, Democrats are looking everywhere for solutions for their Southern problem The 2014 elections seemed like the final reckoning for Southern Democrats, the culmination of a political metamorphosis that began in the Civil Rights era and concluded under the nation\u2019s first black President. Wiped out in governors\u2019 races, clobbered in Senate contests, irrelevant in many House districts and boxed out of state legislatures, Democrats in the South today look like a rump party consigned to a lifetime of indignity. \u201cI can\u2019t remember it being any gloomier for Democrats in the South than it is today,\u201d said Curtis Wilkie, the longtime journalist and observer of Southern life who lectures at the University of Mississippi. \u201cThe party has been demonized by Republicans. It\u2019s very bleak. I just don\u2019t see anything good for them on the horizon.\u201d Look Who's Coming to Dinner The nerd science of political campaigns Will these people pick your president? Is New Hampshire about to get nasty? Could Rand Paul support gay marriage? The luckiest mustache in Iowa Democrats are looking everywhere for solutions to their Southern problem. They hope population changes will make states such as Georgia and North Carolina more hospitable. They want more financial help from the national party. Some are even clinging to the dim hope that Hillary Clinton might help make inroads with white working class voters in Arkansas in 2016. Success here is crucial for the party. There\u2019s virtually no way for Democrats to win back a majority in the Senate \u2013 much less the House \u2013 without finding a way to compete more effectively in the South. But the truth is there are no easy answers for a party so deep in the hole. White voters have abandoned Democrats for decades, and the flight has only hastened under President Barack Obama. The migration has created a troublesome math problem: Democrats across the region now depend on African-American voters and not much else. It\u2019s a disastrous formula in low-turnout midterms dominated by white voters. In Louisiana on Saturday, deep south Democrats bid farewell to their last remaining Democratic senator, Mary Landrieu, who won the African-American vote but failed to secure enough white support in her race against Republican Bill Cassidy. Landrieu won just 18 percent of white voters on Election Day in November, and she failed to expand that margin in the runoff, resulting in another knife-twisting loss for Democrats hoping to put the devastating 2014 midterms behind them. With Landrieu\u2019s loss, there are now just three Democrats senators hailing from the Old Confederacy: Mark Warner and Tim Kaine in Virginia, and Bill Nelson in Florida. But both of those states have diverse populations and thriving economies that have pushed them away, culturally and politically, from their southern neighbors. READ: Landrieu, Cassidy spar in final Senate debate \u201cLyndon Johnson made it very clear when he signed the Civil Rights Act back in 1964 what the impact was going to be on his party, the Democrats, and their relationship with southern white voters,\u201d said South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the House\u2019s highest-ranking African-American and the only Democrat from his state in Congress. Lost for a generation After signing the Civil Rights Act, Johnson is reputed to have said that Democrats have lost the South for a generation. Whether Johnson actually uttered those words is in question \u2014 but the Democratic Party\u2019s fading fortunes are not. In South Carolina, Democrats lost every race for statewide office and won only a single House seat \u2014 the reliably-blue, majority-African-American district represented by Clyburn. In Georgia, even with Peach State brand names like Nunn and Carter on the ballot, Democrats only mustered support from a quarter of white voters in the contested Senate and governor\u2019s races. In Arkansas, Republicans gained total control of the governor\u2019s mansion and the state legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. Sorting through the post-election wreckage, Democratic leaders across the region are pessimistic about the party ever re-claiming its status as the majority party. The challenge of reclaiming state legislatures, race-by-race, is a particularly daunting one. But Democrats also dismiss the funereal commentary about their party, often pegged to the 10-point loss of Georgia\u2019s resilient, gun-brandishing John Barrow, the last remaining white Democrat from the deep South in the House. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can make generalizations,\u201d said Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, who was thumped by nearly 20 points despite his two-terms in the Senate, deep roots in the state and the Bible he wielded in a campaign ad. \u201cEvery state is different.\u201d READ: Schumer on 2016: \u2018Democrats must embrace government\u2019 In states with changing demographics and thriving urban centers like Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia, Democrats are optimistic the states will grow ever friendlier by the next election cycle. South Carolina and Tennessee are more difficult hills to climb, but both states are seeing urban population growth and a continual influx of out-of-staters seeking warmer climates and friendlier tax rates. The forecast is grimmer in more rural, conservative states \u2014 like Mississippi and Alabama \u2014 with negligible growth rates. Wherever they stood, 2014 was a uniquely bad cycle for Southern Democrats. A stew of toxic factors wreaked havoc on the party\u2019s candidates: narrowly-focused campaign messages that did little to address economic anxieties, historic voter apathy, the cyclical second-term drag of a party in power, and an unpopular President who not only struggled to sell his economic achievements but has proven singularly incapable of connecting with white Southerners. Jeb Bush says he's thinking about 2016 CNN poll: 2016 GOP surprise? Clinton, Warren, Biden top poll of Dems Who is Ben Carson? Obama \u201cObama was a huge drag on the party, not just in the South, but across much of the country,\u201d said William Winter, the former Democratic governor of Mississippi. \u201cHe was not articulating a message that I think people respond to. He was well-meaning in his efforts, but he is not in touch with people in the country, and especially in the South.\u201d Winter, a moderate whose 1980 election is still remembered fondly by Mississippi Democrats who were struggling to move past their party\u2019s ugly racial history, said Obama\u2019s skin color is \u201cunfortunately\u201d a driver of his unpopularity in the South. But he said the national party\u2019s dismal standing had more to do with a message that focused on small-bore issues like contraception or minimum wage increases rather than a unifying, big-picture theme that focuses on middle-class economics. Democrats should embrace a pro-business mentality, Winter said, singling out \u201cthe ideas that Bill Clinton was selling.\u201d He bristled at the Elizabeth Warren-style confrontational populism that\u2019s taken hold among Democrats elsewhere in the country. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can win on that,\u201d Winter said. \u201cIf we are not perceived as too far to the left, we can win. I think the South wants to be a part of mainstream America, politically and in every every other way. I think we play on that and let common sense dictate our positions. And it has to be done in concert with the business community. We have alienated a lot of the business community. The business community has a huge stake in maintaining a stable economic and social and educational environment.\u201d READ: 2016 is everywhere this week. Here\u2019s why. The clash between the center and the left mirrors a larger national debate within the Democratic Party  \u2014 and it also reflects a schism among Democrats in different parts of Dixie. In the deeper South, it\u2019s impossible for Democrats to win without persuading a respectable slice of moderate or conservative white voters. The challenge there is more existential. \u201cWe have to find a way to reconnect,\u201d said Clarke Tucker, a newly-elected Democratic member of the Arkansas House of Representatives. \u201cA lot of the policies that we are pushing help everyone, including the white population.\u201d \u201cWe have to find a way to re-connect\u201d Clarke Tucker, a newly-elected Democratic member of the Arkansas House of Represenatives, In his Little Rock district, the 33-year old Tucker said he campaigned on \u201cthe issues that are going to move us forward as Democrats in the South, and those are growing the economy, creating jobs and improving education.\u201d Louisiana Senate race will go to a runoff His Republican opponent, he said with a hint of relief, did not try to tie him to Obama. North Carolina It\u2019s a different story in North Carolina, where Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan was defeated despite running a near-perfect campaign and driving up turnout among non-white voters. Her Republican opponent Thom Tillis relentlessly linked Hagan with Obama, whose job approval in North Carolina exit polls was 43 percent \u2014 better than in other Southern states, but still ugly. Democrats in North Carolina are grumpy about the outcome \u2013 but they aren\u2019t writing their obituaries yet. Both the Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham areas continue to grow at a rapid clip, attracting affluent, educated voters from other parts of the country who aren\u2019t beholden to the state\u2019s conservative traditions. In just four years, the Research Triangle hub of Wake County has added almost 100,000 new residents and now has a population of over 1 million people. That makes for an electorate closely resembling the national Democratic coalition under Obama in 2008 and 2012, made up of urbanized young professionals, including unmarried women, as well as African-Americans and Hispanics. In higher-turnout presidential years, North Carolina is just as winnable for Democrats as it was when Obama won the state\u2019s 15 electoral votes in 2008 \u2014 even as rural whites flee the party. Midterms, though, remain a challenge. \u201cThe landscape has shifted dramatically over the last six years for Democrats in the South,\u201d said Morgan Jackson, a Raleigh-based Democratic strategist.  \u201cSince the 1960s, Democrats ran for cover during presidential election years and used the midterm elections to reclaim seats and expand the majorities. The new math is that Southern Democrats fully embrace the expanded presidential election turnout in order to win races. In the midterms, the goal is survival, period.\u201d GOP state house dominance After the Republican wave of 2010, the GOP gained a chokehold on state houses that gave them the power to shape state legislative and congressional districts in their favor, drawing advantageous lines for Republican incumbents and jamming Democrats into heavily African-American districts, drastically reducing the number of competitive seats in state and federal races. Their strength grew in 2014: The GOP now has total control of both legislative chambers in every state in the South, with the exception of the border state of Kentucky. Republicans also have veto-proof supermajorities in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee \u2014 putting added pressure on Democrats to fight for seats at the local level before the next round of redistricting in 2020. \u201cWe have got to have a 2020 plan going forward, and that 2020 plan must start in 2015,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cThis country is moving to the right and it\u2019s going to keep moving to the right unless the voters intervene.\u201d Republican dominance at the state level has raised questions about whether Democrats will be able to groom candidates for higher office in the future. While it\u2019s true that their farm team has been drastically reduced over the last four years, a younger generation of Democrats say the worries are overblown. \u201cI think candidates can emerge from all sorts of places,\u201d said Tucker, the Arkansas state legislator. He pointed to Dale Bumpers, the former Arkansas governor and senator who was an unknown lawyer before he came out of nowhere to win the governorship in 1970. Arkansas, Tucker said, has a populist streak that rewards big personalities no matter where they come from. In Louisiana, Democratic Party Chairwoman Karen Carter Peterson pointed to a roster of successful mayors in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Shreveport and other cities as possible future statewide candidates. \u201cThese are strong Democratic mayors who have been re-elected without problems,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cWe feel like that is a strong bench for us moving forward to change the tide of the state.\u201d Some Democrats are calling on the national party structure to pay more attention to the South \u2014 and spend more money on party staffers and developing down-ballot talent. Several longingly invoked former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean\u2019s \u201c50-state strategy,\u201d a program that placed Democratic staffers in even the reddest of states with the goal of re-building the party after the 2004 election. It paid off in the 2006 midterms, when Democrats in traditionally Republican states including Kansas and Montana rode a national wave into office. South Carolina state Rep. Bakari Sellers, who faltered in his bid for lieutenant governor this year, pointedly criticized the DNC for leaving candidates in his state adrift this year \u201cwithout a raft or a lifeboat, expecting us to swim.\u201d He said the Republican National Committee has \u201cdone a diligent job with fund-raising, candidate cultivation, helping people with consultants and building a bench for the future.\u201d Sellers said he received more help from political groups associated with Hillary Clinton and Martin O\u2019Malley, two potential presidential candidates, than from the DNC. \u201cFor many of us who were running statewide and have been plowing the soil of the South, we feel like the national party didn\u2019t do much to help us at all,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cWe oftentimes try to push and promote the policies of the White House and the national Democrats, but there is no reciprocation. There is a still great deal of hope that\u2019s associated with the president of the United States. But people aren\u2019t sure what Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC stand for. That was apparent on Nov. 4.\u201d Michael Czin, a spokesman for the DNC, disputed the characterization, saying that state party leaders are \u201ccritical partners.\u201d \u201cFor a decade, the DNC has invested in all of our state parties year in, and year out, including those in the South,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s working with state parties to build our voter file, investing in our State Party Partnership which funds staff on the ground, or our voter expansion and protection programs, the DNC is there to support state parties across the South. We have a lot of work to do, but we are proud of our investments in southern states over the last decade.\u201d Last white Democrat from Deep South loses Congressional seat The Hillary question And there is the Hillary question. If Clinton runs for the White House, some hopeful Democrats wonder if working-class whites might be more willing to return to the party once Obama is out of the picture. Winter believes Clinton would help Democrats down the ballot even if she doesn\u2019t win any Southern states. \u201cBill and Hillary Clinton are part of the South,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand the South and they understand the use of political strategies that will bring people in. They are moderate people, and most people in the South are moderate.\u201d Some Clinton supporters have speculated that she might even put her former home state of Arkansas in play come November 2016. The possibility was floated earlier this month by Mitch Stewart, a numbers-crunching former Obama strategist who advises the Ready For Hillary super PAC. Stewart said Clinton could favorably alter the post-Obama presidential map by making Arkansas, Missouri and Indiana competitive in 2016. \u201cWhere I think Secretary Clinton has more appeal than any other Democrat looking at running is that with white working-class voters, she does have a connection,\u201d Stewart told Talking Points Memo. \u201cI think she\u2019s best positioned to open those states.\u201d The idea seems plausible enough in Missouri and Indiana, two states with large urban centers, but less so in Arkansas. The Clintons\u2019 travel schedule in 2014 spoke volumes: Bill campaigned relentlessly in the state this year for Pryor and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mike Ross \u2014 but the more polarizing Hillary was kept at a safe distance. She never set foot in Arkansas in 2014, opting instead to raise money for Pryor from a safe distance, at a fundraiser in Manhattan. READ: Is the Clinton magic gone in Arkansas What seems more likely is that North Carolina and perhaps Georgia, with their ever-mutating demographics, would be on the early map should Clinton decide to run for the White House. Clyburn, though, waved off the Clinton-specific theories, saying that southern Democrats will get a built-in turnout boost no matter who is on the White House ticket, given the turnout spike that usually occurs in presidential years. \u201cWould be Hillary be helpful? Yes she would,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cBut she is not the only one who would help. There are a lot of Democrats at the top of the ticket who would be helpful. Would Elizabeth Warren be helpful. Yes she would. Would Joe Biden be helpful? Yes he would. I don\u2019t agree with this whole notion that it has to Hillary Clinton or it won\u2019t be a positive. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at all. A presidential year is going to be helpful for us.\u201d To others, that all seems like happy talk. Wilkie, speaking over the phone from his office at Ole Miss, was less charitable than Clyburn. \u201cGood luck finding a silver lining in your story,\u201d he said in his honeyed drawl. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll be able to.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated how many Democratic senators hailed from Southern States.",

            "article_content": "Watch Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Scott Brown face off in a debate, airing on CNN at 11 p.m. ET Thursday. A new CNN/ORC poll shows a statistical dead heat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is keeping it local in her campaign issues GOP opponent Scott Brown tries to tie Shaheen to Obama The President has only a 39% approval rating in New Hampshire New Hampshire's Tight Senate Race Is New Hampshire about to get nasty? Scott Brown hits Shaheen, Obama on ISIS A new CNN/ORC poll shows a statistical dead heat between New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and her GOP opponent Scott Brown, with Shaheen at 49%, Brown at 47%, and a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4%. Perhaps even more telling is another politician\u2019s approval rating, and he\u2019s not even in the Granite State. President Barack Obama has only a 39% approval rating in New Hampshire, the new poll shows. Fifty-seven percent of voters say they disapprove of the way he is handling his job. That\u2019s a far fall for a president who beat his Republican opponents here in the Granite State overwhelmingly in both 2008 and just two years ago in 2012. And that\u2019s part of the problem. Brown and his supporters are tying the incumbent senator to the president, as exemplified by a recent campaign sign from Brown supporters: \u201cStand with Obama, vote for Shaheen.\u201d The \u201999 percent\u2019 factor It\u2019s why Brown rarely speaks a sentence without tying Shaheen to the president. \u201cShe\u2019s voting with the president 99% of the time,\u201d Brown told us over and over, just has he did minutes earlier at a small business event here earlier this week. Shaheen is just as disciplined with her responses. \u201cYou know, Scott Brown can talk about 99 percent all he wants,\u201d Shaheen told us later in Exeter. \u201cThis race is not between the President and Scott Brown, this race is between me and Scott Brown.\u201d Shaheen has something going for her that some Senate colleagues around the country in tough races do not. She is a former governor who is not only well known, but relatively well liked. Her favorability rating in the CNN/ORC poll is 52%, much higher than the president\u2019s. Brown is under water \u2013 with 50% saying they have an unfavorable view of him, 48% favorable. Shaheen tries to exploit that by painting him as an opportunist \u2013 repeatedly reminding voters that two years ago Brown was a senator from Massachusetts, until he lost. \u201cWhen he was in Washington representing Massachusetts he was there for the corporate special interests,\u201d Shaheen told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to remind people what he represented when he was in Massachusetts and it wasn\u2019t our middle-class families, it wasn\u2019t our small businesses, it wasn\u2019t what\u2019s good for New Hampshire,\u201d Shaheen told us. Brown and other Republicans insist he has beaten the carpetbagger issue by visiting with New Hampshire voters all over the state (he still drives the beat-up pickup truck that became famous in 2010 when he won Ted Kennedy\u2019s Senate seat in a Massachusetts special election). When asked about his move on the campaign trail, Brown notes that he was born in the Granite State and has family ties that go back generations. \u201cWe have long and strong ties to New Hampshire and so does Senator Shaheen. We both care about New Hampshire so let\u2019s talk about where we\u2019re going, not about where we\u2019ve been,\u201d Brown said. Fear-mongering? Another way strategists here in both parties agree Brown has made gains is by seizing on ripped-from-the-headlines national-security issues like the threat from ISIS and Ebola, and playing them as examples of how Washington is broken. Shaheen calls it fear-mongering, which Brown naturally dismisses. \u201cWhat I hear is that people are deeply concerned about the border, they\u2019re deeply concerned about ISIS, they\u2019re deeply concerned about the lack of clear and coherent foreign policy, and the fact that Senator Shaheen is on the Foreign Relations Committee and has endorsed those incoherent policies from day one,\u201d Brown told us. The ISIS threat does hit home here in a unique way. The first American beheaded, James Foley, was from New Hampshire. National versus local issues While Brown\u2019s campaign aides are quite candid that they believe their path to victory is to nationalize the race by linking Shaheen to the President and playing up national-security issues, Shaheen is trying hard to keep it local. She is already known as someone with exceptional constituent services, now as senator and before that as governor.  Even GOP sources here speak admiringly of her commitment to returning regularly for local events throughout her last six years in the Senate. Shaheen insists that is what people are most about. \u201cIt\u2019s the people who are working now up at the Berlin prison because I went in and fought to get that prison open after it sat empty for 12 years, its the 12 people who are in their homes because I worked with them when they were being foreclosed on,\u201d Shaheen told us. \u201cI was at Lincoln Financial in Concord yesterday I didn\u2019t get one question about  a national issue,\u201d she said. Keeping it local is a national Democratic strategy, in a climate where disapproval of the President and Washington in general leaves them little choice. Democrats are using it in North Carolina, too, with incumbent Kay Hagan as they pummel her GOP opponent on state education issues. Whether that strategy can work here and elsewhere may determine whether Democrats can keep control of the Senate during Obama\u2019s last two years in office. CNN\u2019s Adam Levy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Cruz: 2015 Congress' top priorities should be to create jobs, repeal Obamacare and secure the border. Cruz: Many Republican bills will get vetoed or filibustered, but that will help the GOP in 2016. Other priorities: Abolishing the IRS and crushing the Common Core education standards. Don\u2019t say Sen. Ted Cruz doesn\u2019t have a plan. The Texas Republican took it upon himself to lay out the vision of what he thinks a Republican-led Congress should do in 2015 if they retake the Senate after the midterms, outlining a 10-point agenda in a USA Today op-ed published Sunday. With plans to abolish the IRS and repeal Obamacare, Cruz acknowledged that Republicans would likely face vetoes from President Barack Obama and filibusters from Senate Democrats. But the potential 2016 presidential candidate appeared to look further than next month\u2019s election, saying obstruction from Democrats would drive Republican success in 2016. \u201cWe should lead boldly. No Washington games,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe will either pass a serious agenda to address the real priorities of the American people \u2026 or the Democrats will filibuster or veto these bills. And, if they do so, we will have transparency and accountability for the very next election.\u201d Cruz\u2019s Op-ed marks a shift in the 2014 elections, which Republicans have sought to define as a referendum on Obama. Now, Republicans are being pressed to say what taking back the Senate would be \u2013 rather than focusing on what it wouldn\u2019t be \u2013 and Cruz is offering that vision. The junior senator said the top priority of a Republican Congress in 2015 would be to stimulate the economy and create jobs with a focus on American energy. Republicans would authorize the controversial Keystone pipeline and cut down on environmental regulations that hamper fracking, have cracked down on coal and stymied the growth of natural gas, Cruz said. And Republican talk about repealing Obamacare is anything but hot air. Cruz, who is a tea party favorite, said his party would \u201cpursue all means possible to repeal Obamacare\u201d \u2013 repealing the act \u201cand then pass bill after bill to mitigate the harms of Obamacare.\u201d Cruz: Lame ducks are where bad things happen Cruz slams Obama's Ebola czar Cruz: We can't afford mistakes on Ebola Cruz: WH 'fundamentally unserious' on ISIS Cruz conceded that Obama could veto \u201cevery one\u201d of those bills, but said \u201ceach has powerful appeal with the electorate who are hurting under this law.\u201d Cruz also pointed to other facets of the right\u2019s agenda: from repealing the Common Core education standards \u201cso that local curriculum is not mandated by Washington bureaucrats\u201d to securing the border and stopping \u201cillegal amnesty.\u201d \u201cWe should welcome and celebrate legal immigrants who follow the rules, and at the same time honor the will of the people and prevent any more illegal amnesty,\u201d Cruz said. On the financial side, Cruz said Congress should pass a balanced budget amendment to eliminate the current and prevent future deficits. He also called for Republicans to abolish the IRS and establish a flat tax, instead of the progressive tax rate that fluctuates based on wealth. In addition to auditing the Federal Reserve and stopping a \u201cculture of corruption,\u201d \u2013 in part by preventing members of Congress from becoming lobbyists and establishing term limits \u2013 Cruz tied the last of his ten priorities to foreign policy. A Republican Congress, he said, would \u201cdeal seriously with the twin threats of ISIL and a nuclear Iran.\u201d \u201cWe must rebuild our military, protect our nation, and restore America\u2019s leadership in the world,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "The liberal advocacy group mixes footage of the Ebola outbreak with Republicans saying the word \"cut\". The group's president blamed Republicans for the Ebola crisis and \"thousands of deaths\". The group is planning to run the ad in states with competitive 2014 Senate races. A liberal advocacy group is blaming Republicans for the Ebola crisis in a new ad that will first air on TV in Kentucky next weekend. The Agenda Project released an ad online late Sunday that interlaces self-described \u201cdisturbing footages of the Ebola outbreak\u201d with a mash-up of top Republicans \u2013 including those tied up in crucial midterm contests and potential 2016 candidates \u2013 saying the word \u201ccut.\u201d The ad describes how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saw its discretionary funding cut by $585 million from 2010 to 2014 and the National Institute for Health has faced $446 million in cuts during the same period. The group plans to continue to play up public fears over the Ebola virus in the final weeks leading up to the midterms and will modify the ad with state-specific versions to hit Republican Senate candidates like Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst and North Carolina\u2019s Thom Tillis who want to cut federal government spending, the group\u2019s founder and president Erica Payne said. Payne called the ad an \u201cindictment\u201d of Republican policies that have \u201cled directly to thousands of deaths overseas\u201d and said the ad is not \u201csensationalized\u201d or \u201caggressive.\u201d A barrel of bad news for Democrats Rand Paul: Govt. is underplaying Ebola McCain: Obama needs to appoint Ebola czar \u201cPeople should be deathly afraid of Republican policies,\u201d Payne said in an interview Monday, adding that the link between the Ebola crisis and the Republican focus on cutting government spending is \u201creally straightforward.\u201d Complete coverage of the Ebola outbreak Responding to the ad, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee said the best way to fix the federal government is to remove \u201cDemocrats from the driver\u2019s seat in the Senate.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s odd in that the Democrats blaming Washington for Ebola have controlled Washington for the last six years,\u201d he said. Both the CDC and NIH were impacted by the sequester, across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect in 2013 when Republicans and Democrats in Congress could not come to an agreement on specific cuts that would offset the automatic slashing. The ad, \u201cRepublican Cuts Kill,\u201d ties Republicans to the Ebola outbreak, which has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa, but only one person in the United States. Payne said that there\u2019s \u201cno question\u201d that the Ebola death on U.S. soil would not have happened if Republicans weren\u2019t so focused on cutting government spending. \u201cThese people\u2019s anti-government fever has reached such a level that it is damaging to our country\u2019s ability to deal with this kind of issue,\u201d Payne said. \u201cWe\u2019re here because of them.\u201d The ad, which the group said will make its debut on Kentucky airwaves this weekend, opens with a clip of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who would likely become majority leader if Republicans take back the Senate next month. \u201cWashington actually can cut spending,\u201d McConnell says at the start of the ad. McConnell isn\u2019t the only Senate contender featured in the ad. Reps. Bill Cassidy and Tom Cotton, who are vying to unseat the Democratic incumbent in Louisiana and Arkansas, respectively, also pop up in the spot. Ebola becomes an election issue Pat Roberts, the senator from Kansas who is facing independent businessman Greg Orman, also flashes across the screen. \u201cPeople should be deathly afraid of Republican policies.\u201d Erica Payne, founder and president of The Agenda Project The group plans to expand the ad to high airwaves in Senate races in South Dakota, North Carolina, Iowa and Kansas, Payne said. And the liberal group also attacks potential 2016 presidential contenders, with Govs. Rick Perry and Chris Christie, Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio as well as Reps. Paul Ryan and Michele Bachmann making an appearance alongside clips documenting the Ebola outbreak. Paul\u2019s spokesman, Brian Darling, blasted the Agenda Project for being \u201ca shadowy group of progressive political hit men\u201d and said they \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves for blaming a whole political party for the Ebola virus.\u201d The organization itself is no stranger to controversy having been behind the 2011 ad that appears to show Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) pushing an elderly woman in an wheelchair off a cliff. The ad isn\u2019t the first time midterm politics have gotten an injection of Ebola. Republican candidate for Senate in New Hampshire Scott Brown also used the deadly disease to attack incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen for not securing the U.S.\u2019s southern border. GOP stokes border fears over Ebola, ISIS Tillis also said the U.S. should tighten border security to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. in a debate last week against Sen. Kay Hagan. U.S. lawmakers want more Ebola screenings Dallas nurse tests positive for Ebola CDC: Protocol 'breach' led to infection Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor also made Ebola the focus of an ad attacking his challenger, Rep. Tom Cotton, for voting against a pandemic preparedeness bill. (Cotton actually voted for the final version of the bill.) Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said Monday on CNN the public health system needs more resources to confront Ebola and that Congress should have never cut public health funding over the last several years. \u201cEspecially when it comes to public health, sequestration is a bad idea and should be repealed,\u201d Casey said. \u201cCongress has to take responsibility for a program that needs a lot more funding.\u201d Democratic senator can\u2019t judge Obama\u2019s Ebola handling Congress will debate and vote on the budget for the next fiscal year in the coming weeks, which Casey called \u201can opportunity in the Congress to get this right.\u201d He is calling for adding at least $120 million to the public health budget. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, also linked spending cuts and the Ebola outbreak in an interview with CNN on Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the deep health care cuts that we\u2019ve seen have made it more difficult to respond in a rapid and comprehensive way to the Ebola outbreak,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cThe cuts they\u2019ve seen in past years, they were like eroding the foundation and it clearly meant that they were starting from behind,\u201d And Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH\u2019s National Insitutte of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a recent Congressional hearing that spending cuts have had \u201ca significant impact on us\u201d that has \u201ceroded our ability to respond in the way that I and my colleagues would like to see us be able to respond to these emerging threats.\u201d Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Jeanne Shaheen releases a campaign ad hitting Scott Brown's record on abortion Brown identifies as a \"pro-choice independent Republican\" Shaheen leads Brown by 6 points in latest poll The war over women arrived in New Hampshire this week \u2013 in the form of a press release. \u201cNew Shaheen Campaign Ad Highlights Scott Brown\u2019s Anti-Choice Record and Extreme Bill He Introduced,\u201d reporters were informed Tuesday morning by email, just hours before Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was to host a women\u2019s-themed campaign event in Derry. Shaheen\u2019s ad is a brutal one \u2013 particularly against someone who is a self-proclaimed \u201cpro-choice independent Republican.\u201d In ominous tones, the ad reveals that when he was a state legislator in Massachusetts, the state Brown used to live in and later represented in the U.S. Senate, he backed a bill that would \u201cforce women considering abortion to look at color photographs of developing fetuses.\u201d Could Rand Paul support gay marriage? The luckiest mustache in Iowa Hillary's madcap media mob Though Democrats in tough races nationwide have been running on women\u2019s issues for the better part of a year, the message had not taken center stage in New Hampshire\u2019s Senate race until this week. The shift foreshadows what could be a rough and tumble end to election season in this typically tranquil New England state. READ: Have Democrats already lost the Senate? Brown is less vulnerable to the \u201cwar on women\u201d attack than other down-the-line conservative Republicans \u2013 one reason the issue is only now surfacing in the race. Beyond his pro-choice stance, he has broken with his party by supporting the Violence Against Women Act and funding for Planned Parenthood. But Shaheen\u2019s new offensive struck a nerve, forcing Brown to throw together a slapdash press conference to respond to her \u201cdespicable attacks.\u201d He was thrown off-message on a day when he was supposed to be talking about foreign policy and tying Shaheen to President Obama and his in-the-dumps poll numbers. The next morning, Brown went up with a defensive television ad stressing his support for abortion rights and accusing the senator of running a \u201csmear campaign.\u201d Shaheen, a cunning, no-holds-barred campaigner despite her pleasant demeanor, is leaving nothing to chance as she clings to a steady single-digit lead in a treacherous political environment for Democrats. In the latest poll of the race this week, from WMUR and the University of New Hampshire, Shaheen led Brown by 6 points, but she was topping out at 47%: the under-50 danger zone for any incumbent. But she has a healthy 15-point advantage among likely women voters, and is doing everything she can to keep it that way. \u201cYou get the sense this race could turn at just a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d said James Pindell, the always-on political director at Manchester television station WMUR. Pindell was joining me for a slice of pepperoni at Romano\u2019s Pizza in Derry for this week\u2019s episode of \u201cHambycast.\u201d \u201cThe race seems to be primed for that,\u201d Pindell said. \u201cIt gets all the attention in this state. This state has got four major races. We have two congressional races and a competitive governor\u2019s race. But all people talk about is Shaheen and Brown, every single day.\u201d At her lone campaign event Tuesday, inside a Derry-based food incubator called Creative Chef Kitchens, Shaheen rattled through a laundry list of female-focused issues she supports \u2014 equal pay, access to contraception, abortion rights \u2014 as a small crowd of women nodded in approval. READ: Hagan skips Armed Services Committee hearing for campaign fundraiser The message was heavy-handed and impossible to miss, but Shaheen put an exclamation point on it just in case: \u201cScott Brown,\u201d she said, \u201cis being disingenuous when he says he is pro-choice.\u201d Reporters surrounded her after her appearance. One asked her why she waited until October to thrust women\u2019s issues into the campaign, using \u201cprobably the most negative ad of the campaign.\u201d Shaheen has highlighted the topic before, memorably in July, after Brown hid in a restaurant bathroom when a reporter asked him about the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial decision in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby that allowed corporations to deny birth control coverage in their insurance plans. But her campaign had not put money behind a television ad on women\u2019s health before, particularly such a blistering one. \u201cI think this is something that we planned to talk about all along,\u201d Shaheen responded. \u201cI think access to health care, access to reproductive choice is critical to women. I\u2019ve worked on it my entire career. This is an issue that is important to women and families. Ninety-nine percent of women use contraceptives at some point in their lives.\u201d Then I asked Shaheen about Brown\u2019s topic of choice: President Obama, whose disapproval ratings in New Hampshire approach 60%. What is it about him, exactly, that Democrats are so wary of? Shaheen would rather not talk about Obama, which is why Brown spent their first one-on-one debate on Monday reminding voters that the senator has voted with the president \u201c99% of the time.\u201d It\u2019s one reason he has seized on the ascendancy of ISIS, the terrorist group roiling Syria and Iraq, and border security. National security is becoming a winning talking point, Republican operatives here argue, claiming it scores points among the very women Shaheen is trying to keep in her fold. \u201cThere is a leadership void,\u201d Brown said at an event Tuesday in Derry, where he was joined by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a foreign policy hawk and potential presidential candidate in 2016. \u201cOur allies don\u2019t trust us, and our foes don\u2019t fear or respect us.\u201d Like Republican candidates across the country, Brown wants the race to be about national issues. Shaheen does not, so she brings up another sore point for Brown: his decision to sell his home in Massachusetts last year and move to the Granite State to run for Senate. Brown is not exactly a carpetbagger \u2013 he\u2019s long owned property in New Hampshire and many thousands of people have moved here from somewhere else thanks to the low tax rates \u2014 but it\u2019s still a reliable campaign jab. \u201cThis race is not about President Obama,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cThis race is about Scott Brown and me. I know that Scott Brown would like to be running against the President, because he has not done anything in New Hampshire, he doesn\u2019t have a history here, he just moved here. I have spent my entire professional life here in New Hampshire.\u201d READ: Roberts rebounds in Kansas Senate race, CNN/ORC Poll finds",

            "article_content": "All 435 House seats, and 36 in the Senate are on the ballot in November Control of the Senate is the big story of the midterms Senate Democrats face a difficult task of maintaining their majority Republican success could be determined, in part, by outrage over Obamacare The primaries are mostly over and the general election races are falling into place. All 435 seats in the House and a third of the Senate are up for election on November 4 in what\u2019s expected to be a difficult year for Democrats. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on the line: Control of the Senate: That\u2019s the big story of the year. Republicans have their best chance of retaking the majority since they lost it in the 2006 midterms. The GOP must realize a net gain of six seats to accomplish the turnaround with Democrats currently holding a 55-45 advantage (53 Democrats and two independents who caucus with them). And for Democrats, it\u2019s not looking good. Key Senate races Three seats total in South Dakota, West Virginia and Montana are almost certain to flip to Republicans. And another seven Democratic-held seats are at risk. In contrast, Republicans have a chance of losing only two seats. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthier environment overall for Republicans,\u201d Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said. The status of the House: Little is expected to change in the House. While some members will lose, it\u2019s expected to remain in Republican hands. The GOP currently has a strong advantage: They control 234 seats to 201 for Democrats. What team wouldn\u2019t love a 33-point advantage on game day? Key House races Like in the Senate, Republicans are performing better. Despite bold predictions from the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer, no one believes Democrats have any chance of taking back the House. \u201cIt looks like Republicans will gain seats we just don\u2019t know how many yet,\u201d Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, said. Why won\u2019t Democrats pick up seats?: In part, it\u2019s the six-year itch. President Barack Obama has been in office for six years and voters get antsy and want change. Since they can\u2019t change the President, they vote for the opposing party in congressional elections. \u201cHistorically, the President\u2019s party tends to lose,\u201d Duffy said. Obama\u2019s job performance, an approval rating that hovers around 41%, is making a tough situation for Democrats worse. \u201cThe President\u2019s job approval rating is casting a shadow on races across the country,\u201d Gonzales said. Obama is a drag in two respects: It\u2019s a difficult environment for Democrats who need Republican voters in Republican-leaning districts, and Democratic voters are not motivated to show up at the polls. The latter is called the enthusiasm gap and traditionally Democratic voters, minorities, single women and younger voters, are not motivated to vote. The role of the tea party: Tea party-aligned challengers had a tough year. unlike 2010 and 2012, when several too-far-to-the-right candidates won in primaries, Incumbent Republicans entered the primaries prepared, taking nothing for granted. And it paid off. Incumbents won in hard fought races, including in Mississippi, Idaho, Kentucky and Kansas. But the anti establishment wing of the Republican Party didn\u2019t come up empty. One of its victories was a big one \u2013 the defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. After bruising battles, the question is this: Will Republicans unite in November? Duffy said that if 2012 and 2010 are indicators, it will. \u201cWhat we can see \u2026 they have united behind whoever won,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think at the end of the day (disappointed Republicans are) going to stay home.\u201d A bright spot for Democrats?: When it comes to gubernatorial races, Republicans are defending 22 of the 36 seats up for grabs in November. And some of them are in states that Obama carried in 2008 and 2012, such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Maine, Nevada and New Mexico. But Democrats also have some vulnerable seats to defend, in Arkansas, Colorado and Illinois. And they won\u2019t have cakewalks in Connecticut and Massachusetts Key governor races Still about Obamacare: For the first several months of the year while the Affordable Care Act seemed to be a rolling disaster, Republicans made it the main issue in campaign, attacking Democrats for their support of the law. Elizabeth Wilner, senior vice president with Kantar Ad Intelligence, which analyzes political advertising, said that Republicans are still hitting Democratic opponents on Obamacare but it is not the only one. \u201cObamcare is still an issue, but maybe a bit less of an issue than earlier this year,\u201d she said. In addition to the Affordable Care Act, Republicans are also attacking Democrats on ties to the President and government spending. In political advertising, Democrats are trying to change the subject and are focusing on jobs, women\u2019s rights, Medicare and Social Security. Regardless, Wilner said analysis shows that up to $3.4 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising this campaign season. Current events: A border crisis and international conflicts are dominating the news cycle just a few months before the election. While the storylines aren\u2019t overwhelming topics of discussion on the campaign trail, Stu Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report wrote that the events \u201cwill add to the President\u2019s woes.\u201d \u201cAs uncomfortable as it will make Democrats, Obama heads into the final three months of the campaign not looking all that different from his predecessor, President Bush,\u201d he wrote. Bush was dealing with a difficult economy, ongoing and unpopular wars and the aftermath of a disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina. The role of the money men: And yes, the biggest spenders are men. Since the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizen\u2019s United campaign finance decision in 2010, the role of individual investors in the political sphere has grown. Wealthy entrepreneurs Charles and David Koch spent $130 million in 2012 through their organization Americans for Prosperity, which works to defeat Democrats. They also donated money directly to candidates and political action committees as well. A wealthy former hedge fund manager, Tom Steyer, hopes to play big as well. Focusing on climate change, he pledged to spend up to $50 million of his own money and hopes to raise another $50 million. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the high rollers play in the midterms \u2013 that is if we ever find out because much of the spending doesn\u2019t have to be made public. Opening act for 2016: Let\u2019s face it, the midterms haven\u2019t even happened yet but the 2016 presidential race is well under way. Potential presidential hopefuls are already spending large amounts of time in early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina and building networks by backing candidates in critical presidential states, in hopes that the favor is returned in 2016.

            "article_content": "A year ago, President Obama dropped plans to bomb Syria over chemical weapons Now Obama confronts the threat of ISIS jihadists that emerged from Syria Complex issues surround military action in Syria involving U.S. forces An election year at home also influences what happens over there A year later, President Barack Obama will likely talk differently about Syria. He addresses the nation Wednesday night to offer his strategy for \u201cdegrading and ultimately destroying\u201d the ISIS jihadists who have swept across northern Iraq from Syria. Exactly one year earlier \u2013 on September 10, 2013 \u2013 Obama also spoke to the nation from the White House to explain why he called off asking Congress to approve air strikes on Syria over its use of chemical weapons. A lot has changed in the ensuing 12 months, particularly the rise of the Sunni extremists who call themselves the Islamic State and who seek dominance over a swath of the Middle East. Here\u2019s a look at what Obama has learned about Syria in the past year: Does Obama need Congressional approval? Obama to meet with congressional leaders 1) Syrian President Bashar al-Assad isn\u2019t going anywhere \u201cI have resisted calls for military action, because we cannot resolve someone else\u2019s civil war through force, particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d Obama said last year. While he added that the United States had no interest in removing another dictator from power, he hoped the tide of the Syrian civil war would go against al-Assad to force him out. Instead, the Syrian leader got help from Hezbollah in Lebanon and, indirectly, from ISIS fighters who formed out of al Qaeda affiliates to seize the advantage over what U.S. and allied officials call the moderate opposition in Syria. That forced Obama to start providing military aid to opposition forces it considers legitimate and like-minded to Western desires for democratic governance in Syria. 2) Al Qaeda affiliates in Syria posed a broader threat \u201cIt\u2019s true that some of Assad\u2019s opponents are extremists,\u201d Obama said of al Qaeda fighters who worked against the Syrian government. He added that failure to respond militarily to al-Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons would allow al Qaeda to \u201cdraw strength in a more chaotic Syria.\u201d In the end, there was no U.S. military response after Britain\u2019s Parliament voted against taking part and Obama knew he would lack congressional approval. While al-Assad gave up his known chemical weapon stockpiles, Obama\u2019s prediction came true as ISIS fighters comprising remnants of al Qaeda strengthened dramatically enough to rampage through northern Iraq. 3) The question of U.S. military action in Syria is complex \u201cI will not put American boots on the ground in Syria,\u201d Obama said a year ago. \u201cI will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan. I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.\u201d Now he may propose some kind of air campaign against ISIS targets in Syria, and voices in Congress are calling for ground troops from a coalition military force \u2013 but no Americans. The issue raises major geopolitical questions involving who would benefit or be harmed by military strikes in Syria, as well as the legality of doing so without approval from al-Assad\u2019s government. Attacking ISIS in Syria stands to benefit al-Assad by weakening what has become an internal enemy and allowing him to portray his country\u2019s civil war as a battle against terrorists opposed by the United States. Strikes by a U.S.-backed coalition in Syria also would give Russia, al-Assad\u2019s main backer, fodder to justify its own border incursions in Ukraine. 4) Secure the coalition first \u201cI have, therefore, asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path,\u201d Obama said last year after Britain rejected joining a coalition to attack Syria over its chemical weapons. This time, he is expected to detail support from global allies \u2013 including some Middle Eastern countries \u2013 in going after ISIS wherever the threat exists, possibly including Syria. In addition, many in Congress question if Obama needs congressional approval to launch air strikes on ISIS in Syria, with several legislators saying Tuesday they doubted a vote would occur before November elections. 5)     It\u2019s an election year \u201cAmerica is not the world\u2019s policeman,\u201d Obama said last year. \u201cTerrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong.\u201d But when \u201cmoderate effort and risk\u201d by the United States can stop atrocities halfway around the world to make America safer,  \u201cI believe we should act,\u201d he added then. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes America different. That\u2019s what makes us exceptional.  With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth.\u201d Expect to hear the same thing Wednesday night, less than two months before the congressional elections, as the President straddles the political fault line between conservative calls for exerting military power and liberal opposition to a renewed war footing. His goal is to satisfy moderates and independents crucial to Democratic hopes of holding on to control of the Senate while not angering the party\u2019s liberal base.",

He said he was referring to a military strategy in Syria that \u201cmight\u201d require congressional approval. \u201cOur objective is clear. That is to degrade and destroy (ISIS) so it\u2019s no longer a threat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can accomplish that.

President Obama in Europe ISIS is a threat to all Gulf countries Senator wants to arm Ukrainian forces In earlier comments alongside Estonia\u2019s President, Obama recalled the \u201cdeep ties\u201d between the two nations as he announced plans for additional U.S. Air Force units to be based in Estonia as part of a bolstering of NATO forces in the region. \u201cOne of our goals at the summit over the next several days is to once again project unity across NATO on behalf of Ukraine\u2019s efforts to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d Obama said. He added that Russia was \u201cpaying a heavy price for its actions,\u201d in part through Western sanctions imposed over Ukraine, and that NATO is poised to do more to help Ukraine defend itself. He said more European NATO members need to spend a full 2% of their gross domestic product on defense to keep NATO strong. The approaching NATO summit is an opportunity for these countries to pledge this, he said. \u201cEstonia does it. Every ally must do it,\u201d he said. NATO needs to create \u2018high-readiness force,\u2019 secretary general says The NATO leaders also must confront the separate threat of militant Islamists making gains in Syria and Iraq, and the brutal beheading of a second American by ISIS, also known as ISIL or the \u201cIslamic State.\u201d Asked about his strategy on the extremist group, Obama said: \u201cThe bottom line is this: Our objective is clear, and that is to degrade and destroy ISIL so it\u2019s no longer a threat not just to Iraq, but also to the region and to the United States. \u201cIn order for us to accomplish that, the first phase has been to make sure we\u2019ve got an Iraqi government that\u2019s in place, and that we are blunting the momentum that ISIL was carrying out. \u201cAnd the airstrikes have done that. But now, what we need to do is make sure that we\u2019ve got the regional strategy in place that can support an ongoing effort, not just in the air, but on the ground, to move that forward.\u201d Analyst: NATO must adapt The original reason for the summit was to determine how NATO\u2019s mission will proceed in Afghanistan when combat troops depart at the end of the year. But the global unrest, while causing political strife for Obama in the United States, could provide a new purpose for the 65-year-old NATO alliance, which is suffering an \u201cidentity crisis,\u201d according to one analyst. Russian official: Russia is emotionally in Ukraine, its troops are not Putin\u2019s actions in Russia have \u201crequired NATO to really adapt and change fairly dramatically,\u201d said Heather Conley, who directs the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Putin's power push into Ukraine Russia's message on Ukraine Judah: 'Putin created a monster' Putin: Don't mess with us, we're nuclear \u201cIn some ways, NATO should thank Vladimir Putin, because it was really searching for its purpose,\u201d Conley said. Warning Putin NATO members that border Russia, watching the once unthinkable breach of Ukraine\u2019s borders, are looking to the military alliance to affirm its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty\u2019s Article 5, which provides for collective defense of states under attack. Ukraine isn\u2019t a NATO member, though leaders did invite the country\u2019s new President, Petro Poroshenko, to Wales this week. Other former Soviet states, like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, joined NATO in the past decade, hoping to bolster ties to the West while increasing their own security frameworks. As reassurance to those countries, NATO leaders plan to approve the creation of a \u201chigh-readiness\u201d force that places new equipment and thousands of troops in Eastern Europe. Ukraine warns of return to \u2018full-scale war\u2019 White House officials say the move is meant to be defensive rather than a provocation for Russia, though initial reaction from the Kremlin \u2013 which called the move an \u201cexternal threat\u201d \u2013 foreshadowed a potential escalation of the crisis. NATO and Russia have agreed since 1997 that no permanent NATO troops will be positioned in Eastern Europe, meaning member states will rotate forces through bases closest to Russia. Charles Kupchan, Obama\u2019s top adviser for European affairs, said leaders will describe the new effort as a \u201cpersistent\u201d force in the easternmost countries, rather than \u201cpermanent.\u201d \u201cWe will see persistent rotation, persistent exercises to ensure that Estonia and that other countries in Central and Eastern Europe are provided the reassurance from NATO and the presence of NATO needed to meet their security needs,\u201d he said. Opinion: What\u2019s Russia doing in Ukraine, and what can the West do? Battling ISIS Not on the official agenda in Wales, the ongoing spread of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria will nonetheless play a major role in Obama\u2019s discussions in Wales. The meeting comes after a video posted Tuesday that shows the beheading of a second American, Steven Sotloff. Obama: 'We don't have a strategy yet' Will Obama hit ISIS in Syria? The killing of Sotloff follows a threat made by ISIS last month during the videotaped beheading of American journalist James Foley. The latest video threatens the life of another man, a British citizen. Obama has said he wants to form a coalition of governments willing to take on the group, which has taken over huge swaths of territory and terrorized ethnic minorities. Officials say that could include a role for NATO, though in what capacity is so far unclear \u2013 after all, Obama himself hasn\u2019t yet decided whether to undertake airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. Western European leaders must also confront the growing threat of \u201chomegrown terrorism\u201d \u2013 citizens leaving to fight with militant groups in Syria and Iraq, and potentially returning to stage a terror attack at home. The host of the NATO summit, British Prime Minister David Cameron, already announced new measures to combat that threat after a London-accented militant was filmed beheading journalist James Foley. ISIS video shows beheading of second journalist \u201cThere will have to be an acknowledgment that individual European countries, and certainly the United States, are taking action, actively working militarily on issues relating to Iraq and then potentially Syria,\u201d said Kathleen Hicks, the director of the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Cameron lays out plans to counter UK jihadi threat Afghanistan\u2019s future Just as the United States is anxiously watching the final outcome of Afghanistan\u2019s recent election, NATO member states are wondering what their role will be there after this year ends. Both candidates in the contested vote have said they\u2019ll sign an agreement allowing U.S. troops to remain there past 2014. But without a winner, the Bilateral Security Agreement remains unsigned. Hanging over the decision is the security situation in Iraq, which completely unraveled after U.S. troops\u2019 withdrawal. Neither Obama nor his NATO counterparts want the same thing to happen in Afghanistan. Gunmen target spy agency in Afghanistan \u201cWe\u2019re moving into a world in which NATO will be less salient in Afghanistan, but in which we want to capitalize on the lessons that we\u2019ve learned, the partnerships that we\u2019ve built,\u201d Kupchan said. No expansion NATO last admitted new members in 2009, but leaders are quick to note this year\u2019s summit isn\u2019t about expansion. The appetite for letting countries like Bosnia and Macedonia \u2013 labeled \u201caspirant countries\u201d \u2013 into the club has waned. It\u2019s hard enough to get the 28 current members to agree on things, officials say. Case in point: NATO is having a tough time convincing its members to spend more on their militaries, a requirement for membership. The United States spends about 4.4% of its gross domestic product on defense, according to NATO figures; the European average is 1.6%. NATO\u2019s guidelines encourage countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. \u201cPart of the reason I think this NATO meeting is going to be so important is to refocus attention on the critical function that NATO plays to make sure that every country is contributing in order to deliver on the promise of our Article 5 assurances,\u201d Obama said at a news conference last week. But analysts say that as long as economic conditions in Europe remain bleak, countries will remain hesitant to ramp up their military spending, even as external threats grow. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis has been a wake-up call,\u201d said Conley, the Europe program director at CSIS. \u201cNow, whether the Europeans will hit the snooze button or not, again, I don\u2019t know, but it has certainly shaken them, that they have allowed their military defense spending to atrophy to a point where they are now vulnerable.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A late entry into Montana Senate race, Amanda Curtis is unabashedly liberal Many insiders dismiss her candidacy as she trails in polls, but she's raising money On many issues, Curtis admits that she needs to study up, but Election Day is not that far off Curtis stepped in after John Walsh's candidacy imploded over plagiarism allegations U.S. Sen. Jon Tester is famous for his flat-top and middle of the road politics. Amanda Curtis, Tester\u2019s fellow Democrat and would-be colleague from Montana, is known for her nose ring and her unabashedly liberal affiliations. Although many insiders dismiss her campaign as a long shot, Amanda Curtis is raising money at a prodigious rate and battling assertions that she is too radical for conservative-leaning Montana. But on many issues, the candidate admits she needs to study up. But time is running out with Election Day a little more than two months away. Curtis, a Butte math teacher serving her first-term in the Montana state house, has already raised $180,000 in 10 days, according to her campaign, and sees \u201cpeople coming out of the woodwork\u201d to support her. According to Curtis, who spoke with CNN last week, her nomination as the Democratic Senate candidate \u201ccame from incredible circumstance.\u201d Curtis added that she had not even planned to seek re-election to her seat in the state legislature, let alone run for the U.S. Senate. An untested candidate But that \u201cincredible circumstance\u201d comes with a price for Curtis and the Democrats who thrust an untested candidate into the national spotlight overnight. When asked her position on the situation in Iraq, Curtis told CNN, \u201cGive me a little more time.\u201d On the border crisis, \u201cI\u2019ll need more time, you know only 11 days ago I was painting my storm windows.\u201d One area the teacher had a firm answer was Common Core, the controversial national education standards opposed by teachers\u2019 unions but supported by the Obama administration. Curtis said, \u201cI am excited by Common Core, as a teacher \u2026 but there has been a rush to implement it and that\u2019s the problem.\u201d Montana State University professor David Parker concedes that \u201cshe\u2019s clearly rough. \u2026 It\u2019s going to take time to get her answers down to sound bite quality.\u201d Not going to back down But Robyn Driscoll, a Democratic Montana state senator, finds the lack of polish \u201ca refreshing change from the usual spin. \u2026 Her approach tells voters she is not going to back down.\u201d Her priorities: access to public lands, opposition to Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s House GOP budget, and \u201ceconomic policies for the 100%, not the 1%.\u201d Curtis, 34, has already garnered the support of the state\u2019s unions, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean\u2019s Democracy for America and Tester, the state\u2019s two-term Democratic senator. \u201cAs Montana\u2019s senior senator, I\u2019ll be supporting Amanda as well as all Democrats who are talking about the issues that are important to Montana,\u201d Tester told CNN. \u201cAmanda\u2019s energy and enthusiasm will be a refreshing change and will bring attention to issues facing working families like education and access to our public lands.\u201d Tester helping out Tester\u2019s spokeswoman Marnee Banks confirmed that he has been helping Curtis fundraise and plans to continue to make calls on her behalf. When Tester\u2019s counterpart, Max Baucus, left the Senate this year for the U.S. ambassador\u2019s post in Beijing, Montana Democrats were in a pickle. They needed a replacement. They chose John Walsh, a decorated veteran, the head of the state\u2019s National Guard and its lieutenant governor, to keep the seat blue. It was already an uphill battle in the Big Sky state against popular freshman U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, the Republican nominee. Then the plagiarism charges hit after a New York Times story detailed how Walsh lifted large parts of his master\u2019s thesis from others\u2019 work. Walsh dropped his campaign within two weeks, vowing to stay in the Senate. Little time to vet candidate Rushing to fill the seat, they chose Curtis at a nominating convention with little time to vet her for the job. After the nomination was announced, the state Republican Party circulated a montage of Curtis\u2019s Youtube videos that catalogue her first term as a state representative. In the video, Curtis is critical of gun-rights supporters, calls herself \u201can anarchist at heart,\u201d and explains she had to restrain herself from punching a fellow state representative who expressed anti-gay sentiments. Chairwoman of the Young Democrats of Montana Marissa Perry said the GOP is taking the remarks out of context in an attempt to smear Curtis. \u201cI encourage you to watch the whole thing. They are not showing the full story,\u201d Perry told CNN. Curtis, for her part, stands by the videos she contends are being manipulated, and encouraged voters to watch them in their entirety. \u201cThose videos are my public record,\u201d Curtis said. Conservative criticism Conservative critics have unearthed other controversial statements and affiliations, including Curtis\u2019 association with the Industrial Workers of the World. IWW is a far left union movement that hopes to \u201ctake possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth,\u201d according to its website. Her husband, Kevin, is listed as a local organizer for IWW in Montana. Phil Kerpen of the conservative advocacy group American Commitment, which first published Curtis\u2019 affiliation with IWW, told CNN, \u201cPlagiarism disqualified a Senate candidate, but extremist ideology, advocacy of violence, and membership in the Industrial Workers of the World results in nothing but praise for his replacement. This is what the Democratic Party has become in 2014.\u201d Curtis campaign manager Clayton Elliot was asked about the union affiliation and criticism, but replied by emphasizing her populist approach. \u201cAmanda grew up in a family that struggled to put food on the table so she knows first hand the struggles of Montana working families. Unlike Congressman Daines, Amanda believes that we must put working Montana families ahead of corporate special interests,\u201d Elliot said. Dems see her as a net-plus Democratic strategists see Curtis\u2019s firebrand politics as a net-plus, if not for her race, for down ballot races. They confided that before her entry into the race, liberal voters were unlikely to turn out for the Democratic ticket in an off-year. The Curtis run will change that, they told CNN. The Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is widely expected to lay low and not invest in the Curtis campaign, which is down double digits in the latest polling. Professor Parker thinks it increasingly unlikely Curtis will receive significant outside support \u201cunless she closes in on Daines in the polls and money race.\u201d For their part, the National Republican Senate Committee is confident that Curtis won\u2019t be able to breakthrough against Daines, who has a huge advantage in name recognition and fundraising. \u201cOur strategy will remain internal, but it seems telling that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is telling allies that they\u2019ve given up on the race entirely,\u201d said NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen. But Curtis backers remain upbeat. Driscoll said the GOP \u201cshould take (Amanda) seriously\u201d since she raised $150,000 in the first week of her campaign \u201cjust using social media!\u201d Calls by CNN to the DSCC seeking comment were not immediately returned.",

Rand Paul kicks off a three-day swing Monday across Iowa, holding campaign-style events and fund-raisers with local politicians as the potential Republican presidential contender barnstorms the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Paul\u2019s route will take him through nine cities from the state\u2019s western border to its eastern edge. The Kentucky Republican will also help the state Republican Party open multiple offices ahead of the midterm elections. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for Sen. Paul to hear the concerns of average Iowans as well as job creators,\u201d said Steve Grubbs, Paul\u2019s chief Iowa strategist and a longtime political operative in the Hawkeye State. As Paul lays the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign, he has kept Iowa a top priority. This is his fourth trip there since the 2012 presidential election. The 'Inside Politics' forecast Rand Paul takes aim at Rick Perry Rand & Rubio's 2016 moves Paul will leave the state on Wednesday, a day before the start of the Iowa State Fair, a popular venue for presidential hopefuls. A small swarm of other potential GOP contenders will travel to Iowa this weekend to attend a popular event for social conservatives. But Paul won\u2019t be there, preferring to give the candidates he\u2019s been helping some breathing room and allow them to be the focus. Poll: Republicans slightly behind Clinton in key 2016 states Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa, said the senator\u2019s plan isn\u2019t a bad idea, especially in a midterm election year. \u201cYou want to come in and do favors for Iowa politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re at the state fair, the attention is on you and not the person you\u2019re trying to help.\u201d \u201cNext year, you call in those favors,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s how it works.\u201d Paul actually starts the week in Omaha, Nebraska, where he\u2019ll appear publicly with Ben Sasse, the GOP nominee for Nebraska\u2019s open Senate seat. Then, he\u2019ll quickly hop across the state line to help the Iowa GOP open an office in Council Bluffs, where he\u2019s expected to appear with the state\u2019s GOP Senate nominee, Joni Ernst. Potential 2016 GOP candidates tout conservative principles in Iowa Later Monday he travels north to Sioux City for another office opening, and then to a fund-raiser farther north, in Okoboji, for Rep. Steve King, a longtime congressman with considerable sway among the state\u2019s social conservatives. Tuesday morning Paul is back on the road for a fund-raiser in Clear Lake, before a stop at the Iowa GOP office in Hiawatha. Continuing east, he\u2019ll attend a fund-raiser for Mariannette Miller-Meeks\u2019 congressional campaign in Iowa City, and then he has two events in Davenport, including a tour of the corporate headquarters of Von Maur department stores. Wednesday he attends a breakfast in Urbandale and wraps up his public appearances for the week with another GOP office opening in the same city, a suburb of Des Moines. On some issues, Paul and Christie sound a lot alike Paul\u2019s political action committee, RANDPAC, has made two big hires from Iowa in recent months: Grubbs \u2013 who\u2019s also a former state representative and state party chairman \u2013 and A.J. Spiker, a prominent figure among Iowa\u2019s libertarian-leaning Republicans. Paul\u2019s father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, generated a huge following in Iowa during his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. The libertarian movement went on to gain sizable influence in the state\u2019s Republican Party after the election \u2013 Spiker, for example, became state GOP chairman \u2013 but mainstream Republicans took back control of the party earlier this year. A big question will be whether Rand Paul, who\u2019s considered more moderate than his father, can re-energize the so-called Liberty faction of the state party, while also garnering support from its social conservatives and mainstream Republicans. \u201cOne of the reasons I signed on to work with Sen. Paul is I could see how he appeals to all of our party,\u201d Grubbs said. \u201cThere are very few candidates who have that ability to unify our party. I think that he can do that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "GOP, Dems push competing border plans, but policy change may be biggest obstacle Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Jeff Miller said they have reached a deal over VA reforms Congress is likely to punt on a highway bill with a stopgap measure through May House Republicans expected to authorize suit against President Obama over Obamacare Congress faces several big issues before beginning its August recess at the end of the week. While it appears lawmakers might get to a few things on the to-do list, other matters are likely to be left until they return in September. Here\u2019s what will and won\u2019t get done before the end of the week: 1. Crisis on the border: Agencies responsible for dealing with the influx of youth migrants from Central America on the southern border could run out of money next month. But competing legislative proposals means it\u2019s highly unlikely a resolution will materialize before Friday. Senate Democrats are looking at a $2.7 billion plan to address the border crisis, while House Republicans are crafting a measure totaling less than $1 billion. President Barack Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion. Congress struggles with border bill How is Obama handling the border crisis? Immigrant or refugee? The major sticking point overall is whether to change a 2008 law to make it easier to deport those streaming across the border from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Central American leaders to Obama: We\u2019re working on it Most Republicans argue for the change in policy because it can take months or years to determine legal status under current law. They want to link any new money to a change in the 2008 law. Most Democrats oppose altering the law, saying doing so could lead to an unfair process that might short-change kids fleeing gangs and violence who want to stay in the United States legally. They want any new money to include no change in policy. But Democrats have sent mixed messages. Obama top administration officials say they are open to addressing the 2008 law, while Hispanic lawmakers and top leaders warn any major revisions are unacceptable. Poll: Border crisis impacts public opinion House Republicans are expected as early as Monday to unveil details of legislation that would fund border and other related agencies through the end of September. They could vote by week\u2019s end. Speaker John Boehner says he wants the House to act but it\u2019s unclear if anything can pass. 2. A fix for veterans\u2019 health care: CNN uncovered troubling stories of delayed care for veterans, some of whom died. Allegations surfaced of secret waiting lists for patient care, mismanagement, and bonuses for executives who oversaw such dysfunction. Investigations were launched, the VA secretary resigned, and Congress stepped in. Veterans caught up in the bureaucratic mess who feared retaliation for speaking out prompted Congress to fast-track legislation to revise procedures at hospitals and provide more resources to address case backlogs. VA reform deal expected Vet's mom: He went downhill with the VA VA may have altered death records Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, a independent who normally sides with Democrats, and his House Republican counterpart, Rep. Jeff Miller, announced a deal on a $17 billion pacage on Monday. Public outrage over the alarming VA shortcomings has lit a fire under Congress to ensure a final measure gets to Obama before week\u2019s end. On Friday, 115 House members wrote to Boehner demanding that Congress stay in session until it approves a bill on veterans care. Veterans waiting longer for cancer care The Senate is expected to confirm Robert McDonald, a former CEO of Proctor & Gamble and a West Point graduate as the next VA secretary as early as Tuesday. 3. Highway fund running on empty: The highway trust fund, which pays for road and bridge repair carried out by the states, is about to run out of money. Funded by gasoline taxes, the account has been in trouble for years with prices at the pump steadily higher and people driving more fuel efficient cars and trucks. The sluggish economy also has cut down on fuel purchases. Less money going into the trust fund fund means hard choices. Raising the 18.4 cents per gallon gas tax is a non-starter, especially in an election year. So where will the money come from? Congress in the past has diverted billions in general tax revenues to shore up the trust fund, and that is what\u2019s on the table now. A short-term House bill would infuse the trust fund with $11 billion in new revenue. It is expected to pass the Senate this week. But that measure just means this emergency will arise again next May, when the balance gets low again. Without federal money, states will have to curtail \u2013 and shut down, in some cases \u2013 road projects. That\u2019s unappealing on both sides of the aisle since construction provides a lot of jobs and fuels economic growth in other ways. 5 ways the highway crisis could affect you 4. House Republicans vs. Obama: The House is expected later this week to pass a resolution authorizing Boehner to sue Obama for exceeding his executive authority. Republicans are basing the case on Obama\u2019s decision last year to authorize a one-year delay in the Obamacare requirement that businesses provide health coverage. Although House Republicans voted to do the same thing, they maintain it\u2019s the job of Congress to change the laws, not the President\u2019s \u201cThis is also not about me vs. President Obama. This is about future Congresses and future presidents. There is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch of our government. It is the judiciary branch\u2019s role to help resolve it,\u201d Boehner wrote on Monday in a USA Today opinion piece. White House to GOP: Game on Holder, GOP dismiss impeachment GOP narrows lawsuit to Obamacare House Democrats are using the case to raise money and make argument that the suit is merely a political move to rally the Republican base ahead of the midterms. There is a small contingent of House conservatives who want to impeach Obama, but Boehner has said multiple times that he disagrees with such a step. A CNN-ORC poll released last week shows that nearly two thirds of Americans oppose any move to impeach Obama. 5. Funding government agencies: The most basic function of Congress is its power of the purse. It decides annually how much each agency can spend. To date, the House has passed about half of the annual spending bills establishing budgets for these departments for the fiscal year starting October 1. But the Senate has not voted on one yet. Unless both pass some type of massive spending bill to cover everything at once before the end of September, there could be another federal shutdown. Remember last fall. Boehner has said he expects the House to approve a resolution extending current levels of funding through some time in December. When lawmakers return after Labor Day, there are about 10 days left in the legislative calendar for a deal to come together. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett contributed to this story",

            "article_content": "Both Iran, United States want to quell the ISIS militant surge in Iraq Secretary of State Kerry suggests possible collaboration with Iran The issue raises questions in Congress Working with Iran might be a necessary evil, retired U.S. general says How can it be? The United States and Iran, sworn enemies for 35 years, are talking about working together to quell the al Qaeda-inspired insurgency sweeping northern Iraq. Such cooperation sounds unthinkable. They are fierce adversaries on issues such as terrorism, Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and Syria\u2019s civil war. Iranian leaders call the United States the \u201cGreat Satan,\u201d while former President George W. Bush labeled Iran as part of an \u201cAxis of Evil.\u201d It was headline news last year when their leaders spoke briefly by phone, the first contact at that level since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 drove the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from power. But should we be too surprised by this latest version of strange bedfellows, now known as \u201cfrenemies\u201d in the modern vernacular? There\u2019s even an old saying of uncertain origin to define it \u2013  the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Deputy Iraq PM says no need for Iran help What's the next step in Iraq? What\u2019s going on? This time, the common enemy is the threat of a regional war based on sectarian battle lines, pitting Sunni and Shia Muslim governments and peoples against each other across the Middle East. Only the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its al Qaeda backers would want that, it seems. They seek to establish a Sunni-dominated Islamic state stretching from Iraq to northern Syria. \u201cWe are now closer than ever to a regional war in the Middle East,\u201d said Paulo S\u00e9rgio Pinheiro, who heads the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria. \u201cEvents in neighboring Iraq will have grave and violent repercussions for Syria. The most dangerous aspect of these developments has been the rise of the sectarian threat, a direct consequence of the dominance of extremist groups like ISIS.\u201d Shiite majority Iran seeks to protect Shia interests and power in Iraq, while the United States wants to see a stable Iraq after pulling its troops out of the country in 2011 to end its eight-year campaign that began by toppling Saddam Hussein from power. Also, Iran has sounded a more positive tone toward the West since last year\u2019s election of President Hassan Rouhani to succeed the more volatile Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. On Wednesday, Rouhani pledged that Iran would do whatever was necessary to protect  Shia holy sites in Iraq. Where do things stand? U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry suggested possible collaboration with Iran, telling Yahoo News on Monday that \u201cwe are open to discussions if there\u2019s something constructive that can be contributed by Iran \u2013 if Iran is prepared to do something that is going to respect the integrity and sovereignty of Iraq.\u201d Then, the United States and Iran held \u201cvery brief discussions\u201d about Iraq and the threat posed by ISIS on the sidelines of nuclear negotiations in Vienna, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. A senior State Department official said while Washington was open to engaging the Iranians, \u201cthese engagements will not include military coordination or strategic determinations about Iraq\u2019s future over the heads of the Iraqi people.\u201d The official said on condition of not being identified that the discussion concerns the ISIS threat to \u201cmany countries in the region, including Iran,\u201d as well as the need to support a more inclusive approach by the Iraqi government than the sectarian efforts by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. What\u2019s in it for the United States? Defense Minister Chuck Hagel noted Wednesday that the United States and Iran cooperated early in the Afghanistan war. He told a congressional panel that \u201cwe had worked with the Iranians on that western border of Afghanistan.\u201d \u201cSo there\u2019s some history here of sharing common interests,\u201d Hagel said, citing \u201csignificant differences\u201d with Iran, but adding that \u201cI don\u2019t think these issues come neatly wrapped in geopolitical graduate school papers.\u201d Even a conservative member of Congress who once advocated military strikes on Iran said Washington may need Tehran\u2019s help. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to anybody to help our people from being captured or killed,\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. \u201cAnd this is a time where the Iranians in a small way might help.\u201d Graham made clear he disapproved of Iran, calling authorities \u201cthugs and killers,\u201d then summed up the situation by saying: \u201cBut we are where we are.\u201d A host of experts agree, including Meghan O\u2019Sullivan, a former deputy national security adviser during the Iraq war. \u201cThere is a political solution here that I think could be both in Iran\u2019s interest and the U.S. interest,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. Whether the United States likes it or not, working with Iran on the Iraq crisis might be a necessary evil, retired Maj. Gen. James \u201cSpider\u201d Marks said. \u201cThere are necessary steps that we have to take with Tehran that we\u2019ve probably never taken before, and would prefer not to take,\u201d Marks said. What\u2019s the downside? Teaming up with Iran could certainly have its pitfalls. The United States is wary of furthering Iran\u2019s already considerable influence in Iraq. The Shiite Iranian regime is Maliki\u2019s closest ally in the region, and a U.S.-Iranian partnership could alienate Iraq\u2019s Sunni population as well as Sunni nations in the region such as Saudi Arabia that are U.S. allies. Meanwhile, the United States doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize international talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program that resumed this week. The talks are intended to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and the United States and Israel have repeatedly said they would use military means against Iran if necessary to achieve that outcome. House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that the United States should \u201cabsolutely not\u201d talk to Iranians about the  Iraq crisis. \u201cI can just imagine what our friends in the region, our allies will be thinking by reaching out to Iran at a time when they continue to pay for terrorists and foster terrorism not only in Syria, in Lebanon but in Israel as well,\u201d the Ohio Republican told reporters. Will Iran and the U.S. work together on the ground? A senior security official in Baghdad said Iran has already sent about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to help fight the ISIS militants. Rouhani then denied that happened, but said he would be open to helping if asked, according to Iranian state TV. A Pentagon spokesman said Monday that military coordination with Iran was not in the cards, similar to what the senior State Department official told CNN. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said Obama has ruled out sending any U.S. combat troops to Iraq. However, Graham noted the need to coordinate in other ways, such as coordinating possible U.S. air strikes on ISIS fighters if Obama orders them. \u201cIf we start flying airplanes, it makes some sense to talk to the Iranians about what we\u2019re doing so they don\u2019t shoot us down and we don\u2019t bomb them,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "NEW: Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl salutes general His family was not present for his arrival Army officer says there's no set time line for the soldier's reintegration Bergdahl is described in stable condition Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the last American prisoner of war, returned home early Friday, his hero\u2019s welcome supplanted by a controversial prisoner swap and his reputation tarnished by accusations he was a deserter. He arrived in San Antonio from a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, where he\u2019d been recuperating since his release May 31 in exchange for five Taliban figures held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The 28-year-old Bergdahl, the longest-held U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War, was taken to the San Antonio Military Medical Center. \u201cThe Army will continue to ensure that Sgt. Bergdahl receives the care, time and space he needs to complete his recovery and reintegration,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. Officials at an afternoon press conference described Bergdahl\u2019s condition as stable. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased with his physical state. He was able to walk into the hospital in a functional manner. We\u2019re going to be planning more comprehensive testing,\u201d said Col. Ronald Wool, admitting physician at Brooke Army Medical Center. Wool said Bergdahl, who has not had the opportunity to practice and speak English for the past five years, spoke in English. Maj. Gen. Joseph DiSalvo told reporters he\u2019d seen Bergdahl for approximately 60 seconds. They exchanged salutes and the soldier \u201clooked good \u2026 had good deportment,\u201d DiSalvo said. This next phase of his recovery will likely not be as intense as what he underwent at the U.S. military hospital in Germany, Chris Heben, a former Navy SEAL commenting on the case, told CNN. \u201cEmotionally, it\u2019s probably almost surreal for him,\u201d Heben said. \u201cHe\u2019s back in the U.S., and he\u2019s no longer under that intense microscope where he was at Landstuhl from a medical standpoint of psychiatric evaluation\u201d Bergdahl\u2019s full physical recovery may take months; his public rehabilitation will likely take longer. The swap that freed Bergdahl has stirred up a political storm in Washington. And almost-daily revelations about Bergdahl\u2019s time in Afghanistan have not helped matters. \u201cEverybody has a piece of the story, and very few people have the whole story,\u201d a Defense Department psychologist told reporters. The backlash has gotten so bad that a public celebration in his hometown of Hailey, Idaho \u2013 one that the 8,000 residents there had waited five years for \u2013 has been scrapped for fear of protests. Bergdahl has not yet spoken to his family and his parents were not present for his arrival. \u201cIt isn\u2019t over for us,\u201d Bergdahl\u2019s father, Bob, told reporters last week. \u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s just beginning for Jani and I, and our family. There\u2019s a long process here.\u201d The disappearance Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan\u2019s Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. Several veterans and soldiers call him a deserter who walked off his base. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent \u2013 something officials couldn\u2019t learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. The reasons On Thursday, The Daily Beast published two letters the solider reportedly wrote to his family while imprisoned by the Taliban. In the letters \u2013 dated 2012 and 2013 \u2013 Bergdahl discusses his life and partially explains why he disappeared. \u201cLeadership was lacking, if not non-existent,\u201d he wrote.. The conditions were bad and looked to be getting worse for the men that where actuly (sic) the ones risking thier (sic) lives from attack,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf this letter makes it to the U.S.A., tell those involved in the investigation that there are more sides to the cittuwation (sic),\u201d Bergdahl said. \u201cPlease tell D.C. to wait for all evadince (sic) to come in.\u201d Heben, the former Navy SEAL, said the letters could hold clues about what happened to Bergdahl. \u201cI think he\u2019s planting a seed of justification for why he went AWOL and why he abandoned his post,\u201d he said. Sen. John McCain, in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d said his advice is to discount anything that Bergdahl wrote while in captivity. \u201cIn that situation, it\u2019s clear his captors had the ability to force him to write whatever they wanted him to,\u201d McCain said. The captivity Bergdahl was captured by insurgents with links to the Haqqani network in Pakistan, an Afghan Taliban commander not authorized to speak to the media told CNN. Americans detained abroad Over the five years, the captive was transferred back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Taliban commander said. Citing an American official, The New York Times reported that Bergdahl told medical staff that the box he was kept in for weeks at a time was pitch black and like a shark cage. CNN has reported that Bergdahl has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape, according to a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified. A Defense Department psychologist notes that historically, those held by \u201cless organized groups\u201d \u2013 such as those holding Bergdahl \u2013 \u201chave harsher treatment\u201d than those held by representatives of governments recognized by the world. The wait In the half-decade that he was gone, Bergdahl\u2019s parents held rallies, maintained a website and lobbied congressmen. The elder Bergdahl grew a long beard, immersed himself in books about Afghanistan and its Pashto language, to speak to his son\u2019s captors if only from afar. The Rocky Mountain town of Hailey is just minutes from the renowned tourist destination of Sun Valley, famed for its skiing. Yellow balloons and American flags line the sidewalks of Hailey. And residents planted one tree for each of the five years Bergdahl was held captive in Afghanistan. \u201cThere were times where we wondered, but (parents) Jani and Bob Bergdahl never once gave up faith that their son was coming home to them,\u201d family friend Stefanie O\u2019Neill said. The rescue With Qatar as the broker, the United States struck a deal with the Taliban to free Bergdahl. The price: the release of five Taliban fighters from Guantanamo. Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bergdahl The Obama administration didn\u2019t tell Congress of the releases. Under law, the White House has to give a 30-day notice to Capitol Hill before any terrorists are transferred from Guantanamo. Believing that his health was deteriorating, the administration said it acted quickly to save his life. U.S. special operations forces recovered Bergdahl without incident on May 31 at a pickup point in eastern Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan. Who was swapped for Bergdahl? The reintegration Bergdahl\u2019s daily routine will focus on four key areas: medical care, psychological support, debriefings and family support. \u201cThis is to help a person who has had no control of their own life for years now regain that control step by step,\u201d said Army spokeswoman Arwen Consaul. Traumatizing experiences \u2013 known only to Bergdahl \u2013 may have distorted any sense of normalcy that he might have had, as well as mechanisms he might have used to cope with everyday life. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in a situation where everybody else has controlled them or something else has taken charge. And they have not been able to choose,\u201d the Defense Department psychologist said about long-held captives generally. \u201cNow they\u2019re overwhelmed with daily living, and so we kind of start the process of giving them back the ability to predict.\u201d The case for each returnee is different. \u201cThe reintegration of Sgt. Bergdahl is a comprehensive process. There is no set time line for any phase of reintegration. Each phase that Sgt. Bergdahl participates in is a custom event, fitted to his individual circumstances,\u201d DiSalvo told reporters Friday. David Rhode, a former New York Times journalist who was held captive by the Taliban for seven months, said Bergdahl faces a long road ahead. \u201cPsychologically, there will be a long debrief,\u201d said Rhode, who was taken in Afghanistan and held in Pakistan until he managed to escape. \u201cThey\u2019re actually going to want intelligence (about) who held him.\u201d Army human resources officials will determine where Bergdahl goes after he completes the reintegration process. He\u2019ll receive follow-up care and have access to a psychiatrist for the rest of his life. Bob Bergdahl appears understanding about the delay. He compared his son\u2019s situation to that of a diver going deep on a dive: \u201cIf he comes up too fast, it could kill him.\u201d Hagel on Bergdahl deal What was initially touted as America\u2019s commitment to never leaving a man behind, Bergdahl\u2019s release has been anything but universally celebrated. In the partisan frenzy permeating Washington in an election year, lawmakers have accused the White House of overstepping presidential authority without consulting Congress. Republican critics contend the cost of the deal was too high because it freed hardened terror suspects to possibly rejoin the fight against U.S. interests, especially in return for a soldier accused by some in his unit of deserting his post. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has defended the deal \u2013 in sometimes testy exchanges \u2013 saying it was Bergdahl\u2019s last and best chance to get out. Hagel appeared Wednesday at a House Armed Services Committee hearing to defend the swap, where Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, appeared to strike a nerve when he pressed the defense chief on why it was taking the U.S. military so long to interview Bergdahl. A U.S. official told CNN that Pentagon and Army officials have looked at the claims, and \u201cright now there is no evidence to back that up.\u201d But the damage has been done. The FBI said it was investigating threats against Bergdahl\u2019s parents. The homecoming The controversy has forced Hailey to put its homecoming on hold. Town officials say it would be too hard to manage all of the supporters as well as all the protesters who might show up. \u201cI got a phone call from a person \u2013 well, an attorney at an event organizer in California who didn\u2019t want to reveal the group, but wanted to know if they could bring 2,000 people up to protest the event, if they\u2019d be allowed into the event,\u201d Police Chief Jeff Gunter told CNN. \u201cSo that was definitely a concern. There was also a gentleman in Texas who wanted to bring up a bunch of people to protest the event as well.\u201d The future Bergdahl is still technically in the Army. Up for promotion in June, he could return to his unit in Alaska, get reassigned somewhere else or be discharged. Some members of his platoon want Bergdahl to face military trial for desertion under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Still, even if he deserted, a senior defense official said earlier this month that Bergdahl will not likely face any punishment. As he told CNN, on condition of anonymity: \u201cFive years is enough.\u201d The Bergdahl Files: A custom magazine Hagel on Bergdahl deal: \u2018We could have done a better job\u2019 of informing Congress Critics, supporters square off over Bergdahl release CNN\u2019s Ed Payne, Dana Ford, Holly Yan and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Schiff: Deal offers \"no guarantee\" Taliban commanders will be tracked Democrats say Bergdahl deal emerged quickly and military approved Speaker Boehner says the swap means \"lost lives\" down the road Congress should have been told ahead of time, legislators say It sounds more like schoolyard taunting than a debate involving presidential power, negotiating with terrorists and bringing home a captured American soldier. Political leaders escalated their rhetoric and raised new arguments on Tuesday about the secret deal that obtained the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl on May 31 in exchange for five Taliban figures detained at Guantanamo Bay. The controversy touches on a range of volatile issues \u2013 ending the Afghanistan war, releasing Guantanamo detainees, accusations by members of Bergdahl\u2019s unit that he deserted \u2013 and it comes in an election year that has further widened the seemingly maximized partisan divide in Washington. Costs from swap will include \u201clost lives\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, a leading Republican voice, told reporters he had no doubt \u201cthat there are going to be costs, lost lives associated with what came out of this,\u201d calling the swap a de facto deal with Taliban terrorists. Boehner not told of Bergdahl swap King: 'I would not have traded for him' Why hasn't Bergdahl spoken to parents? On the Democratic side, Senate allies of President Barack Obama said the deal mediated by the government of Qatar came together too quickly to consult with Congress over an exchange that critics from both parties have labeled too costly. \u201cAll I can tell you is this: (the government) knew a day ahead of time that the transfer was going to take place. They knew an hour ahead of time where it was going to take place,\u201d said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, while his Democratic colleague from Michigan, Carl Levin, noted the military\u2019s top leadership fully backed the exchange. \u201cWhether you agree with them or not, its critically important that the American people know that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the vice chair of the Joint Chiefs strongly recommended this agreement knowing full well Bergdahl, one, had left his unit and knowing full well how bad these Taliban people were,\u201d Levin said. The dispute involves both the dynamics of the exchange and the endless argument between the executive and legislative branches over presidential powers. Legal requirement or courtesy? Members of both parties complain the Obama administration should have let Congress know ahead of time that the exchange was taking place. Some cite the 30 days\u2019 notice called for by the National Defense Authorization Act, while others say a simple heads-up would have sufficed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of courtesy, whether it was in law or not,\u201d said conservative Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a regular critic of the President. \u201cA matter of this importance should have been discussed with at least key leaders in the Congress.\u201d Administration officials say the deal came together quickly, and the risks to Bergdahl and the military commandos involved in collecting him near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border required keeping the exchange top-secret. \u201cThis was a secret military mission in which disclosure of the mission could put into jeopardy not just the life of Sergeant Bergdahl but also the lives of the American servicemen who were involved in the mission,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday. \u201cSo discretion on this matter was important.\u201d However, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon of California called such reasoning for not notifying Congress \u201cabsurd.\u201d \u201cNothing in the law requires the Secretary of Defense to disclose the physical details of the transfer,\u201d said McKeon, a Republican. \u201cThey are merely required to notify us in a classified manner that a transfer will take place, and of the conditions set to prevent a terrorist from re-entering the fight.\u201d Boehner noted that he was briefed as early as six months before another significant and secret military mission \u2013 the 2011 raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. \u201cI was given a heads-up several days before\u201d the bin Laden mission, Boehner said. \u201cSo this idea that they couldn\u2019t trust us to not leak things is just not true.\u201d Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate from West Virginia known for criticizing the administration at times, said his main concern was the release of five Taliban figures who could return to the battlefield against U.S forces and interests. Who was swapped for Bergdahl? Congressman: Deal gives \u2018no guarantee\u2019 Taliban figures will be tracked Under the exchange, the released Taliban detainees were taken to Qatar, where the government says it will keep them under watch for at least a year. But some lawmakers fear there\u2019s no guarantee. \u201cHow we are sure that the Qataris are going to do what they are supposed to do and we are able to keep (the released Taliban figures) from engaging again,\u201d Manchin told reporters. A memorandum of understanding between the United States and Qatar on the deal that freed Bergdahl offered \u201cno guarantee\u201d that the five Taliban commanders exchanged for the captured Army sergeant would be tracked, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee told CNN. Rep. Adam Schiff reviewed the agreement and said, based on his reading, that it is possible the former U.S. detainees \u201cmight disappear even during the first year in Qatar.\u201d Schiff told CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto that the United States has \u201csome capability to track them while in Qatar,\u201d but after the first year, he said, all bets are off. \u201cWe have to expect them to return to the fight,\u201d Schiff said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry defended the swap in an interview with CNN over the weekend, saying the former detainees would be monitored closely, and not just by officials in Qatar. He wouldn\u2019t say who else will be watching, but he said the United States is confident the conditions of their release will be honored. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Tuesday that the Obama administration had received \u201cassurances from Qatar\u201d during the deal. \u201cWe have acknowledged that some of these individuals could attempt to return to activities that are of concern. The President said so explicitly on his trip last week,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have confidence that we will be in a position to go after them if, in fact, they are engaging in activities that threaten our defenses.\u201d Democrats complain about lack of notice Administration officials gave a classified briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday after a similar session on Monday with House members. On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will appear before McKeon\u2019s armed services committee to discuss the exchange, which he signed off on as the Pentagon chief. \u201cHe looks forward to explaining why the President\u2019s decision to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl was the right one, and why the process we undertook in doing so was in keeping with our national interests,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday. After the briefing to House members, some said they were told as many as 80 to 90 administration officials knew of the pending exchange ahead of time, while Congress did not. Earnest told reporters the figure of 80 to 90 officials discussed in the classified briefing referred to the number with knowledge of intelligence involving Taliban activities in Qatar. The number of administration officials who knew ahead of time of the Bergdahl swap was smaller, Earnest said, but he refused to provide a specific figure. Schiff told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d that White House officials should have told congressional leaders, even if the law gave them wiggle room. \u201cI think the President had the constitutional authority \u2026 to make this decision without consulting with Congress,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBut I think it would have been wiser, far wiser, for the administration to have notified, certainly the leadership of Congress in the interest of having good relations.\u201d Polls show divide, with more disapproving More Americans disapprove than approve of Bergdahl\u2019s release in exchange for five Taliban detainees, according to two new national polls. The surveys also indicate a wide partisan divide, with most Republicans opposing the deal while most Democrats approve of it. Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan\u2019s Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent \u2013 something Army officials couldn\u2019t learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. The prisoner exchange has become a political football, with Republicans who once called for the administration to work for Bergdahl\u2019s return now saying the cost was too high. Was Rand Paul\u2019s red meat joke a bit too raw? Slow recovery Bergdahl is \u201ccontinuing to improve every day\u201d as he recovers at a military hospital in Germany, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said Monday, but he hasn\u2019t spoken with his family yet. The \u201cdecision to speak with the family is a decision the returnee has to make when he or she is emotionally in the right place to make the phone call,\u201d Warren said. When he is ready, Bergdahl will be flown to the San Antonio Military Medical Center in Texas, where he may be able to reunite with his parents. As Bergdahl recovers, details are slowly emerging about the conditions he endured during five years of captivity. Citing an American official, The New York Times reported Sunday that Bergdahl told medical staff that the box he was kept in for weeks at a time was pitch black and like a shark cage. CNN reported Friday that Bergdahl has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape, according to a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified. The official also told CNN that Bergdahl suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse.

            "article_content": "Sen. Rand Paul joked the U.S. should trade five Democrats, not Taliban members, in next prisoner swap The partisan joke comes as Paul is actively trying to court Democratic voters Experts say the potential presidential candidate is just trying to figure out what he can get away with Analysts say the joke wasn't that funny, but they doubt it will have a long-term impact More than any other Republican lawmaker, Sen. Rand Paul has aggressively gone after nontraditional GOP voters in the past year, trying to lure Democrats and independents into his party\u2019s column as he considers a presidential bid. So it seemed odd last week when the libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky made a partisan joke about the prisoner swap that secured U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s release. \u201cMr. President, you love to trade people. Why don\u2019t we set up a trade? But this time, instead of five Taliban, how about five Democrats,\u201d Paul said Friday to cheers at the Texas GOP convention in Fort Worth. The Obama administration released five Guantanamo detainees in exchange for Bergdahl, who had been held captive for five years and was handed over to American forces at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on May 31. To help bring back a U.S. marine currently detained in Mexico, Paul suggested trading \u201cJohn Kerry, Hillary Clinton, (and) Nancy Pelosi.\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t we send them to Mexico?\u201d The audience roared. As would be expected, Paul\u2019s joke ignited a firestorm. His comment made national headlines, and the Democratic National Committee called his remarks \u201ccompletely out of line\u201d and uncivilized. DNC press secretary Michael Czin said the joke showed \u201chow unserious\u201d Paul is on foreign policy and argued he was trying to score cheap shots by riling the base. And as would be expected, conservative blogs and commentators found it funny\u2013even \u201chilarious\u201d\u2013and argued critics had no sense of humor. The following day, Saturday, Paul returned to Kentucky to help open the first state Republican Party office in the urban area of West Louisville, where he reiterated that the GOP has to be a \u201cmore diverse party.\u201d It\u2019s a theme he has taken on the road this past year, visiting areas unfamiliar to Republicans, such as the University of California Berkeley, a liberal hotbed. He has also traveled to inner-city Chicago and Detroit, as well as historically black colleges to help spread the Republican message to Democratic-leaning audiences. Rand Paul: GOP must reconnect with African Americans And just last month, he told a Kentucky radio station that people are looking for a leader in Washington who carries \u201cthe best parts of what Republicans stand for and also some of the good things the Democrats stand for.\u201d So, why make a joke that rips some of the very voters you\u2019re trying to attract? Political experts say Paul is testing out his campaign language before it starts to count in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. \u201cHe\u2019s really trying to figure out what he can and can\u2019t get away with on the stump,\u201d said GOP operative Ford O\u2019Connell. \u201cIf he can\u2019t broaden his appeal in the GOP primary, there is no general election.\u201d Paul is also trying to place daylight between himself and other potential Republican candidates, O\u2019Connell continued, as the GOP still lacks a clear frontrunner for 2016. Known for his non-interventionist views, Paul has to convince Republican donors and voters that he\u2019s strong enough to be commander in chief, O\u2019Connell said. Rand Paul responds to GOP criticism of his foreign policy views His joke was the latest in a string of comments last week expressing frustration with the Obama administration over the Bergdahl swap. On Fox News, Paul said he\u2019s not sure the prisoner exchange would have been a good deal, even \u201cif we were trading for a Medal of Honor winner, much less trading for somebody who may well have been a deserter.\u201d While O\u2019Connell argued the dust-up over Paul\u2019s Taliban joke at the convention will be nothing more than a \u201cblip\u201d in the long run, it was nevertheless \u201cout of character\u201d for the senator. \u201cIf he continues to do that, it\u2019s obvious that he hasn\u2019t figured out how to brand himself distinctly from the others,\u201d he said. David Winston, also a GOP strategist, argued Paul would probably \u201clike to have that one back.\u201d \u201cHere he is trying to do outreach, then he delivers a line like this. Clearly this statement seems to be at odds with the general direction he\u2019s going,\u201d Winston said. \u201cThe remark was just unacceptable.\u201d Paul highlights bigger GOP \u2018tent\u2019 in meeting with top Romney donors Talking to reporters in Texas after his speech, Paul said his comment was simply a joke. \u201cExcept for Nancy Pelosi, I was serious about her,\u201d he added, tongue fully planted in cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s humor, and I hope there\u2019s room for humor,\u201d he continued after being asked about the comment again. \u201cI thought it was funny. It was meant to be humorous.\u201d Winston, however, stressed that Paul would be better off staying on message, not offering \u201csome trite, strange comment.\u201d \u201cI think up to this point in many ways he has engaged voters on a substance level \u2013 that\u2019s why this particular statement was so dissonant,\u201d he said. Others say he was just serving up some red meat in the Lone Star State. Jordan Powell, a Republican consultant in Texas, said Paul\u2019s comment was in tune with the rabble-rousing rhetoric so often heard at state conventions held by either party. \u201cIt was a line designed for partisans, to be responded to by partisans,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThat quote happened in a vacuum to the outside world, but it didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum to those who were there at the convention and listening to other speeches.\u201d Rand Paul criticizes the Clintons, urges GOP to engage minorities Six analysts agreed that Paul\u2019s comment is unlikely to have a long-term effect if he decides to run for president. It\u2019s still early, they say, and almost all candidates make controversial statements along the way. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that this will have an impact on Rand Paul\u2019s political career, one way or another,\u201d said Republican strategist John Feehery, adding the joke wasn\u2019t all that funny. \u201cWhen you are serving red meat to a crowd, sometimes it is served very raw. This was pretty raw.\u201d Sometimes jokes can hurt a person politically if the comments mirror a deep-seated public fear about that individual, said presidential historian Doug Wead. As an example, Wead cited Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2007 joke where the then-presidential candidate parodied a Beach Boys song and called for the bombing of Iran. He also referenced Karl Rove\u2019s 2012 comment in which the GOP strategist joked about murdering then-Rep. Todd Akin, whose disastrous comments about rape ultimately cost him the Senate race in Missouri. But Wead argued Paul\u2019s outreach efforts and his work with Democrats on legislation \u2013 such as measures aimed to limit the National Security Agency\u2019s domestic reach \u2013 will outweigh any partisan jokes like the one he made last week. \u201cIf the debate centers around bipartisanship and who has the most appeal from both sides, then let the debate begin,\u201d Wead said. \u201cRand wins.\u201d \u201cIt is early, and he has to reassure his Republican base before he starts tapping the wide appeal he has among youth and others across the partisan divide,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fact that liberals jumped on this reveals their concern about that appeal.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: State media: Russia's ambassador will attend Poroshenko's inauguration Obama says Putin has a chance to \"get back into a lane of international law\" G7 leaders warn Russia they are ready to impose more sanctions over Ukraine Russia's Putin and Ukraine's new President-elect do not rule out meeting in France U.S. President Barack Obama had stern words for his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, following a meeting Thursday of G7 leaders in Brussels, Belgium, at which Russia was excluded. Putin \u201chas a chance to get back into a lane of international law,\u201d Obama said. But for this to happen, he said, Putin must take steps over the coming weeks that include recognizing Ukraine\u2019s new President-elect Petro Poroshenko, stopping the flow of weapons over the border into Ukraine and ceasing Russian support for pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. \u201cWe cannot simply allow drift,\u201d Obama said, speaking alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron following bilateral talks. \u201cThe mere fact that some of the Russian soldiers have moved back from the border and that Russia is now destabilizing Ukraine through surrogates, rather than overtly and explicitly, does not mean that we can afford three months, or four months, or six months, of continued violence and conflict in eastern Ukraine.\u201d A preview of the G8 minus one Obama vows to stand with Ukraine President Obama defends Bergdahl rescue Obama wants 'good relations with Russia' If Russia does not de-escalate the situation, the G7 leaders are united and ready to impose further painful economic sanctions, Obama said, with consequences for the Russian people. \u201cToday, in contrast to a growing global economy, a sluggish Russian economy is even weaker because of the choices made by Russia\u2019s leadership,\u201d he said. Putin was excluded from what was originally planned as a G8 summit in Sochi, Russia, as part of measures to sanction Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region. It\u2019s the first time in some 20 years that Russia has not been part of the meeting of world economic powers, Obama said, adding that the step is warranted because Moscow\u2019s actions have violated international law and gone against the group\u2019s principles. Energy security Putin may not have been at the table, but the summit\u2019s message was clearly directed at Russia. In a joint statement issued late Wednesday, the G7 leaders pledged their support for the Ukrainian people and government \u201cin the face of unacceptable interference in Ukraine\u2019s sovereign affairs by the Russian Federation.\u201d They also warned Moscow that they are ready to intensify targeted economic sanctions and impose new costs on Russia \u201cshould events so require.\u201d \u201cRussia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea, and actions to de-stabilize eastern Ukraine are unacceptable and must stop,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe urge the Russian Federation to recognize the results of the election, complete the withdrawal of its military forces on the border with Ukraine, stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border and to exercise its influence among armed separatists to lay down their weapons and renounce violence.\u201d The G7 leaders also talked about energy security, amid concern over Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian natural gas and Moscow\u2019s capacity to hold nations hostage to political maneuvering. Obama will next head to Paris, where he will dine with French President Francois Hollande. Putin also will be hosted by the French President on Thursday \u2013 but at a separate dinner. Obama and Putin are among a number of leaders invited to take part in ceremonies in France to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, which helped change the course of World War II. They are likely to cross paths while both are in France, Obama said, but no formal talks have been announced. If they should speak, Obama added, he will give Putin the same message on Ukraine that he has given him in phone calls over past weeks and in his public statements. There may be one touchy subject at Obama\u2019s dinner with Hollande. In his remarks after the G7 meeting, Obama said he had \u201cexpressed concerns about continuing significant defense deals with Russia at a time when they\u2019ve violated basic international law,\u201d a reference to a $1.6 billion French deal to sell warships to Moscow. \u201cPresident Hollande understands my position,\u201d Obama said, adding that he in turn recognizes that this is a big deal for France and that it\u2019s important for jobs. Nonetheless, Obama said, \u201cI think it would\u2019ve been preferable to press the pause button. President Hollande so far has not done so.\u201d Putin: I won\u2019t avoid anyone Although Putin was not invited to the G7 meeting \u2013 which brings together the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Japan \u2013 he will have talks on Ukraine with some G7 leaders while they are all in France. Besides Hollande, they include German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Cameron. The D-Day events, which include a spectacular fireworks show Thursday evening along the Normandy coastline and continue into the weekend, may also bring Putin and Ukraine\u2019s President-elect Petro Poroshenko face to face. Asked in an interview with French television station TF1 if he would speak with Ukraine\u2019s new leader, Putin said he will not \u201cevade\u201d Poroshenko or anyone else. \u201cThere will be other guests, and I\u2019m not going to avoid any of them. I will talk with all of them,\u201d he said, according to the Kremlin\u2019s translation. Poroshenko also did not exclude the possibility, speaking at a news conference Wednesday in Warsaw. \u201cAs things stand now, a meeting between me and Putin is not envisaged, but I do not rule out that it could take place in one format or another. So let\u2019s talk about it when there are grounds for it,\u201d he said. Hollande said that both were invited, although Poroshenko is due to arrive only on Saturday. Putin: No Russian intervention in Ukraine Questioned in the same TF1 interview about Russia\u2019s intentions in Ukraine, Putin denied it had sought to annex or destabilize its neighbor. \u201cWe never did that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Ukrainian government must now sit down and talk with their own people instead of using weapons, tanks, planes and helicopters. They must start the negotiating process.\u201d Kiev and the West have said the separatists in Ukraine are coordinated and supplied by Russia. Asked if it was true that Russia had intervened directly, Putin was again vehement in his denial. \u201cThere are no armed forces, no Russian \u2018instructors\u2019 in southeastern Ukraine. And there never were any,\u201d he said. Putin reiterated his position that Russia respects the Ukrainian people\u2019s vote and that Moscow will work with the authorities in Kiev. He also said Russia recognizes Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, while acknowledging that any move by Kiev to join NATO \u201cworries us.\u201d This concern was a factor in Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, Putin told the French broadcaster, following the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych in what Moscow regards as an illegal coup. Whether Putin and Poroshenko meet personally, Russia will give the new Ukrainian president some official recognition when its ambassador to Ukraine attends Poroshenko\u2019s inauguration Saturday. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Thursday, according to state-run RIA Novosti, that Ambassador Mikhail Zurabov will also resume his duties in Kiev. \u201cHe is returning to Kiev in order to continue executing his functions,\u201d Lukashevich said.

Obama\u2019s meeting in Warsaw, Poland, with Ukrainian President-elect Petro Poroshenko can be seen as a sign of U.S. support for the government in Kiev as it battles to quell a pro-Russian separatist uprising in Ukraine\u2019s East. Ukrainian authorities claimed Wednesday to have inflicted heavy losses on militant forces in the Donetsk region, at the same time as acknowledging that separatists have now seized two military bases in Luhansk. A separatist leader gave conflicting casualty figures. In remarks at a ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of Poland\u2019s return to democracy, Obama also voiced his backing for Ukraine, and said the United States would stand up for freedom across the region. Poland and former Soviet states \u201cwill never stand alone,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThese are not just words. They are unbreakable commitments backed by the strongest alliance in the world and by the armed forces of the United States of America \u2013 the most powerful military in history.\u201d Conflicting accounts in heightened eastern Ukraine fighting He also vowed to stand with Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, in the face of Russian \u201caggression,\u201d including its annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region in March. \u201cUkraine must be free to choose its own future, for itself and by itself,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe will not accept Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea or its violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. Our free nations will stand united so that further Russian provocations will only mean more isolation and costs for Russia.\u201d Separatists blame military for airstrike Walesa: U.S. spread too thin to lead Ukrainians want Poland-like prosperity Obama, who spoke after Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski at the solemn ceremony in the heart of Warsaw, also paid tribute to the Poles whose struggle for democracy lit a spark for revolutionary change. The 1989 election commemorated Wednesday \u201cwas the beginning of the end of communism \u2013 in this country and across Europe,\u201d he said. \u2018Deeply impressed\u2019 Addressing reporters earlier alongside Poroshenko, Obama said he was \u201cdeeply impressed\u201d by the newly elected leader\u2019s vision of what is required to help Ukraine grow. \u201cThe challenge now for the international community is to make sure that we are supportive of Petro\u2019s efforts, and the United States has already stepped up in a number of ways,\u201d he said. Obama said the pair had discussed additional steps the United States can take to help Ukraine through its transition process, including helping to train Ukrainian law enforcement officers and providing more nonlethal aid to its military. Deadly attack on pro-Russian separatists He also spoke of the need for Ukraine to undertake economic reforms, including steps to reduce its dependence on natural gas supplies from Russia, currently used by Moscow as a means of leverage. Poroshenko, a business magnate seen as pro-European, is due to be sworn in Saturday. He thanked the United States for its support and said the Ukrainian people had shown their solidarity in rejecting Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. G7 diplomacy The U.S. President then flew to Brussels, Belgium \u2013 the second stop of his three-nation tour \u2013 for a meeting of the G7 group of industrialized nations. A preview of the G8 minus one Poland praises U.S. on Ukraine Donetsk Gov.: Must stabilize situation Militants' plea to Russia goes unanswered Obama led the international effort to suspend Russia\u2019s participation in the world group of economic powers. That suspension resulted in the relocation of this year\u2019s planned G8 summit from Sochi, Russia, to Brussels, as the leaders of the G7 nations decided to meet without Russia. Obama suggested Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin could regain the trust \u201cshattered\u201d by Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine, but only if Moscow plays by the rules and stops destabilizing Ukraine. Putin \u201chas a choice to make\u201d on Ukraine, Obama said, calling on the Russian President to continue to pull back troops from the border with Ukraine, persuade pro-Russian separatists to stand down and back Ukraine\u2019s recent presidential election. Obama and Putin are likely to cross paths while both are in France at the end of the week for events to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, but no formal talks have been announced. Putin told French television station TF1 that he will not \u201cevade\u201d Poroshenko or anyone else. \u201cThere will be other guests, and I\u2019m not going to avoid any of them. I will talk with all of them,\u201d he said, according to the Kremlin\u2019s translation. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet Putin on the sidelines of the D-Day events Friday for discussions on Ukraine, the German government said. British Prime Minister David Cameron will meet the Russian leader on Thursday night, Downing Street said, adding that their talks will focus on steps Russia can take to de-escalate the crisis. Obama urges Putin to make choice over Ukraine NATO defense ministers meet Amid the heightened East-West tensions, NATO defense ministers met Wednesday in Brussels. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said before meeting it was a timely opportunity \u201cto discuss our shared concerns over Russia\u2019s illegal aggression against Ukraine.\u201d The alliance has come to the fore in recent weeks as former Soviet states which are now NATO members seek reassurance amid heightened concerns following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. Obama on Tuesday announced that he would ask the U.S. Congress for a fund of up to $1 billion to allow for a \u201cEuropean Reassurance Initiative\u201d to bolster the security of NATO allies. This would help the United States undertake increased training exercises, explore the prepositioning of military equipment, and build the capacity of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine to partner with the United States and NATO. More U.S. Air Force and Army personnel will be rotated through allied countries in central and eastern Europe, Obama said. Recent moves by Russia to withdraw some of its forces from its border with Ukraine have the potential to ease tensions between Moscow and Washington. But administration officials caution a new detente is a long way off. Russia: 'The problem is inside Ukraine' Ukraine to Russia: Stop feeding terrorism Obama tours Europe Kiev and the West have said the separatists in Ukraine are coordinated and supplied by Russia, a claim that Moscow denies. Separatists seize Ukraine military bases The volatile situation in eastern Ukraine appears to have taken a turn for the worse this week. The Ukrainian government claimed Wednesday that more than 300 pro-Russian militants have been killed and at least 500 wounded in ongoing Ukrainian military operations in the towns of Chervoniy Liman and Slovyansk. CNN could not immediately confirm the report. However, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, self-declared mayor of Slovyansk, told CNN that during Tuesday\u2019s attack by Ukrainian jets and helicopters, 10 separatist militants had died and 12 were injured. He added in the past three days, three civilians, including a woman, had died in the violence. The authorities also said that separatist fighters had taken over two military bases in Luhansk \u2013 one run by the Border Guard and the other by the National Guard. The Ukrainian Border Guard base on the outskirts of Luhansk city has been evacuated and taken over by pro-Russia separatists, according to the Border Guard website. Ukrainian official: Five militants killed in attack on border guard base in Luhansk The border guard detachment at the compound, which was badly damaged during 12 hours of clashes Monday, has been relocated to safe place, the Border Guard Service said. The Ukrainian National Guard said Wednesday it had lost control of its base after an attack by \u201cterrorists\u201d that began late Tuesday. Video appeared to show its detachment surrendering to separatists early Wednesday. The National Guard said its troops at the base had been relocated to \u201ca safe place.\u201d Three of its men were injured, while six of the attackers were killed, it said. CNN cannot independently confirm the number of casualties. Civilians killed The loss of the military bases follows a deadly attack Monday on a regional headquarters building in Luhansk that had been taken over by separatists calling themselves the People\u2019s Republic of Luhansk. Five women and three men, all of them civilians, were killed in the attack, which Kiev blamed on separatists. A munitions expert who accompanied a CNN crew to the scene, however, said the damage to the building was indicative of an airstrike. Ukraine\u2019s President-elect vows vengeance over helicopter attack The Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe came to a similar conclusion. It\u2019s thought to be the first time that civilians have been killed or injured in an attack by the Ukrainian air force since pro-Russian groups began occupying buildings in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions more than two months ago. The U.N. children\u2019s agency, UNICEF, raised concern Tuesday over the plight of children caught up in the violence and urged all groups involved to protect children. Seven children, the youngest age 4, have sustained gunshot and shrapnel injuries in eastern Ukraine since May 9, the agency said, while others in Donetsk have been exposed to violence and terrifying events.

            "article_content": "Thomas Carey had no chance of winning the GOP Senate primary But he believes the small support he got prevented a clear winner Sen. Thad Cochran and challenger Chris McDaniel will meet on June 24 The top two contenders in Mississippi\u2019s too-close-to-call GOP Senate primary are headed for a runoff, and a businessman who finished a distant third in the balloting believes he played the spoiler. Thomas Carey, a realtor from the town of Hernando \u2013 which is not far from the Tennessee border \u2013 captured less than 2 percent of the vote on Tuesday, according to the latest count. It\u2019s not clear if the unheralded Carey actually took enough votes away from either Sen. Thad Cochran or state Sen. Chris McDaniel to delay the outcome. But it\u2019s possible Carey supporters may have been the reason there was no clear-cut winner. He certainly thinks so. \u201cI was really shocked \u2026 that my votes would keep either Senator Cochran or (McDaniel) from winning,\u201d Carey said Wednesday in an interview with CNN. \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect it to be so close.\u201d Cochran and McDaniel failed to reach the necessary 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff election, according to figures compiled by the Associated Press. Fewer than 2,000 votes separated the two and Carey received 4,800. Carey said he knows who he\u2019ll vote for in three weeks, but won\u2019t endorse either candidate publicly. But he did heartily endorse term limits for congressmen and senators. Cochran, who is 76, has held onto his Senate seat since first being elected in 1978. Carey participated in the hotly contested race without raising any money and spent less than $2,000 from his own pocket, he said. Instead, the former telephone installer touted his candidacy as a \u201cfaith-based campaign.\u201d Voters will now head to the polls again June 24, prolonging a race defined by negative attack ads and a scandal involving Cochran\u2019s ailing wife. New ads in nasty Mississippi GOP primary battle Carey urged the rivals to stop the \u201cbackbiting\u201d and focus on offering solutions to fix the economy during the likely three-week runoff campaign. He also hopes both men will fight to repeal Obamacare. \u201cThey need to take those 2,500 pages and put them in the outhouse and put it to good use,\u201d Carey said. McDaniel, who is backed by the tea party, represents the group\u2019s best chance at unseating a member of the Republican establishment after failing to unseat the majority of incumbents challenged in primary races this season. As for Carey? He\u2019ll be back, he said, potentially in 2016 to challenge his own congressman, GOP Rep. Alan Nunnelee. \u201cI just believe we need a different voice in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce people get to Washington, they get brainwashed.\u201d Special coverage: 2014 midterms",

            "article_content": "NEW: Democratic Sen. Feinstein says Congress should have been told President Obama defends the swap of terror suspects for Sgt. Bergdahl White House: protecting U.S. citizens and soldiers is a special circumstance GOP critics say Obama violated a law requiring 30 days' notice for Congress Listening to the White House, it sounds like an adventure movie \u2013 the secret swapping of detained terror suspects for an ailing American soldier captured in Afghanistan. To Congress, it sounds like the same old same old \u2013 the White House ignoring an obligation to let legislators know about the deal ahead of time. In the aftermath of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s weekend release in exchange for five Taliban figures held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, some in Congress allege President Barack Obama broke the law by failing to inform them about the move 30 days in advance \u2013 as called for under the National Defense Authorization Act. \u201cThe law says they are to give us 30 days\u2019 notice. If the President thought that was unconstitutional or an invalid law, than he shouldn\u2019t have signed the bill,\u201d said Georgia\u2019s Saxby Chambliss, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \u201cHe knew very well that he was required by law to give us 30 days\u2019 notice and he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Obama told reporters in Poland on Tuesday that the circumstances required an immediate decision within his authority as commander in chief. W.H.: Bergdahl release 'the right thing' Legal expert: Obama clearly broke the law \u201cWe saw an opportunity\u201d \u201cWe have consulted with Congress for quite some time about the possibility we may have to execute a prisoner exchange,\u201d Obama said of past talks involving Bergdahl. \u201cWe saw an opportunity and we were concerned about his health and had cooperation from the Qataris and we seized that. It was truncated to make sure we didn\u2019t miss that opportunity.\u201d The issue touches on flashpoints old and new between the administration and its critics, especially conservative Republicans seeking to depict Obama as a weak leader driven by political concerns for his legacy. Foremost is whether the Obama administration actually broke the law by not telling Congress beforehand about the weekend exchange in which Bergdahl got handed over to U.S. military commandos near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border while the five alleged senior terrorism figures were flown to Qatar. Under the National Defense Authorization Act signed into law by Obama late last year, the administration gained some added flexibility in transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay, but was required to notify Congress 30 days in advance. However, legislators had no power to block such a transfer. Writing about the law last year, Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institution said it put the administration \u201cin a position to move detainees out of Guantanamo as long as it is willing to be politically accountable for the problems they create and as long as they don\u2019t bring them to the United States.\u201d \u201cIt was lawful,\u201d White House says That is exactly what happened, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden argued Tuesday in a statement. \u201cGiven the credible reports regarding the risk of grave harm to Sergeant Bergdahl and the rapidly unfolding events surrounding his recovery, it was lawful for the administration to proceed with the transfer notwithstanding the notice requirement\u201d in the NDAA, Hayden said in a statement. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin disagreed, saying Obama \u201cclearly broke the law\u201d even if he can provide a legal justification for what he did. The bottom line, to Toobin, was that the law calls for 30 days\u2019 notice and Obama didn\u2019t do it. Under the law, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel can authorize such a transfer if he \u201cdetermines that actions have or will be taken that substantially mitigate the risk that the individual will engage in activity that threatens the United States or U.S. persons or interests,\u201d or if the transfer \u201cis in the national security interest of the United States,\u201d Hayden said. In Poland, Obama noted Tuesday that Qatar provided assurances it would monitor the activities of the five Guantanamo detainees, described as senior terrorist figures. Under the terms of the exchange, the five released Taliban figures can\u2019t leave Qatar for a year. \u201cWe will be keeping eyes on them,\u201d Obama said, noting the possibility existed the freed detainees would continue with terrorist activities but adding \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security.\u201d Even more, he contended, the move adhered to a bedrock U.S. value of protecting its own. \u201cRegardless of the circumstances, whatever those circumstances may turn out to be, we still get an American soldier back if he\u2019s held in captivity. Period. Full stop,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe don\u2019t condition that, and that\u2019s what every mom and dad who sees a son or daughter sent over to a war theater should expect from not just their commander in chief but the United States of America.\u201d On the 30-day notification period for Congress, Hayden said the Obama administration determined that such a wait could scuttle the swap and perhaps cost Bergdahl his life. Conflicting responsibilities She provided a legal explanation, saying the Constitution requires Obama as President and commander in chief to protect the lives of Americans abroad and protect U.S. soldiers, responsibilities that in this case conflicted with the 30-day notification period for Congress. \u201cWe believe it is fair to conclude that Congress did not intend that the administration would be barred from taking the action it did in these circumstances,\u201d she wrote. Hayden also noted that in signing the NDAA, Obama said the law \u201cin certain circumstances would violate constitutional separation of powers principles.\u201d \u201cThe executive branch must have the flexibility, among other things, to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers,\u201d Hayden quoted from Obama\u2019s signing statement. Toobin said the signing statement amounts to the President\u2019s opinion \u201cof what the law should mean,\u201d rather than a legal ruling. \u201cThis is an example of a signing statement where the President is taking power for himself that the law didn\u2019t give him,\u201d Toobin said. \u201cThat may be constitutional, but it is still a violation of what the law says.\u201d To Congress, the exchange irritated an already raw nerve over the never-ending power struggle between the White House and legislators, who accuse every administration of trying to run roughshod over congressional authority. Even an Obama ally like Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California told CNN that as the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, she should have received some advance notice of the swap involving Guantanamo detainees. On Tuesday, Feinstein told reporters that the White House deputy national security adviser, Tony Blinken, called her to apologize for the lack of advance notice. However, it was unclear from Feinstein\u2019s comments if Blinken referred to a courtesy call or the 30-day notification under the law. Meanwhile, both Feinstein and House Speaker John Boehner said the White House encountered opposition from top Democrats and Republicans on congressional intelligence committees when it previously discussed the possibility of exchanging Bergdahl for Guantanamo detainees as far back as 2011. \u201cGiven the past briefings and concerns we had addressed \u2013 and these were from both committees and the leadership of both committees; the concerns were bipartisan \u2013 and I strongly believe that we should have been consulted, that the law should have been followed and I very much regret that that was not the case,\u201d Feinstein said. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, also argued that the past discussions meant legislators expected the Obama administration to brief them again before any exchange took place, adding: \u201cThe only reason it did not is because the administration knew it faced serious and sober bipartisan concern and opposition.\u201d However, another veteran Democrat said the administration took all the proper steps under the circumstances. \u201cWe received a detailed classified notification from the Secretary of Defense that satisfies the many substantive certification requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act,\u201d said a statement by Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. Noting that Obama \u201cput Congress on notice\u201d last December that he intended to act quickly in such cases, \u201cmembers of Congress should not be surprised that he acted as he did in the circumstances that existed.\u201d GOP attack strategy Republicans piled on as part of their strategy to tarnish both the Obama and Democratic brands ahead of November\u2019s congressional elections and the 2016 presidential vote. Some GOP committee chairmen in the House already plan for hearings on the legality of the swap, a move backed by Boehner. Chambliss, who is retiring when his current term expires at the end of the year, challenged the administration\u2019s explanation that Berhdahl\u2019s ill health necessitated moving swiftly to complete the weekend exchange. \u201cThere is no indication of that other than what this President said and I don\u2019t believe a thing this President says now,\u201d he said. Veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona took broader aim on Tuesday, telling Fox News that the Bergdahl swap was part of what he called a misguided policy to get all American troops out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016 \u2013 a timetable Obama announced last week. \u201cThe president may be ending the war in Afghanistan, but the Taliban and al Qaeda are not ending the war in Afghanistan,\u201d said McCain, a constant critic of any effort by Obama to limit U.S. military presence abroad. Obama, who defeated McCain in the 2008 presidential election, \u201cis carrying out a foreign policy of unreliability and weakness\u201d that will cost the nation \u201cfor years to come,\u201d said the senator, himself a former prisoner of war. Toobin said he expected the controversy to remain in the political arena, noting that the courts rarely if ever get involved in power squabble between the executive and legislative branches. \u201cThis just shows that members of Congress, even Democrats, are very jealous of institutional power,\u201d he said, \u201cand that Congress doesn\u2019t want to be treated like a doormat, even by a President of the same party.\u201d Obama defends prisoner exchange for Bergdahl Fellow soldiers call Bowe Bergdahl a deserter, not a hero CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett, Jim Acosta and Laura Bernardini contributed to this report.",

Bowe Bergdahl President Barack Obama wants Vladimir Putin to take steps to rebuild the trust shattered by Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine. Obama\u2019s comment came as he visited Poland on Tuesday, the first stop on his three-country European trip which is intended, in part, to reassure allies in Eastern Europe unnerved by Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region. Putin \u201chas a choice to make\u201d on Ukraine, Obama said during a news conference in Warsaw, calling on the Russian President to continue to pull back troops from the border with Ukraine, persuade           pro-Russian separatists to stand down and back Ukraine\u2019s recent presidential election. If the United States sees \u201cresponsible behavior\u201d from Russia, Obama said, \u201cI think it is possible for us to try to rebuild some of the trust that has been shattered.\u201d But he warned that it will take \u201cquite some time.\u201d Obama defends Bowe Bergdahl swap Obama in Europe: a lukewarm reception? Ukraine talk trumps Obama's Pope visit Kiev and the West have said the separatists in Ukraine are coordinated and supplied by Russia, a claim that Moscow denies. Obama\u2019s visit comes a day after a deadly attack on a regional headquarters building in Donetsk that has been taken over by separatists calling themselves the People\u2019s Republic of Luhansk. Five women and three men, all of them civilians, were killed in the attack, which Kiev has blamed on separatists. A munitions expert who accompanied a CNN crew to the scene, however, said the damage to the building was indicative of an airstrike. Social media video shows an aircraft overhead after the attacks, trees are splintered as if they were hit from above and craters in a nearby square leading to the building appear to have been the result of heavy cannon fire from the air. A meeting in France? Obama, speaking alongside Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, said he had always had a \u201cbusiness-like relationship\u201d with Putin and that he had conveyed the same messages to him in private conversations as were made in public. He said Washington wanted good relations, but added that sanctions imposed over Russia\u2019s Crimea excursion would be maintained and that more have been drawn up in case of further destabilization in the east. Obama added that he was \u201csure\u201d he would cross paths with Putin while both are in France at the end of the week for events to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Obama said he was looking forward to meeting with Ukraine\u2019s President-elect Petro Poroshenko on Wednesday, adding that his election last month \u201cgives us some momentum to build on as we move forward.\u201d He also stressed the need for Ukraine to pursue economic as well as political reform, including taking steps to reduce its reliance on natural gas from Russia. At the same news conference, Obama announced that he is asking Congress for a fund of up to $1 billion to allow for a \u201cEuropean Reassurance Initiative\u201d to bolster the security of NATO allies. This would help the United States undertake increased training exercises, explore the pre-positioning of military equipment, and build the capacity of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine to partner with the United States and NATO. More U.S. Air Force and Army personnel will be rotated through allied countries in central and eastern Europe, Obama said. He urged all NATO nations to live up to their commitment to the alliance when member states are threatened, and commended Poland for its contribution. Obama wants 'good relations with Russia' Why Poland is disenchanted with the U.S. Emotional homecoming for Bergdahl family Bergdahl questions As he undertakes his third overseas trip in less than three months, Obama finds himself once again peppered with questions about his foreign policy, even as he attempts to cement his own legacy on the world stage. His latest trip comes as Republicans have unleashed a new line of attack questioning his judgment in exchanging five Taliban prisoners held at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for the return of a former prisoner of war, Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Obama defended the decision, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t leave men and women in uniform behind.\u201d His administration had previously consulted with Congress on the possibility of a prisoner exchange for Bergdahl, Obama said, but said it had to move quickly because of concerns over Bergdahl\u2019s health and to not miss a window of opportunity. He said he was confident the exchange of Taliban prisoners for Bergdahl would not endanger U.S. national security because the Qataris, who helped broker the deal, would be keeping a close eye on the ex-Guantanamo detainees. Walesa: Superpower not \u2018up to the job\u2019 For Obama, the itinerary of foreign travel has changed, but the conversation will sound familiar. During his last two foreign trips, he fielded questions about his approach to the crises in Ukraine and Syria, as well as the territorial disputes in Asia between China and its neighbors. In Manila, Obama responded that his second-term strategy is to avoid \u201cerrors.\u201d But away from the cameras, he has simplified his doctrine as \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid stuff,\u201d administration officials say privately. However, Obama\u2019s critics, both at home and abroad, contend that approach is at best uninspiring, and potentially dangerous. Lech Walesa, the former Polish President whose democratic Solidarity movement helped usher in freedom in Poland during the fall of the Soviet Union, has warned that U.S. influence has declined under Obama\u2019s watch. \u201cThe superpower has not been up to the job,\u201d Walesa said in a recent interview with the TVN24 television network. \u201cTherefore, the world is at a dangerous point and maybe it really is the case that lots of bad things are happening in the world because there is no leadership,\u201d added Walesa, who endorsed Obama\u2019s rival, Mitt Romney, in the 2012 presidential election. Obama has billed his recent decisions against any form of military action in Syria and Ukraine as successes because they rallied multilateral responses to global challenges, without messy prolonged commitments for U.S. armed forces. Obama, Putin cross paths In France, Obama will have several opportunities to cross paths with Putin. They are both scheduled to dine with French President Francois Hollande on Thursday in Paris, though in separate meetings. The German government\u2019s press office confirmed Tuesday that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will speak with Putin on Friday in Normandy, when the two will discuss the situation in Ukraine. The talks on the sidelines of the D-Day commemorations will continue a telephone conversation the two leaders held Tuesday and focus on measures to aid the stabilization of Ukraine, it said. Obama led the international effort to suspend Russia\u2019s participation in the world group of economic powers. That suspension resulted in the relocation of this year\u2019s G7 summit from Sochi, Russia, to Brussels, which will occur during Obama\u2019s trip.

            "article_content": "NEW: Sen. McCain says Obama has failed to properly exert America's might President Obama presents a broad vision designed in part to rebuff critics Obama has come under criticism for what opponents say is a passive approach He argues global leadership requires military might, alliances and diplomatic tools President Barack Obama on Wednesday outlined a foreign policy vision of \u201cmight doing right,\u201d arguing that modern pragmatism requires both a strong military and the diplomatic tools of alliances and sanctions to exert influence and provide global leadership. He told graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point that after the nation\u2019s \u201clong season of war and divisions about how to move forward,\u201d they now would represent America with the duty \u201cnot only to protect our country, but to do what is right and just.\u201d Under fire from the political right for what critics call diminishing U.S. global influence, Obama offered a robust defense of his foreign policy as the pragmatic and most effective expression of America\u2019s leadership role in the world. \u201cI believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being,\u201d he said, referring to a tenet of conservative ideology. Obama plays defense on foreign policy Obama: Military force used if necessary Obama outlines foreign policy vision \u201cBut what makes us exceptional is not flouting international norms and the rule of law; it\u2019s our willingness to affirm them through our actions,\u201d Obama said in arguing that true leadership involves not only having the world\u2019s most powerful military, but in doing the right thing. \u201cAmerica must always lead on the world stage,\u201d Obama said, and the military \u201calways will be the backbone of that leadership,\u201d but U.S. military action \u201ccannot be the only \u2013 or even primary \u2013 component of our leadership in every instance.\u201d In a direct jab at his detractors, the President said those \u201cwho suggest that America is in decline, or has seen its global leadership slip away, are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics.\u201d One of the most strident critics, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, responded Wednesday by telling CNN that America remained mighty but Obama has failed to follow through on threats such as his \u201cred line\u201d for U.S. military strikes if the Syrian government used chemical weapons. \u201cWe are unreliable, and all our allies and our enemies believe that,\u201d said McCain, who lost to Obama in the 2008 presidential election. To George Mitchell, the former Senate leader who served as Obama\u2019s Middle East peace envoy, the President \u201cmade a persuasive case to the reality that we cannot intervene militarily everywhere.\u201d However, Mitchell said the United States should have done more to help the Syrian opposition without sending U.S. troops. Read the President\u2019s speech In a sign of the sentiments of the cadets and those attending their commencement ceremony, Obama got big applause when he noted they were the first West Point graduates in more than a decade unlikely to be stationed in a war zone. Since he took office, Obama noted, America had ended the Iraq war and was preparing to end the Afghanistan conflict, decimated al Qaeda\u2019s leadership in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and eliminated Osama bin Laden. Now it was time to shift foreign policy to combat a continuing terrorist threat that \u201cno longer comes from a centralized al Qaeda leadership,\u201d but from \u201cdecentralized al Qaeda affiliates and extremists, with agendas focused in the countries where they operate.\u201d \u201cThis lessens the possibility of large-scale 9/11-style attacks against the homeland, but heightens the danger of U.S. personnel overseas being attacked, as we saw in Benghazi,\u201d Obama said in reference to the 2012 assault that killed four Americans at a U.S. compound in Libya. \u201cIt heightens the danger to less defensible targets, as we saw in a shopping mall in Nairobi,\u201d he said of the attack last year in Kenya. \u201cSo we have to develop a strategy that matches this diffuse threat; one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch our military thin, or stir up local resentments.\u201d Obama also spoke of his personal burden as a wartime leader, saying he was \u201chaunted\u201d by the dead and wounded among troops he ordered to Afghanistan. \u201cI would betray my duty to you, and to the country we love, if I sent you into harm\u2019s way simply because I saw a problem somewhere in the world that needed to be fixed, or because I was worried about critics who think military intervention is the only way for America to avoid looking weak,\u201d he told the graduating cadets. Returning to a theme he\u2019s visited throughout his presidency, Obama said he would continue to push for closing the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay \u201cbecause American values and legal traditions don\u2019t permit the indefinite detention of people beyond our borders.\u201d Overall, Obama said, \u201cAmerica has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world,\u201d and he contended that \u201cthose who argue otherwise \u2013 who suggest that America is in decline, or has seen its global leadership slip away \u2013 are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics.\u201d \u201cThe question we face \u2013 the question each of you will face \u2013 is not whether America will lead, but how we will lead, not just to secure our peace and prosperity, but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe,\u201d Obama told the cadets. The President\u2019s speech came a day after he spelled out a plan that would leave nearly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan at year\u2019s end but essentially end the broader U.S. military commitment there by the end of 2016. \u201cWe can not only responsibly end our war in Afghanistan and achieve the objectives that took us to war in the first place, we\u2019ll also be able to begin a new chapter in the story of American leadership around the world,\u201d Obama said in the White House Rose Garden on Tuesday. Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai welcomed Obama\u2019s announcement of planned troop levels, saying in a statement posted Wednesday on his official website that his government was \u201cgrateful to the international community for its assistance and remains confident\u201d in the ability of the expanded and NATO-trained Afghan forces to protect the country and its people. 5 foreign policy headaches for Obama Although Obama enjoyed high-profile foreign-policy successes at the beginning of his time in office, including the military mission to find and kill bin Laden, he\u2019s come under harsh criticism recently for what opponents say is a passive approach abroad. They cite his record in Syria, where he backed away from airstrikes after President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime was reported to have used chemical weapons on citizens. Congress balked at approving the military force, leaving Obama to instead negotiate a deal that would remove the chemical stockpiles from al-Assad\u2019s control but keep al-Assad himself in power amid an ongoing civil war. While the administration has provided non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition, it has stopped short of supplying weapons and ammunition called for by McCain and other critics. America's global responsibility? 9,800 troops to stay in Afghanistan in 2015 In his speech, Obama said there was no military solution to the Syrian civil war, and added that he will \u201cwork with Congress to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and a brutal dictator.\u201d National Security Adviser Susan Rice told CNN that sending weapons and ammunition to Syrian opposition groups would need \u201cthe authority and blessing of Congress.\u201d Earlier, Secretary of State John Kerry defended U.S. policy for Syria, including the deal struck to get chemical weapons out of the country. Speaking to CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d he said he found it difficult to believe that critics would have preferred a military strike and hurting the al-Assad regime temporarily. He said that 92% of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons have been removed, and the other 8% are under control, waiting to be removed. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to me that people simply want to refuse to accept that we\u2019re better off getting all of the weapons out than striking for one or two days and doing damage to some of them,\u201d Kerry said. McCain argued that the result of the administration\u2019s response meant that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad consolidated his grip on power, Hezbollah fighters and Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard were helping him out, Russia was increasing support for his regime and the war has become \u201ca  regional conflict and a tragedy of monumental proportions for which we will pay a heavy price in years to come.\u201d Critics of Obama\u2019s foreign policy also have said the President\u2019s clear assertion that military force is off the table in Ukraine sends the wrong message to other countries \u2013 namely China \u2013 that have their own territorial disputes with neighbor states. The United States and its allies have imposed economic sanctions on Russia for its incursion into Ukraine, though that step hasn\u2019t done much to quiet the arguments coming from Obama\u2019s detractors. On Wednesday, Obama reiterated his policy that the United States will used military force, \u201cunilaterally if necessary,\u201d when its people are threatened, its livelihood is at stake or allies are in danger, but he said the threshold was higher when global issues \u201cdo not pose a direct threat\u201d to the nation. \u201cIn such circumstances, we should not go it alone,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we must mobilize allies and partners to take collective action. We have to broaden our tools to include diplomacy and development; sanctions, isolation; appeals to international law and \u2013 if just, necessary, and effective \u2013 multilateral military action.\u201d Such a collective approach \u201cis more likely to succeed, more likely to be sustained, and less likely to lead to costly mistakes,\u201d Obama said. Obama last spoke broadly about his foreign policy during a trip to Asia in April, defending himself against those who say his policy lacks a discernible direction. \u201cYou hit singles; you hit doubles; every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run,\u201d Obama said in Manila, lashing out at those who argue for greater use of military force in conflicts abroad. \u201cWhy is it that everyone is so eager to use military force?\u201d he asked then. \u201cAfter we have just gone through a decade of war at enormous costs to our troops and our budget. And what is it exactly that these critics would have accomplished?\u201d According to aides, Obama\u2019s West Point speech kicks off a broader foreign policy push that will carry into his upcoming trip to Europe that includes a G7 summit in Brussels and a visit to Poland, designed to reassure Eastern European allies after Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine.

            "article_content": "Obama delivers the commencement address Wednesday at West Point His focus will be foreign policy There are global challenges likely to dominate the remainder of his term Among them: Russia, Syria, Iran, the terror threat and Asia President Barack Obama will defend his foreign policy Wednesday in a commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and lay out an interventionist, but not over-reaching plan, White House officials say. The speech comes amid stinging criticism of the President\u2019s foreign policy following a trip to Asia last month. Obama, who has carefully avoided mentioning any sort of military confrontation in his responses to the challenges in Syria and Ukraine, hit back at his critics, saying his goal is to avoid costly \u201cerrors\u201d on the world stage. But the world waits for no man. Obama may advocate a risk-averse foreign policy, but he has a series of pressing global challenges which are likely to dominate the remainder of his term. Here are a few: Russia Plan for troops in Afghanistan revealed Rep. King: Obama is making a mistake America's global responsibility? The political crisis in Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea have led to tensions between the United States and Russia that are reminiscent of the Cold War. Those tensions quickly have become the Obama administration\u2019s central foreign policy crisis and have tested Washington\u2019s mettle and its alliance with Europe. The United States and its allies have accused Moscow of backing militant separatists and fomenting ethnic skirmishes in eastern Ukraine, and while praising Ukraine\u2019s elections this weekend, have charged Russia with attempting to disrupt the vote.  Russia has been kicked out of the G8 group of industrialized countries, and the United States and the European Union have slapped a series of sanctions on Russian officials and entities. But a military response has been all but ruled out and there seems to be little if any taste on either side of the Atlantic for the kind of sectoral sanctions which would deter Putin. The United States says Russia is feeling the economic heat from the sanctions, but this month in Shanghai, Putin signed a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping to provide China with $400 billion worth of natural gas from Siberia over the next 30 years. Moreover, Russia has proven it can impose costs of its own. Although Washington and Moscow teamed up on a deal to rid Syria of its chemical weapons, Russia\u2019s political and military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its pledge to provide weapons to governments across the Mideast continue to frustrate the United States. With a veto-wielding permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, Russia is able to block action on world crises. The U.S. needs to work with Russia on a nuclear deal with Iran and on curbing North Korea\u2019s own nuclear ambitions. In today\u2019s world, a new Cold War simply seems impractical. Syria Three years into Syria\u2019s bloody civil war, the opposition remains weak and fragmented, extremists continue to grow in numbers and influence and al-Assad remains firmly in power. A year-long effort to bring the opposition and the regime to the table for peace talks was a failure, and a political negotiation seems further away than ever while the humanitarian catastrophe continues to grow. Despite the U.S.-Russia agreement to remove Syria\u2019s chemical weapons, the regime is believed to have launched chlorine attacks which are now being investigated by U.N. inspectors. The administration talks of needing to change al-Assad\u2019s \u201ccalculus,\u201d but Obama has resisted pressure from many of his top advisers to involve the United States deeper in the conflict. Without a decisive change in the balance of power on the military field, it seems unlikely al-Assad will feel compelled to make a deal. Iran World powers are just under two months away from a July 20 deadline for a comprehensive deal with Iran on its nuclear program. An interim pact reached with Tehran in November eased some economic sanctions in return for Iran rolling back parts of its nuclear program, which the United States and others believe is designed to produce a weapon. Iran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful. U.S. negotiators say progress has been made in several rounds of negotiations and the so-called P5+1 \u2013 the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany \u2013 and Iran have begun to draft an agreement. But a number of significant roadblocks remain, including the future of Iran\u2019s heavy water reactor in Arak, its underground facility at Fordo and whether Iran will maintain the right to enrich a small amount of low-grade uranium on its own soil for medical and research purposes. Iran has said those are all sticking points, but Israel and the United States aren\u2019t likely to budge on them. A recent U.N. report also warned that Iran continues to pursue ballistic missile capability and Tehran appears unwilling to discuss its missile technology as part of the nuclear negotiations, to the great frustration of the U.S. and its European allies. New concerns have also surfaced over reports that Russia and Iran are discussing an oil-for-goods deal, which could violate the terms of the interim agreement, circumvent sanctions and derail the fate of the talks. Terror threat The United States got Osama bin Laden and diminished the capacity of al Qaeda\u2019s senior leadership in Pakistan, but a recent State Department report said the terror group\u2019s affiliate organizations have gotten even deadlier. And a series of al Qaeda-based threats to attack American and Western targets in Europe is causing major concern inside the U.S. intelligence community. The State Department report said the group\u2019s affiliate in Yemen \u2013 al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula \u2013 is among the most lethal of the network and \u201ccontinues to pose the most significant threat to the United States,\u201d which shut down its Embassy in Yemen due to the threats. The civil war in Syria has created conditions allowing parts of the country to become a new haven for al Qaeda-linked groups and thousands of foreign fighters \u2013 a situation that U.S. officials warn could come back to threaten the U.S. homeland. Next door in Iraq, a weak security environment in the western section of the country, along with the destabilizing effects of the situation in Syria, have allowed a former al Qaeda affiliate, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, to move across the border with ease to conduct its own attacks. Terrorist groups across North and West Africa are posing an ever-greater threat \u2013 from Mali and Libya, where al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other extremists groups are growing in strength \u2013 to Kenya, where militants from al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group in Somalia, are blamed for an increasing number of attacks. The recent kidnapping of hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls by Boko Haram has suddenly raised the profile of this al Qaeda-linked group. While al Qaeda\u2019s affiliates are grabbing the headlines, the body\u2019s core group in Pakistan may be making a comeback. Officials tell CNN\u2019s Barbara Starr the core is seeking to place operatives to attack U.S. targets at home and abroad. Asia The more pressing crises in Ukraine and Syria have prevented the Obama administration from focusing on the long anticipated \u201cpivot to Asia,\u201d billed as an effort to cement American presence in the region and counter China\u2019s rise. However, the region is experiencing significant chaos, and managing China has proven a formidable challenge. Tensions continue to escalate between Japan and China over a set of deserted islands in the East China Sea. Beijing is also stepping up its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and this week a Chinese vessel rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing boat after a series of anti-Chinese riots that left four Chinese workers dead and more than 100 injured. The two closest U.S. allies in the region \u2013 Japan and South Korea \u2013 are feuding over what Seoul perceives as inadequate remorse from its brutal colonization and the use of Korean \u201ccomfort women\u201d during World War II. Elsewhere in the region, Thailand\u2019s military seized power in a bloodless coup. And Washington\u2019s ambitions at increasing trade in the region appear stalled. Obama traveled to Japan last month to forge a deal with Japan to move ahead with the 12-nation free-trade Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) but left Tokyo empty-handed. The turmoil is distracting from the region\u2019s most dangerous threat \u2013 unpredictable North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his nuclear arsenal. Kim\u2019s erratic behavior and threats of a fourth nuclear test have prompted the United States and Korea to shelve the scheduled transfer of wartime operational control of troops on the Korean peninsula from Washington to Seoul. And more \u2026 Plenty of other challenges remain: from managing relations with Egypt after the near-certain election of former defense minister Abdel Fattah al-Sissi \u2013 whose interim government has been accused of widespread human rights abuses \u2013 to salvaging the Mideast peace process, after talks broke down last month. As Obama winds down the war in Afghanistan, violence is surging in Iraq, the first war he brought to a close \u2013 a potent reminder the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan must be managed carefully. And as the President seeks to articulate a foreign policy that avoids aggressive military entanglements while countering critics calling for a more aggressive U.S. foreign policy, it remains certain that his inbox will remain full.

            "article_content": "NEW: Inspector general finds no conflict of interest in environmental assessment Nebraska court ruling, call for health review could put off pipeline decision The issue involves tough politics for President Obama and Democrats Environmentalists: pipeline a gateway to more climate change pollution A debate of more than five years could stretch even longer with Wednesday\u2019s call for a health study on the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. Two Democratic senators \u2013 Barbara Boxer of California and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island \u2013 urged Secretary of State John Kerry to examine higher rates of cancer and other illness reported in places impacted by the \u201ctar sands\u201d oil from northern Alberta. Their letter to Kerry sought to further delay the project that has support from Republicans, some Democrats, the oil industry and labor unions. A Pew Research Center poll in September showed 65% of respondents favored building it. So why is this still being debated? Answers show how the pipeline has become a political albatross around the neck of President Barack Obama and Democrats as they try to hold onto control of the Senate in November\u2019s congressional elections. Jones: 3 myths about Keystone Pipeline Longterm impact of Keystone Pipeline Report: Pipeline won't impact climate What\u2019s this all about? A Canadian company wants to complete a pipeline from northern Alberta to the Gulf Coast that would carry the tar sands oil across six U.S. states. The $5.3-billion project by TransCanada needs federal approval because the pipeline crosses an international border. For now, the decision rests with the State Department headed by Kerry. U.S. report on Keystone indicates little climate impact Environmental groups oppose the pipeline because extracting and refining the tar sands oil emits 17% more of the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change than conventional oil production. Detractors fear the project would increase U.S. reliance on the dirtier oil at a time when the nation \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest carbon emitters \u2013 should be moving away from fossil fuel dependence to limit climate change. \u201cAt the end of the day, Keystone XL is not just another oil pipeline; it\u2019s a gateway to the unchecked development of one of the world\u2019s dirtiest fossil fuels,\u201d wrote Tom Steyer of NextGen Climate Action in a CNN opinion piece on February 20. Supporters say the years of study since TransCanada first sought U.S. permission in 2008 show the pipeline itself wouldn\u2019t significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions. They note the project will create more than 3,000 temporary U.S. jobs, as well as a likely greater number of indirect jobs. Once it is built, the pipeline would need less than 50 permanent U.S. jobs to operate it. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican of Kentucky, called the pipeline \u201cthe single largest shovel-ready project in America\u201d and an \u201cimportant project that won\u2019t cost taxpayers a dime to build but will bring thousands of private-sector jobs to Americans who desperately need them.\u201d Where does the Keystone oil come from? The pipeline starts in western Canada where tar-like black oil called bitumen saturates the sand around the Athabasca River and other areas. In the 1920s, scientists discovered how to mix what was called tar sand with hot water and caustic soda to separate the components so they could extract the bitumen. Now, major international oil companies have invested tens of billions of dollars to construct huge extraction and refining complexes around Fort McMurray, just over 200 miles northeast of Edmonton. Where does the pipeline go? The Keystone XL pipeline would begin in Hardisty, Alberta, and extend for 1,179 miles through Saskatchewan, Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska to connect with existing segments in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Once completed, it would carry 830,000 barrels a day that could travel to Houston and Port Arthur on the Gulf Coast. Who wants it? The September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terror attacks prompted a U.S. push to reduce its dependence on Middle East oil. Interest rose in getting it from Canada, a neighboring ally, and rising prices made the high cost of tar sands oil production more feasible. Time to get serious on energy: Clean or dirty? Oil companies invested billions in tar sands complexes to extract and refine the Canadian bitumen, and now want to cash in with increased production to meet both the U.S. and export demand. Republicans who traditionally support the oil industry and big business want the pipeline to keep the profits flowing and bolster the economy, while labor unions that historically align with Democrats also back the project because of the jobs it will create. In addition, four Democratic senators facing tough re-election battles this year \u2013 Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, Mark Begich in Alaska, Mark Pryor in Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina \u2013 back the pipeline. \u201cThis single project will inject billions of dollars into Louisiana and national economies and reduce our dependence on oil from hostile countries,\u201d said Landrieu, whose state has major oil production facilities. Who opposes it? The environmental lobby, with backing from wealthy liberal donors, has mounted a growing campaign of protests and other opposition to the pipeline. Steyer, a billionaire former hedge fund manager, says he will spend up to $100 million in the 2014 election cycle to promote the fight against the climate change. \u201cAmerica cannot lead the fight on climate change abroad while allowing even more pollution to be produced in our own backyard,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo truly be a global leader on climate change, President Obama must first make the right choices here at home. He must deny the Keystone XL pipeline.\u201d 5 reasons why climate change is back in the news Boxer and Whitehouse opened a new front Wednesday with their call for the State Department to include a full health review in assessing the pipeline project. \u201cElevated levels of carcinogens and mercury have been documented downstream from tar sands extraction sites, and communities in these areas show elevated levels of rare cancer rates,\u201d they said in their letter to Kerry. \u201cTar sands oil is very difficult to clean up when a spill occurs, and a 2010 tar sands pipeline spill into the Kalamazoo River still has not been resolved.\u201d They also cited \u201csignificantly higher levels of dangerous air pollutants and carcinogens\u201d downwind from tar sand refineries, with people living those areas \u201csuffering higher rates of the types of cancers linked to these toxic chemicals, including leukemia and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\u201d Where does Obama stand? In both of his inaugural addresses and his most recent State of the Union speech, Obama cited climate change as an issue of administration focus. He has mandated improved auto and truck fuel efficiency standards and toughened pollution regulations for new power plants, but the Keystone issue has become the most visible symbol of the climate change debate. In a speech last year on climate change, Obama said the pipeline must be basically carbon-neutral, meaning that approving it would have no more impact on climate change that not approving it. Obama, Harper differences over Keystone pipeline on display at summit A recent State Department environmental report concluded that building the pipeline would have little impact on overall carbon emissions from tar sands oil. Approval or denial of any single project was unlikely to affect how much oil gets extracted from the tar sands, explained Assistant Secretary of State Kerri-Ann Jones. Election-year politics also come into play. Obama would risk a voter backlash against Democratic candidates in November if he rejects the pipeline, which could cost the party its vital control of the Senate. The split over the issue between pillars of the Democratic liberal base \u2013 with the environmental lobby opposing the pipeline and organized labor supporting it \u2013 further confuses the President\u2019s approach. What happens next? More delay, most likely. Release of the State Department environmental report on January 31 launched a 90-day period for public comment and consultation. Kerry, who is known for his effort to combat climate change, will then determine if the pipeline project is in the national interest, thought the final call clearly rests with Obama. On Wednesday, the State Department inspector general cleared one potential hurdle from a final decision by concluding there was no conflict of interest involving a group with ties to TransCanada that took part in the environmental impact study. Republican Rep. Ed Royce of California, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the inspector general\u2019s conclusion ended questions about the process, adding: \u201cLet\u2019s stop the excuses and get America back to work.\u201d However, the call for a health review by Boxer and Whitehouse offers potential cover for putting off a decision. So does a Nebraska state court ruling last week threw out the governor\u2019s approval of the pipeline route through the state. With an appeal likely to take months, the court process gives the Obama administration a plausible reason for waiting until after the November vote. It wouldn\u2019t be the first that the process got delayed until after an upcoming election. In 2011, the Obama administration postponed a decision on the pipeline due to concerns raised by Nebraska officials and environmental groups about the original route near the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water that is important for the state\u2019s agricultural economy. Republicans accused Obama of putting off the issue until after the 2012 presidential election, but their efforts to force an earlier decision failed to work. Meanwhile, TransCanada rerouted the pipeline in the state. CNNMoney\u2019s Steve Hargreaves contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Pipeline supporters approve, environmentalists condemn the report The proposed oil pipeline between the U.S. and Canada is politically charged Next step is a 90-day comment period, followed by another State Department decision President Barack Obama has said the pipeline must be carbon-neutral A long-awaited State Department environmental report on the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline indicates what the oil industry and its backers have been saying \u2013 it won\u2019t have a big impact on carbon emissions that cause climate change. The report released Friday appears to give the Obama administration the cover it needs to approve the politically charged project, but not until May at the earliest, after a 90-day review and comment period. Environmentalists reacted with predictable fury, accusing the government of bad intent by releasing the report before an inspector general\u2019s findings on whether it was flawed because some participants had oil industry ties. \u201cThis document will be seen by the entire environmental community \u2026 as a sham,\u201d complained Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, adding that \u201cit encourages the already widely held impression that the fix was in from the beginning.\u201d White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said Friday night that information in the report \u201cwill now need to be closely evaluated by Secretary (of State John) Kerry and other relevant agency heads in the weeks ahead. \u201cA decision on whether the project is in the national interest will be made only after careful consideration of the (report) and other pertinent information, comments from the public, and views of other agency heads.\u201d GOP: no more stalling Supporters, including Republican leaders who have been pushing for two years for President Barack Obama to approve the project, said now it was time to get it started. \u201cMr. President, no more stalling, no more excuses,\u201d said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, adding a jab at Obama\u2019s recent pledge to act on his own this year if he can\u2019t get congressional backing. \u201cPlease pick up that pen you\u2019ve been talking so much about and make this happen. Americans need these jobs.\u201d The pipeline that would transport oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast has been a political football, pitting the oil industry and its Republican backers against environmentalists and liberal Democrats who complain it bolsters the especially dirty fossil fuel production from the tar sands of northern Alberta. The project also has sparked protests from the political left and the environmental movement. However, the politics get messy for Democrats, because organized labor supports the project that will create several thousand jobs. Release of the report launched a 90-day period for public comment and consultation. Secretary of State John Kerry, who is known for his effort to combat climate change, will then determine if the pipeline project is in the national interest. The environmental analysis makes no final conclusion on the merits of the project, but says it wouldn\u2019t impact how much oil gets produced from Canada\u2019s tar sands in northern Alberta. Dirtier oil Approval or denial of any single project was unlikely to affect how much oil gets extracted from the tar sands, Assistant Secretary of State Kerri-Ann Jones said in a conference call with reporters. Jones noted that the oil from the tar sands was more carbon intensive than normal oil, producing 17% more carbon emissions. Environmentalists say that is why the project should be rejected, arguing that it would continue U.S. reliance on a dirtier foreign oil at a time when Obama has pledged action against climate change. \u201cI will not be satisfied with any analysis that does not accurately document what is really happening on the ground when it comes to the extraction, transport, refining, and waste disposal of dirty, filthy tar sands oil,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California. In a speech last year on climate change, Obama said the pipeline should be approved only if it is basically carbon-neutral, meaning that approving it would have no more impact on climate change that not approving it. The president and CEO of TransCanada, the company proposing the pipeline, said Friday that the environmental report makes clear the benefits of the project to the U.S. economy, including $3.4 billion in added economic activity from its construction. Asked about increased carbon emissions, Russ Girling said the report determined that \u201coil sands are gonna get produced anyway.\u201d \u201cWhen you read the report carefully, it makes clear that blocking Keystone is an important component of climate sanity and we will find out if John Kerry and particularly Barack Obama  are ever willing to stand up to the oil industry or not,\u201d said environmental activist Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org. Messy politics for Democrats Democrats from energy states, such as Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, face tough re-election battles this fall and therefore want to see the pipeline approved to help a major industry for their constituents. They have criticized the administration for taking several years to review it. This year, Obama has made holding onto the Senate in November a political priority. In 2011, the Obama administration postponed a decision on the pipeline until last year, citing concerns raised by Nebraska officials and environmental groups about the original route near the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides drinking water for much of Nebraska and is important for the state\u2019s agricultural economy. Republicans accused Obama of putting off the issue until after the November 2012 election, but their efforts to force an earlier decision failed to work. Meanwhile, TransCanada rerouted it in Nebraska. The State Department is handling the review because the project crosses an international border with Canada.

            "article_content": "Pitfalls might await Clinton: Suspicious progressives and hunger for new blood Many Democratic operatives still waiting to see who else is in race Iowa Democrats currently focused on unusually busy midterm cycle Democrats in Iowa have tradition of voting for underdogs In Iowa, the state that pulled the first block out of her wobbly Jenga-game of a presidential campaign six years ago, Hillary Clinton enjoys stratospheric approval ratings, well-heeled outside groups toiling on her behalf, and important political connections that date back decades. From a distance, she appears invincible once again, far outpacing her rivals in the polls and primed to redeem herself in the caucus state that has never been especially friendly to the Clintons, or to female candidates. Iowa has not elected a female governor, senator or member of Congress. In 2016, Clinton could finally put those demons to rest. Pro-Obama group beefing up ahead of any Clinton run Hamby: Iowa Dems not in love with Hillary Roundtable: Clinton's shadow campaign Book: Hillary Clinton has 'enemies list' But beneath the surface here, familiar pitfalls might await Clinton should she decide to run: A restive and emboldened progressive base long suspicious of Clintonian moderation, a hunger for fresh Democratic voices, and a caucus electorate that boasts a cherished tradition of voting with its heart rather than its head. \u201cOne of the great things about our party is that we are always looking for new leadership and new faces to represent the changing face of the Democratic Party,\u201d said Kimberley Boggus, a 34-year-old Democratic organizer from Beaverdale. \u201cWe are looking for new leadership because that\u2019s what\u2019s needed right now.\u201d Boggus, who was named the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cActivist of the Year\u201d in 2012 for her work on President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign, did not rule out supporting Clinton if she chooses to run for president, a decision the former secretary of state says she will make sometime later this year.  Boggus praised Clinton\u2019s rich experience at the highest levels of government and a lifetime of work on behalf of women and children. But like many Democrats in Iowa, Boggus said she is eager to hear more from other leaders, pointing to Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, two names that have surfaced in early discussions about the next presidential race. O\u2019Malley on 2016 Passion remains wanting A common theme emerged in conversations about Clinton with more than two dozen Democratic activists, strategists and elected officials during a recent winter week in Iowa: Respect for her within the party runs deep, burnished since 2008 by her tour of duty at the State Department, but widespread passion for Clinton remains wanting. At the same time, no one could muster the name of a Democrat with the combination of charisma, ideological bona fides and financial firepower who could topple the Clinton juggernaut a second time. \u201cWho has the kind of pulling power that they can go on the Internet, or go to D.C. and New York and raise the kind of money you need to raise? Who is out there?\u201d said Tom Whitney, a former Democratic Party chairman and gubernatorial candidate who caucused for Obama in 2008. \u201cI would say that the top-tier candidates for Democrats are all women, two or three of them in the U.S. Senate. Hillary stands in the way of all of them.\u201d Pro-Clinton super PAC hauls in formidable sum Despite characterizing Clinton as the most formidable Iowa front-runner the Democratic Party has witnessed since hometown boy Tom Harkin sought the presidency in 1992, Whitney still said he was taking a wait-and-see approach to the campaign. Clintons using de Blasio inauguration? The 2016 battle between Clinton and GOP Hillary Clinton, Pres. Obama & 2016 \u201cRight now, my inclination would be to support her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s Hillary and somebody else, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m to the left of her, personally.\u201d Clinton\u2019s lead over her potential rivals in polls is startling. In hypothetical matchups, she thumps her next closest opponent, Vice President Joe Biden, by margins that Peyton Manning would envy, winning by 40 or 50 points. Others on the Democratic bench, like O\u2019Malley, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, register in low single digits, if not asterisk territory. The same goes for two ambitious female senators, Gillibrand and Minnesota\u2019s Amy Klobuchar, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a darling of the left who says she\u2019s not running, scores a few points higher. The only famous name among no-names Clinton\u2019s robust 2016 lead is built, in part, on her status as the only famous person in a field of relative no-names. A Des Moines Register poll released in December found Clinton\u2019s favorability rating among Democrats at a jarring 89%, while just 7% had an unfavorable view. Pro-Clinton PAC rents her 2008 campaign e-mail list The pollster Ann Selzer, who crunched the numbers for the Register survey, said the paucity of top-tier Democrats made it difficult just to conduct the poll. \u201cIt was hard to come up with a list,\u201d Selzer said in an interview on the newspaper\u2019s website. \u201cPart of that was we just haven\u2019t had candidates coming to Iowa, and not many Democrats strongly indicating they want to run for president.\u201d The lack of presidential bustle in Democratic circles is indeed glaring, especially compared to the swirl of activity on the Republican side of the ticket, where likely candidates are already making trips to Iowa and aides are peddling negative research on their potential rivals. The energies of Iowa\u2019s Democratic activists are focused not on 2016, but 2014 \u2013 a busy midterm election cycle featuring a rare open Senate seat and two House seats up for grabs. Would-be Clinton rivals have only tiptoed into Iowa. Biden, no stranger to the state after two ill-fated presidential runs, spoke at Harkin\u2019s annual steak fry fundraiser last fall, a rite of passage for any Democratic hopeful. O\u2019Malley spoke at the same event in 2012, at the height of that year\u2019s presidential campaign. Could a Hillary Clinton run harm Obama? Biden moves fuel speculation about 2016 Who's better, Clinton or Kerry? Klobuchar traveled south of her state\u2019s border to address the North Iowa Wing Ding Fundraiser last August, and chased her appearance with a series of nice-to-meet-you phone calls to some of the Democrats who attended. The Wing Ding dinner, held at the historic Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, encapsulated the paralytic early state of the Democratic campaign. Klobuchar\u2019s punchy speech before the chicken wing-munching audience earned her rave reviews from local Democrats, who said she would make an intriguing presidential candidate, but Clinton loomed over the event in absentia. Organizers bestowed a lifetime achievement award on Clinton, and reporters pressed Klobuchar on the former first lady\u2019s 2016 chances after the event. Iowa Democrats\u2019 curious paradox The state\u2019s Democratic operatives reveal a curious paradox when handicapping the 2016 race. They note a lack of pervasive grass-roots enthusiasm for Clinton, while at the same time waving off the suggestion that she could lose to another Democrat. \u201cHillary does not have the same connection with grass-roots activists that President Obama had,\u201d said Sam Reno, a top Obama organizer in Des Moines. \u201cBut if Hillary decides to run, I believe Democrats are going to line up behind her lockstep.\u201d Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon, who was John Edwards\u2019 Iowa state director in 2008 and later held senior roles in Obama\u2019s political operation, recalled that six years ago, both Obama and Edwards poured an enormous amount of money and manpower into Iowa to build volunteer-based organizations in the state\u2019s 99 counties and compete for endorsements from party leaders. It\u2019s difficult to imagine anyone building the same kind of institutional support to compete with Clinton in 2016, she said. \u201cThere is still a desire for other party leaders to come visit the state and get to know Iowans,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon said. \u201cThere is opportunity for that over the course of the 2014 cycle. But if Secretary Clinton runs, it will be much harder for any candidate to build the type of organization needed to win Iowa, because it\u2019s so intensive.\u201d While Clinton-world has kept its distance from Iowa and other early voting states \u2013 she has no leftover campaign structure on the ground here \u2013 her allies have worked to whip up an air of inevitability that threatens to prevent others from joining the race. Ready for Hillary, an independent group with tacit support from the Clintons, is dispatching a team of organizers to Iowa next week to meet with labor leaders and party activists. \u201cAn agenda is in formation,\u201d said Ready for Hillary spokesman Seth Bringman when asked about the trip. Clinton: World is worried about U.S. Clinton: U.S. isn't a theocracy, we debate Brazile on Hillary: 'She's like Elvis' Emily\u2019s List, a political action committee that backs Democratic women running for office, hosted a \u201cMadam President\u201d event in Des Moines last summer to help generate excitement for the prospect of a female president. Poll: Clinton most admired woman for 12th straight year Long-running and important connections Clinton also has important connections in the state dating back to her husband\u2019s presidency, including Bonnie Campbell, a former Iowa attorney general who served in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration and co-founded a blue-chip consulting firm in the trendy East Village district of Des Moines. Campbell said she has had no conversations with the former first lady about a possible campaign. But if Clinton does choose to seek the Democratic nomination, Campbell predicted she will have broad and enthusiastic support among women, union members and rank-and-file Democrats. The possibility of another insurgent Democrat defeating her the second time around seems dim, Campbell said. \u201cShe knows Iowa now,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s possible some very compelling person could come along and strike a chord. That has happened. I just think it\u2019s harder this time. There is a sentiment among men and women that it\u2019s time to have a woman president. And who would be more capable and more experienced than Hillary Clinton?\u201d Yet despite having the Democratic establishment at her back, there remains a palpable sense of unease with Clinton in grass-roots corners of the party, even as those very same activists promise to support her if no one else runs. Part of that restraint is ideological. Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucus-goers remain as dovish as they were in 2008, when Clinton\u2019s support for the Iraq war badly damaged her standing on the left. Clinton helped wind down that same war as Obama\u2019s secretary of state, but she is now linked to his national security apparatus, which has expanded drone attacks overseas and broadened intelligence gathering with controversial surveillance and data collection techniques. And at a time when progressives feel emboldened to confront issues like income inequality and wage stagnation, Clinton, who delivered paid speeches last year to two prominent private equity firms as well as a group that actively lobbied against the Affordable Care Act, is perceived by some as too close to the deficit-obsessed worlds of Wall Street and official Washington. \u201cShe needs to become more populist,\u201d said state Rep. Brian Meyer, a Democrat from Des Moines. \u201cIf somebody comes to Iowa and has that populist message it\u2019s going to be well received. People are looking for an alternative. Hillary is the front-runner for a reason. A lot of people support her. But there is a group of progressives in Iowa and New Hampshire and elsewhere who want to see what the field is like and who gets in.\u201d Whimsical Democratic impulses Clinton is also susceptible to some of the same whimsical Democratic impulses that propelled Obama to his stunning Iowa victory in 2008. \u201cDemocrats love an underdog and we love a story,\u201d is how Meyer put it. With a gleaming resume and the potential to make history as the country\u2019s first female president, Clinton has a powerful story to tell. But she is hardly an underdog. Some party leaders warned Clinton against reprising the same kind of heavy-handed front-running behavior that rankled so many Iowa activists \u2013 not to mention the media \u2013 during her 2008 effort. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she has learned that lesson,\u201d said Jean Pardee, the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s 2nd District vice chair. \u201cThe problem with so much of her staff was that they were all sort of higher class than the mere peasants that they had to campaign with. Everyone was kept at arm\u2019s length by the staff, although a couple of key ones were pretty good. That\u2019s a lesson that should be hopefully learned. But when it comes to human nature, maybe that\u2019s not possible.\u201d Top 12 campaign questions for 2014 Clinton must also confront the who\u2019s-on-deck inclinations of the Democratic caucus-goer. Unlike Republicans, who have a habit of nominating loyal soldiers who have waited for their turn, Iowa Democrats have a tendency to search for someone new. The last time the party nominated an obvious heir-apparent was 2000, but Al Gore first had to beat back an unexpectedly fierce primary challenge from Bill Bradley on the left. George Appleby, an attorney and lobbyist in Des Moines who supported Bradley and copped to a \u201cpristine record of picking the wrong guy\u201d in every caucus since 1976 until he backed Obama in 2008, described Clinton as \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cbrilliant.\u201d But he said liberals are suffering from an acute case of \u201cClinton fatigue.\u201d  He named O\u2019Malley, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and Secretary of State John Kerry, the 2004 Iowa caucus winner, as Democrats he\u2019s keeping an eye on. \u201cHillary would make a great president,\u201d Appleby said. \u201cShe is the odds-on-favorite. But I don\u2019t think she is necessarily going to be the nominee, or going to win Iowa. Sometimes people have been around forever, and there is time for some new blood.\u201d Difficult to find Democrat critical of Clinton Even with these simmering concerns, finding a Democrat in Iowa who is outright critical of Clinton, at least on the record, is difficult. Conversations about the putative front-runner, if disparaging, were invariably punctuated with guarded qualifiers. \u201cBut I\u2019m not anti-Clinton\u201d is a common refrain. So is \u201cDon\u2019t print that.\u201d Such caution was on full display in December, when Schweitzer, the former Montana governor, visited the Des Moines suburb of Altoona to headline a holiday gathering hosted by ProgressIowa, a liberal advocacy group. Hip to the 2016 buzz that surrounded his visit to the caucus state, Schweitzer made headlines when he criticized the Democratic senators who voted to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. It was an unmistakable jab at Clinton and her support for the war, a vote that haunted her in 2008 and allowed Obama to tap into the anti-war anxieties of Iowa liberals. Asked over and over by the five reporters in attendance if his comments were aimed specifically at Clinton, the usually blunt Schweitzer hemmed and hawed. \u201cI think 21 Democratic senators got it exactly right and voted against it,\u201d he said, avoiding naming names, and thus any head-on criticism of Clinton. Former Montana governor\u2019s fondness for Iowa The Schweitzer event drew a number of Democratic party power-brokers, including gubernatorial candidate Jack Hatch, who purchased Schweitzer\u2019s signature bolo tie for $125 in a slapdash auction, and Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Scott Brennan, who waved off a reporter\u2019s questions about 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s so damn early,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was stupid early in 2008 and it\u2019s stupid early now. No one has done a damn thing.\u201d And yet, for some reason, nearly 70 activists, labor leaders and party officials showed up to a casino ballroom in the pre-Christmas cold to hear the voluble Montana governor talk about education, the economy and prison reform. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s here,\u201d said Meyer, the state legislator, who was nursing a beer in the back of the room. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can wait on Hillary\u2019s decision to come out. People, if they are serious about running, they have to come out before she makes a decision. Clearly she is the front-runner and she is a wonderful candidate. Joe Biden is No. 2. But I would like to see a second tier of candidates come out here, because Iowa is where upsets are made and where people move on.\u201d Also patrolling the room was Rob Hogg, a bespectacled state senator from Cedar Rapids. After proudly signing a copy of his book on climate change and handing it to a reporter, Hogg was asked which Democratic candidate he supported in the 2008 caucuses. \u201cI supported Secretary Clinton,\u201d he said. Pressed twice on whether he would back her once again, Hogg twice replied with the same answer: \u201cIt depends on who else is in the field.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Iowa Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst raised her profile with pig castration ad Democratic opponent Bruce Braley stumbled into \"out of touch with Iowa\" tag In the moderate state, Ernst might lean too far to the right, Braley too far to the left Joni Ernst takes running for Senate literally. Try keeping up with her as she races through a rainy parade. It\u2019s a workout. Ernst doesn\u2019t march, she sprints \u2013 darting side-to-side, shaking as many hands as possible \u2013 a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard recruiting potential voters for her campaign. The Iraq War veteran and little-known conservative Iowa state senator burst onto the political scene earlier this year with the TV ad of the political primary season. Watch out Iowa, here comes Hillary Smiling straight to camera, Ernst says in the ad that she knows how to cut pork because she grew up on a farm castrating pigs. The squealing pigs in the background became a trademark of her campaign. New polls show growing GOP advantage GOP's 2014 closing theme Inside Politics forecast She decisively beat three GOP primary opponents with the support of a broad coalition of Republican groups \u2013 rare in these divided times for the GOP. Still, Ernst\u2019s conservative views, combined with her interesting personal story and boundless energy, have made her one of this election year\u00b9s most high-profile tea party favorites. The problem for Ernst is that while Iowa has its share of conservatives who vote in GOP primaries, and of course its first in the nation presidential caucuses every four years, it is actually a relatively moderate state. And Ernst is running for an open Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Tom Harkin, a venerable liberal in the state and nationwide. With a new CNN/ORC poll showing just a 1-point difference between Ernst and Democratic opponent Bruce Braley, well within the margin of error, it\u2019s no surprise that Ernst is trying to moderate her image. When we asked whether she wanted to be a senator in the mold of Ted Cruz, the freshman conservative firebrand from Texas, without missing a beat she replied, \u201cOh, no.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a senator in the mold of Joni Ernst, just an independent leader who will represent Iowa,\u201d Ernst told CNN. Ernst says she was harassed in the military Make issues the issue Democrats working to elect Braley believe best the way to beat Ernst and keep this seat in Democratic hands is to steer the conversation away from her persona and toward her position on issues, which Democrats argue fall well out of the mainstream of Hawkeye State voters. \u201cErnst and the people supporting her don\u2019t seem to want to engage and talk about where she stands on the issues,\u201d Braley said. With primary over, Iowa Senate race gets ugly Ernst did answer some of our questions about those issues. That includes when she was a state senator and co-sponsored personhood legislation, which would legally mean life begins at conception.  It\u2019s a position some self-described pro-life voters do not support, but Ernst stands by it. GOP's \"Field of Dreams\" Panel: Does Clinton excite Democrats? Inside Politics: Farmer politics \u201cI promote a culture of life. I promote life. That\u2019s the person I am,\u201d Ernst told us. One of the practical results of the personhood measure \u2013 life starts at conception \u2013 is that it would likely outlaw some forms of birth control. She tried to distance herself from that notion, telling us, \u201cHeavens, no.\u201d \u201cI am someone who supports a woman\u2019s right to birth control, absolutely, so to say that is absolutely false and misleading,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, if women would like to talk to me about those items, I am happy to talk it over. Birth control yes, and promoting a culture of life, yes.\u201d On pocketbook issues, Ernst opposes a nationwide, federal minimum wage, which Braley\u2019s campaign thinks is so harmful politically to her that it\u2019s running ads and talking about it nonstop. She explained to us that she doesn\u2019t believe minimum wage should be a \u201cone size fits all approach,\u201d but rather state by state. \u201cWe really do need to have a minimum wage that is set based on local economies. And I think the state is best to do that,\u201d Ernst said. She said she believes the current minimum wage, $7.25 per hour, is \u201cappropriate for Iowa, but that\u2019s up for our state legislators to decide, and I\u2019m willing to have those discussions at the state level.\u201d When we pointed out that a lot of families live on minimum wage, she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a beginning wage, it shouldn\u2019t be the wage they survive on forever.\u201d Ernst: Savvy, rebellious or both? Ernst is the beneficiary of millions of dollars from outside groups funded by the Koch brothers and other big national donors. She has no shortage of strategic help from GOP operatives on a national level, hoping this will be one of the six seats Republicans need to win the Senate. But she doesn\u2019t always take the advice she gets. DREAMers confront Hillary Clinton DREAMers confront Hillary Clinton Sen. Sanders tests 2016 waters in Iowa On our three-hour drive from Des Moines to Spencer, we got a call from one of her operatives informing us that our scheduled brief interview was canceled. \u201cNo more national interviews for a while,\u201d was what we were told. But when we arrived and approached Ernst, instead of avoiding us, she greeted us warmly and answered several questions along the parade route. Whether that was savvy (avoiding unflattering pictures of her running away) or rebellion against Washington advisers, it was a telling level of sophistication for a first-time statewide candidate in a high-profile race. Braley working to repair his image As for her Democratic opponent, he, too, has a comfort level and natural rapport with voters \u2013 characteristics that fly in the face of the unfortunate image of an out-of-touch Washington insider he helped inflict on himself with a series of early gaffes. The congressman complained about no towel service in the House gym during the government shutdown. And Braley was caught on tape disparaging Iowa\u2019s popular senior GOP Sen. Charles Grassley and farmers \u2013 a big Iowa no-no \u2013 by calling Grassley a \u201cfarmer from Iowa who never went to law school.\u201d While walking with us through the quiet streets of his hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa, Braley owned those mistakes without being defensive. \u201cAll of us say things that we regret. And if you grow up in Iowa, the important lesson to learn is that if you make a mistake, you take responsibility for it, and that\u2019s what I did,\u201d he told CNN. First lady to campaign for Democrat in tight Iowa Senate race He brought us to this small Iowa town where his mother still teaches school at 85 and he started a paper route in third grade, facts that Braley hopes can beat back a narrative that Republicans seized on after his rhetorical stumbles: that he\u2019s a Washington creature now who can\u2019t relate to Iowans. \u201cI\u2019ve baled hay, I\u2019ve worked farms, I was a truck driver, a construction worker. I was a janitor in this town. I learned the value of hard work from the people I grew up here with,\u201d Braley said. \u201cThey taught me that it\u2019s important to respect other people, to be a good listener, and to work hard and fight for people who don\u2019t have an ability to be their own voice. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in the House and that\u2019s what type of senator I\u2019d be,\u201d he told us. While Iowa isn\u2019t conservative, is certainly isn\u2019t ultraliberal. Tom Harkin, feted by the Clintons at his final famous steak fry over the weekend, is a unique public figure in the state \u2013 quite popular statewide despite his openly liberal leanings. Still, Braley told us he would be \u201ca progressive problem solver in the mold of Tom Harkin.\u201d Congressman apologizes for #TrailofTears tweet Gender gap, even with a GOP woman on ballot If Ernst, a 44-year-old mother and stepgrandmother, were to win this seat, she would be the first woman senator from Iowa. But the new CNN/ORC poll shows that 57% of women voters in Iowa support her male, Democratic opponent. The traditional gender gap between the parties still exists here, even with a Republican woman on the ballot. We only had a chance to ask Ernst one quick question about gender along the parade route here \u2013 why she thinks so few of the 20 women U.S. senators are Republican? (There are four GOP female senators). \u201cThat\u2019d is a really good question. You need to ask the voters in all those other states,\u201d she said abruptly before racing off to shake more hands of potential voters. Finally, a Democrat who wants Obama to come Like many Democrats on the ballot this year, Braley is weighed down by an unpopular president, whose approval rating here now stands at just 37%. That\u2019s remarkable, considering that Iowa is where Barack Obama\u2019s big 2008 caucuses win knocked Hillary Clinton off her White House path \u2013 and where Obama beat GOP rivals in 2008 and 2012. If Republicans take control of the Senate for Obama\u2019s last two years in office, it would likely sting even more if Iowa elected a Republican and helped deliver that blow to the President. Still, while Democratic candidates in red states keep their distance, Braley does not. \u201cIf the President has time in his schedule to come to Iowa in this campaign, I\u2019d welcome him,\u201d he said. \u201cIowans are the type of people who welcome somebody of significant importance, and that would certainly include President Obama. Even though they may disagree with him, every four years we welcome people of both parties to come and talk about important policy issues, and I think that would be one of the reasons why it would be alright for President Obama to come to Iowa,\u201d Braley explained. \u201cCome on, President Obama!\u201d That was Ernst\u2019s reaction when we about her opponent\u2019s willingness to host the unpopular Democratic President on the campaign trail here. \u201cI think that would be wonderful,\u201d Ernst told us, barely hiding a mischievous smile.
