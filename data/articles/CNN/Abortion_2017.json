            "article_content": "Critics say proposed law opens door for LGBT discrimination Supporters say faith-based agencies need legal protections to keep offering child welfare services Texas lawmakers are poised to vote on a bill that would allow adoption agencies to turn away potential parents they find objectionable on religious grounds. Opponents say the proposed law would allow faith-based agencies to discriminate against potential parents who are gay, single or of a religion that members of the adoption agency find objectionable. The bill\u2019s author insists it heads off any potential discrimination by mandating that alternatives be made available for potential parents who are rejected by faith-based providers. Called the \u201cFreedom to Serve Children Act,\u201d Texas\u2019 House Bill 3859 extends religious liberty protections to providers within Texas\u2019 child welfare system, allowing them to decline services to individuals based on \u201cthe provider\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d The vote on the bill was originally planned for Saturday but has been rescheduled for Monday. The Texas bill also includes provisions that let adoption and foster care agencies refuse to provide or facilitate abortion services and contraception to teens under their care. Child welfare providers can also require children under their care to receive a religious education, including putting them in religious schools. \u201cHB 3859 would allow child welfare service providers that contract with the state to use taxpayer money to discriminate against LGBT individuals and families in foster care, adoption and other services,\u201d ACLU of Texas said in a statement on its website. \u201cIt\u2019s about as limiting a bill as we have seen,\u201d Terri Burke, executive director for ACLU Texas, told CNN. \u201cYou say you have a sincerely held religious belief and you are a private adoption agency or private entity that helps place foster children \u2013  you can say you will not place that child with gay parents \u2026. If I\u2019m Catholic I can say I don\u2019t want any Baptists to raise the child,\u201d Burke said. But the bill\u2019s author, Rep. James Frank, says new protections are needed for the 25% of state child welfare providers that are faith based. A statement about the bill provided to CNN by Frank\u2019s office says that \u201cHB 3859 protects the rights of the faith-based organizations to exercise their religious mission to serve others without fear of retaliation.\u201d Frank argues that, without legal protection, those organizations may shut down child welfare services entirely and thereby worsen the \u201ccritical shortage of foster homes\u201d in Texas. The bill also includes a \u201csecondary services\u201d provision that \u201cspecifically requires the state to ensure that alternate providers are available to offer any services that a faith-based provider declines to provide due to religious conflicts,\u201d according to his office\u2019s statement. The ACLU said HB 3859 is one of 17 bills filed in Texas legislature this session that \u201cwould allow government officials, private individuals and businesses to discriminate against LGBT people in virtually all aspects of their lives.\u201d Burke said proposed laws like HB 3859 show that Texas Republicans \u2013 who control both the state legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion \u2013 have \u201cbecome more emboldened\u201d since the election of President Trump. Last week, Trump signed an executive order meant to allow churches and other religious organizations to become more active politically, though the actual implications of his order appear to be limited. \u201cThe executive order Trump signed had no teeth to it. But these bills working their way to the Texas legislature are real and they are going to do real damage to real people,\u201d Burke said. Several other states have passed religious liberty bills. South Dakota approved a sweeping bill last March that protects faith-based adotpion agencies that refuse to place children with couples on religious grounds.

            "article_content": "She was one of the Democrats trying to unseat GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder in 2018 She made her announcement on Facebook Democrat Andrea Ramsey announced Friday morning she was dropping out of the race to fill a competitive House of Representatives seat in Kansas amid news of a 2005 lawsuit that accused her of sexual harassment. Ramsey, who announced on Facebook that she was quitting the race, was accused in the lawsuit of sexually harassing and then retaliating against a male subordinate who said he had rejected her advances. Ramsey was not named as a defendant in the case, which was first reported by The Kansas City Star. The case was dismissed in 2006 and multiple sources with knowledge told The Star the man had reached a settlement with LabOne, the company where Ramsey had been the executive vice president of human resources. Ramsey told The Star she was unaware of any settlement. She was one of the Democratic candidates running to try to unseat Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder in 2018 in Kansas\u2019 3rd District and also had the endorsement of Emily\u2019s List, the influential Democratic political committee that backs women for public office who support abortion rights. \u201cA man sued my company twelve years ago and made false accusations against me. Had the false allegations been brought against me directly, I would have fought to exonerate my name and my reputation,\u201d she said in the Facebook post. \u201cNow, twelve years later this suit is being used to force me out of my race for Congress.\u201d She continued: \u201cAs a first-time candidate, I am disappointed and disillusioned by the political process. \u2026 I will continue to seek future opportunities to serve our community and fight for our Republic, just not as your Congresswoman.\u201d She also said it\u2019s important for women to step forward and tell their stories. \u201cOn balance, it is far more important to me that women are stepping forward to tell their stories and confront their harassers than it is to continue our campaign,\u201d she said. She said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee will not \u201csupport\u201d her \u201cpromising campaign.\u201d \u201cIn its rush to claim the high ground in our roiling national conversation about harassment, the Democratic Party has implemented a zero tolerance standard,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor me, that means a vindictive, terminated employee\u2019s false allegations are enough for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) to decide not to support our promising campaign. We are in a national moment where rough justice stands in place of careful analysis, nuance and due process.\u201d The DCCC, which had not endorsed anyone in the election yet, said members and candidates should be held to the \u201chighest standard.\u201d \u201cMembers and candidates must all be held to the highest standard. If anyone is guilty of sexual harassment or sexual assault, that person should not hold public office,\u201d DCCC communications director Meredith Kelly said Friday. The allegations against Ramsey were in a lawsuit against LabOne, and in a complaint to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The man, Gary Funkhouser, accused Ramsey of \u201cunwelcome, unwanted and offensive sexual comments and innuendos\u201d beginning in September 2004. \u201cAfter plaintiff rejected Thomas\u2019s sexual advances, Thomas changed her demeanor toward plaintiff by shunning him, ignoring him, refusing to talk with him, and otherwise treating him in an unprofessional manner; moving him out of an office into a cubicle farther away from her office; criticizing his work performance; and ultimately terminating his performance on June 13, 2005,\u201d the lawsuit said. Ramsey told the Star she made the decision to fire Funkhouser in conjunction with the management of the company. CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "There\u2019s growing Democratic optimism for 2018. President Trump may have a new national security strategy. And Republicans brace for another intra-party feud over a southern Senate seat. It\u2019s all in this week\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d forecast, where you get tomorrow\u2019s headlines today. Recent election results, such as Doug Jones\u2019 win an Alabama, have Democrats thinking big. Just how big might surprise you. It would take a swing of 24 seats to flip the House from Republican-controlled to Democrat \u2013 no easy task given the way congressional districts are drawn these days. And while Republicans will have just a 51-49 Senate majority once Alabama\u2019s Doug Jones is sworn in next year, the conventional wisdom for months has been that the Senate math favors the GOP because so many of the seats up in 2018 are held by Democrats, including 10 in states President Trump won in 2016. But the 2017 election results, combined with high engagement among Democrats and a GOP suburban slump, have Democrats quite bullish. Jonathan Martin of The New York Times shared his reporting about how some seasoned Democrats are thinking big. \u201cYou hear the party talking about 40 seats now,\u201d Martin said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a long way until next year\u2019s election, but you have people who are typically sober looking at a heck of a year next year in the House.\u201d President Trump on Monday will deliver a speech in conjunction with his administration\u2019s release of its official national security strategy. It\u2019s the White House\u2019s chance to offer a roadmap about how the President and his team view the world and will respond to potential threats. And the global challenges facing this President are many, from ISIS to North Korea to the China challenge and beyond. So it will be a document and a speech that deserve attention. But will it have a long shelf life? That question came up in the reporting of Politico\u2019s Eliana Johnson, who says Trump\u2019s frequent changes of heart raise questions about whether a position laid out this week will survive into next year \u2013 or even next week. \u201cI\u2019ll be watching whether this document merely collects dust or whether it actually serves to guide the administration\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cUp until now, it really seems to have been guided by the way the president wakes up feeling.\u201d North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs top most lists of the most pressing national security challenges facing President Trump. Meanwhile, there were new dustups this past week between Trump White House aides and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray reports that many in the Trump inner circle believe there will be some big North Korea decisions to make in the near future, perhaps even during the President\u2019s Christmas break in Florida. US scrambles to find unified message on North Korea And, despite all the media accounts of Trump-Tillerson tensions, Murray thinks there could be a year-end truce of sorts. \u201cI\u2019m told by at least some that privately, they have reached a temporary d\u00e9tente,\u201d Murray said Sunday. \u201cNow it\u2019s Trump, so temporary could be key here.\u201d There is no question that corporations are the biggest winners in the tax-reform legislation due for votes this week in the House and Senate. But what about other interests that were lobbying furiously to the end as negotiators tried to settle differences between the House and Senate versions? If you\u2019ve got student loan debt, you get to keep that deduction. Ditto for families with high medical costs: That deduction remains as well. Read the Republican tax plan Bloomberg\u2019s Sahil Kapur tracked the tax bill horsetrading and says the final version does not include some provisions pushed by social conservatives. \u201cA tax break for unborn children that reproductive rights advocates feared would threaten legal abortion was defeated at the last minute,\u201d Kapur said. Ailing Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran\u2019s staff says he is expected back in the Senate this week for the big tax cut vote. But the Republican leadership isn\u2019t ready to bet the bill on that, and worked late last week to get enough votes to pass the measure even if Cochran and Arizona\u2019s John McCain remain sidelined by health issues. Cochran also missed time in the Senate earlier this year because of health problems, and there are quiet contingency conversations in both Mississippi and Washington about what would happen if Cochran is unable to return to work \u2013 or if he decides to step aside in 2018. Having those discussions might seem a tad crass, but Mississippi law is a factor. If the Senate is in session at the time the vacancy occurs, the state\u2019s governor must appoint an interim senator within 10 days. GOP Sen. Thad Cochran still out sick with UTI, threatening key tax-related vote this week Again, all this is in its relative infancy. But GOP sources with knowledge of the conversations say allies of Chris McDaniel, a tea party Republican who lost a fiercely contested primary to Cochran in 2014, believe he should be the leading candidate for for interim senator. But the Republican establishment, which went on full alert to quash the McDaniel challenge in 2014, has zero interest in that. As we just witnessed in Alabama, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has a keen interest in keeping Republicans he views as agitators off of the ballot and out of the Senate. The GOP sources keeping track of the Mississippi whispering say the establishment favorite, should there be a Cochran vacancy, is former Gov. Haley Barbour, who is also a former Republican National Committee chairman and a veteran Washington lobbyist. This is all theoretical at the moment, because Cochran\u2019s staff predicts he will be back to work soon. But here is another factor in the contingency planning: If a vacancy happened in 2018, state law calls for a special Senate election to coincide with the normal election that year, which would mean both of Mississippi\u2019s Senate seats would be on the ballot. McDaniel has already talked of maybe mounting a primary challenge against incumbent GOP Sen. Roger Wicker. If both seats were on the ballot, the 2014 Cochran race and the more recent Alabama race would serve notice that the Magnolia State could become a giant stage for the festering GOP faction wars.",

            "article_content": "Media focused on Roy Moore's conservative Christian base in Alabama But he lost in large part because of another group of \"values voters\" Going into the Senate race in Alabama, much of the attention was focused on Republican Roy Moore\u2019s conservative Christian base. Would they turn out to support him despite the allegations that he molested and harassed teenage girls decades ago? They did, according to exit polls. Eight in 10 white evangelical voters cast their ballots for Moore, who is himself a white evangelical. That\u2019s roughly the same percentage President Donald Trump won among white evangelical voters nationally in 2016. In the Alabama Senate race, white evangelicals made up 44% of the electorate, a sizable slice that suggests turnout was roughly on par with previous elections. But Moore lost in large part because another group of \u201cvalues voters\u201d \u2013 African-American women \u2013  voted overwhelmingly for his opponent, Doug Jones. A whopping 98% of black women voters cast their ballots for Jones, giving the Democrat a huge boost, exit polls show. Measuring the 'Alabama earthquake': How Doug Jones won Black women, and men for that matter, aren\u2019t usually categorized as \u201cvalues voters\u201d in the media, which usually reserve that term for conservative white Christians. But perhaps it\u2019s well past time for that to change. First of all, according to the Pew Research Center, nearly 15% of black Americans are themselves evangelicals, though a majority (53%) attend historically black Protestant denominations. More than 80% say they believe in God and attend church at least once or twice a month, and three in four say religion is \u201cvery important\u201d in their lives, according to Pew. That makes African-Americans one of the country\u2019s most devoutly religious groups. Black voters turned out for Jones African-Americans are also more likely than white Christians to blend religion and politics in church, according to a separate Pew study conducted last year. Nearly 60% said clergy at their house of worship had encouraged the congregation to vote in the general election for president, and half said the same about the presidential primaries. That\u2019s a higher percentage than any other group, including white evangelicals. Where African-American churchgoers differ is in the political issues they\u2019re likely to talk about in church. White evangelicals were most likely to discuss religious liberty, abortion and homosexuality. Black churches, too, talked a lot about homosexuality \u2013 39% told Pew they had heard clergy mention the issue. But they were also far more likely to talk about economic inequality and environmental issues. So perhaps in addition to expanding the definition of \u201cvalues voters,\u201d it\u2019s time to expand the idea of the \u201cvalues\u201d that religious voters care about as well \u2013 in Alabama and elsewhere.",

            "article_content": "Trump's official White House role came with a steep learning curve The early months of the Trump administration were fraught with internal chaos Like nearly every senior staffer in a White House infamous for backstabbing, Ivanka Trump spent her early months immersed in the drama of competing power centers. She just didn\u2019t know where the daggers were coming from. Anecdotes quickly emerged of Ivanka pleading with her father to moderate his positions \u2013 or at least his tone \u2013 often, with little success. It took a while to determine those leaks weren\u2019t entirely the result of her Manhattan friends casting her in the role of their liberal savior, but rather her newfound White House colleagues looking to undermine her influence, according to administration officials. The early months of the Trump administration were fraught with internal chaos. Rival factions emerged, pitting then-chief strategist Steve Bannon and others who counted themselves as nationalists against the more global-minded wing, led by Jared Kushner, Ivanka\u2019s husband, and chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. Meanwhile, then-chief of staff Reince Priebus battled constant speculation about his status and lack of standing within the West Wing. Ivanka Trump rebrands -- again As Trump accepted a formal role of assistant to the President, she wasn\u2019t spared either. Her role came with a steep learning curve and a target on her back. \u201cI\u2019m listening, I\u2019m learning, I\u2019m defining the ways in which I think I\u2019ll be able to have impact,\u201d she said in April at a women\u2019s economic empowerment panel alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Less than a year after assuming her unprecedented role in her father\u2019s White House, President Donald Trump\u2019s elder daughter has begun to carve her own path. After months of navigating the drama and unpredictability of the divided factions within the West Wing \u2013 as well as her father\u2019s own unpredictability \u2013 her focus has turned to building relationships within the administration, Congress and officials abroad. A portfolio that once included dabbling in nearly every issue that crossed her father\u2019s desk is now more neatly tailored to women\u2019s economic empowerment. Trump arrived in Washington in January with her husband and their three small children. Initially, her intention was to care for her family and continue loosely advising her father, for whom she has been a long-trusted aide. Asked what type of role she would have in her father\u2019s White House days after the election, Trump, who worked for the family real estate business and built an eponymous fashion brand herself, initially eschewed a formal role, telling CBS News: \u201cI\u2019m going to be a daughter.\u201d But by March, it became apparent her role was expanding; she obtained a security clearance and moved into an upstairs office in the West Wing, becoming a senior adviser to the President. With her formal title came lofty expectations, including the notion that she would moderate her father\u2019s positions on everything from climate change to LGBTQ issues to women\u2019s reproductive rights. A testy meeting with Planned Parenthood after the inauguration \u2013 in which Trump advocated that the group spin off any abortion-related services in order to protect its federal funding \u2013 left reproductive rights activists disenchanted with her commitment to women\u2019s advocacy. Her efforts to urge the President not to abandon the Paris climate accord also fell short, disappointing global warming warriors. \u201cDon\u2019t Let Ivanka Trump\u2019s Tweets Fool You \u2013 She Doesn\u2019t Care About Women,\u201d a Harper\u2019s Bazaar article declared in April. \u201cLook, It\u2019s Time to Collectively and Officially Give Up on Ivanka Trump,\u201d a Vogue article said in July. \u201cIvanka Trump has no power as a White House adviser,\u201d a Salon article insisted in September. \u201cI got the sense through my interactions that the goal was continued relevance, not impact,\u201d said one early adviser to Ivanka, who has since parted ways with her team. Rather than slowly easing into Washington and building a unique coalition of conservative and more liberal-leaning allies behind the scenes, Trump dove headfirst into an ill-defined White House job. \u201cShe took a very traditional path, which closed off opportunity,\u201d the former adviser said, dismissing her position in Washington as \u201cnot only ineffective, but irrelevant.\u201d For Trump, working at the White House has been a lesson in learning to pick her battles. If it\u2019s a promise the President campaigned on, she knows there\u2019s little chance of changing his mind and her most valuable role may be presenting him with alternative points of view. If it wasn\u2019t a core campaign promise, she has more room to try to exert her influence. \u201cI would say not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence,\u201d she told CBS in April, when asked about criticism that she has failed to speak out on hot-button issues like climate change and Planned Parenthood. \u201cSo where I disagree with my father, he knows it. And I express myself with total candor. Where I agree, I fully lean in and support the agenda and \u2013 and hope \u2013 that I can be an asset to him and \u2013 and make a positive impact. But I respect the fact that he always listens.\u201d But she did say that she\u2019s been able to change his mind on some issues. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the mat on certain issues and I may still lose those,\u201d she told The New York Times in May. \u201cBut maybe along the way I\u2019ve modified a position just slightly. And that\u2019s just great.\u201d Since Gen. John Kelly was hired as chief of staff in July, the West Wing has become a somewhat calmer workplace. Bannon was ousted from his perch as chief strategist in August, a departure that was cheered by some administration officials who viewed him as an egotist taking credit for the President\u2019s accomplishments and peddling false narratives about his colleagues. White House officials insist some of the tales about Ivanka appealing to her father to moderate his tone or flip on controversial issues were exaggerated. \u201cI think it was overblown,\u201d said Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs. \u201cI think there are certain policy positions she wants to advocate, but I think she\u2019s really here more than anything to help her father.\u201d As Kelly imposed a military-like order on the West Wing, he also helped to more clearly define the portfolios of senior staffers, including the president\u2019s daughter. \u201cEverybody was just kind of freelancing,\u201d Short said about the administration before Kelly. \u201cNow there\u2019s better defined structure. It enables her and a lot of us to know our territory and have responsibility.\u201d These days, Trump no longer feels the need to weigh in on the issue du jour. Instead, she has focused on economic initiatives that benefit women and families, including workforce development, encouraging women to move into STEM fields and combating human trafficking. On tax reform, she emerged as a key administration voice for expanding the child tax credit. As she and her husband look to build relationships in Washington, they\u2019ve hosted several dinner parties at their Kalorama home. The subject matter has ranged from prison sentencing reform to tax reform, and participants have included lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, Cabinet secretaries and staffers. Among the dinner attendees: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the President\u2019s former political rival, who also teamed up with Ivanka and other members to press for an expansion of the child tax credit. While Trump may cast herself as a typical White House employee, the scrutiny and interest in her activities outshine most other aides. An Ivanka appearance on Capitol Hill all but assures a mob of reporters in tow. Those who have worked with her on Capitol Hill have praised her ability to raise awareness for such issues. On tax reform, she may be poised to notch a victory. The Senate version of the bill doubles the child tax credit to $2,000. \u201cI believe that most of our success is due to her charisma and her competence and her courage to stand up and take the arrows she takes normally,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, who worked with Trump on the child tax credit push. \u201cWithout her this is not possible.\u201d Trump\u2019s sphere of influence extends beyond the West Wing \u2013 she has become a key representative of the administration abroad, working to build relationships with key players across the globe. It\u2019s a wise move for world leaders, understanding that she has her father\u2019s ear. Last month, she traveled to Hyderabad, India, leading the US delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, where she held meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi focused on increasing US security and economic partnership with India. Earlier in November, she was invited to speak at a conference on women\u2019s participation in the economy in Tokyo by Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe. She spoke about human trafficking alongside Britain\u2019s Theresa May during a United Nations panel this summer, and she\u2019s met with Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau multiple times. Trump also counts the creation of a World Bank facility aimed at empowering women in developing countries, called WeFi, which she spearheaded alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as one of her biggest successes in the administration thus far. Trump\u2019s allies insist she finds her West Wing role fulfilling and is already lining up legislative issues to tackle after tax reform. And while it may be a disappointment to the liberals who once pinned their hopes on her, she\u2019s shown little sign of upending her cautious approach. She remains hesitant to disagree publicly with her father; Trump has been on the record just once in opposition to the President, speaking out strongly against Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for people who prey on children,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview otherwise focused on tax reform last month. Though she chose her words carefully, declining to say that Moore was one such person, she added that she had \u201cno reason to doubt the victims\u2019 accounts.\u201d Her father was irritated by her comments and didn\u2019t hesitate to tell her so, according to administration officials. The President appeared to give little credence to the victims\u2019 allegations against Moore. \u201cHe totally denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said last month. \u201cAnd look, you have to look at him also.\u201d The President threw his full support behind the embattled Senate candidate, recording a robocall for Moore and traveling last week to nearby Pensacola, Florida, where he urged supporters to \u201cget out and vote for Roy Moore.\u201d For his part, former White House adviser Bannon continued his needling of the first daughter. Speaking at an election eve rally for Moore Monday evening, he appeared to mock her statement on Moore, criticizing members of his party who spoke out against the Senate candidate: \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for Republicans who should know better.\u201d Moore lost to Doug Jones, the first Democrat to win a statewide race in Alabama in 25 years, Tuesday night.",

            "article_content": "The Alabama Senate race is over. And Democrat Doug Jones has pulled off an absolutely massive upset, edging embattled Republican Roy Moore. Jones\u2019 projected victory narrows the Republican edge in the Senate, which is a very big deal for the future (or lack thereof) of President Donald Trump\u2019s policy agenda in 2018. But, there are broader takeaways \u2013 for Trump, the GOP and the Democratic party \u2013 from Tuesday\u2019s result too. Here are 5 big ones. At the start of this year, the idea that Democrats would have any chance to win the Senate majority come November 2018 was regarded as a joke. No more. Jones\u2019 victory means that for now Democrats are only 2 seats away from the majority \u2013 Vice President Mike Pence casts the tie-breaking vote when it is 50-50. While a Democratic move into the majority still looks like a long shot, it\u2019s now not out of the question. Remember that Trump won Alabama by 28 points 13 months ago. A Democrat hadn\u2019t won a Senate race in the state since 1992 when then Democratic Sen. Richard Shelby won. He switched to the Republican party two years later. Who is Doug Jones, the Democrat who just won in Alabama? Yes, Moore\u2019s profile \u2013 and the series of allegations from women who said he pursued relationships with them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s \u2013 made this race uniquely competitive. But, if a Democrat can win in Alabama, a Democrat can win just about anywhere in the country. The numbers are still daunting for Democrats: 25 Democratic seats are up in 2018 as compared to just 8 for Republicans. But, with competitive races likely for current GOP seats in states like Nevada, Arizona and Tennessee, there is now a path for Democrats to win the majority. And that is stunning. Trump went all in for Moore in the late stages of this race. His appearance last Friday in Pensacola was a wink, wink, nudge, nudge way to rally Republican support for the flagging Republican nominee. Trump recorded a robocall for Moore, sent out a series of tweets about the race and generally worked in the final week of the campaign to make this a referendum on himself. Analysis - Trump tries to minimize stinging defeat It didn\u2019t work. Turnout in rural counties in Alabama didn\u2019t match the booming numbers in the Democratic enclaves of the state. (More on that later.) In a state where Trump won massively just more than a year ago, his approval rating was a so-so 48% approve and 48% disapprove, according to exit polls. There\u2019s no doubt that Trump\u2019s involvement on Moore\u2019s behalf \u2013 against the wishes of a large chunk of the Senate Republicans \u2013 was largely driven by a belief that the two men were kindred spirits. Both, in Trump\u2019s mind, faced unfair sexual allegations. Both made a career out of fighting the GOP establishment. Both were warriors against political correctness. But, Roy Moore, the Donald Trump of Alabama, lost on Tuesday night. And that means Donald Trump lost too. What it doesn\u2019t mean is that Trump will moderate his behavior in any meaningful way.  Usually, when faced with a loss, Trump doubles down and insists that somehow, someway he won. This is not a man who will admit defeat even when it\u2019s staring him in the face as it is in Alabama. Make no mistake: Mitch McConnell did not want Roy Moore in the Senate. McConnell \u2013 and the rest of the GOP leadership \u2013 did everything they could to get rid of Moore. When it became clear Moore wasn\u2019t going to leave the race \u2013 and Trump started to weigh in for the embattled GOP nominee \u2013 McConnell threw his hands up and said it was up to the voters of Alabama to decide the race. McConnell\u2019s unwillingness on Tuesday to even engage the prospect of what he would do if Moore won spoke to just how little the majority leader wanted Moore in the Senate. There\u2019s no question that McConnell took a big sigh of relief when Jones was declared the winner just before 10:30 p.m. ET. In his mind, the Moore loss is short-term pain (the GOP margin shrinks to a single seat) for the long term gain (the GOP brand doesn\u2019t have to be associated with an accused child molester for the next few years.) At issue for McConnell is that the forces at work in the Alabama race suggest that his plans to expand the GOP Senate majority in 2018 may be in trouble. If the Democratic base is anywhere near as fired up in the 2018 midterm as they were in Alabama on Tuesday, the GOP Senate map starts to look a lot less friendly. And that\u2019s even before you consider the likely McConnell versus Steve Bannon primary fights to come in states like Arizona and Nevada. For Jones to even have a chance to win, the core pillars of the Democratic base in Alabama \u2013 especially African American voters \u2013 had to turn out in presidential election-like numbers. No one thought that was possible \u2013 until it happened. Black voters comprised 29% of the Alabama electorate on Tuesday and went for Jones by 92 points, according to exit polling. In 2012, African Americans made up 28% of voters and Barack Obama won them by 91 points. Black voters turned out for Jones That\u2019s stunning. Jones matched the performance of the first black president in history among black voters. There were, of course, extenuating circumstances. Moore was long seen as the Alabama Democratic base as enemy #1 \u2013 due not only to his controversial statements on race, gender and homosexuality, but also because of his long record in the state as a lightning rod for conservative causes. Not every state, in short, has a Roy Moore. But, this race became about more than Moore by the end of it. Due to Trump\u2019s involvement in the final days, it became a way for Democratic partisans to send a massive message \u2013 and warning \u2013 to the President. That message? If we can beat you here, we can beat you anywhere. And, they delivered it. If you are a Republican running for office in any corner of the country, the results in Alabama should scare you. If they don\u2019t, you aren\u2019t paying attention. Moore is, was and always will be a deeply flawed candidate. Even before the allegations of sexual impropriety arose, Moore had a history of underperforming other Republican office holders on the ballot. Yes, he had his core base of 35% or so who would never leave him no matter what he said or what people said about him. And, in a Republican primary, that was enough. But Moore showed zero inclination or ability to ever expand beyond that hardcore base. His candidacy felt more geared toward the 1950s than 2017. Alabama race: Exit poll updates Meanwhile, Jones avoided being labeled a national Democrat and did everything he could to make the race about values \u2013 and who better shared the values of the average Alabama voter. He didn\u2019t spend tons of time talking about abortion or guns. He talked about the economy and about how Moore let his own personal ideology get in the way of doing what was right for the state. The lesson: Even in a state as red as Alabama, you can\u2019t nominate a massively flawed candidate and just expect the partisanship of the electorate to deliver a win for you. Particularly when the other side nominated a credible alternative. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe summed that idea up nicely on Twitter. \u201cYes, Moore was unmoored,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBut Doug Jones and his team executed one of the best campaigns in years. Much to study and learn from, both turnout and persuasion.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is widely seen as a prospect for the 2020 race Gillibrand's aides say there was no political calculation behind her moves When Democrats have faced uncomfortable questions about their own bad actors, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has now twice answered first. The New York senator\u2019s Facebook post Wednesday calling on Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota to resign in the wake of sexual assault allegations led to dozens more party leaders issuing the same call within hours. It came weeks after she\u2019d made headlines when asked about Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual misconduct. Gillibrand said that \u2013 if that misconduct happened today \u2013 she\u2019d want Clinton to resign the presidency. Democratic senators to Al Franken: Resign Widely seen as a prospect for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Gillibrand\u2019s moves against leading figures in her own party have positioned her to turn her focus to Republicans and make an aggressive case against Trump. The short version: At the same time Gillibrand led the charge against sexual misconduct in her own party, Trump \u2013 accused of sexual assault himself \u2013 endorsed Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate facing allegations that he pursued sexual relationships with teenage girls while in his 30s. Gillibrand\u2019s aides insist there was no political calculation behind her moves. Instead they see the continuation of her years-long efforts to combat sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. Still, they believe that Gillibrand\u2019s moves allowed Democrats to move past questions about party members\u2019 own behavior \u2013 shifting the focus back to Trump. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t about 2020,\u201d said one Democratic strategist who has worked for Gillibrand, who asked for anonymity to speak frankly. \u201cIt\u2019s about, we have a sexual assaulter in the White House. And how do we do something about that? How is that OK? How did that become acceptable? It cannot become acceptable.\u201d In her Facebook post, Gillibrand cast Trump\u2019s election as the catalyst for the societal change in how Americans view sexual assault allegations. \u201cIn the wake of the election of President Trump, in just the last few months, our society is changing, and I encourage women and men to keep speaking up to continue this progress. At this moment, we need to speak hard truths or lose our chance to make lasting change,\u201d she wrote. 'Nothing about it felt right': More than 50 people describe sexual harassment on Capitol Hill But her posture \u2013 particularly toward Clinton \u2013 has led to a round of questions about why she didn\u2019t criticize the former president before Hillary Clinton (who Gillibrand replaced in the Senate in 2009) had lost and the family had faded from the Democratic political scene. Longtime Hillary Clinton aide Philippe Reines tweeted, in response to Gillibrand\u2019s comments, that she \u201ctook the Clintons\u2019 endorsements, money, and seat. Hypocrite.\u201d \u201cInteresting strategy for 2020 primaries,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBest of luck.\u201d Gillibrand called that criticism \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d in an interview with MSNBC last month. \u201cBill Clinton did very important things for this country, but my point is about this conversation that we\u2019re having today. We need to have highest standards for elected leaders, and we have to change what\u2019s happening throughout society and we have to allow people to tell their stories, that\u2019s what this is all about,\u201d she said. It was far from the first time Gillibrand angered members of her own party over her approach to sexual assault and other issues important to women. Gillibrand feuded in 2013 with  Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, then the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, over military sexual assault. Levin wanted the Defense Department to keep its existing system for prosecuting sexual assault cases; Gillibrand pushed for major reforms. She later sought legislation focused on campus sexual assault and is now pursuing legislative changes to how sexual assault and harassment is handled by members of Congress and their staffs. Those efforts have gotten attention outside the political sphere. Gillibrand, more than most politicians, speaks frequently to magazines and websites that cover issues important to women and this year, in particular, regularly sits for podcast interviews. Gillibrand launched her \u201cOff the Sidelines\u201d political action committee to back women candidates for office, and made waves when she endorsed an abortion-rights-supporting female primary challenger to Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois, who opposes abortion rights. \u201cYou all have no idea how many chits that earned Gillibrand in Illinois. We\u2019re not only a big donor state for 2020, but we have lots of delegates and we send more volunteers to Iowa than any other state,\u201d tweeted veteran Illinois Democratic strategist Tom Bowen. \u201cSmart, smart move.\u201d Now that Franken is sidelined, the Democratic strategist who worked for Gillibrand said Trump \u201cshould be very, very concerned here.\u201d \u201cIt should be quite the contrast for the media to take note of and for the American people, for voters, to know that Al Franken resigned and Roy Moore could be sitting in the chamber,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what Donald Trump seems to want.\u201d",

Trent Franks announced in a statement Thursday night he will resign from Congress at the end of January, after the House Ethics Committee said it would investigate allegations against him of sexual harassment. The House Ethics Committee announced earlier Thursday that it will investigate Franks to determine if he engaged in \u201cconduct that constitutes sexual harassment and/or retaliation for opposing sexual harassment.\u201d In his statement, Franks acknowledged he made staffers \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and that he discussed fertility issues and surrogacy with two female staffers, but denied having ever \u201cphysically intimidated, coerced, or had, or attempted to have, any sexual contact with any member of my congressional staff.\u201d READ: Rep. Trent Franks statement on leaving Congress \u201cBut in the midst of this current cultural and media climate, I am deeply convinced I would be unable to complete a fair House Ethics investigation before distorted and sensationalized versions of this story would put me, my family, my staff, and my noble colleagues in the House of Representatives through hyperbolized public excoriation,\u201d Franks said in his statement. \u201cRather than allow a sensationalized trial by media damage those things I love most, this morning I notified House leadership that I will be leaving Congress as of January 31st, 2018.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s office released a statement saying that Ryan was briefed on \u201ccredible claims of misconduct\u201d last week and that Franks did not deny the allegations when he was confronted with them. The Wisconsin Republican said he accepted the letter of resignation Thursday. Franks\u2019 resignation would create a vacancy in Arizona at the end of January, which per Arizona law, would mean Republican Gov. Doug Ducey would have to call an election with a primary in late April or early May and a late June date for the general election. Franks\u2019 announcement came hours after Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, announced he would step down in the wake of allegations about inappropriately touching women and two days after Michigan Democratic Rep. John Conyers announced he was resigning as allegations about his past sexual misconduct increased. READ: Rep. Trent Franks statement on leaving Congress Franks, an eight-term congressman, is the first Republican to announce his resignation since the nationwide reckoning over sexual harassment and assault began this fall. On Thursday evening, a group of conservative House Republicans gathered around Franks on the floor and prayed with him. Franks, a self-styled \u201cconservative, Reagan Republican,\u201d joined Congress in the early 2000s and has hewed conservative on a range of issues in his time there, with a particular focus on anti-abortion issues. Until his statement on Thursday, Franks appeared to be headed for re-election, and according to the Federal Election Commission, he raised more than $100,000 through the end of September for the 2018 cycle. Franks\u2019 northwest Phoenix suburb is reliably Republican, having gone to Trump and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, both of whom won the district by more than 20 percentage points, and Franks easily won re-election last year. \u201cCongress should be held to the highest ethical standard,\u201d said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers. \u201cTrent Franks did the right thing in stepping aside.\u201d He supported President Donald Trump last year, even in the wake of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, by saying Trump\u2019s words, while bad, did not compare to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s support of abortion rights. Franks was involved in Trump\u2019s efforts to oust Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake before Flake announced his retirement. Franks, state Treasurer Jeff DeWit and former state GOP Chairman Robert Graham huddled privately backstage with Trump before the President\u2019s raucous Phoenix rally earlier this year. Franks sits on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Armed Services Committee. Franks drew national ire in 2013 when he said, \u201cIncidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low\u201d \u2013 a remark he later said was taken out of context. This story has updated and will continue to update with additional developments. CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner, Phil Mattingly and Adam Levy contributed to this report.",

Janet Porter's full interview with Anderson Cooper Defending Moore, Porter compared the claims that women have made against him to the Duke Lacrosse rape case, in which three members of the Duke University men\u2019s lacrosse team were falsely accused of sexually assaulting an exotic dancer at a party in March 2006. \u201cFirst off, when we talk about believing the women, I would ask the question of maybe some lacrosse players at Duke University, ask them if they believe every woman who makes an accusation,\u201d Porter said. \u201cIf we did a lynch mob media against innocent people as we did with lacrosse, there would be some lacrosse players in jail right now.\u201d Moore faces Democratic opponent Doug Jones in the December 12 special election in the deep red state. Jones is bidding to become the first Democrat to win a Senate race in Alabama in 25 years. The Roy Moore scandal: Follow the latest Porter continued to argue that the Democratic establishment, the far-left media, the pro-abortion lobby and George Soros were to blame for the accusations. \u201cCan you just explain to me how all these people got together and came up with this plot against Roy Moore?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cWhen you have false allegations that are generated by \u2018The Washington Post\u2019 there tends to be a pile on,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThat\u2019s how a lynch mob works.\u201d \"You can repeat allegations over and over again, but it doesn't make them true,\" says Janet Porter, Roy Moore campaign spokeswoman https://t.co/5BF7d8HDR9 Asked if she had any evidence to support her claim, she doubled down, saying, \u201cwhat the establishment does is make false allegations.\u201d In a discussion about about Moore\u2019s past positions and statements, Porter appeared unable to answer Cooper\u2019s questions. \u201cDoes judge Moore still believe that homosexual conduct should be illegal and homosexuality is still the same thing as beastiality?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question,\u201d she replied. \u201cI can tell you what he does believe regarding that issue. If you want to talk about making sure we don\u2019t have sexual predators.\u201d Cooper pushed back, \u201cCan you get back to me on whether or not he believes homosexuality should be illegal?\u201d \u201cI believe that he believes the Bible and what the Bible has to say,\u201d Porter said. \u201cDoes he still believe that 9/11 may have happened because, \u2018we distanced ourselves from God\u2019?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cA lot of people talk about God and how they\u2019re Christians,\u201d Porter replied. \u201cIn fact if you look at the commercials of Roy Moore\u2019s opponent, he\u2019s telling everybody what a great Christian and he is and how he defends the Second Amendment.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know the answer about 9/11 either?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer about 9/11, no,\u201d Porter said. \u201cDoes he still believe an American citizen who\u2019s a Muslim should not be able to serve in Congress? \u201cI think that what he\u2019s getting at there is we believe in the rule of law by the Constitution, not Sharia law,\u201d she said. Cooper cited Moore\u2019s past statement, in which he said, he believed that Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison should not be allow to swear on the Quran. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the answer to that either, whether he still believes that?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cI believe his position has to do whether we follow the Constitution or the ridiculously oppressive to women Sharia law,\u201d Porter replied. \u201cI get you don\u2019t want to answer these questions and that\u2019s cool, but I\u2019d rather you just say I\u2019d rather not answer them rather than just ignore them,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019m answering them,\u201d Porter replied. \u201cHe picks the Constitution over Sharia law and the people of Alabama agree.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It's one of the least understood political trends of the Trump era There's a wide divide in the views of white-collar and blue-collar white women If Republican Roy Moore wins next week\u2019s Senate special election in Alabama, it will be largely because of his support among women. More specifically, Moore\u2019s ability to survive the allegations of sexually pursuing young girls, which have rocked his campaign, will likely turn on whether he can maintain his pre-scandal advantage among white women without a college education \u2013 even as their college-educated counterparts have moved toward Democrat Doug Jones in much bigger numbers than usual for deeply conservative Alabama, according to public and private polling in the race. With that contrast, the Alabama race is illuminating one of the least understood political trends of the Donald Trump era. Many commentators have warned that Republicans face a systemic problem with female voters under Trump \u2013 and could see that difficulty deepen if Moore wins and is seated in the Senate. But that conclusion is far too sweeping. Rather than a monolithic response, the Trump era instead is widening the divide between the political preferences of white-collar and blue-collar white women. The much-touted gender gap hasn\u2019t disappeared. Whether looking at whites, blacks or Hispanics, Democrats consistently run better among women than men (or from the other angle, Republicans run better among men than women). But in the Trump era, the class divide looks more powerful than the gender divide, especially among whites. In the 2016 presidential race, Trump ran much better among white women without a college education than those with an advanced degree. In fact, the gap between the two groups was by far the widest recorded in exit polls since at least the presidential race of 1980. Likewise, in last month\u2019s Virginia governor\u2019s race, as white-collar white women broke toward Democrat Ralph Northam, the winner, and blue-collar white women held for Republican Ed Gillespie, the two groups diverged even more than they did during the Trump-Hillary Clinton race in the state a year earlier. And both parties are bracing for another sharp divergence between white- and blue-collar women in Alabama next week. \u201cThe class division is a much larger one [than the gender divide] and certainly the results in Virginia show that,\u201d says Gene Ulm, who polled for Gillespie. \u201cGender is simplifying things to a degree that doesn\u2019t explain a whole lot.\u201d Looking forward to the 2018 congressional races, all signs point to a sharp backlash against the GOP among well-educated white women, who express extreme distaste for Trump in polls and are being further energized by the surge in high-profile sexual harassment cases. That shift, combined with a more modest but still measurable pullback from Trump among college-educated white men, illuminates a clear pathway of opportunity for Democrats in affluent suburban House districts from New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania through Virginia, Illinois, Minnesota, Colorado, Texas and California. Trump calls Roy Moore to offer his endorsement But with blue-collar white men remaining firmly behind Trump and the GOP, the Democrats won\u2019t flip many working-class and non-urban districts unless they can convert more working-class white women. Without at least some breakthroughs in such blue-collar districts, Democrats will face a very narrow pathway toward recapturing the House, which has been under Republican control since 2011. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to reach those non-Democratic women,\u201d says Margie Omero, a Democratic pollster who has extensively researched the largely blue-collar \u201cWalmart moms.\u201d Despite broad generalizations about the gender gap, Republicans have consistently run more strongly among white women without degrees than their counterparts with advanced education. Historically, fewer blue- than white-collar women have been moved by Democratic arguments on social issues \u2013 either because they take more conservative positions on questions such as abortion or don\u2019t prioritize those concerns as much. Conversely, blue-collar white women, who generally are among the most economically strained groups in the electorate, have also been more receptive than their white-collar counterparts to Republican arguments for cutting taxes and federal spending. President Barack Obama carried only about two-fifths of non-college white women in each of his two victories, and those women gave the GOP huge margins during its midterm landslides in 2010 and 2014. But while the disparity between blue- and white-collar women is long-standing, the Trump-Clinton struggle raised it to a new height. Trump carried just 44% of college-educated white women, according to exit polls. That tied George W. Bush in 2000 for the weakest performance with those women of any Republican presidential nominee since 1980 \u2013 except for the 1992 and 1996 races, when a significant number of them broke for the third party candidate Ross Perot. GOP tax plans could fuel the suburban revolt against Trump And yet Trump, running against the first female major-party nominee, stunned observers by solidly defeating Clinton among white women overall. He did that by winning fully 61% of white women without a degree \u2013 more than any candidate in either party since 1980 except for President Ronald Reagan during his 1984 landslide, according to the exit polls. The result was that Trump ran fully 17 points better among white women without a degree than those with one. Since 1980, the largest previous gap had been in 2008, when John McCain ran 11 points better among non-college than college-educated white women. The widening class gap among white women tracked a parallel divergence among white men. Trump ran 18 points better among white men without a college degree than with those holding advanced education. Before Trump, no Republican since 1980 had run more than six points better among non- than college-educated white men. Put another way, in the 2016 race, the class gap between whites of the same gender was much larger than the gender gap between whites of the same class. The same pattern shaped the high-profile Virginia governor\u2019s race. Northam was lifted by a surge among white women with college degrees: he carried 58% of them, up significantly from Clinton\u2019s 50% in Virginia. Northam also registered a six-point gain compared to Clinton among college-educated white men. But relative to Clinton the exit polls showed Northam gaining only three percentage points among both blue-collar white women and men. In contrast to the sharp upscale shift toward the Democrat, Gillespie carried fully two-thirds of white women without a degree. That was a staggering 25 points better than his showing (42%) among the college white women. Since taking office, Trump has clearly lost some ground with blue-collar white women, who grew highly resistant to his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. His approval rating among non-college-educated white women in the most recent ABC/Washington Post national poll stood at just 46%, and in a recent national Quinnipiac Poll only 54% said they believed Trump is fit to serve as president. The clock is ticking for Republicans But Northam\u2019s weak showing in Virginia showed how many cultural and economic barriers still prevent that unease from translating into Democratic votes. Next week\u2019s Alabama race could reinforce that message. The Washington Post/Schar School poll released Saturday that showed Jones narrowly ahead with likely voters found the Democrat opening up a 15-point advantage among college-educated white women. But despite the allegations battering Moore, the survey found him still leading by about 35 points among white women without a degree. That leaves Jones with very little margin for error, because Moore in the poll holds a 20-point lead among college-educated white men and a nearly 50-point advantage among white men without degrees. Private polling in the state has found the same pattern, though generally with Moore slightly ahead depending on turnout projections. The Alabama race suggests the heightened focus on sexual misbehavior could widen the partisan divide between white- and blue-collar white women. Generally, polls, such as the recent ABC/Washington Post survey, show that roughly the same percentage (just over one-third) of white women with and without a degree report unwanted sexual advances at work. (For non-white women the number was lower, about one-fourth.) The intensified attention to the problem appears to be further energizing the upscale women already deeply alienated from Trump. (In the Quinnipiac Poll over three-fifths of college-educated white women said he wasn\u2019t fit to be president and two-thirds said he doesn\u2019t respect women as much as men.) But it may not be as mobilizing an issue for the blue-collar women, particularly since the highest-profile cases have focused largely on media and entertainment figures. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be incumbent on everyone talking about this to make sure we are not just talking about harassment of privileged women and famous jobs,\u201d says Omero. \u201cAnd that we are not just talking about harassment period, but all of the ways that women need more equal opportunity.\u201d Donald Trump was the big loser in Virginia Similarly, one Democrat closely watching the Alabama race says the allegations against Moore haven\u2019t dislodged more blue-collar women because so many of them consider various forms of harassment an inescapable part of their working life. \u201cQuite frankly, the power structure is so different than from what suburban housewives have to deal with,\u201d said the Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter that some of these non-college-educated white women don\u2019t think Moore did this, but there is a big part of them that don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal compared to what they deal with.\u201d With Trump in the White House and Moore potentially in the Senate, Republicans could be facing a stampede toward the Democrats among well-educated white women next year. That alone would power measurable gains. But if Democrats can\u2019t also convince more blue-collar white women to join the charge, the party may still fall short in its bid to recapture the House or Senate",

            "article_content": "Moore is perhaps best known for his strident opposition to LGBT rights and Islam Here are four things to know about Moore's history of controversy-making actions and remarks Roy Moore\u2019s Senate campaign has been damaged by accusations of sexual assault and that he pursued relationships with teenage girls while in his 30s. Those allegations have turned the December 12 special election in the reliably Republican Alabama into a close contest between Moore and Democratic nominee Doug Jones. But Moore was already a controversial figure \u2013 beloved by some evangelical Christians in Alabama, but seen as toxic to the Republican brand by national party figures. Bannon to campaign with Roy Moore next week While the accusations have placed him in the national political spotlight, the 70-year-old Moore has been engulfed in controversy through much of a two-decade stretch that began when he became Alabama\u2019s chief justice in 2001. Moore is perhaps best known for his strident opposition to LGBT rights and Islam and embrace of Christian theocratic principles. Here are four things to know about Moore\u2019s history of controversy-making actions and remarks: Moore was more than two years into his first tenure as Alabama chief justice when he was kicked off the state Supreme Court in November 2003. The reason: He refused to obey federal and state court orders to remove a 5,280-pound stone monument of the Ten Commandments. After running a foundation and a failed run for governor, Moore launched a campaign for his old job and was elected chief justice again in 2012. But he was removed again in 2016 after telling probate judges not to follow the US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. Roy Moore's Alabama court ouster rooted in credibility questions The Alabama Court of the Judiciary, a special Alabama court that removed Moore as chief justice, reached the unanimous view that he had not been \u201ccredible\u201d when he denied attempting to contravene a Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriages. The court focused on Moore\u2019s \u201cmisleading\u201d statements. It said Moore\u2019s 2016 assertion \u201cthat his actions and words mean something other than what they clearly express is not a new strategy.\u201d Moore declared at the time that the complaint against him that led to his ouster was \u201ca politically motivated effort by radical homosexual and transgender groups to remove me as chief justice of the Supreme Court because of outspoken opposition to their immoral agenda.\u201d Moore\u2019s anti-LGBT stances extend far beyond his opposition to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. In 2005, Moore said in a radio interview that \u201chomosexual conduct should be illegal\u201d and that homosexuality is \u201cthe same thing\u201d as bestiality. Moore made similar comments in a 2015 video posted on YouTube by user Lone Star Q. In the video, Moore was asked, \u201cDo you still think that homosexuality should be illegal?\u201d \u201cI think homosexuality should be illegal,\u201d Moore said. In 1997, Moore \u2013 then a circuit judge \u2013 was removed from a case after he ruled that a woman who had a lesbian affair couldn\u2019t visit her children unsupervised or with her partner, writing that the \u201cminor children will be detrimentally affected by the present lifestyle\u201d of the mother. Roy Moore compares accusations against him to Russia probe \u201cThe court strongly feels that the minor children will be detrimentally affected by the present lifestyle of (Borden) who has engaged in a homosexual relationship during her marriage, forbidden both by the laws of the State of Alabama and the Laws of Nature,\u201d Moore wrote in his ruling. In 2006, Moore called the appointment of an \u201cadmitted homosexual\u201d to an ambassadorship an \u201copen affront to Christian principles.\u201d Moore has repeatedly appeared on a radio program hosted by a controversial pastor who has preached the death penalty for homosexuality. On his Facebook page in July 2015, Moore shared an article praising Russia\u2019s anti-gay laws. More recently, he has made opposition to transgender rights the central talking point of his campaign speeches. \u201cI oppose transgender rights. There is no right to believe you\u2019re a person of the opposite sex or opposite gender,\u201d Moore said at a campaign event Monday night. Moore is a staunch evangelical Christian whose calls for a more direct role for Christianity in American society is at the core of his political identity. Prayers \u2013 both before and after Moore speaks \u2013 are a staple of every campaign event. His support base is made of evangelical Christians. In a February speech at the Open Door Baptist Church, Moore suggested that the September 11, 2001, terror attacks happened because the United States had distanced itself from God. \u201cBecause you have despised His word and trust in perverseness and oppression, and say thereon \u2026 therefore this iniquity will be to you as a breach ready to fall, swell out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instance,\u2019\u201d Moore said, quoting Isaiah 30:12-13. Then he added: \u201cSounds a little bit like the Pentagon, whose breaking came suddenly at an instance, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Where Doug Jones stands on the issues Moore continued, \u201cIf you think that\u2019s coincidence, if you go to verse 25, \u2018there should be up on every high mountain and upon every hill rivers and streams of water in the day of the great slaughter when the towers will fall.\u2019 You know, we\u2019ve suffered a lot in this country, maybe, just maybe, because we\u2019ve distanced ourselves from the one that has it within his hands to heal this land.\u201d Later in the same speech, Moore suggested God was upset at the United States because \u201cwe legitimize sodomy\u201d and \u201clegitimize abortion.\u201d On the eve of Alabama\u2019s Senate Republican primary in September, Moore \u2013 chatting with reporters from CNN, Vox and The Washington Post \u2013 pulled laminated pages from Joseph Story\u2019s 1833 \u201cCommentaries on the Constitution\u201d from his briefcase and discussed the government\u2019s \u201cduty to foster religion and foster Christianity.\u201d \u201cHe said at the time of the adoption of the Constitution that \u2018it was the general, if not the universal, sentiment in America that Christianity ought to be favored by the state so far as was not incompatible with the private rights of conscience.\u2019\u201d In 2009 remarks to a socially conservative organization, Moore said that \u201cthe only thing I know that the Islamic faith has done in this country is 9/11.\u201d It was just one in a long line of anti-Islam comments Moore has made. In 2006, Moore wrote in an op-ed on the far-right website World Net Daily that then-Rep.-elect Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and the first Muslim ever elected to Congress, shouldn\u2019t be allowed to take office. In 2015, Moore\u2019s Facebook page shared a Franklin Graham call to stop all Muslims from coming to the United States. Moore has offered no indication that his anti-Islam beliefs have changed. In the September conversation with three reporters on the eve of the primary, Moore falsely claimed that jurisdictions in Illinois and Indiana were being governed with Sharia law. \u201cThere are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. Christian communities; I don\u2019t know if they may be Muslim communities,\u201d Moore said. Asked which communities are under Sharia law, he said: \u201cWell, there\u2019s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana \u2013 up there. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Pressed again by Vox\u2019s Jeff Stein, Moore said: \u201cI was informed that there were. But if they\u2019re not, it doesn\u2019t matter. Sharia law incorporates Muslim law into the law. That\u2019s not what we do. We do not punish people according to the Christian precepts of our faith \u2013 so there\u2019s a difference. I\u2019ll just say: I don\u2019t know if there are. I understand that there are some.\u201d There are no known instances of American laws being codified explicitly according to Sharia principles. Though because Sharia is widely understood to contain prohibitions on acts like theft and murder, it is true that some of its principles are present in many existing American laws.",

            "article_content": "House Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to win back the majority Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, pointed to \"record-breaking\" fundraising A top House Democratic leader predicted Wednesday his party would regain control of the US House of Representatives in the midterm elections, but said now is not the time for members of his party to push impeachment. \u201cI think we are going to win the House back in 2018,\u201d Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second ranking Democratic leader in the House, told a group of reporters in his Capitol Hill office. \u201cThere is a strong momentum, a lot of grassroots energy.\u201d As more House Democrats publicly came out in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump this week, Hoyer said reversing the 2016 election result shouldn\u2019t be a focus for his party now. \u201cThat should not be overturned except for the most egregious and demonstrable facts and both Leader Pelosi and I believe it is not timely to address that issue given what is in front of us.\u201d Hoyer also broke with those progressive groups who want litmus tests for candidates on issues like abortion and single-payer health care proposals, saying he and Pelosi oppose that standard. \u201cThe litmus test is whether you want to be for working people,\u201d he said. The Maryland Democrat pointed to \u201crecord breaking\u201d fundraising by the House Democrats\u2019 campaign committee this cycle, even though Republicans control both chambers of Congress.  He said that another positive indication for his party was that three times as many Democrats have raised over $100,000 at this time in the election cycle as did in 2016. Maxine Waters: 'Take Trump out' remark was about impeachment \u201cDemocrats all over the country believe we can win,\u201d Hoyer, who frequently travels and fundraises for candidates, asserted, putting the number of districts in play at 91. House Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to win back the majority. After Democrats won statewide and local contests in Virginia last week House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said \u201cthe door is certainly open for us\u201d in terms of regaining the majority next fall. She pointed out that Trump\u2019s approval rating, now around 38%, is the same as then-President George W. Bush\u2019s favorability rating prior to the 2006 midterms. Hoyer also noted Wednesday that Trump\u2019s approval rating with voters is a factor in the current political landscape: \u201cWe believe that independents are much more inclined in this election to vote for the Democratic alternative because of their disappointment with Trump, to that extent I think Trump will play a role.\u201d But he emphasized that congressional Democrats and challengers are training their message on economic issues and explaining what their policy proposals would do for voters. Jesse Hunt, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, mocked the latest midterm prediction in a written statement to CNN: \u201cNancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer are two of the worst political prognosticators in America. They\u2019ve made this same claim for the last three cycles only to fail and have members of their own party call for their ouster from House Democratic leadership.\u201d",

In his 2009 memoir \u201cSo Help Me God: The Ten Commandments, Judicial Tyranny, and the Battle for Religious Freedom,\u201d Roy Moore wrote about the first time he saw his future wife. \u201cI knew Kayla was going to a special person in my life,\u201d Moore wrote. Can Sessions actually run for his old Senate seat? In his memoir, he recalled first seeing her \u201cmany years ago\u201d at a dance recital at a nearby college in Alabama. He wrote he never forgot her, even when he saw her again years later. It\u2019s unclear what age Kayla Moore was when he first saw her at the dance recital, but they began dating when she was 23, a year before they married, according to the memoir. \u201cAnxious to meet her, I began with the line, \u2018Haven\u2019t we met somewhere before?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 she replied,\u201d he said, recalling the moment they met at a church Christmas party. Moore was 38 when he married then-24-year-old Kayla Kisor, who changed her last name to Moore after the marriage. She was in the same graduating class in high school as Nelson, according to AL.com. Kayla Moore was divorced with a child when she married Roy Moore. She is now the president of the nonprofit he started after he was removed from the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003 for publicly displaying the Ten Commandments. The Foundation for Moral Law, based in Montgomery, Alabama, offers legal help to support conservative Christian issues. While she hasn\u2019t done many interviews, she did tell Breitbart News a few days ago that the accusations against her husband \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cugly.\u201d \u201cYou know we met at a Bible study \u2013 that\u2019s where we met,\u201d she told Brietbart, although Moore\u2019s memoir said it was at a Christmas party. \u201cWe raised our children at in Bible-focused Christian home. You know, it\u2019s just not true \u2013 any of it.\u201d Although her husband has always been in the political spotlight, Kayla Moore has engaged in politics on her own as well. In the 2016 election, she endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz for his conservative beliefs on government, marriage and abortion. She also stood next to Moore when he announced he was running for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions after he was appointed US attorney general. If there\u2019s anything that sums up Kayla Moore\u2019s efforts to defend her husband, it\u2019s her recent Facebook post. She shared a story from a local TV station that tried to disprove recent reporting that Roy Moore was banned from the local Alabama mall over his alleged attraction to teenagers. \u201cWould have been nice if the press would find out the truth first before they run with gossip,\u201d she wrote in the post.

            "article_content": "Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine called on his party to eliminate superdelegates Sen. Robert Menendez said Sen. Cory Booker could serve 'in the highest office' Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand \u2014 who holds what was once Hillary Clinton\u2019s seat \u2014 just placed herself at the forefront of a Democratic re-evaluation of Bill Clinton\u2019s legacy. Asked by The New York Times whether Clinton should have resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations during his time in the Oval Office, Gillibrand said, \u201cYes, I think that is the appropriate response.\u201d An aide clarified to the newspaper that Gillibrand had meant Clinton would need to resign if his inappropriate relationship with an intern had happened in the current era. \u201cThings have changed today, and I think under those circumstances there should be a very different reaction,\u201d Gillibrand told the newspaper. \u201cAnd I think in light of this conversation, we should have a very different conversation about President Trump, and a very different conversation about allegations against him.\u201d Predictably, Clinton world was furious. \u201cOver 20 (years) you took the Clintons\u2019 endorsements, money, and seat. Hypocrite,\u201d tweeted Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide. \u201cInteresting strategy for the 2020 primaries. Best of luck.\u201d The comments from Gillibrand, who has been a leading Senate voice on the issues of sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, put her at the forefront of what could reflect a major shift in how Bill Clinton is ultimately viewed. It comes in the context of a cultural sea change in attitudes toward sexual harassment and assault, in which women\u2019s credible claims are more often being taken seriously and treated with zero tolerance. It started with film mogul and Democratic mega-donor Harvey Weinstein and moved on to actors Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K., then Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore and Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken. The moment has also opened the door for a re-examination of the sexual assault claims against President Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. That conversation had already started among some progressives, and Gillibrand just put it on the table for the entire party and for the 2020 race. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a conversation for society and the Democratic Party for months and years to come, I think,\u201d former Barack Obama aide Dan Pfeiffer said on the \u201cPod Save America\u201d podcast Thursday. KAINE: ELIMINATE SUPERDELEGATES: The 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, sided with Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and called on the party to eliminate superdelegates. \u201cThese positions are given undue influence in the popular nominating contest and make the process less democratic,\u201d Kaine, a superdelegate himself, wrote in a letter this week to Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez. The DNC\u2019s Unity Reform Commission is currently considering proposals to reduce the number of superdelegates. AN ENDORSEMENT BOOKER WON\u2019T WANT: New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, celebrating the mistrial in his corruption case Wednesday, praised home-state Sen. Cory Booker for backing him and then delivered a 2020 endorsement Booker might not want: \u201cHe\u2019s a public servant with an unlimited potential who can easily serve our country in the highest office in the land,\u201d Mendendez said. \u2014 Booker will speak at the Victory Institute\u2019s three-day LGBTQ leadership conference in Washington next month. The event, which more than 500 LGBTQ elected officials and advocates will attend, is December 6-9. MCAULIFFE TO HELP THE DNC: Outgoing Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is hosting the DNC\u2019s year-end fund-raising reception \u2014 making him one of the only 2020 prospects willing to raise money for a party organization that has lagged far behind Republicans in fund-raising. It\u2019s also one of the first moves beyond the Virginia governor\u2019s office that McAuliffe will have made after Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s big win there last week. Politico\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti has more details. BIDEN ON 2020: \u2018WHO KNOWS\u2019: Former Vice President Joe Biden didn\u2019t rule out a 2020 presidential run as he kicked off his book tour this week. \u201cI\u2019m a great respecter of fate \u2026 but who knows what the situation is going to be a year and a half from now. I don\u2019t have any idea. I\u2019m in good health now. I\u2019m in good shape, knock on wood, as my mother would say. But I just, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d \u2014 Is Biden too old to run for president? He\u2019s 74 and would be 77 on Election Day 2020, and in his 80s his entire second term, if he wins and is re-elected. The Washington Post\u2019s Paul Kane made an interesting point in a recent chat with CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza: \u201cThe distance from 74 to 86 is big for any human, let alone one that would spend eight years of that span in the toughest job in the world,\u201d Kane said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched, up close, as a number of senators who were incredibly sharp and energetic in their mid-70s turn very slow and plodding by their early 80s. We have to think, as a society, whether we want the leader of the free world to be challenging Father Time.\u201d \u2014 An interesting comment from Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, a 2020 prospect and lock for vice presidential short lists himself, on Biden: \u201cI love Joe Biden; he has been a mentor to me and he is someone I was supporting in the primary before he decided not to run in last year\u2019s election,\u201d Moulton said. \u201cBut I am someone who is actively recruiting a new generation of Democratic leaders. I\u2019ve got 12 veterans right now that I have endorsed in key swing districts all across the country who are the kind of inspiring leaders I think we need to take the country forward.\u201d \u2014 Vice\u2019s Eve Peyser throws cold water on the idea Biden could win a Democratic primary, pointing out \u2014 among other things \u2014 his role in the Anita Hill sexual harassment hearing in 1991, his involvement passing a 1994 crime bill, his anti-populist trade stance and some potentially controversial abortion positions. \u2014 Friday, November 17 \u2014 Joe Biden\u2019s book tour swings through Washington with an 8 p.m. ET event at the Warner Theatre. \u2014 Friday, November 17 \u2014 Reps.

            "article_content": "Democrats and allied liberal groups are on the defensive \u2013 and cautiously weighing their next steps \u2013 amid revelations of sexual harassment and assault by Minnesota Sen. Al Franken. On Thursday morning, the broadcaster and former model Leeann Tweeden said in an account posted to the 790 KABC website that Franken had forcibly kissed and later groped her, while she was asleep, during a USO Tour overseas in 2006. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. He groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep,\u201d Tweeden wrote. \u201cI felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated.\u201d The story included an image that shows Franken reaching for Tweeden\u2019s breasts as she slept, wearing a flak vest and Kevlar helmet. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t remember the rehearsal for the skit (in which Tweeden said Franken kissed her) in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,\u201d Franken said on Thursday, before releasing a longer statement. \u201cAs to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn\u2019t. I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d News of the report was jarring to progressive groups who count Franken, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star and bestselling author, as one of their most popular draws and a potential presidential or vice presidential candidate in 2020. He was applauded by liberals during the Trump administration\u2019s confirmation hearings for taking a harder line than some of his colleagues with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. The revelations also diverted attention from the sexual abuse scandal facing Republicans: Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama is accused of making advances on teenagers when he was in his thirties. The progressive group MoveOn.org on Thursday called the report about Franken \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d Senator Franken: 'Sessions must recuse himself' \u201cProgressives & Democrats must not tolerate sexual harassment or assault,\u201d it said in a tweet. \u201cWe must lift up women & others speaking out. @SenFranken should be held to the same standard as anyone in public or private life.\u201d But that standard \u2013 how it\u2019s measured and then enforced \u2013 could become a point of contention among Democrats. \u201cWhat accountability should look like is clearly an important question. As a next step, MoveOn strongly supports an immediate investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee,\u201d the group\u2019s chief communication officer, Nick Berning, said in an email. Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, was critical of Franken\u2019s initial response to the charges. \u201cThat was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAl Franken must be held accountable if our party wants to live up to our commitment to women & girls.\u201d Top Democrats in Washington are expected to go along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s call for an ethics investigation. None have called for Franken to resign. \u201cSexual harassment is never acceptable and must not be tolerated,\u201d Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted early in the afternoon. \u201cI hope and expect that the Ethics Committee will fully investigate this troubling incident, as they should with any credible allegation of sexual harassment.\u201d Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, also expressed her support \u2013 retweeting Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill\u2019s own call \u2013 for a probe into Franken. \u201cAnd I hope some women are part of the ethics investigation panel,\u201d she added in a subsequent post. And I hope some women are part of the ethics investigation panel. https://t.co/E0BxXReopB The abortion rights group NARAL issued a broad condemnation of sexual misconduct in \u201cthe traditionally male, very powerful Halls of Congress\u201d and anywhere else, but mentioned Franken by name only to say it expects him \u201cto be at the front of the line in addressing the impact of (elected leaders\u2019) behavior, and changing this destructive culture.\u201d To Leeann Tweeden and all the women who have come forward with their stories of sexual harassment & assault: We support and believe you. Our statement: pic.twitter.com/RQv94JqYYB The Franken revelations are especially fraught for Democrats in the Trump era, as they seek to frame themselves in opposition to Republicans who support the President in spite of a series of unresolved allegations of sexual misconduct against him. More recently, Moore, the Alabama Republican, has been hit with a flurry of detailed accusations. (Top Republicans have called on Moore to stand down from his campaign.) Other concerned Democrats, many clearly thrown for a loop by the Franken news, are beginning to think ahead to the coming midterms and future election cycles. \u201cWe need elected officials without baggage, without regrets and without fake apologies,\u201d the progressive strategist Rebecca Katz said on Thursday. \u201cThe best way to make sure we get that is to nominate and elect young people who know better and women who wouldn\u2019t be put in these situations in the first place.\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, called on Franken to \u201ccome completely clean about the details of what happened, and if there are any other incidents involving other women that may come to light.\u201d Franken himself has been outspoken on the rising tide of sexual harassment and assault allegations now sweeping across American life, from Hollywood to the corridors of Congress. His past statements \u2013 dating to his first run for Senate in 2008, when Republicans hammered him over a column he had written for Playboy magazine nearly a decade earlier \u2013 will now be subject to sharper scrutiny and charges of hypocrisy. On October 10, Franken shared an opinion piece, written by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, that detailed ways to assure \u201cmore victims have opportunities to speak up, and to see justice served when they do.\u201d Franken introduced the piece on Facebook by writing: \u201cThe women who have shared their stories about Harvey Weinstein over the last few days are incredibly brave. It takes a lot of courage to come forward, and we owe them our thanks. And as we hear more and more about Mr. Weinstein, it\u2019s important to remember that while his behavior was appalling, it\u2019s far too common.\u201d Ten days later, he tweeted: \u201cI believe we should do everything in our power to support survivors of sexual violence.\u201d I believe we should do everything in our power to support survivors of sexual violence.",

            "article_content": "Tuesday\u2019s elections favoring Democrats could give conservative forces more urgency in an area President Donald Trump is already moving on aggressively: reshaping the federal courts. Amid tension, Trump and McConnell together on judges Trump and his advisers are moving at break-neck speed compared with past presidents. Republicans pushed four conservative US appeals court judges through the Senate last week, and with a total of eight appeals court appointees, Trump has won far more Senate confirmations than his three immediate predecessors did at this point in their presidencies. A hearing on six nominees is scheduled for next week. The Republican majority, led by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has been crucial to Trump\u2019s effort to move swiftly on the lifetime judicial appointments and please his right-wing base. Judges exert control over myriad social and business issues, from abortion rights to class action litigation. Public attention naturally focuses on Supreme Court appointments, yet with the nine justices hearing less than 1% of the petitions that reach their door, the regional courts of appeals constitute a powerful last stop for the nation\u2019s litigants. Trump\u2019s legal team has taken advantage of the GOP Senate majority while also trying to outpace any major disruption for the executive branch, whether it be a sudden Supreme Court vacancy or more charges arising from Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. Mueller is exploring possible Trump campaign links to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. For any administration, a Supreme Court opening or major legislative effort \u2013 such as President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul in his first term \u2013 can divert attention from key lower court posts. A high court resignation is not a far-fetched prospect these days. Three of the justices are over 75, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, has signaled that he is mulling the possibility of stepping down soon. Trump already named one new justice, Neil Gorsuch. That opportunity arose because Senate Republicans blocked Obama from filling a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. After Tuesday\u2019s Democratic sweep at the polls, Democrats grew more optimistic about victories in the 2018 congressional elections, but a switch in party control at the Senate remains a long shot. To take the majority, Democrats need to gain three seats in the Senate. As it stands, the 2018 midterm map makes such a flip unlikely. Republican-held seats in Arizona and Nevada are clear Democratic targets. But any possibility of Democratic inroads is offset by the reality that the party would be defending 10 Senate seats in states Trump won in 2016, including the reliably red states of West Virginia, North Dakota, Montana, Missouri and Indiana. As electoral politics churned this fall, Trump racked up a total of eight new judges on US appellate courts. At this point in Obama\u2019s first term, he had had only one new appellate judge confirmed; for President George W. Bush, four appellate judges, and President Bill Clinton, two appellate judges. (There are a total 179 life-tenured seats on the 13 US appeals courts.) Trump nominates 16 judges as Democrats look ahead to Supreme Court fight Obama and Clinton both filled one Supreme Court seat in the first year of their first terms; Bush had to wait until his second term for an opening. Among Trump\u2019s appeals court appointees so far are several who, like Gorsuch, were on lists the conservative Federalist Society provided him for possible Supreme Court selection. Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, a former law clerk to Scalia, was confirmed last week for the US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Trump is carrying forward other conservative favorites, including deputy White House counsel Gregory Katsas, for the prominent US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That bench has been a launching pad to the Supreme Court, including for Chief Justice John Roberts and justices Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Katsas, a former law clerk to Justice Thomas, on Thursday. Eighteen more appeals court vacancies currently await Trump, according to statistics from the Administrative Office of the US Courts.",

Clinton, in an on-camera conversation with California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also faulted the Trump administration\u2019s policy on contraception, arguing that restricting women\u2019s rights to abortion and contraception is saying \u201cwomen have no right to control their own reproductive capacity.\u201d Congress reached a deal earlier this year to slap fresh sanctions on Russia and restrict the President\u2019s veto power to block any easing of those sanctions. The agreement headed to Trump\u2019s desk, where the sanctions have yet to be implemented. The State Department \u2013 25 days after guidance on the sanctions were due \u2013 issued direction on which Russian individuals and entities will be subject to sanctions under the newly passed legislation. The lack of guidance had drawn bipartisan scorn. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t implemented it. So what is the lesson from that?\u201d Clinton said at an event in Washington. \u201cThe lesson is you can get away with attacking America, sowing discord and divisiveness, effecting our election and this President and administration are not going to hold you accountable.\u201d The sanctions are now set to be fully implemented in January. Clinton\u2019s animosity toward Russia dates back years and was further heightened in 2016, when the country meddled in the US election to help Donald Trump and hurt her candidacy. Clinton, in books and speeches, has traced Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s animus toward her to her decision to speak out against Russia\u2019s elections in 2011. Clinton defended that decision Thursday and subtly knocked Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s secretary of state, in the process. \u201cI was the secretary of state and part of my job was to stand up for democracy, something we used to expect from our secretary of state,\u201d she said. One topic not addressed during the wide-ranging conversation: Allegations leveled by former interim DNC chair Donna Brazile. In newly released book excerpts, Brazile allege that the Democratic National Committee was controlled by her 2016 campaign long before she was the party\u2019s nominee, an accusation long lobbed by supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton\u2019s 2016 opponent. Instead of focusing intra-party fighting \u2013 Feinstein never asked about the excerpts \u2013 Clinton lobbed most of her attacks at Trump. Clinton slammed Trump\u2019s decision to allow employers more leeway for covering birth control through employee insurance plans. Clinton said restricting women\u2019s access to contraception \u2013 not just abortion \u2013 is saying \u201cwomen have no right to control their own reproductive capacity.\u201d \u201cThat is what is so troubling to me, Dianne, because that is in line with regimes and ideologies around the world that really do want to limit women\u2019s autonomy and being able to make decisions for ourselves,\u201d Clinton added.",

Listing off issues such as higher health care costs, a nuclear-armed North Korea and Russian interference in last year\u2019s US election, Collins said she wants to \u201ccontinue to play a key role\u201d in leading issues, and noted that she had climbed in Senate seniority from 99th to 15th. \u201cThe best way that I can contribute to these priorities is to remain a member of the United States Senate,\u201d Collins said. Collins began her remarks Friday by launching into a lengthy explanation of why she opposed the health care bills. \u201cI was guided by the central tenet of the Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm,\u201d she said. \u201cThe current system is not working for many Americans, but in trying to solve the problem, it\u2019s important that we not make matters worse.\u201d Collins\u2019 clashes with her own party could have made it difficult to win the Republican primary in the race for the governor\u2019s office currently occupied by Paul LePage, a bombastic figure much more in line with Trump. Re-election to her Senate seat in 2020 would likely be a safer bet. A source with knowledge of Collins\u2019 thinking said over the last year the Maine senator had taken a serious look at running for governor. Collins values constituent services, felt she could do more in an executive role and, the source said, liked the idea of capping her political career as Maine\u2019s first female governor. But, the source said, the reality of Collins\u2019 prominent role in the Senate \u2013 where she has seniority and is a swing vote on nearly all major legislative items \u2013 has led Collins to rethink whether she wants to depart now. Another factor in her thinking is that her friend, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, is being treated for brain cancer \u2013 which, the source said, has made Collins\u2019 voice countering Trump more important. In a reflection of that line of thought, Collins on Friday criticized the Trump administration\u2019s decision to end cost-sharing subsidies under Obamacare, issuing a call to \u201cstabilize the insurance markets very quickly.\u201d \u201cThe point is, when we\u2019re dealing with an issue that affects millions of Americans, we need to understand the consequences of what we\u2019re doing \u2013 not vote in the middle of the night on bills that have had no substantive hearing and little analysis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must stop allowing partisanship to be a pre-existing condition that prevents meaningful health reform,\u201d Collins added. Collins is Maine\u2019s senior senator, having served since her first election in 1996. She began her career in politics as an aide to Maine Sen. William Cohen, and served briefly in the Bush 41 administration. In 1994, Collins ran as the first major-party female candidate for Maine governor, but was defeated, coincidentally, by Angus King, who now serves as her junior colleague in the Senate. In 1996, Collins won Cohen\u2019s old US Senate seat. She joined Olympia Snowe to form just the third all-female US Senate delegation, further distinguished by the fact that both were members of the Republican Party in the largely Democratic northeast. Collins reflected her state\u2019s independent streak \u2013 Maine splits its electoral votes and has been fertile ground for third-party candidates \u2013 and over the course of her career in Congress, she emerged as a regular swing vote in high-stakes policy debates. In 2009, Collins, along with Snowe, was just one of three Republican senators to vote for the stimulus package crafted by the Obama administration in response to the Great Recession. And though Collins voted against passage of the Affordable Care Act that same year, she was also a key \u201cno\u201d vote in Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal the health care law earlier this year \u2013 remaining opposed even in the face of a fierce lobbying campaign from party leaders and the White House. Collins is also one of the few pro-abortion rights Republicans in Congress, supported a 2013 bill to expand background checks for gun purchases and came out against Trump\u2019s travel ban in the early months of the new administration. With Republicans currently holding just a two-seat edge in the Senate, Collins\u2019 vote has rarely been more influential. The Maine senator\u2019s independence, however, has led to increasingly frequent clashes with her own party in recent years. Before she helped scuttle Obamacare repeal, Collins was among the Republicans most critical of Trump during the 2016 election. Collins held out on endorsing, and eventually wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post explaining why she wouldn\u2019t be voting for Trump. Still, Collins easily won re-election in 2014, is well-regarded within her state. She serves on the powerful Senate appropriations and intelligence committees.

            "article_content": "Pennsylvania Rep. Tim Murphy has had one hell of a last month. In early September, the Republican House member admitted to an extramarital affair with a \u201cpersonal friend\u201d following the unsealing of divorce records that showed he had been involved in a relationship with Shannon Edwards, a forensic psychologist. \u201cThis is nobody\u2019s fault but my own, and I offer no excuses,\u201d Murphy said in a statement issued through his attorney, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. \u201cTo the extent that there should be any blame in this matter, it falls solely upon me.\u201d It got much, much worse on Tuesday when the Post-Gazette reported on a text message exchange between Edwards and Murphy in which she alleges he urged her to have an abortion. \u201cAnd you have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,\u201d wrote Edwards in the text obtained by the Post-Gazette. A text reply sent from Murphy\u2019s phone read: \u201cI get what you say about my March for life messages. I\u2019ve never written them. Staff does them. I read them and winced. I told staff don\u2019t write any more. I will.\u201d Edwards was not ultimately pregnant. Murphy\u2019s personal foibles are not the point here. What is the point is that he is someone who has been an outspoken critic of abortion rights in his public life even while apparently being much more willing to consider it when it impacts him personally. Murphy was a co-sponsor of legislation \u2013 passed in the House on Tuesday night \u2013 that would make it illegal for women to abort a baby after the 20-week mark. He has a perfect 100% score with National Right to Life, having voted with the organization on five key pieces of legislation, including the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act.\u201d As my former Washington Post colleague Aaron Blake expertly documents here, Murphy was also touting his anti-abortion stance even as he was reportedly urging his mistress to seek an abortion. This is hypocrisy of the worst sort. Murphy does one thing in his public life as an elected official and something very, very different in his private life. It\u2019s literally a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do situation. And it\u2019s what people, rightly, hate about politics. The sense that politicians don\u2019t think the rules apply to them. The idea that all politicians are lying liars who have one position in public and a totally contradictory one in private. That they don\u2019t really believe anything they are saying. It\u2019s those feelings which play a major part in the terrible image people hold of Washington these days. In a September CNN poll, just 20% of people approved of the job Republican leaders are doing in Congress; 32% approved of Democratic leaders in Congress. Less than three in 10 had a favorable opinion of the Republican Party in that same poll, the lowest mark ever recorded in CNN data. It\u2019s that dissatisfaction, distrust and disdain that gave us Donald Trump. Trump blasted politicians \u2013 in both parties \u2013 as ineffective losers. So deep was peoples\u2019 dislike for traditional politicians that they were willing to take a massive risk \u2013 and, make no mistake, they knew it was a major risk \u2013 on Trump as president. When you see a politician like Murphy, you can see why. Not all politicians are like him. Most aren\u2019t. But he is a classic bad apple spoiling the bunch. His office has not commented on this latest report on text messages. Murphy was unopposed for re-election in 2016 and he sits in a district in western Pennsylvania that gave Trump a 17-point margin. But this is the real conundrum of US politics. If past is prologue, there\u2019s a real chance Murphy will win again. Just before the 2012 election, reports came out that Tennessee Rep. Scott DesJarlais, a Republican opponent of abortion rights, had urged his pregnant mistress to get an abortion. He won. In the wake of that election, much more came out \u2013 including the fact that DesJarlais and his ex-wife had mutually agreed she have two abortions. He faced a serious primary challenge in 2014 \u2013 but won. DesJarlais was re-elected to a 4th term with 65% in 2016. That\u2019s the reality of our politics. And why so many people hate it so much.",

            "article_content": "Trump issued support for the bill even before he won the election Some of Trump's top advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, are vocally opposed to abortion The House of Representatives passed legislation Tuesday that would criminalize abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for instances where the life of the mother is at risk and in cases involving rape or incest. The bill passed the House by a vote of 237 for and 189 against, largely on party lines. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which is similar to legislation that failed in 2013 and 2015, has support from the White House this time around. The divisive issue of abortion has once again been brought to the forefront of national conversations since President Donald Trump assumed office. Trump issued support for the bill even before he won the election. In a letter dated September 2016 that was sent to anti-abortion leaders inviting individuals to join the campaign\u2019s \u201cPro-Life Coalition,\u201d Trump said he was committed to \u201csigning into law the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would end painful late-term abortions nationwide,\u201d as one of four points. The White House reiterated its support in a statement of administration policy issued Monday: \u201cThe administration strongly supports H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and applauds the House of Representatives for continuing its efforts to secure critical pro-life protections.\u201d Some of Trump\u2019s top advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, are vocally opposed to abortion. Trump also tapped Neil Gorsuch to the US Supreme Court, which anti-abortion advocates saw as a win. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced last week that the House would vote on H.R. 36, calling it legislation that \u201cwill respect the sanctity of life and stop needless suffering.\u201d \u201cIt will protect those children who science has proven can feel pain, and give them a chance to grow and live full and happy lives,\u201d McCarthy\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe have an obligation to speak and defend for those who can\u2019t speak for themselves.\u201d As for the narrowly divided Senate, where passing abortion-related bills can be harder than in the House, the legislation may not get floor time anytime soon. GOP Whip Sen. John Cornyn was asked Monday if the chamber would take up the legislation. \u201cThat\u2019s not a near-term priority,\u201d Cornyn replied. Similar legislation is already enacted in several states. But opponents of the legislation argue 20-week abortion bans are unconstitutional. \u201cThis dangerous, out-of-touch legislation is nothing more than yet another attempt to restrict women\u2019s access to safe, legal abortion,\u201d Planned Parenthood Action Fund said online. PPAF also writes, \u201c20-week bans are unconstitutional. 20-week bans are a clear attempt to erode Roe v. Wade. In fact, 20-week ban proponents are outspoken about their goal to challenge the 1973 Supreme Court decision protecting a woman\u2019s right to safe and legal abortion.\u201d 20 week abortion bans are: - unpopular- unconstitutional- part of the agenda to ban ALL abortion#NoAbortionBan pic.twitter.com/gBDEosX1of NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue called the legislation \u201can attack on women\u2019s freedom.\u201d The House GOP\u2019s bill to ban abortion after 20 wks is an attack on women\u2019s freedom & our ability to chart our own futures. #NoAbortionBan pic.twitter.com/6RFgdBLlCV CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former White House adviser Steve Bannon is campaigning Monday for Roy Moore Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence is stumping for Sen. Luther Strange Sen. Luther Strange and Roy Moore are into the final hours of a hard-fought intra-party campaign that is testing President Donald Trump\u2019s influence with Republican voters and could set the stage for a series of GOP Senate primaries next year. The final day of campaigning here features Vice President Mike Pence as Strange\u2019s most visible advocate and Steve Bannon, the recently ousted former White House chief strategist, stumping for Moore. Pence will visit NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, and then head to Birmingham, Alabama\u2019s largest city, for a nighttime rally to close Strange\u2019s campaign. Bannon, meanwhile, heads to Fairhope \u2013 just outside Mobile, on the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 to join \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Phil Robertson at a Monday night \u201cfaith and family rally\u201d with Moore. Bannon will also appear on Fox News host Sean Hannity\u2019s show from the rally, giving Moore\u2019s side one final audience with Hannity\u2019s right-wing audience. The last-minute campaigning comes amid deep fears among Republicans in Washington about what a Moore win could mean for the party in 2018\u2019s midterm elections. Strange has been propped up by more than $9 million in spending from the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Moore, meanwhile, has cast the campaign as an opportunity to reject McConnell \u2013 a much less popular figure among Alabama Republicans than Trump. Trump\u2019s visit to Alabama on Friday night was designed to lend his popularity to Strange, who Trump told a crowd of thousands has been a loyal ally in the fight to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Trump after 'lock her up' chant: Talk to Jeff Sessions RELATED: The 64 most memorable lines from Donald Trump\u2019s Alabama speech But the President acknowledged the potential that Moore could win \u2013 and what such a victory would mean for Trump. \u201cIf Luther doesn\u2019t win, they\u2019re not going to say we picked up 25 points in a very short period of time,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cThey\u2019re going say, \u2018Donald Trump, the President of the United States, was unable to pull his candidate across the line.\u2019\u201d Alabama\u2019s matchup is unusual in that many of Trump\u2019s core supporters also back Moore, the 70-year-old former state Supreme Court justice who was ousted from that job twice \u2013 first in 2003 for refusing to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments at a state court building, then again recently for refusing to abide by the US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. RELATED: Alabama senate candidate repeatedly appeared on radio with pastor who preaches penalty for homosexuality is death Moore\u2019s campaign even touted Trump\u2019s comment from his Friday night rally in Huntsville that he would \u201cfight like hell\u201d for Moore if he defeats Strange. Roy Moore says 'we've asked for' shootings and killings by turning away from God Either Strange or Moore would be favored against the Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, in the December special election for the seat formerly held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and which Strange has held since being appointed in February. \u201cIf (Strange) loses, I think the reality is that the Republicans will still hold that seat,\u201d White House legislative director Marc Short said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Still, a Moore win could be damaging for Republicans nationally. He is well-known for a history of bombastic statements about race, sexual orientation and more \u2013 such as Thursday night, when he told a debate audience that \u201cabortion, sodomy, sexual perversion sweep our land.\u201d Democrats could use Moore\u2019s remarks as a fundraising tool and to put Republicans on the spot. Republicans are closely watching Alabama for signs of what could happen in other races featuring anti-establishment challengers next year. In Nevada, Republican Sen. Dean Heller already faces a primary fight against Danny Tarkanian. In Arizona, Sen. Jeff Flake faces conservative Kelli Ward. Both, like Moore, have Bannon\u2019s support. And across the board, Republican candidates recruited to take on Democratic incumbents in states won in 2016 face tough battles against farther-right foes.",

            "article_content": "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg looked out at the first year law class she was about to address at Georgetown Law on Wednesday and smiled broadly after being told the majority of the class were women. \u201cTo look out a class like this is exhilarating,\u201d the 84-year-old justice said. Ginsburg graduated from Columbia 58 years ago and there were only nine female students in her entering class. She would go on, as a young lawyer, to blaze new trails in the field for gender equality. The moderator of Wednesday\u2019s event \u2013 law dean William Treanor \u2013 asked Ginsburg how she chose her early career path. She rephrased his question. \u201cHow did I decide to become a flaming feminist litigator?\u201d she asked. The audience, including President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter Tiffany, who is a first-year student at the school, burst into laughter. Ginsburg went on to speak broadly about her experience as an ACLU lawyer in the 1970s, important cases from last term, and gave a brief preview of the upcoming term that includes cases concerning the travel ban, religious liberty, voting rights and cell phone privacy. With the relatively new addition of conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court is likely to be closely divided on some of those hot-button cases. \u201cThere is only one prediction that is entirely safe about the upcoming term, and that is it will be momentous,\u201d she said. A year ago, Ginsburg, like many in the country, thought the Supreme Court was on the verge of making a hard left turn. Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat was still vacant but many people thought Hillary Clinton was set to win the election and would nominate a judge who would move the court to the left. That would have meant that Ginsburg \u2013 nominated in 1993 by President Bill Clinton \u2013 would lead the charge on issues including abortion, voting rights and campaign finance. But that was not to be. A newly inaugurated Trump nominated Gorsuch. After a contentious confirmation battle, Gorsuch took the bench in April to hear the remaining 13 cases of the term. And Ginsburg quickly delivered her verdict. \u201cI imagine that when you compare how I vote and he votes, it will be just the same as it was when you compared me to Justice Scalia,\u201d she said in May. She was right. It\u2019s too early to tell the story of Gorsuch\u2019s impact on the court. But so far, he has aligned himself with the conservative side of the bench. For most of last term, the court issued narrow decisions at times in an effort to avoid 4-4 splits. This term, the court is full strength. Already, justices responded to an emergency request earlier this month in a case concerning redistricting in Texas with a 5-4 order. That split could portend more to come. Wednesday, Ginsburg did not emphasize contentious cases that grab the public\u2019s attention, but instead noted that the court is often unanimous in cases the public does not follow. She also had kind words for Gorsuch, saying that he has \u201ccast himself as a potential rival to Justice Sonia Sotomayor as the justice who asked the most questions.\u201d With the court\u2019s term beginning next month, Ginsburg shows no signs of slowing down. This fall, her personal trainer is set to release a book \u2013 the RBG Workout \u2013 outlining her fitness regime. Publicity materials include illustrations of Ginsburg wearing a \u201csuper Diva\u201d T-shirt doing front and side planks. \u201cJustice Ginsburg upped the ante by doing her front plank in a full push-up position, with her hands on the ground,\u201d wrote Bryant Johnson. Treanor asked her Wednesday night if she used her knees when she did her push ups. She paused a moment and looked horrified. \u201cNo,\u201d she responded, incredulous at the question.",

            "article_content": "Two Trump lawyers were caught discussing discussions about the Russia probe by a New York Times reporter Trump's legal team has not been able to control their client Ty Cobb and other lawyers were supposed to impose discipline on an unruly White House as it confronted the investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s possible collusion with Russians in the 2016 election. It appears the opposite has happened. Trump\u2019s attorneys are beginning to look as undisciplined as their disruptive client. The emerging picture of his legal defense seems more chaotic than coordinated, one that could aggravate his legal problems rather than solve them. It also cannot help but stir private chatter among lawyers who have previously represented top officials over whether Trump\u2019s team is up to the task of defending a president under scrutiny by a crack team of federal investigators. Exclusive: US government wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman DACA judge reading Trump\u2019s tweets carefully The latest: A New York Times report about White House infighting over documents sought by the Russia special counsel that featured an overheard luncheon conversation between Cobb, one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, and Dowd at a popular Washington restaurant just steps from the Times\u2019 Washington bureau. Cobb, hired to manage the administration\u2019s Russia defense, was heard talking loudly to Dowd, one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, about a dispute over materials sought by the special counsel investigating connections between Trump and the Russian election interference. Differences between Cobb, who was said to be interested in releasing as many documents as possible to bring the inquiry to a swifter end, and White House counsel Don McGahn appeared to have triggered the dispute. According to the Times, Cobb talked about a White House lawyer he regarded as \u201ca McGahn spy\u201d and said McGahn had \u201ca couple documents locked in a safe\u201d that Cobb apparently wanted. The Times reported that Cobb, in an interview, later praised McGahn and played down any conflict over documents. The front-page report shocked experienced litigators who have been involved in past presidential investigations. The revelations appear wholly counterproductive to the Trump defense in the specific investigation and also in the public eye. And the episode offered the latest example of a legal team that seems ill-prepared to counter a high-powered federal investigation overseen by former FBI Director Robert Mueller. Yet Trump\u2019s attorneys have their defenders. \u201cCobb and Dowd are very experienced lawyers,\u201d said lawyer Ross Garber, a white-collar crime specialist who has represented three US governors facing impeachment proceedings and worked previously with Cobb. \u201cThey\u2019ve spent a lot of time on significant investigations and congressional inquiries. It\u2019s easy for lawyers who aren\u2019t involved to second-guess decisions of those actually doing the work. Having said that, this is difficult, nuanced, challenging stuff.\u201d NYT: Cobb overheard talking about colleagues, Russia probe at DC steakhouse The Cobb-Dowd conversation might offer Mueller an avenue to pursue Mueller suspects the White House is withholding materials. He might possibly question Cobb about documents secreted away in a safe or elsewhere. Mueller already appeared to be focusing on possible obstruction of justice by Trump and his associates related to the Russia probe. Mueller came to the job after Trump in May fired James Comey, then the FBI director and the individual who had been running the investigation. Even if the episode at the Washington restaurant does not become part of Mueller\u2019s investigative trail, it calls into question the judgment of Trump\u2019s leading lawyers as they discussed the white-hot Russia probe. Experienced counsel usually watch what they say about sensitive matters when others are within earshot, in elevators, restaurants, on planes and trains. That\u2019s particularly true in Washington, where it seems a journalist or political rival is around every corner \u2013 or at the next table. Monday\u2019s reported indiscretion recalled other clumsy, if potentially less consequential, news accounts involving Trump\u2019s lawyers this summer. Last month after the deadly demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, Dowd forwarded an email that compared Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee to US President George Washington and that said the activist movement Black Lives Matter \u201chas been totally infiltrated by terrorist groups.\u201d Earlier, Marc Kasowitz, a New York-based personal lawyer to Trump, was caught in a profanity-laced email rant that he sent to a stranger after the individual urged him to resign from representing Trump. \u201cF*** you,\u201d Kasowitz said in his initial response. In a second message, Kasowtiz said, \u201cWatch your back, bitch.\u201d Clinton opens door to questioning legitimacy of 2016 election Jay Sekulow, another attorney representing Trump in the Russia investigation, denied in a CNN interview that Trump was involved with crafting a misleading statement about Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer. It soon emerged that the President apparently had dictated the misleading statement. Sekulow, a conservative advocate, has specialized in anti-abortion, religious rights litigation, not white-collar or government investigative matters Of the attorneys trying to help Trump with the Russia probe, Cobb and Dowd appear to offer the most relevant expertise, after decades of white-collar criminal work in Washington. In the 1990s, Dowd represented Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain in an ethics investigation; McCain was cleared in the Senate probe surrounding the so-called Keating Five. Cobb, a former federal prosecutor, was a partner in the investigations practice of the Hogan Lovells law firm. Yet neither man has brought in teams of associates. The White House had earlier tried to hire on a big-name litigator with the resources of a large firm. One overriding reason seems to be a lack of confidence that any attorney would be able to control this client or the case. Trump has a reputation for ignoring advice and for making public statements \u2013 on Twitter, especially \u2013 that may be counterproductive, such as with challenges to his travel ban. In the end, Trump\u2019s lawyers will likely be measured by how they fight off any possible charges. In the meantime, however, the task is to minimize \u2013 not increase \u2013 any criminal exposure. Lawyers are expected to put out fires for their clients, not start them with their own blunders.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s longtime spiritual adviser, Bill Shillady, has pulled out of an appearance with the former secretary of state that was slated for Thursday in New York City, a spokesperson for the event tells CNN. The decision came after Shillady admitted he plagiarized aspects about his book, \u201cStrong for a Moment Like This: The Daily Devotions of Hillary Rodham Clinton,\u201d leading his publisher, Abingdon Press, to pull the book from stores and destroy all copies. The book was based on morning devotionals Shillady emailed to Clinton during the 2016 campaign. The event will go on, said Ann Waller Curtis, a spokeswoman for the event, with the Rev. Ginger Gaines-Cirelli of Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington hosting the conversation with Clinton, who attended services at Foundry when she lived in DC. It is unclear whether Shillady decided to bow out or if he was asked to do so, but the event\u2019s spokesperson said the decision for him to not attend the event became clear once the minister \u201crealized he was going to be a distraction.\u201d Shillady declined to comment when reached by CNN on Thursday. A Clinton aide confirmed that Shillady will not attend the event. Hillary Clinton's pastor plagiarized portion of new book \u201cThere will be a statement made at the event tonight,\u201d he said. CNN reported on the first discovered instances of plagiarism in August, when Shillady was found to have plagiarized an emotional devotional he sent Clinton at 4 a.m. on the morning after Clinton lost the presidential election. Clinton had lent her stature to the book, writing a foreword and praising the minister. The two grew close after meeting in New York in 2002. Shillady co-officiated at Chelsea Clinton\u2019s wedding in 2010, presided over Clinton\u2019s mother\u2019s memorial service and blessed her grandchildren. In response to his plagiarism, Shillady asked for forgiveness. \u201cI deeply regret my actions,\u201d Shillady said earlier this month. \u201cI was wrong and there is no excuse for it. I apologize to those whose work I mistakenly did not attribute. I apologize to those I have disappointed, including Secretary Hillary Clinton, Abingdon Press, and all the writers and others who have helped me publish and promote this book. I ask for everyone\u2019s forgiveness.\u201d Clinton, according to an invite for the event, will discuss her lifelong Methodism and the 2016 election at Thursday\u2019s event. The former first lady is a deeply spiritual person, writing for decades that her faith is what helped her get through some of the most difficult moments in her life. Though Clinton usually keeps her faith private, during the 2016 campaign she routinely discuss her faith and beliefs. During one particularly eye-opening event, Clinton told an Iowa mother that she laments people who use faith to \u201cjudge so harshly.\u201d \u201cIt is very important to me. I am a person of faith. I am Christian. I am a Methodist,\u201d Clinton said in response to a question about how she squares her faith with her beliefs regarding abortion. \u201cMy study of the Bible, my many conversations with people of faith, has led me to believe that the most important commandment is to love the lord with all your might and to love your neighbor as yourself and that is what I think we are commanded by Christ to do.\u201d Former President Bill Clinton also said during the 2016 campaign that Clinton has \u201clived by\u201d the Methodist Church\u2019s charge to \u201cdo all the good we can, in whatever ways we can, to all the people we can, for as long as we can.\u201d Clinton is also on the cusp of a book tour of her own, with her latest memoir, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d slated for widespread release next week. CNN purchased the book from a Jacksonville, Florida, bookstore earlier this week. A raw and aggrieved Clinton looks to explain her 2016 loss in the book, laying blame on a host of outside factors while also taking blame \u2013 at times \u2013 herself. \u201cI go back over my own shortcomings and the mistakes we made. I take responsibility for all of them. You can blame the data, blame the message, blame anything you want \u2013 but I was the candidate,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was my campaign. Those were my decisions.\u201d CNN\u2019s Daniel Burke contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Korie Robertson says she didn't decide who to vote for until the day of the 2016 election Her message to Trump: \"Be a leader that unifies\" \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Korie Robertson says she doesn\u2019t understand why President Trump didn\u2019t speak out sooner and more forcefully against white supremacists after they rallied this month in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cIt was shocking and scary, the fact that it seemed like he wasn\u2019t willing to call them out\u201d after the violence that erupted that day, Robertson said in an interview that aired on CNN Thursday afternoon. The President first denounced \u201chatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\u201d without mentioning the white supremacists at the event. Two days later he condemned white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK. But later that week he said \u201cthere is blame on both sides,\u201d referring to counterdemonstrators, and said that there were \u201cfine people\u201d on both sides. Robertson, in an exclusive interview with CNN, said she believes there is \u201cabsolutely\u201d no moral equivalence between white supremacists and the counterprotesters who were there that day. \u201cWhen he came back and tried to say there\u2019s good people on both sides and all that, that\u2019s when it got even more shocking for me, because I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how you could say there are good people marching with torches, shouting Nazi slogans, wearing Hitler shirts, spewing all amounts of hate.\u2019\u201d \u201cSo if there was a good person that showed up there, they would leave when they saw what was happening. So that floored me, and I don\u2019t really understand that,\u201d she said. Robertson is the wife of famed CEO of Duck Commander and Buck Commander, Willie Robertson, whose family and business are chronicled in the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d reality series on A&E. Robertson said that even though her husband was an early supporter of Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention in July 2016, the family was divided over the election. \u201cWillie was outspoken and supported Trump from the beginning; and I was not. So we had a lot of discussions about it. And we could agree to disagree, as well,\u201d Korie Robertson said. Robertson said she ultimately voted for Trump \u2013 but that she didn\u2019t make the decision until Election Day. Her choice, she said, came down to Hillary Clinton\u2019s views on abortion. CNN spoke to Robertson days after she retweeted former President Barack Obama\u2019s widely shared Twitter message on the day of the Charlottesville violence. Obama tweeted a quote from Nelson Mandela\u2019s 1994 autobiography \u201cLong Walk to Freedom\u201d that said, \u201cNo one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.\u201d \"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion...\" pic.twitter.com/InZ58zkoAm Obama\u2019s post was the most liked in Twitter history. \u201cThere\u2019s so much divisiveness on Twitter, on social media \u2013 so many people fighting \u2013 that to see something that was positive and such truth, it just felt like light was winning,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAnd I thought, I\u2019m just going to retweet that as well.\u201d The Charlottesville rally happened in part to protest the pending removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E Lee. Since then, a number of local governments across the country have decided to take down Confederate monuments. Robertson, a Louisiana resident, said she agreed that such statues should come down. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember our history, so that we don\u2019t repeat it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need to revere that part of our history.\u201d Robertson said it was time for Trump to change. \u201cSay you were wrong. \u2026 Why are you still fighting? What are you trying to prove at this point?\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s just come together, and be a leader that unifies, that brings people together.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Conservative street artist Sabo, a longtime supporter of Sen. Ted Cruz, told CNN last week that after months of refusing to back the Republican presidential nominee, and initially vowing to \u201cwrite in Cruz,\u201d he will now be voting for Donald Trump. Over the last few months, Sabo has gradually budged from #NeverTrump, to riding the Trump train \u201cfor the day\u201d in an anti-Clinton art project, to maybe Trump and then finally, to a cautious Trump voter. The artist\u2019s journey echoes Cruz\u2019s own difficult process in coming to terms with Trump, where the Texas senator gradually went from denouncing Trump, to endorsing him \u201cafter many months of careful consideration.\u201d \u201cIn the past year I wrote Trump off as a shill for Hillary (Clinton). What seemed like his constant self-destructive approach helped to support this thought. What helped to break this idea for me, what finally won me over, was watching how hard he\u2019s been kicking Hillary, Bill, and the media in the teeth,\u201d the staunchly conservative artist told CNN in an email Friday. Sabo\u2019s art has taken the streets of Los Angeles by storm for years during the 2016 campaign, infuriating and often shocking residents of the largely progressive city. The Louisiana native\u2019s art first gained national attention when Sabo depicted Texas politician Wendy Davis as \u201cabortion Barbie\u201d and later, for portraying Ted Cruz as a tattooed, cigarette-smoking bad boy, who was \u201cblacklisted\u201d by the Washington establishment \u2013 an image that has become iconic during the 2016 election. Sabo was called racist and homophobic by some, including those offended by his decision to use the N-word in his art, but he said he enjoys the diversity in Los Angeles and said that his artistic decisions do not make him a racist. \u201cI\u2019m an artist. I take it upon myself to use every word at my disposal and that doesn\u2019t make me a bigot,\u201d Sabo said. \u201cAnd if I do use that word in a very harsh way, I don\u2019t use it any differently than Chris Rock did in the mid \u201980s.\u201d At first glance, the bombastic and far from politically correct artist, might seem like the artist embodiment of Trump. But Sabo said he is far from it because Trump is not a true conservative. Sabo initially dismissed Trump as a \u201cDemocrat,\u201d whose \u201cself-destructive\u201d behavior on the trail is going to guarantee Clinton the White House. He told CNN in August that while a politically incorrect, anti-establishment message is something the Republican Party needed, he would have wanted a true conservative like Cruz to be the messenger. Sabo lamented Cruz\u2019s loss in the primary, hailed the Texas senator\u2019s refusal to back Trump and vowed to \u201cwrite in Cruz\u201d in Election Day. \u201cI think (Trump) makes sense in a lot of things that he says, but you really, one of the biggest problems I have about Trump is he\u2019s a man without a core,\u201d Sabo said, \u201cSo you really don\u2019t have much of an idea as to what he\u2019s actually going to do.\u201d Amid backlash over Clinton saying that \u201chalf\u201d of Trump\u2019s supporters fit into the \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d Sabo briefly took a trip on a Trump Train, making campaign swag with the label \u201cThe Deplorables\u201d to defend Trump supporters. \u201cThis design is doing well and no, I\u2019m not on the Trump Train. I just got a day pass,\u201d Sabo said. After months of refusing to back the Republican nominee and following his combative speech at the Republican National Convention in July, where he urged conservatives to vote their \u201cconscience,\u201d Cruz endorsed Trump in September. When asked about Cruz\u2019s decision to back Trump, Sabo was beginning to have a change of heart but he was not ready to back Trump himself. He said that this election is \u201ca s\u2014 sandwich,\u201d but conservatives like Cruz and himself \u201cjust have to sprinkle enough sugar on it to choke it down\u201d because with the prospects of a Clinton presidency, \u201ctoo much is at stake.\u201d Following the final presidential debate, Sabo said that he doesn\u2019t know whether he will still write in Cruz on Election Day or bite the bullet \u2013 or in his case the \u201csandwich\u201d \u2013 and vote for Trump. \u201cIf by some miracle Trump needs my vote I\u2019ll take a bit out of that s\u2014 sandwich and vote for him because I see Hillary is too big a threat to our democracy,\u201d Sabo, who will be voting in California, said. \u201cIf he gets trounced along the way then I\u2019ll write in Cruz as a protest vote,\u201d he said. Trump spent much of October defending himself against claims of sexual assault that surfaced following the release of a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video, in which Trump is caught on a hot mic bragging about his ability to grope women because of his star power. But he also unleashed on Bill Clinton, slamming the former President\u2019s past sexual indiscretions, inviting Clinton accusers to the second presidential debate and accused the Democratic presidential nominee of bullying her husband\u2019s accusers. He also relentlessly attacked the Democratic presidential nominee over news that the FBI is looking into new emails related to her use of a personal server during her time as secretary of state. \u201cIt no longer mattered that I didn\u2019t see him as a true Republican or conservative. He was doing something with a force I\u2019ve never seen any Republican do,\u201d Sabo said. \u201cThat was enough for me.\u201d",

For more on the intersection of politics and humor, watch CNN\u2019s \u201cThe History of Comedy\u201d Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT. \"If I could say anything to Donald Trump it would be talk to some women. I think you need to,\" Winstead said \"Every woman is a victim of sexism and I feel like you gotta call it out no matter what,\" she said about Melania Trump As late-night comedians ramp up their roles as political commentators in the age of President Donald Trump, CNN\u2019s #GetPolitical series caught up with comedian Lizz Winstead \u2014 the co-creator and former head writer of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d \u2014 to talk politics, comedy and social activism. Winstead, who backed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, founded Lady Parts Justice League in 2012 \u2014 a non-profit organization that merges her passions for comedy and feminism. \u201cI think a lot of people woke up from the election the day after in a crumpled pantsuit, with food in their bra, saying, what happened to me? What am I gonna do?\u201d Lizz Winstead \u201c(Lady Parts Justice League) is a group of comics and musicians and writers and we make videos to try to shine a light on the hypocrisy around removing access to reproductive health care,\u201d Winstead said. This summer Winstead went on a comedy tour \u2014 \u201cThe Vagical Mystery Tour\u201d \u2014  with a group of female comedians, visiting cities with strict birth control and abortion laws to raise awareness and educate women about their options and resources. How do you assess the Trump presidency, so far? Winstead: I kinda feel like it\u2019s like if everyone let go of all the Macy\u2019s balloons in the parade and they just started deflating and crashing into buildings \u2014 that\u2019s like my larger scope of the Trump presidency. Um, but I feel like the unpredictability of it is what makes it so scary. You have argued that Hillary Clinton faced sexism in 2016. How did sexism play out? Winstead: I think a lot of people woke up from the election the day after in a crumpled pantsuit, with food in their bra, saying, what happened to me? What am I gonna do? \u2026 I think that when you look at how we even ignore the issues that face women \u2014 equal pay, reproductive rights and justice, gender justice \u2014 how it\u2019s not centered is as much as a telling piece of sexism as the overt sexism. What about first lady Melania Trump? She also experienced some sexist dialogue. Winstead: I feel that every woman is a victim of sexism and I feel like you gotta call it out no matter what, no matter how you feel about them. if you\u2019re not smart enough to call out people on their behavior and their policies and you immediately go to the looks well, it says more about you than it does about that person. I learn nothing from you if you make some crass comment about her modeling. Her advocacy is online bullying (laughs), there\u2019s plenty of jokes, to be had at the expense of the Trump family as a whole. What the women look like? I don\u2019t care. Ivanka Trump has spoken out on women\u2019s issues but was met with some criticism from the left. Why is her message not resonating with some? Winstead: I think that her message comes from a super privileged space \u2026 Some people have jobs but they\u2019re not in a career. Some people are working two jobs trying to raise their kids, some people are tradespeople, you know, so it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t have a clue about how to talk about anything other than the life she lives. And if you\u2019re not going to look at again, the full humanity of what women need in their daily lives, it\u2019s not always these executive-level, lean-in type programs. \u201cI kinda feel like it\u2019s like if everyone let go of all the Macy\u2019s balloons in the parade and they just started deflating and crashing into buildings \u2014 that\u2019s like my larger scope of the Trump presidency.\u201d Lizz Winstead Has late-night comedy evolved over the years? Winstead: I think so. I think now that you add the digital aspect and social media to how you satirized things, I mean, we have you know, the first troll-in-chief and that is like a new experience to look at how you you talk about politics. I think that with Sam Bee \u2026 the issues that affect women are centered, which is really cool. For the first time we\u2019re actually looking at the political ramifications of walking the earth with a uterus, which is kind of astounding. Late-night comedy often blurs the line between news and comedy. Does it have news value or is it fake news? Where is the line? Winstead: I think the line is in the information. I mean, when I was at \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d we, you could fact check our show and it would be correct. Is it all the news you need? No. But, is it accurate? Yeah. When Tomi Lahren was on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d with Trevor Noah she described it as being in \u201cthe lion\u2019s den.\u201d Does late-night comedy alienate conservatives? Winstead: I feel like if you are alienated by comedy, ask yourself, about your own personal assessment \u2026 ask yourself why you feel alienated. Are you willing to allow in all the information that surrounds you or are you desperately trying to cling to the set of facts you choose to believe even if they\u2019ve been disproven as facts? And so, if late-night (comedy) alienates you, I would have to ask you, what is it about the truth that you feel alienated by? \u201cFor the first time we\u2019re actually looking at the political ramifications of walking the earth with a uterus, which is kind of astounding.\u201d Lizz Winstead Should comedians put in more effort to include more conservative guests? Winstead: Well, I think conversation with people who don\u2019t think like you is always a good idea. Conversation with people who are willfully promoting fake news and pseudo science is legitimizing a platform of things that aren\u2019t true and I don\u2019t think that is good at all. If you could send President Trump a message or a tweet what would you say to him? Winstead: If I could say anything to Donald Trump it would be talk to some women, I think you need to.

A motion came to recess for 10 minutes, until the YDS meeting wrapped and its delegates \u2013 some of them salty over being rushed \u2013 could make their way to the main hall. At that, Laura, a DSA member from Buffalo, stood to register a point of information.

In the aftermath of President Donald Trump\u2019s election, DSA recruitment skyrocketed, from something like 8,000 in November 2016 to 25,000 dues-paying members on the even of the 2017 gathering in Chicago, according to organizers. As importantly, a new American left culture has found its spiritual home with the organization, growing up alongside and around DSA politics. If the 1960s political counterculture had rock music, the new socialists \u2013 their affection for a good sing-song notwithstanding \u2013 have podcasts, internet memes, and a vibrant independent media. Binding it all together in a single, recognizable package is Bernie Sanders. The Vermont independent \u2013 who identifies as a democratic socialist but is not a DSA member \u2013 \u201cbrought single payer into the mainstream discourse and Trump (and the Republican effort to gut Obamacare) lit it on fire,\u201d said Jeremy Gong, a member of California\u2019s East Bay DSA, and newly elected member of the group\u2019s national political committee. But even before the first 2016 primary vote was cast, a New York Times/CBS News poll caught a snapshot of the rising tide, with 56% of Democratic primary voters surveyed saying they held a positive view of socialism. For the many, not the few! #DSACon17 welcomes Marcus Barnett from U.K.'s Labour Party #BeautifulSocialists pic.twitter.com/mc9S8ZM4ti Chris Maisano, an organized labor veteran from New York City, was also voted in for a two-year term on the NPC. Earlier in the weekend, he helped lead a breakout session called \u201cElectoral Strategy for Socialists.\u201d \u201cThis was a big, boisterous and loud movement,\u201d he said, recalling the century-old heyday of Eugene V. Debs, a five-time Socialist Party presidential nominee. The road back to relevance was laden with tripwires. Cold War era crackdowns, open or implicit, Red-baiting, derailed opportunities to build a mass movement. Four decades of Democratic Party drift away from the policies of public control, often in favor of \u201cmarket-based solutions,\u201d and the success of union-busting strategies on the right, has kept the far left on the back foot. \u201cSanders did a really great and tremendous job of opening the conversation and helping us get out of the closet a little bit,\u201d Maisano said. A campaign, especially one with the insurgent spirit of Sanders\u2019 2016 bid, can galvanize support \u2013 and inject immediacy into a movement \u2013 in ways that meetings and readings and protests have failed. But the next steps will be more challenging. DSA, with its 25,000 members is both large, growing, and in the grand scheme of American politics, laughably small. The former, leaders say, will continue \u2013 and the latter upended \u2013 by one thing. \u201cI\u2019m serious about winning,\u201d said Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, the 28-year-old alderman from Chicago\u2019s 35th ward, who joined DSA and served as a Sanders delegate to the DNC. \u201cI\u2019m not dogmatic and I\u2019m extremely pragmatic. We need to assess how it is that we can win and elect Democratic Socialist values and that\u2019s going to take different forms in different places. In the end, the Democratic Party is not an end unto itself, nor is a third party an end unto itself, a party whether it be the Democratic Party of a third party, is a means to an end.\u201d Stood in solidarity with Mechanics' Union Local 701 picket in the @35th_Ward today. Their spirits are high! They will win! #UnionStrong #1u pic.twitter.com/oGFby6y7mY Given the chance to formally, and forcibly, extract themselves from any relationship with the Democrats, and promote a third party alternative, delegates in Chicago voted overwhelmingly against a call for the senator to establish his own. When faced with the question more broadly, a number of delegates and member observers I spoke to were openly skeptical. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to end up like the Green Party,\u201d one activist mused. Helping to secure victories for DSA-backed candidates, no matter their chosen ballot line, in even the smallest races is a key tactical priority for the organization\u2019s top officials. \u201cAs a historian and a movement person, I know that when people win, they are motivated, and when they lose, they are not motivated,\u201d said Maria Svart, DSA\u2019s national director. \u201cSo that\u2019s a big part of why we think it\u2019s really important to take that into account and be really pragmatic and realistic.\u201d The last six months have brought enough victories to meet the thirst. In South Fulton, Georgia, khalid kamau, a Black Lives Matter activist and endorsed DSA member won a seat on his city council. John Grant, a housing organizer in Seattle, won a DSA endorsement and, last week, the second slot in a run-off for a city council seat. pic.twitter.com/gpArG9Es09 Mike Sylvester, now in his first term in the Maine House of Representatives, was among DSA\u2019s first nationally backed candidates. His bona fides included years of union organizing down in Boston and, as evident in our conversation, the ability to drop the term \u201csocialist analysis\u201d seamlessly into otherwise light conversation. \u201cThe socialist organizations that I was in before (DSA) said you must believe these 15 dictums and these 59 subsections, otherwise you are tool of the capitalists,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cDSA has a much larger idea of what socialism is.\u201d Progressives who ripped Obamacare find themselves fighting to defend it Sylvester is ambitious too and was one of the few on hand in Chicago to venture openly into discussion of DSA\u2019s place on the national electoral scene, as the 2018 midterms and 2020 general election come up on the horizon. \u201cIt\u2019s our role to hold the left, to have a socialist analysis, to ask candidates where they are in terms of that \u2013 and not to move toward them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s to say, we can\u2019t support you because you\u2019re not for single payer, you\u2019re not for \u201cMedicare for all. That\u2019s a benchmark for us. A bottom-line issue.\u201d Indeed, conversations around the University of Illinois-Chicago Forum and in smaller conference rooms at the school\u2019s student center returned inexorably to health care. It was a matter of both conscience and, as many explained, a growing savvy. \u201cPolitics is about identity whether we like it or not now,\u201d said East Bay DSA organizer Jess Dervin-Ackerman, who worked as a digital organizing manager at NextGen Climate during the 2016 campaign. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about the issues. So when we go out and talk about single payer \u2013 we chose that issue for a reason: it will help mostly working people and marginalized people more than everyone else.\u201d When I asked her colleague at the East Bay chapter, Jeremy Gong, how DSA planned to persuade Democrats that socialism could advance the ball on what many identify as social issues, he pointed to abortion \u2013 and sought to frame it as a fundamentally economic one. \u201cThere is a false dichotomy between identity and class that has been leveraged by liberals (like those in the Clinton campaign),\u201d Gong said. \u201cWe can say that abortion is legal, but unless they are free and universally provided, so people don\u2019t have to drive very far to get them, like they do in places like Texas, then they are not actually guaranteed.\u201d Even if that argument is destined to lose with establishment Democrats, who are knee-deep in their own internecine squabbling, DSA\u2019s optimism is rooted in true belief. The message will sell, or it won\u2019t. Democrats' disastrous mistake on abortion Delegates in Chicago and the members who followed along on social media for details are disproportionately young. For many, their participation in both the single payer campaign \u2013 which included, for many, a place at the frontline in the fight to defend Obamacare \u2013 and the DSA\u2019s internal politics has been their first foray into activism of any kind. Leadership wants that first taste to be sweet. Svart, the national director, made the point by recalling a pervasive debate from the early days of Occupy Wall Street, back in the fall of 2011. Even as media members pressed them, and trollish political opponents prodded, OWS protesters often clashed over whether to issues an official slate of \u201cdemands.\u201d (Some OWS outposts did; most didn\u2019t.) \u201cPeople there didn\u2019t feel that the state was capable of responding to popular pressure. Young people tend have that perspective,\u201d Svart said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t lived through major social programs being created that changed the material reality of their lives.\u201d Ultimately though, DSA wants to offer something more. And Svart believe it will define their destiny. \u201cAs socialists, the ideological piece is so important because it\u2019s a lens through which people can understand the world. And they\u2019re not getting that anywhere else,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they\u2019re pissed off. We want to be fighting to change people\u2019s everyday lives and we want to be fighting for what we can actually win. We have this north star.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A recent Morning Consult national poll testing the approval ratings of the nation\u2019s governors produced a surprising \u2013 to me \u2013 result: The most popular governor in the country is Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker. Even in the liberal Bay State, 71% of residents approve of the job  the Republican Baker is doing. Seeking to explain the key to Baker\u2019s popularity, I reached out to Boston Globe political reporter James Pindell. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Charlie Baker is a Republican in 1 of the most Democratic states in the country. He\u2019s also the most popular governor in the country in a new Morning Consult poll. What gives? Pindell: Let\u2019s start with some context. Yes, Massachusetts is known as a liberal bastion of the country. Elizabeth Warren is serving in the same Senate seat once held by Ted Kennedy. Another Kennedy represents part of the state along with an entirely Democratic delegation in Washington. The state house has lopsided Democratic majorities in both chambers. But, like many places, the largest group of registered voters are independents. When it comes to governors, Bay State residents appear to like socially moderate/fiscally conservative Republicans, partly to serve as a check against Democrats. I write that because while I understand the premise of the first part of your question (how can a Republican lead Massachusetts) for locals it is actually not that surprising at all. Five of the last six Massachusetts governors were Republican. The second piece of context: things are going well in Massachusetts so it shouldn\u2019t come as a shock that the governor\u2019s approval ratings are high. US News and World Report named Massachusetts the number one state to live in the country. The unemployment rate is low. The public schools are among the best in the country. The world\u2019s leading hospitals and universities are here. Boston is tied with New York for the amount of venture capital funding projects. In fact, Boston is undergoing its biggest building boom in the city\u2019s history. Among the buildings being built is the new world headquarters for General Electric, something that Baker is partially credited for bringing to the state. Hell, the Red Sox are currently in first place the AL East. On top of all that context is Baker himself. When he ran in 2014 he did so as basically a non-partisan manager. He said he would watch the state\u2019s pocketbook after eight years of a Democratic governor who proposed a lot of new spending. At the same time Baker is for abortion rights and featured his brother\u2019s coming-out story in a legendary campaign ad. After becoming governor Baker has avoided national politics. He didn\u2019t even vote for president. Right after he took office the state faced huge blizzards that crippled an aging public transportation infrastructure. He got good grades for his emergency management and has since made fixing the MBTA a top priority. So in other words, Massachusetts voters have no problem with a Republican governor, things are going well, and Baker hasn\u2019t done anything so horrible to give people reason not give him high job approval ratings. Cillizza: Baker first emerged in politics in 2010 when he ran an underwhelming race against Gov. Deval Patrick in a very good Republican year nationally. What\u2019s changed about him as a politician since then? Pindell: Around here we say that there was Charlie in 2010 and then Charlie 2.0 in 2014. Learning the lessons of his defeat when he was seen as the angry white male, four years later he became the softer, gentler type. In 2010 Baker yelled at reporters, in 2014 he curried favor with them. In 2010 he said he was agnostic on the questions of global warming. In 2014, he believed in the science behind global warming. He favored abortion center buffer zones. He had a plan for homelessness. He was a guy you\u2019d wouldn\u2019t mind having a beer with. Cillizza: Baker seems to me in the Mitt Romney mold of Republicans who can win in Massachusetts: Businessman bringing practical principles to the government. Is the Romney comparison a fair one for Baker? Pindell: You just described how Republicans become Massachusetts governor. There is some Romney in there with Baker, sure, but his models are former Republican governors William Weld and Paul Cellucci. He worked for both. And where Romney began running for president the moment he became governor, Baker has only flirted a few times with it and it is not his modus operandi. Cillizza: Baker is up for re-election in 2018. He HAS to be a Democratic target \u2013 good poll numbers for him or not. Who is going to run? And how does the race look? Pindell: Even in Massachusetts and in President Trump\u2019s first midterm Baker appears like he will have a fairly easy reelection. A recent WBUR poll showed him beating all of his current opponents by roughly 30 percent in matchups. Yes, 30 percent. As my colleagues at the Globe have well documented, one of the main themes of Baker\u2019s first term is that Democrats have really struggled with how to criticize him. At the same time he is raising record amounts of money for his reelection, with the goal of $30 million. That stunning amount of cash, combined with his high approval ratings has meant that the big Democratic names (Attorney General Maura Healey, and US Reps. Seth Moulton and Joe Kennedy III) are all taking a pass at running. Those who are running are struggling for money and attention so far. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cIf Charlie Baker gets re-elected in 2018, the next political office he will run for is _______.\u201d Now, explain. Pindell: \u201cSwampscott, Mass. Board of Selectmen?\u201d His next shot at the The Big Show would be 2024 where he would likely be the anti-Trump option in a Republican primary also likely featuring Vice President Mike Pence. That is a REALLY long time from now so let\u2019s set that aside because, as I mentioned earlier, that is not the current MO. Of course, if he wins a strong reelection you can see a scenario where he will be encouraged to run for US Senate in 2020 against Democratic incumbent Ed Markey. I don\u2019t know what he would say to that if the time comes.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Joe Kennedy III's online presence has skyrocketed this year Two Democratic strategists offered dramatically different takes on the party's future Many Democrats expect Bernie Sanders to sit 2020 out because he\u2019d be 79 on Election Day. But the reality is, Sanders hasn\u2019t quit campaigning yet. The Vermont senator is back on the road this weekend. On Sunday he\u2019ll visit West Virginia and Kentucky \u2013 two red states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 to make the case that the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare would devastate rural America. The following weekend, he\u2019ll be back in Iowa, speaking at a populist group\u2019s political convention. Sanders\u2019 latest moves come a few days after Our Revolution, the political organization borne out of his 2016 campaign, joined with a handful of progressive and leftist groups to organize nationwide sit-ins protesting the Senate Republican health care bill. Vox\u2019s Matt Yglesias makes a case that Sanders is Democrats\u2019 2020 front-runner. There\u2019s no question Sanders has the biggest megaphone in progressive politics. He\u2019s also the only potential candidate with a nationwide network. And, quietly but importantly, he is moderating on some key issues. Two real challenges facing Sanders: accusations around his wife Jane Sanders\u2019 land deal at Burlington College are an ongoing headache and there\u2019s the reality that, in a wide-open Democratic primary, a host of campaigns would have reason to attack more aggressively than Hillary Clinton did. \u201cMost of the opposition research on Bernie Sanders aside from his opposition to gun safety measures has never seen the light of day,\u201d a Democratic operative told me. \u201cWith a large field of Democratic candidates competing, that will undoubtedly change and cause big problems for him.\u201d We\u2019re watching for Sanders to introduce his \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d single-payer health insurance bill in the coming weeks \u2014 to see if the details stand up to serious scrutiny, and to see how many Democrats sign onto the measure. The next President Kennedy?: Rep. Joe Kennedy III\u2019s online presence has skyrocketed this year, fueling more speculation that he\u2019s destined to become the next member of his family to seek the presidency. Matt Viser\u2019s Town & Country profile is a good introduction. Feinstein\u2019s burn: California Sen. Kamala Harris has built a major new following in recent weeks and is angling to build her national profile. But that didn\u2019t stop the state\u2019s senior senator, Dianne Feinstein, from delivering a terse reality check for the freshman senator, telling The New York Times that \u201cshe just got here.\u201d Booker\u2019s Pharma \u201cpause\u201d: New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker recently made an odd announcement aimed at wooing progressives who see him as too tight with the pharmaceutical lobby. \u201cWe put a pause on even receiving contributions from pharma companies because it arouses so much criticism,\u201d he told NPR. He didn\u2019t make clear how long this \u201cpause\u201d would last. A reminder that in January, he angered progressives by voting against a measure that would have allowed the importation of cheaper prescription drugs. Booker has \u2013 as The Intercept\u2019s Zaid Jilani lays out \u2013 worked hard to reverse perceptions of his approach to Pharma. Still, right now, that view is his biggest political liability as a 2020 prospect. Thus, the \u201cpause\u201d that\u2019s noncommittal enough that it just might backfire. (By the way, Booker tread carefully around a 2020 question this week. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future\u2019s going to bring,\u201d Booker told David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast. \u201cI\u2019m not making predictions, but I want to unleash the fullness of who I am right now, and I want to call out injustice where I see it.\u201d) Gillibrand vs. DeVos: New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a 2020 prospect, teamed up with Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill to urge Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to reverse her department\u2019s decision that they say hinders sexual assault investigations. \u201cWe have seen through our work on this issue that often if a school fails to protect students from sexual assault or mishandles an incident of sexual assault that this is rarely an isolated case on that campus,\u201d the two told DeVos in a letter. Klain and Penn\u2019s divergent advice: Two Democratic strategists with years of experience on the presidential level \u2013 Ron Klain and Mark Penn \u2013 offered dramatically different takes on the party\u2019s path back to relevance this week. In The Washington Post, Klain recommends a platform of defending Obamacare, offering four years of free higher education, fixes for the gig economy, making affordable child care a \u201cright\u201d \u2013 as well as \u201chonest talk\u201d that makes no excuses for diversity and makes clear that an education past high school is necessary. \u201cThe nostalgia for an America where brawn alone was enough to create a middle-class life and where a comfortable stagnation was revered as \u2018tradition\u2019 must be abandoned,\u201d Klain writes. In The New York Times, Penn asserts: \u201cThe path back to power for the Democratic Party today, as it was in the 1990s, is unquestionably to move to the center and reject the siren calls of the left, whose policies and ideas have weakened the party.\u201d In a stark contrast with Klain\u2019s advice on diversity, he calls on Democrats to reject \u201cidentity politics\u201d and moderate on abortion \u2013 and move to the right on a long list of issues.

Claire McCaskill won reelection to the Senate in 2012 against challenger Todd Akin Her Missouri seat is seen as among the most vulnerable for incumbent Democrats in 2018 A top Republican recruit announced Monday she wouldn\u2019t challenge Sen. Claire McCaskill for her Senate seat in 2018, sparing the Missouri Democrat a potentially stiff challenge in the high-stakes midterm elections next year. Rep. Ann Wagner said that she would instead run for reelection to the House of Representatives in a statement to the Washington Examiner on Monday. Wagner\u2019s office confirmed to CNN that she would not run for the Senate seat. \u201cThose who know me well know I put my family and my community first,\u201d she told the Examiner. \u201cWhile I am grateful for the incredible support and encouragement I have received from across Missouri to run for United States Senate, I am announcing today my intention to run for re-election to the United States House of Representatives in 2018.\u201d She added, \u201cThe 2nd District is my home. It\u2019s where I grew up, went to school, have worked and volunteered, raised my kids, and attend church every week \u2013 there is no greater honor than representing a place and people that I love.\u201d CNN has reached out to McCaskill\u2019s office for comment and have not yet received a response. McCaskill won reelection to the Senate in 2012 against challenger Todd Akin, whose campaign was derailed after his controversial comments about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and abortion. McCaskill defeated Akin by nearly 15 points, though she had been expected to struggle in the race prior to Akin\u2019s self-destruction. Her seat is seen as among the most vulnerable for incumbent Democrats in 2018. Wagner is member of the House foreign affairs committee and serves as the chair of the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House financial services committee \u2013 positions which afford her meaningful influence in the chamber. She was viewed as top potential challenger for McCaskill. Still, Wagner\u2019s decision to forego a Senate bid \u2013 in a solidly red state the last few cycles \u2013 also reflects the reluctance of some Republicans to raise their political profile in what looks to be a caustic and challenging election cycle.

            "article_content": "Kennedy, 80, has been a consistent swing vote in key Supreme Court rulings Dozens of his former clerks will be in Washington for a reunion this weekend Justice Anthony Kennedy, the man who so often determines the outcome of the most controversial Supreme Court cases, is himself the center of brewing speculation. Will he stay or will he go? The rumors have swirled for months and the 80-year-old justice has done nothing either personally or though intermediaries to set the record straight on whether he will step down. Helping drive the speculation, dozens of Kennedy\u2019s former law clerks traveled to Washington this weekend to participate in a private clerk reunion that occurs regularly \u2013 and many of them wondered if it will be their last chance to meet with him while he is still on the bench. At the end of a dinner with the former clerks Saturday night, Kennedy addressed the crowd, saying he had heard some speculation about an announcement tonight, \u201cand here it is,\u201d he said: The \u201cbar will be open after dinner.\u201d But sources close to Kennedy say that he is seriously considering retirement, although they are unclear if it could occur as early as this term. His departure would cause a seismic shift and offer President Donald Trump a chance to continue reshaping the court. Trump\u2019s first nominee \u2013 Justice Neil Gorsuch, himself a former Kennedy clerk \u2013 joined the court earlier this year. Like no other justice in recent history, Kennedy has cast the vital swing vote in cases that grab the countries\u2019 attention. To liberals he is a hero for Obergefell v. Hodges \u2013 a landmark opinion that cleared the way for same-sex marriage in 2015 and will likely be his most lasting legacy. \u201cThey ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right,\u201d Kennedy wrote. To the delight of abortion rights supporters, Kennedy voted to reaffirm the core holding of Roe v. Wade in 1992. \u201cAs the court\u2019s most important Justice \u2013 at the center of the institution\u2019s ideological balance \u2013 Justice Kennedy\u2019s ability to bridge the divide between left and right on critical issues such as the right to access abortion cannot be overstated,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. \u201cReplacing Justice Kennedy with a Trump nominee would almost certainly sound the death knell for Roe, just as candidate Trump promised during the 2016 campaign.\u201d But nine years later, he sided once again with the liberals on the court to strike down a Texas law that abortion rights supporters thought was the most strict nationwide. Without Kennedy\u2019s vote, the law would have been allowed to go into effect, inspiring other states to pass similar legislation. In the same term, Kennedy pivoted on the issue of affirmative action when he voted for the first time in favor of a race-conscious admissions plan at a public university. After that term, former acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal said, \u201cIt is very much Justice Kennedy\u2019s Court.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t understand how important his affirmative action opinion is without understanding his earlier jurisprudence,\u201d said Katyal. \u201cFor decades, he has been the court\u2019s most eloquent voice on the need to be color blind \u2013 why he changed his mind is something historians will debate for decades.\u201d However, sometimes Kennedy voted with the four conservatives on the bench. It was Kennedy who penned the majority opinion in Citizens United v. FEC \u2013 striking down election spending limits for corporations and unions in support of individual candidates. He\u2019s also sided with the right side of the bench on issues such as gun control and voting rights. Kennedy joined Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 2012 opinion, Shelby County V. Holder striking down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. And Kennedy sided with George W. Bush in the case that essentially decided the 2000 presidential election for the GOP candidate. On one side is his age \u2013 a desire to spend more time with his grandchildren is driving any decision, and in many ways he has already established an enduring legacy on the court. In terms of a replacement, Kennedy might take comfort in the list of 20 judges Trump has vowed to draw from when considering the next vacancy on the court. Another consideration is that if Kennedy were to delay his retirement for a year, his replacement would face confirmation during the mid-term election year, something that could further inject politics into an already controversial process. On the other hand, Kennedy is well aware of his role on the court and could be alarmed by how politicized the confirmation process has become. Indeed, Republicans were forced to change Senate rules to make it easier to confirm Gorsuch after Democrats objected. Kennedy might think it would make sense to remain on the bench until the political climate simmers down \u2013 although there\u2019s no guarantee that would ever happen. Retiring at 81 would not be all that much different than retiring at 80 and he would get to serve longer with Gorsuch as well as take up a case on next term\u2019s docket concerning partisan gerrymandering \u2013 an issue that might once again keep Kennedy in the spotlight.",

            "article_content": "Senators are likely to have only a handful of days to decide whether to support or vote against the bill Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has very little room for error The closely guarded Senate health care bill written entirely behind closed doors finally became public Thursday in a do-or-die moment for the Republican Party\u2019s winding efforts to repeal Obamacare. Read the Senate Republican health care bill (full text) The unveiling of the 142-page bill marks the first time that the majority of senators get a look at the plan to overhaul America\u2019s health care system. With Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pressing ahead for a vote next week, senators now only have a handful of days to decide whether to support or vote against the bill. Four conservative Republican senators \u2013 Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee \u2013 said they opposed the current version. And key votes such as Sens. Dean Heller and Susan Collins have also withheld support. \u201cAs currently drafted, this bill draft does not do nearly enough to lower premiums,\u201d Cruz said in a statement obtained by CNN. \u201cThat should be the central issue for Republicans \u2013 repealing Obamacare and making health care more affordable. Because of this, I cannot support it as currently drafted, and I do not believe it has the votes to pass the Senate. Here's where Republican senators stand on the health care bill The bill would repeal Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, drastically cut back federal support of Medicaid, and eliminate Obamacare\u2019s taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others. President Donald Trump praised the bill Thursday \u2013 though he acknowledged that changes were likely coming. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very good,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cA little negotiation but it\u2019s going to be very good.\u201d With the exception of some key changes \u2013 notably keeping Obamacare\u2019s subsidies to help people pay for individual coverage \u2013 the bill is similar to the version of the House measure that passed last month which Trump has since called \u201cmean\u201d despite having a Rose Garden celebration with House Republicans. Democrats blasted the bill, using Trump\u2019s \u201cmean\u201d judgment of the House bill. \u201cThe Senate bill needed heart, the way this bill cuts health care is heartless,\u201d said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cThis is a nasty bill and they\u2019re trying to cover it up with little things here and there.\u201d Schumer slams bill with giant 'mean-er' sign RELATED: Senate to White House on health care: No Trump, please McConnell\u2019s decision to keep the details tightly under wraps until Thursday was intentional and aimed at winning over his colleagues out of the public spotlight, but the secretive process has infuriated Democrats \u2013 and aggravated plenty of Republicans, too. McConnell has very little room for error \u2013 he can only lose two Republican votes and still pass the bill \u2013 and GOP senators were not jumping to support it. \u201cCurrently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation,\u201d Paul, Cruz, Johnson and Lee said in a joint statement. \u201cThere are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current health care system, but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs.\u201d Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told CNN that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for lawmakers to digest the bill in time for a vote next week. Heller \u2013 who will have a tough re-election in Nevada next year \u2013 expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the bill\u2019s impact on constituents who depend on Medicaid. \u201cIf the bill is good for Nevada, I\u2019ll vote for it and if it\u2019s not \u2013 I won\u2019t,\u201d Heller. Still, others were more upbeat. GOP Sen. John McCain, who has been openly critical of the lack of transparency in the crafting of the bill, said the proposal was better than Obamacare in \u201c100 ways.\u201d The bill will have to undergo parliamentary scrutiny to ensure that it meets the strict requirements on what can or can\u2019t be included in a bill under the budget reconciliation process. One report that will inform Senate Republicans as they decide whether to support the bill will be a score from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which says it will release it early next week. The CBO analysis will shed light on how much money the bill would cost and how many people would be covered. Senate Republicans hope to see better headlines from this CBO report than the one that the House GOP legislation received. CBO said the House bill would result in 23 million fewer people insured in 2026 than under Obamacare. Pre-existing conditions: The Senate bill would require insurers to cover those with pre-existing conditions and ban them from basing premiums on consumers\u2019 health history. But it would allow states to waive the federal mandate on what insurers must cover, known as the essential health benefits. This would allow insurers to offer less comprehensive policies, so those with pre-existing conditions may not have all of their treatments covered. Last-minute House concessions to conservatives would have allowed states to opt out of several protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Medicaid: This has been one of the central sticking points in the debate. The bill would continue the enhanced Medicaid expansion funding from Obamacare until 2021 and then phase it out over three years. This is a concession to moderates, who weren\u2019t pleased that the House version would end the enhanced support for new enrollees in 2020. However, conservatives also get some of what they want when it comes to overhauling the entire Medicaid program. The Senate bill would keep the House plan to send a fixed amount of money to states each year based on enrollment or as a lump sum block grant. But it would shrink the program even more over time by pegging the annual growth rate of those funds to standard inflation, rather than the more generous medical inflation, starting in 2025. This would likely force states to cut enrollment, benefits or provider payments. Premiums subsidies: The Senate bill would also largely maintain Obamacare\u2019s premium subsidies structure, but tighten the eligibility criteria starting in 2020. Fewer middle class folks would get help because only those earning up to 350% of the poverty level would qualify, rather than the 400% threshold contained in Obamacare. But it would also open up the subsidies to enrollees below the poverty level so those living in states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid could get some assistance. Senators opted to keep Obamacare\u2019s subsidies to prevent the funds from being used for abortions. The House bill called for creating tax credits based largely on age, but adding abortion restrictions to these credits could have run afoul of Senate rules governing the bill. Still, the similarities to Obamacare will likely infuriate conservatives such as Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who decried the House version as \u201cObamacare Lite.\u201d Planned Parenthood: As in the House bill, it would defund Planned Parenthood for one year. Cost-sharing subsides: The bill would also aim to shore up the existing Obamacare market by allocating funds for the cost-sharing subsidies until 2019. This will placate insurers, who were distraught by Trump\u2019s refusal to commit to continue making these payments, leading many carriers to hike rates or drop out of the exchanges for 2018.

            "article_content": "Senate talks continue; leaders plan to release bill Thursday Vote on legislation possible by end of next week Senate Republican leaders plan to release their health care plan Thursday, the first time the public \u2013 and their fellow GOP senators \u2013 will get to see what they have been working on behind closed doors. Georgia race: Republicans jittery about health care breathe sigh of relief And the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to release its analysis of the bill early next week, with a Senate vote possible before the July 4 recess. Here\u2019s a cheat sheet of what we know, don\u2019t know and think we know on the policy front at this hour: Medicaid reform An under appreciated element of the House bill was the extent to which it dramatically reformed the Medicaid program. The Senate bill would keep that overhaul, curtailing federal support by sending states a fixed amount per enrollee, known as a per capita cap. This change, along with eliminating funding for Medicaid expansion, would reduce spending on the program by at least $800 billion over 10 years. States would also have the option of receiving a lump sum each year as a block grant, in return for even more flexibility on how to administer the program. Regulatory waivers The waiver issue was all the rage in the House, and behind closed doors, has certainly been an area of contention in the Senate. Senate leaders have decided to address the most contentious issue head on \u2013 they plan to remove the waiver option for community rating, which bans insurers from charging higher premiums to those with pre-existing conditions. They will leave, or add, waivers for the following regulations: And a note of caution: There is still no guidance as to whether these waivers will survive the Senate parliamentarian and be allowed to be in the final bill. State stability fund The House included $138 billion to help states and insurers cover pricey patients in a variety of ways, primarily through things like high risk pools, and to help lower consumers\u2019 costs. This will be in the Senate bill as well, but several moderate senators have pushed for *significantly* more money for this fund. It\u2019s unclear how much will be added, but a sizable amount is likely needed to pacify senators like Susan Collins, who gave a private presentation on Maine\u2019s now-defunct high risk pool and noted for it to be taken nationwide. Of note, adding money to this fund (to the tune of $8 billion, targeted for those with pre-existing conditions in states that opted out of community waiver regulations) was positively *essential* to House Republicans passing their bill. This is a natural home for plussing up funding to appease senators (and a certain Oval Office inhabitant) wary of, say, charges that the bill is \u201cmean.\u201d Tax credits The House bill eliminated the Affordable Care Act\u2019s subsidies, which are based on income and cost of coverage, and replaced them with tax credits based mainly on age that started at $2,000 per year and peaked at $4,000 a year. That structure, according to analysts and Republicans alike, fell far short when it came to providing adequate financial help for lower income and older Americans. The Senate is expected to make the tax credit more generous for these groups. There\u2019s also been a significant push from people like Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski to add a geographic adjustment to the credit \u2013 something essential to ensuring her state isn\u2019t disproportionately hammered by the new subsidy structure. However, it could also further alienate conservatives, who are already upset that the tax credits are too similar to Obamacare\u2019s subsidies. To what degree all of this would be implemented \u2013 or if it all makes it in the final structure \u2013 remains somewhat unclear, but the House bill included an $85 billion placeholder for the Senate to utilize, so there is room to maneuver in what would be a crucial component of securing moderate Republican support. Opioid funds This is a central issue for Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, whose home state relies heavily on the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion to finance its addiction treatment and rehabilitation. The structure and size of the fund remains up in the air \u2013 Portman has made clear he\u2019d accept it through Medicaid, or via a separate fund of sorts and $45 billion over a decade has been a number that has been mentioned. But it\u2019s important enough to him \u2013 and to several other senators from states that have been crushed by the current epidemic \u2013 that it\u2019s likely to find its way into the bill in some form or fashion. Still, the path isn\u2019t entirely clear - conservatives have voiced concern about the new spending and structure of the fund. Rural hospital funding Keep a close eye on how Republicans try to address this issue \u2013 it may be key to securing the Murkowski\u2019s support. Alaska, according to analysts, would be hit particularly hard by the House version of the Republican American Health Care Act. The coverage losses and premium hits would be borderline catastrophic. Changes to the tax credit will address some of that, but funding for rural hospitals may be the best way to assuage some of her very real concerns. Short-term market stabilization GOP Senators including health committee Chairman Lamar Alexander and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson have called for some sort of short-term market-stabilization package to be included \u2013 provisions to essentially hold the markets over until a new law could be fully implemented. What that would entail is still very much unknown. Would they guarantee Cost Sharing Reduction funding for an additional year? Would they allow individuals to utilize subsidies outside the Obamacare exchanges in areas insurers have abandoned entirely? These are very consequential near-term question for a number of senators \u2013 and answers (and what it would mean for the cost of an overall bill) are still lacking. Medicaid growth rate Conservatives are pushing to change the way the growth rate is calculated for how federal payments are made to states. The House bill would peg the growth rate to medical inflation. A proposal that has been on the table in the Senate (and pushed heavily by Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey) would, by 2025, shift measure to regular inflation, something that would result in significantly deeper spending reductions for the program. For conservatives, who call the program bloated and unsustainable, this would be a major win. But for more moderate senators, like Portman and West Virginia\u2019s Sen. Shelly Moore Capito, it\u2019s likely a non-starter. It would likely force states to cut benefits, enrollment and provider rates. Medicaid expansion phase out Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is going away. The question is how quickly and in what form. The House bill froze the ability of states to join the program and essentially eliminated the expansion by ending enhanced federal funding for new enrollees in 2020. People who were continuously enrolled would be able to maintain their coverage, but the program has a high churn rate, so the House authors worked under the assumption that expansion beneficiaries would quickly dwindle and the program would end on its own. Senators and governors from expansion states have called that funding cliff unrealistic and too draconian. Senators pitched a seven-year glide path for the program. Senate GOP leaders have countered with a three-year glide path, starting in 2020, that would gradually drop the enhanced funding to the traditional match rate for expansion states over that period. It\u2019s still unclear whether that will fly with expansion state Republicans. How governors react will play a major role here, particularly in the case of Nevada, home to the most endangered GOP senator up for re-election next year, Dean Heller. Obamacare taxes Like the House bill, the taxes will be repealed. The question is when. The House bill, at the request of conservatives both outside and inside the halls of Congress, immediately repeals most of the taxes. The issue here is financing for the bill. Senate Republicans have made clear they\u2019d also love to immediately repeal all of Obamacare\u2019s taxes \u2013 but they\u2019re adding new money via the tax credit, and the more gradual Medicaid expansion phase out, and to risk pools, and potentially to an opioid fund and rural hospital money. And they\u2019re doing all of that while being required to have *at least* $133 billion in deficit savings over a 10-year period (which is actually more than is in the House bill, according to CBO.) So they need to find that money somehow. Delaying the repeal of certain taxes is a nifty way to do it, but it\u2019s something that is abhorrent to conservatives. So this remains an open question. Abortion Conservatives on Capitol Hill anxiously await health care bill The House bill prohibits federal funding for Planned Parenthood for a year. This is a major issue for Sens. Collins and Murkowski \u2013 a potential deal-breaker for both \u2013 who oppose limiting funds for the group. But there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s something Senate GOP leaders may not have to grapple with at all. Many aides believe the Senate Parliamentarian will strike this provision down on Byrd Rule grounds. There\u2019s also the lingering issues of the tax credits. There is widespread speculation that they can\u2019t attach Hyde language (no federal funds for abortions) to the new credits. Without it, conservatives may have even deeper problems with the credits (and it\u2019s worth noting, conservatives are already quite uncomfortable with the credits themselves.) Should they lose the ability to attach Hyde language, plus the ability to defund Planned Parenthood, that would be a significant loss for the anti-abortion groups who have pinned major policy hopes on this bill. Auto-enrollment This is an idea pushed by several senators \u2013 one that would markedly improve any CBO score\u2019s coverage numbers. It could also play a huge roll in market stabilization, essentially forcing younger, healthier people into the marketplace and as such, lowering overall costs. But it\u2019s something that would infuriate conservatives in the conference and talk of its existence in a final bill has faded in recent weeks. Experts also say it would be incredibly difficult to implement. We\u2019ll see if it somehow comes back to life. CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The polls were tight going in to Tuesday's Virginia primary, but Northam pulled away The results will be studied by Democrats plotting their way back to power When former congressman Tom Perriello made his surprise entrance into the Virginia Democratic gubernatorial primary in January, the stage looked set for an intra-party proxy war \u2013 the establishment, in the form of incumbent Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, put to the test by Perriello and the party\u2019s growing progressive insurgency. But while the campaign saw its share of sharp elbows, the dividing lines between the candidates were fuzzier than expected. The Clinton-Sanders redux race many expected \u2013 and some hoped for \u2013 never materialized. Instead, the animating questions were both broader, with President Donald Trump\u2019s long shadow looming, and narrower, as the candidates jostled over issues unique to the Commonwealth. Northam came out on top, picking up about 55% of the vote to Perriello\u2019s 45%, with 81% of the state reporting. In the end, his initial focus on the White House might have tripped up Perriello, whose profile is less of a state politician than megaphone for the Trump-era angst of the national party. And that could be the ultimate implication of this race for Democrats, who will continue to ask whether making Trump the focus of every contest is a more direct path back to power than zeroing in on local issues. If Northam\u2019s victory is any indication \u2013 and that too will be up for debate \u2013 then Democrats might be wise not to bank on \u201cthe resistance\u201d for too much, at least when they\u2019re vying for the support of their own party\u2019s rank-and-file. Perriello drew headlines at the outset of the campaign for his full-throated assault on Trump, an apparent effort to nationalize the race and coalesce the growing opposition to the incoming administration\u2019s controversial agenda. Northam initially centered his focus on statewide questions. But as primary day neared, the competing ideas about what issues should drive the race dovetailed. Northam, a doctor, upped his attacks on Trump, calling the President a \u201c\u2018narcissistic maniac\u201d in an ad last month. Despite their varying approaches, months on the trail have revealed two candidates as more alike than not. \u201cBoth of these candidates fit into the ideological tradition of (Democrats Terry) McAuliffe, (Tim) Kaine and (Mark) Warner,\u201d said Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. \u201cThis primary has been more of a contest of style, approach and focus than substantive policy differences.\u201d Perriello joined the race as resistance to the Trump agenda began to boom, and promised on the stump to make Virginia a bulwark against it. His bid was boosted soon thereafter by the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders and his political organization, \u201cOur Revolution,\u201d along with a laundry list of former aides to President Barack Obama. Among the Obama veterans to line up behind Perriello were 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe and former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, who more recently served as a top aide on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post to offer his blessing. Obama never joined Perriello on the campaign trail, as he did in 2010 when the congressman was fighting an ill-fated battle to keep his seat in the House. Still, Perriello touted his good relations with the popular former president, using video from the old re-election rally in a series of ads. One of the spots featured Obama, Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. At first expected to cruise to the nomination without a serious challenge, Northam countered with a broader slate of state-based support. The governor, Terry McAuliffe, backed his deputy. Virginia\u2019s Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, along with attorney general Mark Herring endorsed Northam. Both state House and Senate caucuses pledged their support just ahead of Perriello\u2019s announcement. As the campaign progressed, both candidates ran into roadblocks in the form of past votes that threatened to undermine their pitches to the party base. Perriello, who backed Obamacare, then defended his decision \u2013 and the law \u2013 when many of his Democratic colleagues backed off, was confronted on the trail for his support of the \u201cStupak Amendment,\u201d a proposed Obamacare tweak that would have denied federal money to insurance plans offering abortion coverage. (Perriello apologized on the trail, repeatedly, and while he currently has a 100% rating from abortion rights group NARAL, Northam won their endorsement.) With 54 hours of canvassing between them in the last 3 days, these 3 women are pumped to bring it home for @RalphNortham! Polls close at 7! pic.twitter.com/HDFw6yNytv Northam encountered his own difficulties. He was attacked for taking money from the increasingly controversial Dominion Energy, a regulated monopoly that serves as the state\u2019s largest energy supplier. Perriello announced early on that he would not accept donations from the influential company. Northam was also forced to cope with an admission that he voted \u2013 in 2000 and 2004 \u2013 for candidate and then President George W. Bush. Perriello drilled him on the decision throughout the campaign. \u201cI\u2019m the only person in this race that\u2019s been a Democrat my whole life,\u201d Perriello said at a forum in May. \u201cI voted for Democratic presidential candidates. I devoted my life for three years to trying to defeat George Bush\u2019s agenda while Ralph Northam was voting for him twice.\u201d At a town hall in Richmond a month earlier, Perriello suggested those votes would hamstring Northam in a general election debate with the likely GOP nominee, Ed Gillespie, who served as the Republican National Committee chair during Bush\u2019s re-election campaign before eventually working in his White House for 18 months. For Democrats, the fight to keep hold of the governor\u2019s mansion Virginia is only beginning. Northam, Perriello, DNC chair Tom Perez, McAuliffe and others are slated to gather for a unity event on Wednesday.",

Terry McAuliffe can't seek a second term, per state law If Democratic voters thought \u2013 or hoped \u2013 the Bernie Sanders versus Hillary Clinton saga was long since settled, then they apparently need to think again. Just across the Potomac River from the nation\u2019s capital, a fierce fight is playing out in the race for Virginia governor pitting the Sanders wing of the party, as channeled by former Rep. Tom Perriello, against the Clinton wing of the party, represented by Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam. The comparison seems apt on paper. Northam boasts support from all of the state\u2019s prominent Democrats and has a lengthy career in state government, which helped make him the consensus pick of the party establishment. Perriello, meanwhile, entered the race late, has zero experience in state government and is running as an unabashed liberal. But longtime Virginia political experts believe the comparison is not that simple. 2018 is beginning to look like a very good year for Democrats \u201cIt is really more a battle between the national wing of the Democratic Party versus the Virginia wing of the party,\u201d said Democratic political operative Ben Tribbett, who is not supporting a candidate in the race but has been tracking voting trends in the party for years. Tribbett believes Perriello\u2019s run is a test case for Democrats in Virginia. \u201cThe Democratic model in Virginia for several decades has been trying to get elected in a red state,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that Virginia is a blue state and it looks like it is getting bluer, the model for electing a governor in Virginia has changed.\u201d Northam represents the type of successful candidates that Virginia Democrats have run for years. Governor-turned-Senator Mark Warner once proudly boasted his \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association, talked up his \u201cSportsmen for Warner\u201d advocacy group and embraced the endorsement of NASCAR stars. In 2017, the two gubernatorial candidates are fighting over their mixed record on 2nd Amendment issues. Perriello is distancing himself from his own A rating from the NRA as a member of Congress. Northam is spinning a perfect 100% legislative voting record in 2013 from the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a local gun rights advocacy group. This poll shows Donald Trump is a BIG problem for Republicans \u201cI can\u2019t imagine Chuck Robb or Gerry Baliles or Mark Warner or Tim Kaine running the type of campaign that Tom Perriello is running,\u201d said Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center of Politics, referring to Democrats who triumphed in races for governor since the 1980s. Northam has stuck to the strategy that works. He has crisscrossed the state for the better part of the past four years in his capacity as the number two Democrat elected in state government. He has stuck close to current Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is term-limited under Virginia\u2019s unique state law that forbids governors from seeking re-election. Northam is focusing on a very specific set of issues Democrats rely on, talking up his support for abortion rights, expanding access to health care and keeping the state budget balanced. \u201cVoters in Virginia are looking a bit more at the comparative qualifications,\u201d said Sabato. \u201cNortham has two terms in the (state) Senate, one term as lieutenant governor. He is essentially next in line.\u201d His solid campaign has helped him keep his support from the state\u2019s popular Democratic leaders rock solid. But while they continue to stick by his campaign, they are reluctant to criticize Perriello in any way. \u201cListen, Tom had every right to get into the race, and I haven\u2019t said a bad word, and I\u2019d never say a bad word,\u201d said McAuliffe. \u201cIf Tom were the nominee the next day, I would be the first guy out there campaigning. What matters to me is getting a Democrat elected governor.\u201d And while Northam retains that support, Sabato argues a simple endorsement only goes so far. \u201cThey think they lend their names and that is worth thousands of votes,\u201d he said. \u201cActually it is worth the vote of their spouse, about half of the time.\u201d Free from the confines of the traditional campaign, Perriello has run an unconventional race, embracing the endorsement of liberal leaders from outside Virginia, holding a rally with Sanders, touting endorsements from former Clinton top aide John Podesta and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as well as raking in funding from sources outside the commonwealth. The 2020 Democratic race is underway. Here are 5 takeaways To date, Perriello has raised 51% of his more than $2 million in fundraising dollars from donors who do not live in the state. He has cashed big checks from figures like liberal activist George Soros and his family. All told, Perriello has raised more than $385,000 from people with the last name Soros. By comparison, 91% of Northam\u2019s more than $3 million in campaign cash comes from donors inside Virginia. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing that just a few years ago in Virginia would\u2019ve beaten a Democrat,\u201d said Sabato. Perriello is tapping into the angst over the Trump administration that is fueling Democratic enthusiasm in unprecedented ways. While he is not shying away from Virginia specific issues, he is also emphasizing topics like the battle over Obamacare (his campaign ad featuring an ambulance being crushed has reached viral status with more than 400,000 views on YouTube), the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban and the controversy over Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the US election. Perriello's big smash makes a mark, but will it resonate? \u201cIt is well beyond anything I have ever seen before,\u201d described Tribbett. \u201cIt is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Democrats to create an organizational structure that we\u2019ve never had.\u201d But Sabato warns that while Perriello\u2019s lurch to the left is what made his primary campaign viable, it could end up hurting his chances in the general election. Perriello\u2019s lack of state government experience and the fact that he has few contacts and connections in Richmond could be a drag on his campaign. However, despite Northam\u2019s obvious advantages in that department, his campaign has yet to seize on the issue in a tangible way that might expose Perriello\u2019s flaws. \u201cEither the Northam campaign is legitimately confident because of their private polls or they overconfident and lethargic,\u201d said Sabato. Public polls show the race in a virtual tie, which means that the outcome of the June 13 primary will likely come down to turnout \u2013 how many voters show up and exactly where they show up. If turnout is average, that could be an advantage for Northam. If turnout exceeds expectations that will likely indicate a surge of new voters \u2013 people potentially energized by Perriello\u2019s underdog campaign. \u201cOlder voters and the traditional voters will participate no matter what,\u201d said Tribbett. \u201cThe new voters that come in that add to your electorate tend to be younger voters. They tend to be people participating in a primary for the first time and they would be more open to a challenger to the establishment.\u201d But at this point, most Virginia Democrats remain reluctant to pick a winner, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of the electorate especially barely seven months after Donald Trump\u2019s shocking presidential win. The winner of the Northam-Perriello fight will face the winner of what has at times been an animated fight between Prince William County Supervisor Corey Stewart, State Sen. Frank Wagner, and former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, who came very close to upsetting Warner in a 2014 senate fight and is the perceived favorite in the upcoming primary.",

            "article_content": "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's leadership will be necessary to get a health care bill through Congress The Kentucky Republican helped ensure a conservative justice was confirmed to the Supreme Court A few hours after the House finally passed a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Mitch McConnell walked silently and expressionless from his office to a waiting black SUV outside the Capitol. Only his police detail and an aide were with him as he left the quiet building and drove off. The solitary scene was a sharp contrast from the crowded and boisterous victory rally President Donald Trump threw for relieved House Republicans in the White House Rose Garden after the vote. But it may capture the low-key, no-frills style of McConnell, the determined Senate majority leader from Kentucky, that could serve him well as he takes on one of the most important legislative challenges of his career. All eyes now turn to McConnell and his fellow Senate Republicans to see if they can accomplish what the House GOP did through fits and starts: Pull together an ideologically diverse conference and secure enough votes to get rid of Obamacare, a promise they\u2019ve made repeatedly but failed to keep since President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law passed in 2010. AMA, AARP, Cancer Society Oppose GOP's Plan \u201cThe Senate is looking forward to getting it,\u201d Trump said after the House vote. \u201cMitch McConnell knows how to do things, and I think we\u2019re going to have some really great health care for a long time.\u201d McConnell, who has led the Senate Republicans for a decade, may be one of the most disciplined politicians in America and therefore uniquely suited for the task. He will need all the self-control and detachment he can muster to steer the complex health bill through the competing demands \u2013 and passions \u2013 of the various factions of his caucus while also writing effective legislation that could set the nation\u2019s health policy for a generation. McConnell\u2019s reputation is that of the ultimate Washington insider, a talented legislative tactician who utilizes the dense Senate rules to achieve his goals. Those skills will be on display as he works to maximize what can pass using the Senate\u2019s complicated budget reconciliation process, which will allow Republicans to pass a repeal without any Democratic votes. Kasich: GOP health plan 'woefully inadequate' His working knowledge of the specialized ways of Washington, gained through 30 years in the Senate, make him someone who Trump, the outsider, needs to lean on to get the Obamacare repeal and other legislation passed. To date, despite GOP control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, Republicans have yet to score any major legislative accomplishments. That adds pressure on McConnell to get health care across the finish line. That process will begin in about two weeks after the Congressional Budget Office delivers its official score of the House bill, an estimate of what it will cost taxpayers and how many people will gain or lose health insurance because of it. The CBO said the original House measure in March could mean 24 million fewer people are insured by 2026 than under Obamacare. Senate votes to trigger nuclear option After that, McConnell will square off against Democrats in a critical behind-the-scenes debate \u2013 known in colorful Senate parlance as a \u201cByrd Bath\u201d \u2013 to determine which parts of the House bill meet the Senate\u2019s strict reconciliation rules and can stay in the bill and which parts must be cast aside. It\u2019s based largely on whether the provisions are related to taxes and spending and will lower the deficit or if they are unrelated policy matters that aren\u2019t allowed in a budget reconciliation bill. The judge is the non-partisan Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth McDonough, who will hear arguments on both sides before deciding. Warren cut off during Sessions debate McConnell is accustomed to the limelight even if he doesn\u2019t seek to bathe in it the way many politicians do. The 75-year-old sixth-term Kentuckian was unflinching in the face of withering criticism from Democrats after he blocked Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court last year and then used the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to make it easier for Trump to put his nominee, Neil Gorsuch, on the court. His defiance and fortitude won him praise and loyalty from most Republicans \u2013 including Trump. Republican senators routinely praise McConnell\u2019s leadership skills and soft-spoken but direct messaging style. For the most part, he doesn\u2019t suffer from the damaging internal backbiting many legislative leaders encounter. Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz once called him a \u201cliar\u201d on the Senate floor. But the clash was an aberration and McConnell responded coolly, dispatching other senior senators to chastise the younger Cruz. The only time recently that McConnell has shown anger in public was during a February debate over the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, to be attorney general, when McConnell abruptly interrupted Sen. Elizabeth Warren and accused her of breaking Senate rules that forbid one senator from disparaging another member on the floor, something she denied doing. \u201cShe was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,\u201d McConnell said of Warren. In the end, the late-night dust-up probably bolstered Warren\u2019s standing with liberals more than anything else. Annoyance can he heard in McConnell\u2019s voice occasionally on the floor when he gets into a back-and-forth with Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, or Schumer\u2019s predecessor Harry Reid of Nevada. But McConnell is typically on-message, reading dryly from a well-honed text written by his staff that lays out exactly what he wants to say about a given issue, and not an ounce more or less. And McConnell doesn\u2019t mind hammering his messages home, often repeating the same lines day after day until they take root in the debate. How Trump won another unlikely victory At news conferences, McConnell is unflappable, deflecting reporters who regularly bait him to criticize Trump. McConnell will be straightforward when he disagrees with the President \u2013 and has said he should stop tweeting so much \u2013 but McConnell has yet to make a major gaffe as he has juggled countless questions about Trump\u2019s unorthodox presidency. While McConnell is from the establishment wing of the party, he got behind Trump once the businessman won the nomination and never wavered the way House Speaker Paul Ryan did. While the two men are not close friends, they have a respectful working relationship. They meet in person or speak on the phone regularly. Trump called McConnell after the House vote Thursday, according to a White House official, to deliver the message that it\u2019s now the Senate leader\u2019s task to complete the work. McConnell is tighter with Vice President Mike Pence, the former House member who attends weekly meetings with Senate Republicans, and who was a critical force in getting the repeal bill through the House. Pence is expected to play a similar role as the Senate considers the bill. Republicans defend having no women in health care group For all his strengths as a politician, what McConnell may need most is the power of quiet persuasion as he works private meetings and phone calls to convince conservatives Republicans like Cruz and Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas to accept an outcome that more moderate members of the caucus like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska could vote for too. He might also need the courage to cut loose someone like Collins \u2013 or fellow Kentuckian Sen. Rand Paul, who has blasted the House bill \u2013  if he feels they won\u2019t support an emerging deal, something GOP aides say could happen. McConnell can afford to lose two members of his caucus and still get 51 votes with a tie-breaking vote from Pence. McConnell will lead a 13-member Senate working group on health care that will go behind closed-doors to try to hammer out a compromise over the next several weeks. If they reach a deal that can pass the Senate, McConnell then must determine whether to go into negotiations with the House to resolve differences between their bills or just send the House the Senate bill and force it to \u201ctake-it-or-leave it.\u201d McConnell\u2019s decision would be critical because, while the pressure could be enormous on the House to accept whatever the Senate can pass, it would be a risky gambit in that House Republicans could reject the Senate bill and the whole effort could fail. But before that happens there are many difficult issues McConnell must help resolve to get a bill through the Senate. What to do about the expansion of Medicaid, which is supported by some GOP senators in swing states that expanded their Medicaid programs under Obamacare but is opposed by some GOP senators in red states that did not expand? What to do about tax credits that make insurance more affordable for lower-income consumers but that are expensive to the treasury? House bill faces challenges in Senate, but GOP already talking What to do about Obamacare regulations that are popular with some senators because they protect consumers but abhorred by others who argue they are mandates from Washington that drive up premiums? The thorny issue of abortion is part of the debate too because the House bill includes language defunding Planned Parenthood. That won\u2019t sit well with some moderate Republicans who will want to take out the provision. But keeping it in could be a powerful incentive for conservative Republicans to accept other compromises in the bill they don\u2019t like. Each Republican senator has unique policy and political needs related the bill. It will be McConnell\u2019s job to understand and respect each situation and design a final bill that is carefully tailored to those imperatives and, in the end, is the least bad for most of them. He then must persuade the others, especially those not thrilled with the final agreement, to support it anyway. Democrats warn privately that McConnell might put the political interests of his 52-member conference \u2013 especially those up for re-election in 2018 \u2013 ahead of the repeal-and-replace effort. They think McConnell would be happier to remain in the majority in two years and still have Obamacare in place than to than to get rid of law but be in the minority. Democrats, don't get too giddy about 2018 If over the next few weeks, McConnell can use his skills to quietly and deftly thread the needle between his party\u2019s policy and political interests, he might be able to have both.",

Female leaders from the Democratic Party were out in force Wednesday evening \u2013 the gala\u2019s speakers included Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Maxine Waters, Sen. Tammy Duckworth and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, among others. Many of them spoke out against the Trump administration the night before the House was scheduled to vote on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. \u201cTrumpcare will raise your health costs, destroy the coverage for millions of Americans and undermine a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe must not let them succeed.\u201d The lawmakers\u2019 message of resistance extended beyond health care \u2013 the speakers were vocal about Trump\u2019s so-called Muslim ban, the environment and the importance of funding for women\u2019s health centers that provide abortions, among other topics. \u201cMen like Donald Trump come to power when their country\u2019s already in deep trouble, when their economies (are) already deeply flawed and when people in those countries begin to lose hope for a better future and start looking for someone to blame,\u201d said Warren, who noted that her first political donation was to Emily\u2019s List. \u201cI\u2019ve got news for Donald Trump: Up against our army, he doesn\u2019t stand a chance,\u201d Warren said. While acknowledging the pain of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss in their eyes, speakers also said there was reason to celebrate this election cycle \u2013 with four new female members of the Senate and eight elected to the House. \u201cIt hurts because Donald Trump is so manifestly unfit for the presidency,\u201d Emily\u2019s List President Stephanie Schriock said. \u201cIt hurts because Hillary Clinton was more ready for the challenges of that office than any candidate in generations.\u201d Emily\u2019s List has raised more than $500 million for its chosen candidates, and has trained more than 9,000 women to run for office, according to the group. \u201cWe must never stop fighting \u2013 fight, fight, fight,\u201d Giffords said.

            "article_content": "Warren faulted Obama for what she said was an overreliance on statistics Warren also discussed Democrats' debate over abortion politics Sen. Elizabeth Warren delivered an unsubtle criticism of former President Barack Obama in an interview published Monday, saying the former president and other politicians are out of touch with \u201cthe lived experiences of most Americans.\u201d Warren was interviewed by The Guardian while promoting her new book, \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight,\u201d amid heavy speculation about her plans for the 2020 presidential election. That speculation was only fanned over the weekend when President Donald Trump, at a rally in Pennsylvania, suggested that Warren would likely be his 2020 opponent. Speaking to the newspaper, Warren first looked back, attempting to diagnose Democrats\u2019 failures in the 2016 election. \u201cI think President Obama, like many others in both parties, talks about a set of big national statistics that look shiny and great but increasingly have giant blind spots. That GDP, unemployment, no longer reflect the lived experiences of most Americans. And the lived experiences of most Americans (are) that they are being left behind in this economy,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWorse than being left behind, they\u2019re being kicked in the teeth.\u201d Warren 'troubled' by Obama's big Wall Street speech payday Warren has been increasingly critical of Obama and members of her own party as Democrats have grasped for a path forward under the Trump administration. Last week, after it was reported Obama would deliver a paid speech reminiscent of the speaking engagements that undercut Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, Warren said she was \u201ctroubled\u201d by his decision. In her interview with The Guardian, Warren also stepped into the debate over abortion that has roiled Democratic politics lately \u2013 whether the party should be more accepting of candidates who oppose abortion rights in an effort to become competitive in traditionally conservative areas. Another leading liberal voice, Sen. Bernie Sanders, has helped drive this debate. He campaigned for a mayoral candidate in Nebraska who was supportive of polices restricting abortion, and asked about it by NPR, Sanders said, \u201cwe have got to appreciate where people come from\u2026you just can\u2019t exclude people who disagree with us on one issue.\u201d But Warren \u2013 perhaps foreshadowing a fault line for Democrats in 2020 \u2013 told the Guardian she would \u201cprobably not\u201d endorse a candidate who opposed abortion rights. \u201cLet me be clear. Look, I\u2019m pro-choice, I\u2019m strongly pro-choice, I\u2019ve been in these fights forever and forever and at the federal level this is powerfully important to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI get that not everyone in the Democratic party agrees with me, but I am in this fight all the way.\u201d Warren was also asked if the reasons she decided not to run for president in 2016 \u2013 among them, concern for her family \u2013 would prevent her from a 2020 bid, and didn\u2019t say no. She told the Guardian, \u201cI said I\u2019m in this fight, there\u2019s no pause about that. I can take whatever somebody wants to throw at me. It is harder when things get thrown at your family but that\u2019s become the reality of 21st-century politics.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump's arrival in office accelerated activism Massive increase in Planned Parenthood donations After a political novice with a controversial past with women rose to victory over the first woman to ever be a major political party\u2019s presidential nominee, more than a million people mobilized for one of the largest inauguration weekend protests in history. Less than 24 hours into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, people in the nation\u2019s capital and worldwide protested the newly inaugurated US leader \u2013 some among them crushed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss, others worried about Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s anti-abortion stance, others outraged about Trump\u2019s rhetoric on women and some motivated by a combination of those concerns and more. Since that day, the Women\u2019s March group has rolled out its own set of action items, titled \u201c10 Actions, 100 Days,\u201d which included the Day Without A Woman strike early last month. In that same stretch of time, involvement in other women\u2019s organizations has skyrocketed. Now, as the President marks his first 100 days in office, many involved in that movement are assessing progress and preparing for what\u2019s next. Climate protest takes on Trump's policies -- and the heat -- in DC march Emily\u2019s List, a group that supports Democratic women candidates who support abortion rights, has heard from over 11,000 women seeking a path to political office since Election Day. As of January 23, VoteRunLead had trained 5,000 women to run for office over a two-year period \u2013 2,300 of those trainings were in the two months following the election. \u201cSomething switched,\u201d VoteRunLead founder Erin Vilardi told CNN in January. How the world sees Trump, 100 days in The Republican-held Congress and executive branch have also garnered attention from women\u2019s groups for their anti-abortion actions, such as the reversal of the Mexico City Policy, which removed funding to NGOs that perform or promote abortions, and cuts to funding for the United Nations Population Fund, a program for women and girls, over abortion. Trump has also added abortion critics, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and Pence, who spoke at the March for Life the week following the Women\u2019s March in his first major address as vice president. Mallory Quigley, the communications director for the anti-abortion group the Susan B. Anthony List, called Trump \u201cincredible for the pro-life movement.\u201d Planned Parenthood \u2013 also a Women\u2019s March partner \u2013 has had more than 600,000 new individual donations since November 8. \u201cThe general theory here is \u2018stand up, fight back,\u2019 and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d said Dawn Laguenes, the executive vice president and chief brand officer of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. The fight over women\u2019s issues isn\u2019t exclusive to the beltway. With an eye on the 2018 midterm elections, more people are joining grass-roots efforts across the country. Over a thousand Arizonans signed up to become new volunteers at Planned Parenthood since the election, while at least 36,000 people turned out to women\u2019s marches in downtown Phoenix, Tucson and Flagstaff, according to the organization. One of Arizona\u2019s most vocal Planned Parenthood advocates, 17-year-old Deja Foxx, confronted the state\u2019s Republican Sen. Jeff Flake at a town hall, and questioned his stances on Planned Parenthood and Title X funding. \u201cI was really, really angry I felt, because he kept dodging us at rallies,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cIt just seemed as though we were being ignored. And I don\u2019t want to be ignored by someone whose job it is to represent me.\u201d EPA removes climate change information from website The Susan B. Anthony List garnered more than 40 anti-abortion groups to support Gorsuch after his nomination, focusing on states including Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, North Dakota, Montana, Pennsylvania and Florida \u2013 where Senate Democrats are up for re-election in 2018, according to Quigley. \u201cSusan B. Anthony List and its partnered super PAC, Women Speak Out, spent more than $18 million in the 2016 election cycle, knocking on more than 1.1 million doors in battleground states to defeat Hillary Clinton and maintain a pro-life Senate,\u201d a news release from the Susan B. Anthony List said. A list released by the White House that outlines Trump\u2019s first 100 day accomplishments cites his actions on women in entrepreneurship and space exploration. However, many have also criticized Trump for policies involving women. In April, Trump signed an executive order that revoked an Obama-era policy that made companies with federal contracts comply with 14 civil rights and labor laws, an action that opponents say undid victories for women in the workplace. The President also privately signed a bill that allows states to withhold federal money from organizations that provide abortion services, including Planned Parenthood. Foxx credits Planned Parenthood with helping her navigate the health care system and providing her with quality reproductive care and education. Her care is completely covered by Title X, the only federal grant program dedicated to comprehensive family planning and preventative health care. \u201cI am first and foremost a Planned Parenthood patient, that\u2019s the background that I come from, and that\u2019s one of the things that makes me feel passionate about this work,\u201d Foxx said. A mother of two, Lori Hawkins, has used Planned Parenthood since college because of what she calls the organization\u2019s \u201ckind and competent\u201d health care. A screening at Planned Parenthood led to the discovery of damaging tumors and cysts on her ovaries that, if uncaught, would have prevented her from having children. Hawkins, who lives in House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s Wisconsin district, decided to become more involved after attending a meeting in her community, where she connected with a Planned Parenthood representative. Hawkins then participated in a press conference in Kenosha with the group\u2019s president, Cecile Richards, and other users of the group\u2019s health care services. The next week, she traveled to Washington, DC, for Planned Parenthood\u2019s lobby day. By the numbers: How Trump stacks up after 100 days \u201cMy daughter said to me, \u2018Mom I really want to go to Washington, DC, with you.\u2019 And I thought oh of course you do, it\u2019s time away from school, and I said jokingly, \u2018Well why do you want to go to Washington, DC?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Because I want to have the opportunity to sit in Paul Ryan\u2019s office and let him understand that I wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for Planned Parenthood.\u2019 \u201c She says going to Washington is just the beginning of her work for Planned Parenthood. \u201cI\u2019m just not afraid of standing up for Planned Parenthood, and for what I believe in,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve even gone so far as to sign up for some trainings to be more savvy on speaking out in public, and you know, maybe running for office one day, or becoming a lobbyist. It kinda just lit a fire under me.\u201d",

The analysis is consistent with other recent surveys that have shown voters who backed Trump in November are still fervently behind him. But Pew\u2019s data is notable because Trump is a relative newcomer to the evangelical community, a critical voting bloc that helped power his underdog victory. The guilt-free gospel of Donald Trump CNN/ORC Poll: At 100 days, Trump approval rating shows no sign of growth Eight in 10 white evangelicals who attend church at least once a month approve of how the President is leading the country, the analysis finds, a number consistent with the 77% that Pew found backed him in the months before Election Day. CNN exit polls found 80% of white evangelicals backed Trump during the general election. Recent national polls have found Trump\u2019s approval rating hovering around 40%. Pew\u2019s findings, released Wednesday, also found white evangelicals who attend church less regularly back Trump at 71%. Although Trump, a self-described Presbyterian Protestant, is attracting headlines for approaching his 100th day in office without a cornerstone legislative achievement, he has delivered on many of the campaign promises that helped him attract white evangelicals to his campaign. Part of Trump\u2019s appeal to white evangelicals was his stated campaign promise to \u201cprotect religious liberty.\u201d Some House lawmakers, however, say he hasn\u2019t gone far enough \u2013 a letter penned by more than 50 Republican members of Congress earlier this month urged him to take \u201cprompt executive action\u201d to allow churches a freer hand in political activism while retaining their tax-exempt status. \u201cNumerous times, you reiterated your support for restoring the free speech rights of charities and churches threatened by the unconstitutional nature of the Johnson Amendment,\u201d the letter said, referring to a provision of tax law that bars religious organizations from endorsing political candidates. \u201cThe recent revelations of IRS targeting of conservative groups along with regularly issued demand letters sent to churches by outside entities, has created a chilling effect on pastors from merely mentioning political events.\u201d \u201cExecutive and legislative action is also needed to protect religious liberty in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent redefinition of marriage\u201d that legalized same sex marriage nationwide, it added. The White House did not respond to CNN to comment on the letter.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has served as unifying force for a fractured Democratic party His first 100 days in office have been marked by energetic protests from the left The messaging woes with rural, white Americans, the hurt feelings over a bitter primary, the lagging national party infrastructure, the Republican-dominated statehouses decimating unions and limiting voting access \u2013 all of the challenges that doomed Democrats in 2016\u2019s election still exist. But the party also finds itself with a singular asset that might overpower any of those deep, structural woes: Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. The first 100 days of Trump\u2019s tenure in office has infused the progressive base of the Democratic Party with an energy \u2013 and an eagerness to fight \u2013 that party elders have never before seen. The women\u2019s marches and the emergence of an even broader-based, liberal version of the tea party led by new groups like Indivisible, have brought into the party new activists willing to do the grunt work of organizing locally. That energy has manifested itself in massive turnouts even at far-flung town halls hosted by Republican members of Congress, as well as in an unprecedented non-election year fundraising surge for progressive organizations. Other new groups, including Run for Something, are helping recruit and train candidates \u2013 some of whom will compete in places previously ignored by Democrats. One thing is holding it all together: Trump. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee compared Trump\u2019s presidency to a mix of \u201ccomic opera and tragedy.\u201d \u201cYou almost expect him to say, \u2018Who knew the North and South was so complicated?\u2019\u201d Inslee said in an interview, referring to Trump\u2019s claim he\u2019d sent an \u201carmada\u201d to the Korean peninsula when in fact the aircraft carrier was en route to the Indian Ocean. \u201cYou sort of expect him to nominate Bill O\u2019Reilly for man of the year.\u201d Ben Ray Lujan, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2013 the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm \u2013 said in the party\u2019s weekly address marking Trump\u2019s 100 days in office that \u201cit seems like President Trump spends more time golfing than governing.\u201d While Democrats have a common enemy, they still don\u2019t have a common message \u2013 or a single leader. With Barack Obama enjoying retirement and the Clintons off politics\u2019 main stage, Democrats no longer have a star figure to counterbalance Trump. RELATED: Democrats\u2019 \u2018unity tour\u2019 is highlighting their many divisions Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, was successfully able to muster a filibuster against Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, forcing Republicans to invoke the \u201cnuclear option\u201d taking away the filibuster for future high court picks. And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, has kept her ranks from supporting Trump. Yet those figures help Democrats win process battles \u2013 not identify a positive message to sell to the nation. Others on Capitol Hill \u2013 particularly Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and California Sen. Kamala Harris \u2013 are being looked to for leadership. Gillibrand won progressives\u2019 praise by casting the most \u201cno\u201d votes against Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has by far the biggest megaphone of anyone on the left. Yet in an interview alongside new Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez in the middle of their joint unity tour, Sanders told MSNBC he isn\u2019t a Democrat \u2013 he\u2019s an independent. RELATED: Bernie Sanders stands by anti-abortion mayoral candidate Still, Democrats insist they aren\u2019t worried. Some party officials and Democratic veterans pointed to the Republican rise of the tea party in 2009 and 2010, noting that its messages never really developed beyond stopping Obama and his push for health care reform. Trump isn\u2019t likely to stop provoking liberals\u2019 ire, those Democrats said. \u201cThere\u2019s like five assaults on progressive values a day, depending on the tweets,\u201d said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress. \u201cHe\u2019s doing nothing to make anyone do anything but dislike him.\u201d Democrats are now largely focused on special elections for House seats vacated by Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. The party nearly pulled off a shocker in Kansas \u2013 with no investment from the national party. Then, in Georgia, online fundraising superstar Jon Ossoff came within 2 percentage points of capturing what was once Newt Gingrich\u2019s seat in Congress \u2013 and has another shot in a June runoff. RELATED: Progressives see reason for optimism after near-win in Georgia Those close results in normally deep-red districts have buoyed Democrats\u2019 hopes for the 2018 midterm elections \u2013 even if party activists were disappointed not to net any wins yet. \u201cThe current playing field \u2013 this handful of special elections \u2013 is on a tiny, unrepresentative patch of the country that is far more Republican than the nation as a whole,\u201d said David Nir, the political director for Daily Kos, the liberal blog that helped Ossoff raise an eye-popping $8.3 million in 2017\u2019s first quarter. \u201cBut plenty of Republicans who sit in much more vulnerable districts will be up for re-election next year,\u201d Nir said. \u201cIf they slip by anywhere near as a big a margin as the GOP did (in Georgia and Kansas), a lot of them are going to lose. And DC Republicans can\u2019t go all in with millions in spending to save every at-risk GOP incumbent next year.\u201d As for leaders, Perez has taken the helm of the DNC and is now in his second month attempting to rebuild the organization. Much of the behind-the-scenes work of preparing the infrastructure for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential race could fall to him. RELATED: How Tom Perez is trying to fix the DNC Other Democratic organizations are also preparing to play new roles. The super PAC Priorities USA brought Democratic super lawyer Marc Elias onto its board and is focusing on voting access. Former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a new group\u2019s efforts to fight gerrymandering in courts and back Democratic state lawmakers so the party has more say in the redistricting process. Tanden, meanwhile, has organized a May \u201cIdeas Conference\u201d with a star-studded lineup that looks like the first cattle call of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. But Democrats say they\u2019re not worried the party doesn\u2019t have a single standard-bearer today. \u201cThe heroes are on the street right now,\u201d said Inslee, who led the legal battle against Trump\u2019s executive order banning travel from seven majority Muslim nations. Inslee recalled a ferry ride to the women\u2019s march in January, where he saw an old friend who had never been politically active. She was wearing a pink hat \u2013 and had brought 10 of her friends with her. \u201cIt\u2019s been very successful organically without any particular strategic thought,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very gut-level, sincere, powerful effort to resist a departure from basic American values. And the fact that it has been organic and natural without a dime\u2019s worth of provocation is pretty amazing.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Karen Hadel is the former Georgia secretary of state who twice unsuccessfully sought state office Republicans must decide whether they want to unite behind her after some targeted her with attacks In Karen Handel, Republicans found an experienced political hand to take on Democratic online fundraising star Jon Ossoff in the runoff for a hotly contested House seat in Georgia. But with Handel\u2019s political experience comes baggage. The former Georgia secretary of state\u2019s stances on social issues are certain to be a focus in the runoff \u2013 particularly her effort to stop the Susan G. Komen Foundation, the breast cancer charity where she was senior vice president for policy, from funding screenings through Planned Parenthood because she opposes abortion rights. She later wrote a book, \u201cPlanned Bullyhood,\u201d about the episode. After finishing second out of 18 candidates with 19.8% of the vote in the special election \u2013 and first among 11 Republicans \u2013 Handel will now square off with Ossoff in a June runoff. The contest has largely been seen as a test of President Donald Trump\u2019s popularity \u2013 particularly because he barely won the district, even though his pick for health and human services secretary, former Rep. Tom Price, was re-elected in 2016 by more than 20 points, and Mitt Romney had carried the district by 23 points in 2012. Handel raised eyebrows when she didn\u2019t mention Trump at all in her speech Tuesday night. But she tweeted Wednesday morning that the President had called her. And, asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d whether Trump would campaign for her, she said: \u201cI would hope so.\u201d RELATED: Jon Ossoff doesn\u2019t live in his district. That might be a problem. \u201cHe just called to say, \u2018Congratulations\u2019 and encourage me and let me know that as we go into June 20, that it\u2019s all-hands-on-deck for Republicans and we take it very seriously,\u201d she said. Handel, 55, grew up in the Washington suburbs in Maryland and moved to Atlanta in the 1990s for her husband\u2019s work. She later became a Fulton County commissioner and then Georgia\u2019s secretary of state. Handel has twice run unsuccessfully for higher office, losing in GOP primaries both times. In 2010, she was defeated in a governor\u2019s race by Nathan Deal. And in 2014, she unsuccessfully sought a US Senate seat won by David Perdue. Since her 2010 campaign, Handel has been \u2013 as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution put it \u2013 on the outside of local Republican politics looking in. John Garst, a Handel consultant, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it\u2019s now up to Georgia\u2019s Republican heavyweights to decide whether to rally behind Handel. \u201cNow we have the question: Will the Republican power crowd that isn\u2019t here right now, and they\u2019re not going to be here tonight \u2013 there\u2019s going to be some talking done in the backroom. Do they get behind her or do they not?\u201d Handel was targeted by other Republicans during the 6th District jungle primary \u2013 including Dan Moody, whose campaign aired a memorable ad portraying Handel, who often wears a pearl necklace, as an elephant wearing an enormous set of pearls. She was also attacked by the Club for Growth over what it called out-of-control spending \u2013 particularly on her office budget \u2013 as a Fulton County commissioner. RELATED: This Georgia special election is all about Donald Trump Democrats are already readying their attacks against Handel, signaling they are prepared to pick up on the spending-related attacks. \u201cHandel\u2019s career as a big-spending career politician will haunt her candidacy,\u201d Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee press secretary Evan Lukaske said in a memo. Handel\u2019s efforts as secretary of state to purge Georgia\u2019s voter rolls by requiring voters to prove their citizenship led to fights with the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. In an interview last month, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez \u2013 who led the Civil Rights Division during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term \u2013 said voters would hear \u201ca lot\u201d about Handel\u2019s efforts to require voters to prove their citizenship if she advanced to the runoff. \u201cSecretaries of state matter, and when they\u2019re good, then people can actually vote who are eligible to vote. And when they\u2019re following the ALEC playbook of the far right, they make it harder for people to vote,\u201d Perez said, referring to the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council.

            "article_content": "Gorsuch offered a message of unity on Monday He might have to go farther than other Supreme Court nominees in explaining his position on abortion rights Fireworks are expected on day two of the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. On Tuesday, each senator on the Judiciary Committee will get 30 minutes to grill President Donald Trump\u2019s pick. The session is expected to last 10 hours, following a lengthy \u2014 and telling \u2014 round of opening statements from senators and Gorsuch. Here\u2019s what we learned Monday and what\u2019s tap for Tuesday: Gorsuch, who didn\u2019t speak until the end of Monday\u2019s four-hour hearing, delivered a heartfelt speech to a silent room, at times growing emotional. But the bottom line was a message of unity. \u201cLong before we are Republicans or Democrats \u2013 we are Americans,\u201d the 49-year-old judge said. Not only did he talk about his family\u2019s impact on his life, but he also expressed support for judges across the country. This comes after Trump made headlines twice in the past year for attacking judges whose decisions he disagreed with. Gorsuch did not bring up those attacks on Monday, but in his meetings with senators leading up to his hearing, he said attacks on judges  were \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d \u201cI want to thank my fellow judges across the country,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cJudging is sometimes a lonely and hard job, but I have seen how these men and women work with courage and collegiality, independence and integrity. Their work helps make the promises of our Constitution and laws real for us all.\u201d Tuesday, he is all but certain to be asked directly about Trump\u2019s comments. Notably, two of the three men who introduced Gorsuch at the hearing were Democrats. Despite the bipartisan showmanship, both used some of their time to go negative, ripping into Republicans for blocking Merrick Garland \u2013 President Barack Obama\u2019s pick for the same seat last year \u2013 and blasting Trump for his attacks on the judiciary. One of them was Obama\u2019s acting solicitor general, Neal Katyal, who successfully challenged the Trump administration\u2019s new travel ban in federal court in Hawaii. \u201cIt is a tragedy of national proportions that Merrick Garland does not sit on the court, and it would take a lot to get over that,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, there are less than a handful of people that the president could have nominated to even start to rebuild that loss of trust, but in my opinion Neil Gorsuch is one.\u201d Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado was respectful of Gorsuch, but he made it clear that his introduction didn\u2019t necessarily mean he would vote for the judge and that he was doing the introduction out of tradition. \u201cIt is customary for senators to introduce nominees from their home states,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not here today to take a position or persuade any of our colleagues how to vote. I am keeping an open mind about this nomination and expect this week\u2019s hearing will shed light on Judge Gorsuch\u2019s judicial approach and views of the law.\u201d Bennet called Senate Republicans\u2019 treatment of Garland an \u201can embarrassment to this body,\u201d and said \u201cit is tempting to deny Judge Gorsuch a fair hearing\u201d as well. \u201cBut two wrongs never make a right,\u201d he added. At times on Monday, it was difficult to remember that Gorsuch was the focus of the hearing. Democrats frequently sought to remind the public that Republicans orchestrated a strategy to keep Obama\u2019s nominee from ever receiving a hearing, thus keeping the seat open until a new president was inaugurated. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, called it an \u201cextraordinary blockade\u201d that was \u201ctotally unprecedented in our country\u2019s whole history.\u201d Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said it was part of a \u201cRepublican strategy to capture our judicial branch of government.\u201d Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, argued that under normal circumstances, Gorsuch would be deserving of the \u201cbenefit of the doubt,\u201d but circumstances changed after Republican senators \u201cdenied any semblance of due legislative process\u201d for Garland. Looking up from his notes to make direct eye contact with Gorsuch. Whitehouse told the judge that Garland was \u201ceven more qualified than you \u2013 and that\u2019s saying something.\u201d Texas Republican Ted Cruz responded later by saying, in essence: We won. Cruz sharply defended Republicans\u2019 decision to hold the seat vacant, saying the presidential election was also a \u201creferendum on the kind of justice that should replace Justice Scalia.\u201d \u201cGiven the engagement of the electorate nationally on this central issue, I would suggest that Judge Gorsuch is no ordinary nominee,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBecause of this unique and transparent process \u2013 unprecedented in the nation\u2019s history \u2013 his nomination carries with it a super legitimacy,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe American people played a very direct role in helping choose this nominee.\u201d The question for Tuesday: Have Democrats shouted themselves out on Garland, or is there more to come? Several senators signaled their upcoming line of questioning by bringing up specific decisions or comments by Gorsuch that they didn\u2019t like. Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar expressed concern about Gorsuch\u2019s past criticism of a doctrine known as \u201cChevron deference.\u201d In the simplest terms, back in 1984, the Supreme Court held in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council that when a law is ambiguous, courts must defer to the interpretation of a law adopted by the federal agency charged with enforcing that law, as long as the interpretation is reasonable. Liberals in recent years have tended to support Chevron because when there is congressional gridlock, Democratic presidents have interpreted older statutes having to do with issues such as the environment and labor to allow them to implement broader protections. President Obama was especially active on that front. But Gorsuch has argued the doctrine gives agencies too much power to say what the law is, which is really the job of the courts. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, brought up a case in which a trucker was fired for abandoning his broken-down trailer in freezing temperatures to seek safety. The trucker, Alphonse Maddin, filed a complaint asserting that his firing violated a federal safety law. In a 2-1 decision the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Maddin\u2019s favor. Gorsuch dissented. \u201cA trucker was stranded on the side of the road, late at night, in cold weather, and his trailer brakes were stuck,\u201d Gorsuch wrote and noted that the company \u201cfired him for disobeying orders and abandoning its trailer and goods.\u201d \u201cIt might be fair to ask whether TransAm\u2019s decision was a wise or kind one,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s not our job to answer questions like that. Our only task is to decide whether the decision was an illegal one.\u201d Gorsuch concluded it wasn\u2019t. His dissenting opinion is something Democrats are likely to harp on to paint Gorsuch in a negative, less humane light. Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal also suggested that Gorsuch might have to go farther than other Supreme Court nominees have in explaining his position on Roe v. Wade \u2013 the landmark opinion that legalized abortion, in part because Trump announced that he was going to appoint \u201cPro-life judges.\u201d \u201cIf you fail to be explicit and forthcoming and definite in your responses, we have to assume that you will pass the Trump litmus test,\u201d Blumenthal warned. Leonard Leo, an attorney currently on leave from the conservative Federalist Society, who helped Trump pick the nominee, called Blumenthal\u2019s potential question \u201cfar-reaching and dangerous.\u201d \u201cThe President never sought promises from the judge on future cases, and Judge Gorsuch never made any,\u201d Leo added. \u201cJudge Gorsuch can\u2019t make these promises on how he might rule.\u201d It\u2019s rare for anything to outshine a Supreme Court confirmation hearing. But that\u2019s what happened Monday when FBI director James Comey testified before the House Intelligence Committee, saying no evidence had been found to back up the president\u2019s claim that Obama had wiretapped the phones at Trump Tower. At the same hearing, Comey also confirmed for the first time that the FBI is investigating whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow while Russia was interfering in the presidential election. Those were major headlines that dominated news coverage all day Monday, but Comey won\u2019t be returning to the Hill on Tuesday, and the spotlight will be squarely focused on Gorsuch. Asked if the Russia and wiretapping news is sucking all the oxygen out of the Supreme Court debate, Blumenthal told reporters Monday after the hearing that he\u2019s not concerned. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be overshadowed. I think for the purposes of our decisionmaking, it will be immensely important in what my colleagues and perhaps I had to say today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut much more important will be what Judge Gorsuch has to say tomorrow.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans' efforts to make good on a long-running universal campaign pledge are on shaky ground The opening volleys of the Trumpcare fight bear some uncanny resemblances to the Obamacare saga It\u2019s been nearly seven years since former President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. For every one of those years, as Democrats tried to help the law take hold, Republicans have been craving a moment like this. Repealing and replacing Obamacare is within their grasp. But even with a firm grip on power, Republicans\u2019 efforts to make good on that long-running universal campaign pledge are on shaky ground. If this sounds in any way familiar, well, it should. The opening volleys of the Trumpcare fight bear some uncanny resemblances to the Obamacare saga, with Republicans stepping in many of the same puddles their Democratic colleagues did back in 2009 and 2010. Here\u2019s a look at some of the similarities: President Donald Trump will be the standard-bearer for the law Republicans eventually deliver to his desk. But like Obama and Obamacare, he, too, has outsourced its actual construction to partisan allies on Capitol Hill. In 2009, the moderate Montana Democrat Sen. Max Baucus took control of the process and steered the bill, which he had workshopped with a bipartisan \u201cGang of Six\u201d through the Senate Finance Committee over Republican objections. That bill eventually passed the Senate along party lines, 60-39, but after Republican Scott Brown won a special election to replace the late Sen. Ted Kennedy in January 2010, the Democrats\u2019 filibuster-proof majority was broken. That meant House Democrats, who had previously passed a more progressive bill that included a public option, would have to approve the Senate\u2019s, which did not. House Democrats had to take it or leave it. The Obama administration stepped up to close the deal. Obama made a hard sell during his State of the Union address, then hosted a White House health care summit in late February. After debating, then placating a group of anti-abortion holdouts, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi eventually delivered \u2013 without a single GOP defector \u2013 a 219-212 vote to approve the Senate bill. Days later, Obama would sign into law the reform package that, informally but inescapably, now bears his name. Many of the House members who delivered those difficult votes were swept out in 2010 in a tea party wave from which Democrats have still not recovered. There were some shadows of these events on Capitol Hill this week when House Speaker Paul Ryan pledged there would be 218 votes \u2013 the bare minimum \u2013 for the first leg of Obamacare repeal. And Trump warned Republicans, whose consternation at the bill unveiled by GOP elders has since turned to outright rebellion, that they would suffer a \u201cbloodbath\u201d if they vote no. They, too, can take it or leave it. If Kennedy had lived another few years or his would-be elected successor, Martha Coakley, won her special election to the Senate, the bill that landed on Obama\u2019s desk in March 2010 might have looked much different. But with Kennedy\u2019s death and Coakley\u2019s defeat, Republicans gained a 41st vote in the Senate \u2013 and the ability to filibuster any revisions to the legislation passed on Christmas Eve 2009. That meant House Democrats would not, as had been initially expected, be able to sit down with their colleagues in the upper chamber and hammer out a compromise bill. If Pelosi\u2019s caucus didn\u2019t deliver, health care reform was dead. Republicans have yet to reach a similar fly-or-die moment, but they are working under time constraints. With only 52 votes in the Senate, GOP leadership took steps earlier this year to allow Obamacare repeal to pass with a simple majority through a process called budget reconciliation. Democrats used a similar maneuver to pass some aspects of the original bill. But if this fiscal year ends without a successful repeal, broader plans to use reconciliation for tax reform \u2013 another high-level priority for the White House and Congress \u2013 would be pushed back again. As these deadlines approach, expect Trump to amp up the pressure on Republican senators and House members. With Obamacare now under attack from the right, Democrats have mostly set aside their differing ideas about the law and circled the wagons. But in 2009, solidarity seemed a long way off. In May of that year, protesters in favor of a single-payer national health care program, whose proponents were not invited to testify, repeatedly disrupted a Senate Finance Committee hearing. They were escorted out of the room on Baucus\u2019s order. In the spring and summer, as Republicans crowded town halls to rail against reform, single-payer advocates agitated from the left. If Hillary Clinton had defeated Trump in November, they would have be in the streets again, pushing for the new Democratic administration to expand coverage. The Republican bill made public this week has likewise faced serious backlash from elected officials and outside groups. On Capitol Hill, tea party conservatives who want \u201cfull repeal\u201d and a small group of senators, concerned about those covered under Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, have suggested they would not support the legislation as it\u2019s written. Groups like the Heritage Foundation, FreedomWorks and the Koch Brothers\u2019 Americans for Prosperity have all attacked the bill for not taking drastic enough steps to undo the government mechanisms that support Obamacare. We support the 2015-2016 reconciliation bill, and then we will deal with replace. Let's rip #ObamaCare out by the roots! pic.twitter.com/NnmwxGkELK FreedomWorks on Tuesday night revealed plans to spend big on a digital and social media campaign opposing the Republicans\u2019 plan, which they called a \u201cbetrayal\u201d and \u201cObamaCare lite.\u201d When Obama was running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, he pledged to put the process on live television. \u201cThat\u2019s what I will do in bringing all parties together, not negotiating behind closed doors, but bringing all parties together, and broadcasting those negotiations on C-SPAN so that the American people can see what the choices are,\u201d he said during a January 2008 debate with Clinton. The discussions went forward, but the cameras were mostly absent. Key elements of the law were crafted behind closed doors, leading Republicans to criticize what they described as a secretive and, in some cases, corrupt process. Vice President Mike Pence, then a congressman from Indiana, lamented negotiators\u2019 retreat to \u201csmoke-filled rooms\u201d as the legislation took shape. Fast forward eight years and the GOP is facing the same backlash, including from high-profile officials like Sen. Rand Paul. When House Republicans put the replacement bill under lock and key last week, Paul set off \u2013 with cameras in tow \u2013 on a hunt for the mysterious document. \u201cWhen we heard it was secret, we wanted to see it even more,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Friday. \u201cAs we speak, my staff is still going around Washington looking for the bill.\u201d In the years after Obamacare passed, the former President was repeatedly attacked and lampooned for some of his overly optimistic \u2013 and inaccurate \u2013 public promises. \u201cIf you like your doctor, you\u2019ll be able to keep your doctor,\u201d Obama said in June 2009, on one of the more than two dozen occasions he made the pledge. \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health care plan.\u201d Like his predecessor, Trump has largely stayed out of the legislative fray while focusing on a more broad public sales job. \u201cOur wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation,\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday morning. \u201cObamaCare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast!\u201d Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast! Twelve hours later, after hearing complaints from Republicans, he sought to soothe their worry. \u201cI feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster!\u201d Trump wrote in the early evening. I feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster! But the line that is most likely to follow him through the years came in January, when he declared to The Washington Post, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have insurance for everybody \u2026 Much less expensive and much better.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Chelsea Clinton is developing a distinctive, sometimes sassy, Twitter voice She is using the platform to comment on the Trump administration Chelsea Clinton is bringing the fire on Twitter lately. Freed from the constraints of her mother\u2019s political ambitions, Clinton, 36, has taken to the medium, posting frequently and weighing in on current events with a distinctive, sometimes sassy, voice America hasn\u2019t heard before. When Coretta Scott King said \"Freedom is never really won...you win it in every generation,\" was she thinking of @SenateMajLdr & @SenWarren? \u201cWhen Coretta Scott King said \u201cFreedom is never really won\u2026you win it in every generation,\u201d was she thinking of @SenateMajLdr & @SenWarren?,\u201d Clinton tweeted Tuesday night, in the wake of a recent Senate floor showdown. What???? Did he actually say \"on both sides\"?? And here I thought it was extremists of ANY background who pose a threat to ALL OF US...!!! https://t.co/pc939L6QQ1 Does a QT count as a RT? Asking for a friend...and myself...and millions of Americans https://t.co/LKdZsbrlk1 In a September 2016 E! News interview alongside her mother, Clinton declared Twitter her favorite social platform. She\u2019s been @ChelseaClinton since August 2012, and her account now boasts 1.44 million followers. The former first daughter was always somewhat mysterious to the millennial crowd that grew up alongside her as her father occupied the White House during her teenage years. But in 2012, she told Vogue that she learned to embrace her celebrity, something she decided during the frenzied media coverage of her wedding to Marc Mezvinsky. Chelsea Clinton knocks Kellyanne Conway: 'Please don't make up attacks' \u201cEither it was something I could continue to ignore or it was something I could try to use to highlight causes that I really cared about,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cHistorically I deliberately tried to lead a private life in the public eye. And now I am trying to lead a purposefully public life.\u201d She hit the campaign trail as a surrogate for her mother, attending more than 200 public events. But even then, her social media voice was controlled. \u201cIt was mostly staff. A lot of times, but not always, they\u2019d be written at headquarters but approved and heavily edited by Chelsea-world. Non-Hillary Clinton family accounts had, as you can expect, a somewhat opaque process,\u201d a former Clinton campaign digital aide said of her Twitter habits. A spokeswoman for Clinton, Erika Gudmundson, refuted that description, saying: \u201cIt was not opaque to me, and I can tell you that throughout the campaign and now, Chelsea has been in control of her own Twitter account, whether she was tweeting photos with people she met on the campaign trail or her own thoughts on issues or news she feels strongly about.\u201d In the time between the election and the inauguration, Clinton tweeted in a decidedly neutral tone on topics such as global health, education, youth empowerment and women\u2019s issues, linking to a series of news and science reports with minimal comment. Now, she\u2019s wading into politics, actively criticizing the Trump administration with sharply worded, and sometimes sarcastic, tweets. She raised eyebrows last week, taking a shot at Trump senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, who cited a non-existent \u201cmassacre\u201d to defend the President\u2019s travel ban. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make up attacks,\u201d she said. Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks. Conway fired back: Bosnia lie a Great reminder. And 2 @ChelseaClinton & others, you can't \"invent\" quality candidates either. I misspoke; you lost the election https://t.co/7TwnX2b5yA When the administration sent conflicting messages on whether the travel ban was, in fact, a \u201cban,\u201d she linked to a video, writing: \u201cSo\u2026.which one of these is not like the others?\u201d So....which one of these is not like the others? #NoBanNoWall https://t.co/Lrfe9c95GQ Linking to a transcript of the President\u2019s speech to an African-American History Month listening session last week, she had no words, only to say: \u201cThis is\u2026this is\u2026\u201d This is...this is... https://t.co/p0Jv4CBa0q When the President suggested we should pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s \u201cApprentice\u201d ratings at the National Prayer Breakfast, she wrote: \u201cNo, no, no. Thinking of Isaiah 40:29-31.\u201d No, no, no. Thinking of Isaiah 40:29-31. https://t.co/eWU3qPCbjw She has used humor to tackle a series of difficult issues. Retweeting a link about an Arkansas law that will let rapists sue victims who want an abortion, she wrote: \u201cUnconscionable - if only also unreal. Never thought I\u2019d be wishing anything was fake news.\u201d Unconscionable - if only also unreal. Never thought I'd be wishing anything was fake news. https://t.co/lUNpMIL1CA In response to one tweet regarding Trump\u2019s Wall Street deregulation asking \u201cWho could have predicted this?\u201d  she simply wrote: \u201cAnyone taking him seriously.\u201d Anyone taking him seriously. https://t.co/OxA461M47O She personally participated in a Sunday protest in New York City\u2019s Battery Park, posting a photo of a sign reading: \u201cGET USED TO THIS PICTURE DON.\u201d \u201cYes. We will keep standing up for a country that matches our values and ideals for all,\u201d she wrote. Yes. We will keep standing up for a country that matches our values and ideals for all. pic.twitter.com/yfVlX5sL3f Clinton has shown a more personal side in recent weeks, as well, tweeting about pop culture and interests like the Super Bowl, looking at pictures of elephants (\u201cSome people look at cats for a break, I look at elephants,\u201d she said), Serena Williams, coffee, space, chili peppers and children\u2019s books. She linked to a map of the most popular girl scout cookie by state, writing: \u201cThis map makes me miss my grandma. Every state she ever lived in shares her love of Thin Mints.\u201d And she often nods to her father\u2019s friendship with President George H. W. Bush, linking to multiple news updates about his recent recovery from pneumonia. So what\u2019s next for Chelsea? She\u2019s still taking some time to figure that out, per an aide. Clinton, who completed a PhD in international relations from Oxford in 2014, has a book out Thursday with co-author Devi Sridhar called \u201cGoverning Global Health: Who Runs the World and Why?\u201d building on her PhD work. But don\u2019t expect a book tour \u2013 it\u2019s geared toward an academic crowd, published by Oxford University Press. She will continue her work as vice chair of the board at the Clinton Global Initiative. She\u2019s also the mother of two young children \u2013 son Aidan, now seven months old, was born in June. Daughter Charlotte is nearly 2 1/2 years old. In the meantime, keep an eye on her tweets. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica contributed to this report. This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Three women had not seen each other for years -- then the election happened Shared experiences at college prompted desire to protest It\u2019s been 25 years since Jessica, Penny and Lisa marched together in Washington. They were college roommates when they demonstrated for women\u2019s rights in 1992. Now they are full-time working mothers, living in different cities \u2013 and discovering that planning a reunion isn\u2019t as easy as it used to be. They hadn\u2019t seen each other for more than four years. Then the election happened. \u201cI keep thinking about some of the incidents that happened in the run up to the election with Donald Trump and some of the footage, and just some of the appalling, appalling ways that we have evidence that he treats women,\u201d said Jessica Sisto. Sitting at her San Francisco kitchen table, Sisto grabs her head in frustration. In Chicago, Jennifer \u201cPenny\u201d Martinand shares those feelings. \u201cI had to turn off CNN for three days after the election to cleanse. It was pure horror.\u201d Lisa Levine, a mother of two and a financial lawyer living in lower Manhattan, couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cThe levels of sexism and racism are disheartening \u2013 and examples have come out so openly now with incidents like swastikas in schools,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels important to do something.\u201d And so, between day jobs and play dates, they decided it was time to march again. \u201cIn our 20s you have a bit more hope, but now you\u2019re fighting more for something being taken away from you,\u201d Martinand said. A teacher and mother of a son and two daughters, she feels she\u2019s doing it not just for herself, but for the next generation. \u201cMy 15-year-old will be able to vote next time, I have to go and speak out and show a good example,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m going down there to lead by example, fight for what I believe in and raise good sons,\u201d Levine said. Sisto, an executive coach and leadership consultant, is flying from the West Coast to see her friends and make her voice heard. She also feels she\u2019s partly marching for her 5-year-old daughter. \u201cI\u2019ll be really happy that I could tell my daughter someday that I went there, that I felt that passionately about this women\u2019s rights cause that I went.\u201d Back in 1992, the three best friends from Rutgers College, New Jersey, got on a 4 a.m. bus to participate in a women\u2019s rights march in Washington. The Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey was threatening to overturn Roe v. Wade, challenging Pennsylvania\u2019s statutory provisions regarding abortion. \u201cBeing 22 and unaware, I remember I was inspired seeing parents with strollers, men, women and children and so many people holding signs,\u201d Sisto recalled. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take much planning, we didn\u2019t put much thought to it, just hopped on the bus,\u201d Martinand added. They mostly remember the crowds and the signs, and feeling \u201clarge and small at the same time,\u201d Levine said. \u201cI felt like I\u2019m just one person in a sea of people but at the same time it felt very powerful.\u201d They all agree that the progressive and politically active environment in Rutgers, as well as essays they wrote on gender issues, helped affirm the significance of having a choice over their own body, and prompted them to protest. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the basic ruling of Roe v. Wade, and the three women remained good friends, meeting again over the years for weddings and vacations. In their puffy 90s clothes, three young women are smiling timidly in the old photo, the National Museum of Natural History in the background. Two and a half decades later, they will stand in the exact same pose, and with a big laugh recreate the picture. Except now they are much less hopeful. \u201cSadly, I feel that not much has changed in 25 years,\u201d Levine said. \u201cThere was a time between then and now where I thought we were making progress but one of the things that was clear to me from the election cycle was that not much has changed.\u201d Martinand is not sure they\u2019ll achieve anything tangible by marching, but maintains it\u2019s important to fight for equality. \u201cIf you stay quiet, it will be harder to change things as it gets more set in,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope there will be more awareness about the work that is left to do for women\u2019s rights and equality,\u201d Sisto said. \u201cI think there are so many women that don\u2019t even realize that things could be different for them. They just tolerate things like sexual harassment, or assume they just get paid less and that\u2019s just how it is. And it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d Nonetheless, the three women hope that the nationwide marches will be \u201cone of many actions of resistance that will bring about change.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Judge Neil Gorsuch is Trump's pick for the high court Trump: \"It is an extraordinary resume. As good as it gets\" Senate Democrats will oppose the nomination, but unclear if they will force Republicans to break a filibuster President Donald Trump will nominate Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Trump announced Tuesday night at the White House. The nomination of Gorsuch, a 49-year-old federal appellate judge from Colorado, gives Trump and Republicans the opportunity to confirm someone who could cement the conservative direction of the court for decades.   Meet Neil Gorsuch: a fly-fishing Scalia fan His selection also sets up an intense fight with Senate Democrats, still angry over the Republicans\u2019 decision to essentially ignore former President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland for the empty Supreme Court seat last year. Introducing Gorsuch, Trump said he had committed as a candidate to \u201cfind the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court.\u201d \u201cMillions of voters said this was the single most important issue for them when they voted for me for president,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI am a man of my word.\u201d \u201cToday I am keeping another promise to the American people by nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\u201d Supreme Court 101: How it works and what's at stake now Democrats ready for Gorsuch battle on Capitol Hill The court has been operating with eight justices since the sudden death last February of Justice Antonin Scalia. If confirmed, Gorsuch would continue the ideological balance that existed before Scalia\u2019s death, with four conservatives, four liberals and Justice Anthony Kennedy as a swing vote between the blocs. Trump selected Gorsuch \u2013 who sits on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals \u2013 from a list of 20 potential justices compiled during the presidential campaign in a direct appeal to conservative and evangelical voters skeptical about his commitment to their values. Gorsuch\u2019s opinions on religious liberty, where he sided with the challengers to the so-called Obamacare contraceptive mandate, and on the separation of powers, where he said too much deference was given by the courts to administrative agencies, are key to his appeal to Republicans. As is his age. At 49, he could carry on Trump\u2019s legacy long after the President leaves office. Unlike others on Trump\u2019s list, Gorsuch has an Ivy League pedigree, having attended Columbia and Harvard, and also studied at Oxford, where he earned a doctorate in legal philosophy. Gorsuch is a fourth-generation Coloradan and a former clerk to both Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. Trump's Supreme Court pick marks end of one battle, starts new one \u201cIt is an extraordinary resume. As good as it gets,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe qualifications of Judge Gorsuch are beyond dispute,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI only hope that Democrats and Republicans can come together for one, for the good of the country.\u201d On the bench he joined an opinion siding with closely held corporations who believed that the so-called contraceptive mandate of Obamacare violated their religious beliefs. The ruling was later upheld by the Supreme Court. Gorsuch wrote separately holding that the mandate infringed upon the owners\u2019 religious beliefs \u201crequiring them to lend what their religion teaches to be an impermissible degree of assistance to the commission of what their religion teaches to be a moral wrong.\u201d He also wrote a majority opinion in a separation of powers case holding that too much deference was given to administrative agencies. This issue is a favorite of conservatives and Gorsuch\u2019s beliefs align with those of Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas. Gorsuch, in a speech last year at Case Western Reserve University School of law, aligned himself with Scalia\u2019s judicial philosophy. \u201cThe great project of Justice Scalia\u2019s career was to remind us of the differences between judges and legislators. To remind us that legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and to claims about social utility to reshape the law as they think it should be in the future, \u201d he said. \u201cBut that judges should do none of these things in a democratic society.\u201d At the White House Gorsuch he would faithfully commit to upholding the laws of the nation, saying he would act as a \u201cservant of the Constitution and laws of this country.\u201d Like Trump, he cited Scalia as a model. \u201cJustice Scalia was a lion of the law,\u201d he said. Senate Democratic leaders instantly painted Gorsuch as an extremist and said he must get the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. \u201cJudge Gorsuch has repeatedly sided with corporations over working people, demonstrated a hostility toward women\u2019s rights, and most troubling, hewed to an ideological approach to jurisprudence that makes me skeptical that he can be a strong, independent justice on the court,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump \u201coutsourced this process to far-right interest groups.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump said he would appoint justices who would overturn 40 years of jurisprudence established in Roe v. Wade,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cJudge Gorsuch has shown a willingness to limit women\u2019s access to health care that suggests the President is making good on that promise.\u201d For Democrats, the nomination is made worse by what happened with Garland. When Obama nominated Garland to take Scalia\u2019s seat last year, liberals hoped that they would get a liberal majority that would swing the court left on key issues such as abortion, campaign finance and voting rights. But Senate Republicans refused to hold hearings, citing the impending election which was still eight months away. Who is Judge Neil Gorsuch? Democrats have said they would fight the new nominee \u201ctooth and nail\u201d putting not only his or her credentials to the test, but holding Republicans responsible for what liberals say is a \u201cstolen seat.\u201d After Trump\u2019s unexpected win, conservatives rejoiced, expecting the new president to nominate someone to the bench in the mold of Scalia. They also hope that with three justices on the Supreme Court in their late 70s and early 80s, Trump might have at least one more vacancy to fill. If, for example, Justice Anthony Kennedy were to step down, the conservatives might be able to chip away at Roe v. Wade, the landmark opinion that legalized abortion. Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation would mean a return to Washington. He spent part of his youth in Washington when his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, served in the Reagan administration as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. She resigned in 1983 under controversy after refusing to turn over toxic waste records to Congress. He served as a partner at a prestigious Washington Law firm, Kellogg, Huber as well as Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General. Gorsuch and his wife Louise have two daughters. They live in Boulder, Colorado. CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and George Phillips contributed to this report.",

He said the President asked him to attend. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway had earlier said the President was planning to call in to the large annual gathering of anti-abortion activistis, then later clarified that his plans were dependent upon his schedule and the call may not work out if it conflicted with his meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May. The March for Life happens annually near the January anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision making abortion legal. Pence reminded the crowded that Trump signed an executive order earlier this week blocking federal funding for abortions overseas and promised that Congress will work to end federal funding going to American organizations that perform abortions. \u201cAnd we will devote those resources to health care services for women across America,\u201d he said. And the Vice President said next week Trump will announce a Supreme Court Justice next week that will back anti-abortion policies and \u201cwill uphold the god given liberties in our Constitution in the tradition on of the late and great justice Antonin Scalia.\u201d Trump tweeted his support for the march earlier. The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching --- you have my full support! \u2018March for Life\u2019 set for Friday: What you need to know The President mentioned the march Thursday while meeting with GOP leaders at the Republican retreat in Philadelphia and Vice President Mike Pence announced on Twitter Thursday that he will address the attendees in person. It\u2019s the first time a sitting vice president has addressed a March for Life rally, according to administration spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. Conway also spoke at the annual event reminding attendees of the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to the anti-abortion voting bloc. \u201cAllow me to make it very clear: We hear you, we see you, we respect you and we look forward to working with you,\u201d she said. \u201cThe March for Life began in Washington, DC, as a small demonstration and rapidly grew to be the largest pro-life event in the world,\u201d according to the march\u2019s website. At past events, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush addressed the event via telephone. Several Republican lawmakers and activists hope to use the event to \u201cunite and strategize around a common message,\u201d according to the group\u2019s mission statement. More than 60% of Republicans said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, according to a Pew Research Center poll. Trump often campaigned on promising to nominate a Supreme Court justice with conservative views on abortion and pledged to back anti-abortion rights justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade as well as send the issue back to the states, in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Nearly seven-in-ten Americans say Roe v. Wade should not be completely overturned, according to a Pew Research Center poll.",

            "article_content": "\"Life is winning,\" Pence declared Friday at the March for Life rally Pence became the highest-ranking WH official to speak at the rally in its 43-year history In his first major address as vice president, Mike Pence championed a cause that he tirelessly spoke about on the campaign trail: his anti-abortion stance. \u201cLife is winning,\u201d Pence declared Friday at the March for Life rally in Washington. His address to the anti-abortion rally marked the highest ranking US official to speak to the group in person. It\u2019s also not the first time he has addressed the group. \u201cMore than 240 years ago, our founders wrote words that have echoed through the ages. They declared these truths to be self-evident, that we are all endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights and among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d he said to a sizable crowd who braved the cold for the speeches. Pence referenced the Supreme Court case of Roe vs. Wade, saying the court had \u201cabandoned\u201d ideals in the first amendment but now things were turning around with the new administration. \u201cThat is evident in the election of pro-life majorities in the congress of the United States of America. But it is no more evident in any way than in the historic election of a president who stands for a stronger America, a more prosperous America, and a president who I proudly say stands for the right to life,\u201d the vice president said, joined by his wife, Second Lady Karen Pence, and daughter, Charlotte. It was friendly territory for the former Indiana governor, whom many viewed as an evangelical and conservative Christian presence on the Republican ticket. Pence spoke often and freely of his opposition to abortion on the campaign trail, which is deeply linked to his Christian faith. Friday\u2019s message follows President Donald Trump re-signing the so-called Mexico City executive order, banning non-governmental groups from performing and promoting abortions. In one of his biggest solo appearances on the campaign trail in October, Pence received a standing ovation from Liberty University students as he declared, \u201cI\u2019m pro life and I don\u2019t apologize for it.\u201d During his speech, Pence said, \u201cI believe a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable. The aged. The infirm. The disabled. And the unborn.\u201d Pence promised on the trail that if elected, he and Trump would \u201cembrace a culture of life in America\u201d and sign a bill banning late-term abortions. He also promised to uphold the Hyde Amendment, which he said would prevent the use of taxpayer dollars to fund \u201cthat which millions of Americans find to be morally objectionable.\u201d During the Voter Values Summit in September, Pence told a Washington ballroom of conservative activists that he would \u201csend Roe versus Wade to the ash heap of history where it belongs,\u201d a line that elicited cheers and applause to the hundreds of attendees. The line was a constant crowd-pleaser on the trail ranging from Iowa to Florida. Pence, who described himself on the stump as \u201ca Christian, a conservative, and a Republican,\u201d said at the time, \u201cI\u2019m truly grateful for Donald Trump\u2019s strong commitment to the sanctity of life. He understands the moral imperative of advancing the cause of life, and we\u2019ve spoken of it many times.\u201d He also frequently referenced his anti-abortion rights initiatives as governor of Indiana, pointing to millions of dollars of additional funding that he provided to crisis pregnancy centers so that \u201cwomen facing crisis pregnancy have more choices before them and can choose life.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The anti-abortion march is held in Washington, DC, and has taken place every year since 1974 The anti-abortion effort has picked up steam with the election of Donald Trump On the heels of President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration and last week\u2019s Women\u2019s March, the annual March for Life, this year marking the 44th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, is set to take place on Friday. The anti-abortion march is held in Washington and has taken place every year since 1974. Since the Supreme Court ruled abortion legal in 1973, marchers have descended upon Washington to protest the decision. \u201cThe March for Life began in Washington, DC, as a small demonstration and rapidly grew to be the largest pro-life event in the world,\u201d the march\u2019s website reads. Although the movement is decades old, the anti-abortion effort has picked up steam with the election and Trump\u2019s leadership. His first week in office, Trump signed an executive action reversing policy that allowed funding to international non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortion. Trump also acknowledged the march during his speech to fellow GOP leaders at the Republican retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday. Trump\u2019s second in command, Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 who announced on Twitter Thursday he will address the march in person \u2013 is an opponent of abortion and signed some of the most restrictive abortion legislation into law while governor of Indiana. The March for Life will kick off with a rally that is scheduled to take place at the Washington Monument shortly before noon on Friday, near the corner of 15th Street and Constitution Ave. Speakers will make remarks around noon and the marchers will begin walking around 1 p.m. ET, according to the website. The website also notes there will be screening sites for attendees for security purposes. Those screenings will start at 9 a.m. Marchers who can\u2019t be in DC also have the option of participating in local efforts as well. Information on other events can be found here. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, and Cardinal Timothy Dolan are among the listed speakers. Also scheduled to speak is Baltimore Ravens tight end Benjamin Watson and top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, among others, according to the website. Pence also will address the march. \u201cHonored to meet with Pro-Life leaders in my office tonight. Just told them I look forward to addressing National @March_for_Life on Friday,\u201d the official vice president\u2019s account tweeted. Honored to meet with Pro-Life leaders in my office tonight.

The group of political leaders and activists gather to \u201cunite and strategize around a common message,\u201d the group\u2019s mission statement says. In addition to their usual message, anti-abortion activists are also now looking to Trump as he is set to nominate a new Supreme Court justice in the coming weeks.

Well, perhaps they have to go to another state,\u201d Trump responded.",

            "article_content": "As he progressed from punchline to primary contender, from frontrunner to nominee, and then from seemingly doomed general election candidate to president-elect, Donald Trump has, for all his idiosyncrasies, offered a remarkably consistent package of promises. Now, less than a week into his presidency, he is beginning to carry them out. The grinding machinery of federal government has not checked his most extreme ambitions, as so many savvy observers predicted, and the weight of the office has not humbled or aroused in him some reservoir of internal reflection. Instead, much as we saw during the primary \u2013 as defeated Republicans fell in line behind Trump only to be mocked or ignored \u2013 power only emboldens him. On Friday, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to undermine Obamacare. After a weekend spent attacking the media \u2013 and enlisting his new press secretary to follow suit \u2013 for accurately reporting on his inaugural crowd size, Trump kicked off Monday by reinstating a federal ban on foreign aid to organizations that include abortion or family planning in their mission statements. TPP is dead. NAFTA is on the ropes. There has been a crackdown on government social media accounts that discuss or allude to basic environmental science. Trump on Tuesday revived the Keystone XL pipeline project and ordered a review of the Dakota Access project be expedited and approved. The wall is next. Wednesday comes with a request for federal funds to build it, though no word on how he\u2019ll compel Mexico to pick up the tab. He told ABC News on Wednesday he hopes to start construction on the wall very quickly, although getting Mexico to pay for it could get \u201ccomplicated.\u201d Concurrent actions will seek to increase deportations and squeeze sanctuary cities by choking off grants of federal money. In his remarks at the Department of Homeland Security, Trump undermined any notion his administration lacks the cunning to effectively implement its agenda \u2013 with or without the acquiescence of this Congress. \u201cPeople are surprised to hear that we do not need new laws,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will work within the existing system and framework.\u201d The push is slated to continue throughout the week. Though it will not be formally titled a \u201cMuslim Ban,\u201d the coming push to delay or block entry into the United States from Muslim-majority countries \u2013 \u201cterror-prone\u201d nations in the new vernacular \u2013 is the logical conclusion of a policy Trump introduced in December 2015, before the first primary vote was cast. And Trump this week is expected to order a halt to the US refugee program, at least temporarily closing the door on Syrians fleeing civil war and humanitarian catastrophe. He is also focusing on what he has taken to calling \u201ccarnage\u201d here at home. The alarmist language is familiar from the campaign, when he regularly painted American cities as blood-soaked war zones. By late Tuesday, Trump had threatened intervention in Chicago, tweeting that he would \u201csend in the feds\u201d absent an immediate decline in gun violence. If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible \"carnage\" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! Hours later, a little after 7 a.m. Wednesday morning, he vowed to pursue a \u201cmajor investigation\u201d into the massive voter fraud conspiracy he\u2019s peddled as a means of explaining away his loss in the presidential popular vote \u2013 even though there is, again, no evidence anything of the sort occurred. I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and.... even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures! And if that sounds outlandish, or like something that will never actually happen \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t. Not anymore. Trump promised to smash the Washington power structure and showed he would defy all norms, social and political. His first actions have Republicans opposing the trade bills they once championed and Democrats floundering for a message. It should be noted here that Trump is new in town and his party controls Capitol Hill. What he\u2019s doing this week requires a pen and not much more. It is not clear how effective he will be when he needs 60 Senate votes to pass a spending bill. Congress and the courts will both have their say on how to pay for these things. Less than a week into the Trump era, he has not yet been required to stare down a tectonic government bureaucracy that slows all proposals. Remember: One of the first executive actions signed by former President Barack Obama during his administration was aimed at closing the prison base at Guantanamo Bay and shuttering secret detention facilities. An unfriendly Congress kept Guantanamo alive even as Obama shrunk its population. Trump is poised to build it up again and, according to reports in The New York Times and Washington Post, the Trump team is now drawing up plans to potentially revive the \u201cblack sites.\u201d CNN has not confirmed those reports and White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the plans had not come from the White House. But they would fall in line with another promise Trump made repeatedly on the campaign trail \u2013 to bring back torture techniques like waterboarding and \u201cmuch worse.\u201d And why would you doubt him?",

            "article_content": "Judges Neil Gorsuch and Thomas Hardiman have joined William Pryor and Diane Sykes at the top of Trump's list President Donald Trump has made clear he\u2019s winnowed down his list of potential Supreme Court nominees \u2013 and may be days away from making the announcement. Trump himself said on the campaign trail that he would look at judges William Pryor and Diane Sykes as top contenders, and has touted his list of 20 possible choices from conservative legal circles. Sources close to the search say as things stand now, Judge Neil Gorsuch has emerged on top of the list as well as Judge Thomas Hardiman. The President will discuss the Supreme Court vacancy Tuesday afternoon with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the leaders of the Judiciary Committee, McConnell announced. \u201cI appreciate the President soliciting our advice on this important matter,\u201d McConnell said. However, Trump may have already made his choice. \u201cI think in my mind I know who it is,\u201d Trump said during a luncheon at his hotel Thursday with Republicans, according to cell phone video of the event obtained by CNN. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be very, very excited.\u201d In recent weeks, the search has intensified as lawyers and outside groups have joined the effort pouring through legal briefs, opinions, articles and congressional transcripts. The decision will all come down to a calculation by top staff weighing the judge and the current court against a series of factors including his or her record, age and background. A look at four of those on the top of the list reveal arguments that Trump will weigh both for and against. Trump knows, for example, that if he picks Pryor, he is asking for a fight with Senate Democrats. Pryor sits on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and he is a dream candidate for many conservatives. He\u2019s called Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion, an \u201cabomination.\u201d He\u2019s a committed member of the Federalist Society, and in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, believes that the Constitution should be interpreted based on its original public meaning. \u201cI am a conservative, and I believe in the strict separation of governmental powers,\u201d Pryor wrote in 1997 when he was attorney general of Alabama. \u201cCourts should not resolve political problems.\u201d Pryor has faced the Senate gauntlet before. In 2004, Democrats blocked his confirmation to the appellate court, and it was only in June 2005 that he was officially confirmed by a vote of 53-45. But despite Pryor\u2019s record, some conservatives have questioned an opinion he joined that they perceive as expanding transgender rights. Gorsuch, who sits on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Colorado, has never called Roe an abomination. In fact, he\u2019s never had the occasion to write an opinion addressing Roe. That might disappoint some who want to make sure that he wouldn\u2019t surprise them on the issue. But he\u2019s become a favored candidate in part because of his opinions on religious liberty including one he joined siding with closely held corporations who believed that the so-called contraceptive mandate of Obamacare violated their religious beliefs. And on more than one occasion, he\u2019s aligned himself with Scalia. In the weeks after Scalia\u2019s death last year, Gorsuch gave a talk emphasizing that \u201cthe great project of Justice Scalia\u2019s career was to remind us of the differences between judges and legislators.\u201d Trump might conclude that Gorsuch could sidestep a major fight in Congress. Or not. Liberals are still seething mad that Republican senators failed to hold hearings for former President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, and could take it out on Gorsuch, or anyone else Trump picks. \u201cThose of us who believe that Merrick Garland was improperly denied a vote and also recognize that the majority of the American people voted for Hillary Clinton are going to refuse a nominee who moves the court in such a a right wing direction,\u201d said Caroline Fredrickson of the American Constitution Society. It is unclear if progressives would accept any of Trump\u2019s nominees that have been a part of his current list. Sykes hails from Wisconsin, a critical state during the last election and home to Trump\u2019s Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. A former journalist, she flexed her interviewing skills in 2013 by sitting down with Justice Clarence Thomas for a talk to discuss his jurisprudence. She won over the room during the event \u2013 hosted by the Federalist Society \u2013 for showcasing Thomas\u2019 personality in an interview that at times brought down the house. Just last week Sykes issued an opinion striking three provisions of Chicago regulations meant to govern shooting ranges. It was a follow up opinion from one she penned in 2011 that enjoined Chicago\u2019s ban on firing ranges within city limits. Both opinions are peppered with references to Scalia\u2019s landmark Second Amendment opinion, District of Columbia v. Heller. Sykes would bring another woman to the Court. She would be the fifth woman ever named, the second from a Republican candidate. But  Trump could calculate that it would make more sense to save her for the seat of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg should she ever retire. Sykes is also 59 years old, and some court watchers think that Trump might prefer someone younger. Hardiman of the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, for example, is almost a decade younger at 51 and offers Trump a compelling personal story. Hardiman hails from a blue collar family in Massachusetts and was the first in his family to graduate from college, driving a cab to help pay his bills. Hardiman is not product of the Ivy League having attended Notre Dame and Georgetown. Those close to him think that Trump might appreciate Hardiman\u2019s dry wit and the fact that while he is persuasive he doesn\u2019t take over a room. Like Sykes, Hardiman referred to Heller several times in a dissent he penned in 2013 in a case concerning gun licenses. The opposition of Hardiman has been relatively muted and Ian Millhiser of the progressive Think Progress has written that he is \u201cone of the more ideologically enigmatic names on Trump\u2019s list.\u201d Such a sentiment could scare away conservatives who do not want a dark horse candidate. Conservatives believe that George H.W. Bush missed an opportunity to shape the court when he named a relative unknown \u2013 David Souter \u2013 to the bench. Rather than helping create a conservative legacy, Souter became a reliable vote for the left. Some might question whether Hardiman has a robust enough record to scour and get Republicans excited. If Trump needed a personal reference, however, he\u2019d only need to reach out to his sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who sits on the same appellate bench.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations President Donald Trump on Monday will start to unravel the behemoth trade deal he inherited from his predecessor, as he signed an executive action to withdraw from the negotiating process of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That executive action sends signals to Democrats and leaders in foreign capitals around the world that Trump\u2019s rhetoric on trade during the campaign is turning into action. Trump vowed during the campaign to withdraw the US from the Pacific trade deal, commonly known as TPP, which he argued was harmful to American workers and manufacturing. The TPP was negotiated under former President Barack Obama, but never ratified by Congress, so withdrawing from it will not have an immediate, real effect on US economic policies, although it does signal a new and very different US outlook on trade under Trump.   The other executive actions signed Monday included reinstating the Mexico City abortion rules and instituting a hiring freeze for federal agencies. RELATED: Obama pushes trade in Asia, but has 2016 killed the TPP? Trump\u2019s action comes as the President is looking to change the conversation after a rocky first weekend at the White House, during which, he and his officials feuded with the press and his presidency was greeted with massive protests in the nation\u2019s capital and in large cities across the US. The executive action was just one part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to focus attention on its plans to radically reshape US trade policies, making good on a central premise of Trump\u2019s campaign and its economic nationalist underbelly. Trump on Monday also met with union leaders and blue-collar workers several hours after signing the executive action and had a separate meeting with business leaders. As the Republican nominee, Trump railed against free trade agreements he argued were lopsided against the US and vowed to implement more protectionist trade policies as president, rallying voters to the polls with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan. Trump has also threatened to impose trade tariffs as a way to revive American manufacturing and compel US companies not to take their manufacturing operations abroad. Obama\u2019s administration worked with the 11 countries that became signatories for more than two years to formulate the massive free trade deal that was set to reshape commerce throughout the Pacific Rim, triggering movement among multinational companies in the region at the same time. Trump\u2019s election swiftly dealt a death knell \u2013 one formalized on Monday \u2013 to the deal, sending shockwaves in Asian capitals that had pinned their economic hopes on the deal. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the US from TPP is also a first step in the administration\u2019s efforts to amass a governing coalition to push the new President\u2019s agenda, one that includes the blue-collar workers who defected from Democrats and flocked to Trump\u2019s candidacy in November. The move could also put many Democrats \u2013 particularly those who opposed the trade deal \u2013 in a tricky position as they look to hold on to union support, a key constituency in their political coalition. Obama struggled to sell many Democrats on the trade deal, in particular because of concerns about how the trade deal would impact American manufacturers and the US workers in that industry. Even Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee who pushed the TPP deal as secretary of state, backed off her support for the deal during the campaign amid pressure from the left. Democrats with heavy union worker constituencies will either need to get on board with Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies or risk losing reelection. Republican leaders, many of whom supported the TPP trade deal and free trade more broadly, will also be pressed to react Monday \u2013 reactions that could show daylight between top Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House on a top policy issue. Trump has said that he also plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, a free trade deal joining the US, Mexico and Canada. This story has been updated. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The first Tuesday of the new administration is set to be full of confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on in Washington on Tuesday: Previously, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources was scheduled to meet at 9:30 a.m. to vote on the nominations of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke for interior secretary and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry for energy secretary. But the committee issued a statement late Monday postponing the votes \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d At his hearing last week, Zinke said climate change is not a \u201choax\u201d and that \u201cman has had an influence,\u201d a statement that may help appease Democrats who are concerned about Trump\u2019s statement from December when he said \u201cnobody really knows\u201d if climate change is real. During his hearing last week, Perry said he regrets previously saying he would abolish the Energy Department, which he is nominated to lead. Democratic aides on the committee have said that they are not concerned with Perry\u2019s lack of scientific experience, noting that the role of energy secretary has not always gone to a scientist. Georgia Rep. Tom Price has already had his confirmation hearing with the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Now, he testifies before the Senate Finance Committee at 10 a.m. The congressman and orthopedic surgeon has been a significant critic of the Affordable Care Act, and has worked to dismantle the law in the past. Price is now also under scrutiny after CNN reported on a questionable stock purchase. Also at 10 a.m. on Capitol Hill, the Senate Judiciary Committee will meet to vote on whether to confirm Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Sessions sat before the committee last Tuesday where he drew a number of Democratic opponents due to his record. However, Republicans hold a majority in the Senate and the nomination is expected to pass. Another 10 a.m. meeting will be for the Senate Commerce Committee to vote on the nominations of Elaine Chao for transportation secretary and Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary. Both had their hearings before the committee last week and while both are expected to pass, some are concerned about Ross\u2019s business interests. South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney is set to testify before the Senate Budget Committee at 10:30 a.m. after being nominated by President Donald Trump to head the Office of Management and Budget. Last week, it was revealed that Mulvaney did not pay more than $15,000 in payroll taxes for a household employee. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said this was \u201cdisqualifying\u201d for Mulvaney to serve as the White House budget director. A source from Trump\u2019s transition team told CNN that Mulvaney, who at the time was the father of newborn triplets, hired a \u201csitter\u201d and didn\u2019t realize he needed to pay taxes on her income. The aide declined to say where the employee was from. Also at 10:30 a.m., the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee will meet for their hearing on Linda McMahon, who Trump nominated to lead the Small Business Administration. McMahon, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, gave millions to Trump to support his presidential campaign, including a $1 million donation just before the election. At noon, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on the nomination of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump\u2019s choice for UN ambassador. During her confirmation hearing last week, Committee Chair Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said that Haley is expected to be confirmed \u201coverwhelmingly.\u201d The committee questioned Haley about her lack of dealing with foreign affairs, but commented her time as governor of South Carolina has made her ready for this position. A closed-door Senate Intelligence Committee hearing will take place at 2:30 p.m. On Tuesday, the House will vote on H.R. bill \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017.\u201d The bill would ban federal funding of abortions, as well federal funding for health benefits plans that cover abortions. It would also ban federal facilities and federal employees from providing abortions. This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "First they marched. Now, Democratic organizers are telling the scores of women who turned out to oppose President Donald Trump over the weekend, it\u2019s time to run \u2013 for something. The massive turnout in Washington and across the country at women\u2019s marches Saturday stunned even the most optimistic liberals \u2013 injecting an energy into their cause that many accused the Hillary Clinton campaign of lacking. But it is also forcing Democrats to rapidly find ways to channel that energy into a sustained movement before the moment is lost. One way several groups are attempting to do that: recruit the women who participated Saturday to run for office \u2013 from school boards and city councils to Congress. Emily\u2019s List, which helps train and fund female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights, hosted 500 women for a day-long training session Sunday \u2013 with nearly 500 more on its waiting list. \u201cI\u2019m confident I talked to a future United States senator. I just may not know who it is yet,\u201d Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily\u2019s List, said in an interview Monday. One of those candidates is Bella Stenvall, an 18-year-old from California who is interning on Capitol Hill for Rep. Salud Carbajal. She said she\u2019d like to run for local office at home one day. Her mother moved to the United States from the Philippines at age 18, so \u201cthe opportunities I have in America were always stressed to me very strongly,\u201d she said \u2013 one of the reasons she signed up for the Emily\u2019s List training. Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric was infuriating, she said, and his victory was \u201ca firm call to action.\u201d \u201cAll of a sudden, it\u2019s real,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of us saw this coming. It was genuine shock.\u201d The message of Sunday\u2019s training session, Schriock and Stenvall said, was that women who participated in Saturday\u2019s marches already have the most important quality they need to run for office. \u201cWe have to start by reminding each and every one of them that the most important thing is a commitment to make some change \u2013 a true desire to help your community. That is the most important piece,\u201d Schriock said. \u201cWe so often hear from our women who are getting trained \u2013 they\u2019ll list off things like, \u2018I don\u2019t have enough experience, I don\u2019t have that law degree, I don\u2019t have connections to really wealthy people.\u2019 What we do is say, none of that matters. That\u2019s actually nothing that you need,\u201d she said. Other organizations that help women run for office \u2013 some nonpartisan \u2013 are also reporting upticks. VoteRunLead has trained 5,000 women to run for office over a two-year period \u2013 but 2,300 of those came in the two months since Trump\u2019s election. \u201cSomething switched,\u201d said the group\u2019s founder, Erin Vilardi. Similarly, the Center for American Women and Politics, which is part of Rutgers University\u2019s Eagleton Institute of Politics, saw increased enrollment in their seminars, according to the group\u2019s director, Debbie Walsh. The group holds an annual training program in March. Two years ago, four people had registered by January 1. Last year, there were two. However, this year, by New Year\u2019s Day, more than 100 had registered and paid in full. Walsh said the influx her group has seen wasn\u2019t an anomaly \u2013 partner programs across the country have seen a similar trend. \u201cPeople are seeing the consequences of elections and that they really matter and that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the upsurge in women,\u201d Walsh said. Stung by the depth of Democrats\u2019 problems that were laid bare after Clinton\u2019s loss, Democrats hope to use the anti-Trump energy to begin rebuilding the party\u2019s empty bench. A new group called \u201cRun for Something\u201d \u2013 launched by Democratic operatives Amanda Litman and Ross Morales Rocketto, with a board made of veterans of the Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaigns \u2013 is seeking to recruit and train progressives under 35 for races for city councils, state legislatures and more. In the group\u2019s first 72 hours, more than 400 people reached out, expressing interest, Litman said. Those include \u201ca lot of people who haven\u2019t thought about public service before this particular moment; a lot of people who say, \u2018I\u2019m frustrated and angry that my community and my politicians won\u2019t represent me anymore,\u2019 \u201d she said. The mix of those expressing interests, she said, is split evenly between men and women, includes many African-Americans, members of the LGBT community, immigrants and \u201cquite a few veterans.\u201d The group is looking for people who don\u2019t already have inroads into politics. It has a network of more than 200 Democratic operatives who have offered to help prospective candidates \u2013 guiding them through launching candidacies, raising money and more. It\u2019s eyeing 2017 municipal races and contests for Virginia House of Delegates seats. \u201cThe reason why the focus on some of these down-ballot races is so critical is that these are the individuals whoa re going to be future congress people, future senators, future governors, future attorneys general,\u201d said Morales Rocketto. \u201cThese are the individuals who 10, 15, 20 years from now are going to be essentially running the country.\u201d Beyond potential candidates for office, Democratic groups say they are seeing a major influx of new donors and supporters. Emily\u2019s List said 60% of its donors in the week after the presidential election had never contributed before. The group has doubled the number of people who are online monthly donors since then. And 3,300 have reached out to express interest in running for office \u2013 including 860 since Trump\u2019s inauguration Friday. The official Democratic infrastructure is benefiting, too. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2013 the campaign arm for the party\u2019s House candidates \u2013 has already had its best-ever January for digital fundraising, and has seen its list of grassroots supporters grow by 500,000 people in 2017 so far. Now, the DCCC and other Democratic groups are rapidly hashing out strategies to channel the sudden energy toward the 2018 midterms \u2013 not the 2020 presidential race. \u201cWe will focus on educating voters on the importance of the midterms, to get people to turn that emotion into electoral success as soon as possible,\u201d said DCCC spokeswoman Meredith Kelly. The seven candidates seeking to lead the Democratic National Committee spent Saturday in Florida at a donor summit organized by David Brock that was largely focused on the party\u2019s failings in 2016. They quickly realized they were missing a major moment. Back at home, the family of former Labor Secretary Tom Perez \u2013 one of the DNC chair candidates \u2013 was cramming 10 visitors in town for the march into their house. It took Perez \u2013 who said he was \u201cfrankly very conflicted\u201d about missing the marches in the first place \u2013 multiple runs to Union Station to drop all his visitors off as they departed Sunday. Perez said beyond Trump\u2019s moves on health care and home mortgages and his wealthy Cabinet appointments, Americans already miss the \u201cgrace\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure in office \u2013 and that \u201cthere have been more integrity breaches since this election by Trump than any president I can think of.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why you see America waking up \u2013 and America is going to stay awake,\u201d he said. Another candidate for DNC chair, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, said he got a call from his niece, a senior at Emerson College in Boston, who he\u2019d not been able to get involved in the 2016 race \u2013 but who told him by phone Saturday she was inspired by the marches. He said the Democratic Party \u201cmust support and partner with the energetic activists we saw \u2013 not just ever so often, but 365 days a year.\u201d \u201cWe are stronger,\u201d Ellison said, \u201cwhen voters know that our party stands for the human rights and dignity that were highlighted during the marches.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s team, led by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, is gently sussing out what it would take to win enough support in the Senate to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court \u2013 a surprisingly tough prospect with the threat of a filibuster looming and a quick deadline set by Trump. Behind the scenes, Republicans have painted targets on a mix of moderate-conservative Democrats and Democratic senators facing re-election next year in states Trump won just a few months ago. CNN's Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee shortlist Democratic leaders are keenly aware of the political reality for their colleagues. \u201cWe want to wait and see a nominee. And if that nominee is not middle of the road, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s going to be resistance. I can\u2019t tell you every Democrat feels the same way, but enough of us do to make the point,\u201d the No. 2 Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, told CNN. Durbin said that some Democrats will break rank, but he is trying to head that off. \u201cThat\u2019s always the question: Those who are vulnerable, in states that went strongly for Trump, you know, we\u2019ve got to talk to them, make sure we understand their position,\u201d he said. Democrats have not firmly said if they will filibuster a nominee \u2013 and Republicans have not flatly said they would break that filibuster through a rules change known as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2013 but those cards are effectively on the table, weeks before Trump submits a nominee. But the Trump team is still plotting for a possible climb that includes picking off at least eight Democrats, a tall order by any measure, much less a vacant seat on the Supreme Court. Pence went to work on a group of six senators at the Capitol Wednesday and Trump aides have been working behind the scenes at the Capitol. \u201cToday was really about talking about our legislative agenda, but also meeting with members of the Senate to get their input on the president\u2019s decision about filling the vacancy on the Supreme Court,\u201d Pence told reporters last week. Pence said he \u201chopes\u201d moderate Democrats will come on board with his pick. \u201cThe President-elect made very clear today we do expect \u2013 he\u2019s not yet made a decision \u2013 but we\u2019re in the process of winnowing that list now,\u201d Pence said. The 60-vote bar has been somewhat informally set by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer himself, who told MSNBC last week that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d do all he could to keep the Supreme Court seat open. And the threat of a filibuster was clearly on the minds of lawmakers as Pence tested their feelings on the Supreme Court nomination. Donald Trump's other Supreme Court decision With everything else swirling at the Capitol \u2013 a wave of high-stakes confirmation battles and the opening of the Obamacare fight dominated the week \u2013 the talks on the Supreme Court have taken on a surprising sense of urgency. After he exited his meeting with Pence, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin refused to say if he would join a unified front of Democrats against any Trump nominee. \u201cI\u2019ve pretty much been a West Virginia Democrat,\u201d Manchin said. Montana Sen. Jon Tester \u2013 another clear target of Republicans \u2013 declined to flatly rule out supporting any Trump nominee, saying Wednesday that he would like to see who is being considered. \u201cI\u2019ll take a look at that list\u201d of potential Supreme Court nominees, Tester said. Trump said Wednesday he has a list of 20 names he is considering. And conservative judicial activists, led by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, have been advising Trump on who he should select. Republicans are eight votes shy of a 60-vote threshold needed to break any filibuster on a Supreme Court nominee. But a handful of factors could swing the balance, starting with vulnerable Democrats seeking re-election in 2018. At the top of that list are moderate-conservative Democrats like Manchin and Tester and others, including North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly. Pence met with Manchin and Donnelly, and also Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine \u2013 who could also face a tough re-election bid in a state that Hillary Clinton just narrowly won. However, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said he was confident that Republicans wouldn\u2019t even have to wrestle with that and floated one of his party\u2019s key attacks against Democrats \u2013 that they would look like hypocrites trying to block a nominee after complaining about the Republicans\u2019 treatment of Merrick Garland. \u201cYou got to remember how much of a fuss they made after (former Justice Antonin) Scalia died that we weren\u2019t going to take it up because we were going to let the people take a vote. So between that and the election they can\u2019t complain about a longer period of time now,\u201d Grassley said. The Supreme Court vacancy has been a particular sore point in the Senate, in particular, after Republicans refused to even consider President Barack Obama\u2019s selection to fill the vacancy left after former Scalia died last year. Some Democrats, including Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, have accused Republicans of \u201cstealing\u201d a Supreme Court seat by never considering Obama nominee Merrick Garland. And Sen. Patrick Leahy, the former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who presided over the last two appointments to the Supreme Court \u2013 Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 blasted Republicans when asked whether Democrats should filibuster. Trump's second Supreme Court pick could be the real drama \u201cWe\u2019re having a difficult time knowing what\u2019s going to happen because even though every Republican senator raise their hand swore unto God they would uphold the Constitution and then refused to for a year on advise and consent,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to predict what they might do. You see shown for the first time in the history of the country they are willing to violate the Constitution and politicize the Supreme Court. So what\u2019s going to happen now I don\u2019t know.\u201d Senate Republican leaders are holding their cards tight when it comes to possibly breaking a filibuster by simply rewriting the rules to only require 51 votes to end the debate \u2013 a move known as the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d But a top Senate Republican aide warned that Supreme Court fights have always been vicious and that Republicans have a long memory of all the times they have been stifled by Democrats. \u201cThey made a term for it: Borked,\u201d said the Republican staffer, a reference to Robert Bork, who\u2019s nomination was squashed by Senate Democrats three decades ago \u2013 ultimately paving the way for Justice Anthony Kennedy to join the court. Even with the focus on Democrats in the battle, Senate Republicans still have some of their own hurdles \u2013 highlighted by two of the senators Pence met with last week: moderate Sens. Susan Collins, of Maine and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska. Both women favor abortion rights \u2013 which could easily become a sticking point amid promises from Trump that his appointees to the Supreme Court would overturn the landmark abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade.",

Jeff Sessions, in the middle of his confirmation hearing to become President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general, said Tuesday he would respect laws allowing abortion despite his deeply held personal belief that the courts are wrong on the issue. The Alabama Republican said specifically that he would respect the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that said the right to privacy gives women the right to an abortion. Sessions, who has consistently voted against abortion rights in the Senate and has a 0% rating from several abortion rights groups, told senators overseeing his committee hearing that although he believed Roe v. Wade violated the Constitution, he would defend it. \u201cIt is the law of the land, it has been settled for some time,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cI will respect it and follow it.\u201d Sessions said, however, that he believes the decision was a \u201ccolossal\u201d mistake by the Supreme Court.

Wade. \u201cI\u2019m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life,\u201d Trump said in a post-election interview with CBS, arguing that if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

            "article_content": "Sen. Jeff Sessions \u2013 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general \u2013 denied \u201cdamnably false charges\u201d of racism Tuesday as he kicked off his hours-long confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sessions also said he\u2019d play no role in considering prosecuting Hillary Clinton, opposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States and said he wouldn\u2019t challenge existing Supreme Court decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage. Here\u2019s some of what we\u2019ve learned so far from Session\u2019s confirmation hearing: Nowhere in Sessions\u2019 prepared remarks was a rebuttal of the accusations that sank his 1986 nomination for a federal judgeship. But he decided to address them \u201chead on\u201d anyway, denying decades-old claims that he had offered supportive words about the Ku Klux Klan and criticized the NAACP. He said those were \u201cdamnably false charges.\u201d Sessions responds to past racism allegations \u201cI abhor the Klan and its hateful ideology,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cI never declared the NAACP was un-American.\u201d The Alabama senator and former US attorney told senators that in 1986, \u201cthere was an effort to caricaturize me as something I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Booker to testify against Sessions As he discussed those allegations of racism, his wife, Mary Sessions, became emotional in the crowd. Sessions said he\u2019d seen the horrors of racism \u201cas a Southerner.\u201d \u201cI know that was wrong, and I know we need to do better. We can never go back,\u201d he said. \u201cI am totally committed to maintaining the freedom and equality this country has to provide to every citizen and I can assure you that\u2019s how I will approach it.\u201d Sessions: Muslims shouldn't be denied entry to US Sessions backed away from Trump\u2019s campaign trail promise to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. \u201cI have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States,\u201d the Alabama senator said. He did, though, open the door for religion to be used as a factor in approving visas. Under questioning from Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Sessions said some people hold religious views that are \u201cinimical\u201d to the safety of people in the United States. Sessions also defended Trump, noting that he has backed away from his calls for an outright Muslim ban, instead aiming that ban at countries with terrorist activity. \u201cLock her up\u201d chants rang through nearly every Trump campaign rally this fall. Trump once promised to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate his Democratic rival. If any of that happens, though, Sessions says he\u2019ll have nothing to do with it. Sessions: I'd recuse myself from Clinton probe He said he\u2019d recuse himself, citing his role as a prominent Trump supporter during the 2016 presidential race. \u201cI believe the proper thing for me to do would be to recuse myself from questions involving those kinds of investigations involving Secretary Clinton that were raised during the campaign and could be otherwise connected to it,\u201d Sessions said, upon questioning by Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. \u201cI believe that would be best for the country because we can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute.\u201d Sessions said he would respect the 1973 Supreme Court decision allowing abortion and the more recent Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage \u2013 even if he doesn\u2019t agree with the decisions. \u201cI believe it violated the Constitution,\u201d Sessions said in response to a question from Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein about whether he stands by his past statements calling Roe a \u201ccolossal\u201d mistake. \u201cIt is the law of the land, it has been settled for some time. \u2026 I will respect it and follow it,\u201d Sessions said. Likewise, Sessions said same-sex marriage is settled. \u201cThe Supreme Court has ruled on that, the dissents dissented vigorously, but it was 5-4 and \u2026 I will follow that decision,\u201d he said. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, wasn\u2019t willing to let Sessions dodge one of the biggest controversies Trump faced during the election: the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. Sessions asked about 'Access Hollywood' tape \u201cIs grabbing a woman by her genitals without her consent sexual assault?\u201d Leahy asked. Sessions responded, \u201cClearly it would be.\u201d Sessions was pressed on waterboarding \u2013 which Trump has spoken in favor of bringing back even though the practice is considered torture under US and international law and is illegal. Pressed by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, on whether waterboarding is torture, Sessions replied that Congress has, since waterboarding\u2019s use in the early Bush administration during the war on terror, outlawed it. \u201cCongress has taken an action now that makes it absolutely improper and illegal to use waterboarding or any other form of torture in the United States by our military and by all our other departments and agencies,\u201d he said. Sessions was also grilled by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, on the Constitution\u2019s \u201cemoluments\u201d clause, which bans foreign business dealings by officers of the United States \u2013 but might not actually apply to presidents. The Alabama senator sidestepped the question, avoiding Blumenthal\u2019s urging to appoint a special counsel if Trump or a member of his family ran afoul of the law and saying he\u2019d have to look into it.",

            "article_content": "Republicans need the backing of at least 50 of their 52 members to repeal Obamacare There are at least two pro-choice senators who caucus with the GOP A push by Republican congressional leaders to defund Planned Parenthood could threaten passage of their top-priority legislation to repeal Obamacare because of opposition to the anti-abortion provision by two key GOP senators. House Speaker Paul Ryan announced Thursday that Republicans will move to strip all federal funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the process they are using early this year to dismantle Obamacare. Congressional Republicans have tried for years to zero out all federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the group provides abortion services. The fight over Obamacare helped trigger a 16-day government shutdown in 2013, and Democrats and President Barack Obama insisted any Planned Parenthood provision targeting the group be removed from a bill to fund federal agencies. The decision to add the controversial Planned Parenthood language, which is opposed by most Democrats, could have a major impact on getting the Affordable Care Act repeal legislation through the Senate because supporters need the backing of at least 50 of their 52 members and two pro-choice senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, won\u2019t commit to approving the bill with the Planned Parenthood provision in it. Further complicating matters for Senate GOP leaders is Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who announced this week he plans to vote against the Obamacare repeal legislation because the underlying budget measure it is attached to doesn\u2019t balance and adds to the deficit. If Murkowski, Collins and Paul all voted against the budget bill, it would be enough to torpedo the Obamacare repeal legislation. \u201cI\u2019m going to wait and see what happens,\u201d Collins told reporters, indicating she thinks it\u2019s too early to decide how she will vote on the bill.  \u201cObviously, I\u2019m not happy to hear the speaker wants to include defunding of Planned Parenthood, an extremely controversial issue in the package.\u201d Murkowski\u2019s told reporters Tuesday she was still weighing the issue. In 2015, she joined Collins in voting for an amendment to strip Planned Parenthood funding out of a budget bill that would have also repealed much of Obamacare. But Murkowski ultimately backed the repeal measure even though it had the anti-Planned Parenthood provision, which Obama ultimately vetoed. \u201cAt this point and time, I have not been involved in a sit down with colleagues about specifics of reconciliation. So it\u2019s tough for me to speculate or engage in any conjecture,\u201d Murkowski said earlier this week. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be having a lot of discussions about that probably as soon as this week.\u201d When asked her position Thursday, Murkowski\u2019s spokeswoman Karina Petersen said, the senator \u201cis concerned about defunding Planned Parenthood as she is a longtime support of Planned Parenthood and has opposed broadly defunding the organization.\u201d Republicans could drop the Planned Parenthood measure, but doing so could spark anger from the right-flank of their party and potentially make it harder to defund the organization at a later date. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in his chamber, said \u201cthat\u2019s certainly where I am\u201d when asked if he wanted to include defunding of the organization into the repeal measure. But he noted \u201cthat\u2019s place we start\u201d and that nothing has \u201cfinally been decided yet.\u201d \u201cWhile we would like to have all 52 senators, if we have a vice president in the chair, that gives us a little bit of flexibility on reconciliation,\u201d Cornyn said Thursday, referencing the ability of the vice president to break Senate ties. The vast majority of federal money that Planned Parenthood does receive funds preventive health care, birth control, pregnancy tests, and other women\u2019s health care services. Democrats also point out that much of the money the group received is through the Medicaid program, which reimburses health care clinics that provide care to those covered by the federal program. Under the long-standing \u201cHyde amendment\u201d that is attached to annual funding bills, no federal money is allowed to go to programs that include abortion services, unless they are needed to preserve the life of the mother or are caused by rape. Democrats immediately denounced the news that Republicans again were working to bar future federal funds for Planned Parenthood. \u201cThis is a priority for the Republicans,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Thursday afternoon. \u201cSo I just would like to speak individually to women across America: this is about respect for you, for your judgment about your personal decisions in terms of your reproductive needs, the size and timing of your family or the rest, not to be determined by the insurance company or by the Republican ideological right-wing caucus in the House of Representatives. So this is a very important occasion where we\u2019re pointing out very specifically what repeal of the (Affordable Care Act) will mean to woman.\u201d Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on \u201cOutFront\u201d Thursday that \u201cconcerned\u201d women have lobbied against the move throughout the day. \u201cHis phone has been jammed up today,\u201d Richards said. Anti-abortion rights groups point to a letter that the Trump campaign signed in September pledging support for \u201cDefunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions, and re-allocating their funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive health care for women.\u201d \u201cVulnerable pro-abortion Democratic senators need to do a serious gut check, especially following the 2016 election outcome, and decide if they will stand with their constituents and women\u2019s health care or continue to funnel money to big abortion,\u201d warned Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, in a written statement. CNN\u2019s Jason Kurtz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "To move legislation, the GOP will have to keep everyone in their party happy There will be opportunity for senators to gain leverage on key issues The Senate\u2019s razor-thin balance of power \u2013 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats \u2013 means that just a few senators can tip the scale on whether a bill passes \u2013 and some lawmakers are already embracing their potential influence. Effort to defund Planned Parenthood threatens Obamacare repeal As the GOP looks to take advantage of having Republican President-elect Donald Trump in the White House, party leaders have promised an ambitious first 100 days agenda. But to do so, they\u2019ll need to keep everyone in their party happy. And senators on both sides are quick to realize they can gain leverage if a vote will come down to party lines. That provides opportunities for senators with pet issues to draw lines in the sand, for vulnerable senators up for re-election to get airtime, and for moderates on both sides to work across the aisle on compromise bills. Some examples have already emerged. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul voted against the motion to open up Obamacare repeal proceedings on Wednesday do to opposition to the underlying budget. Though Republicans still had the votes to proceed, Paul is lobbying his colleagues and working with members of the House to try to force his colleagues to oppose deficit spending, even if it jeopardizes Republicans\u2019 pledged Obamacare repeal. Paul rallies House Republicans on deficit Paul met Thursday morning with the House Freedom Caucus, a group of roughly 40 Republicans in the House who have caused headaches far bigger than their small numbers for Republican leadership. Paul left the meeting without firm commitments, though the group plans to continue to meet on it. While on his way to make a similar pitch to his Senate colleagues, Paul said in response to a question that the Freedom Caucus could serve as a model for a small percentage of the GOP caucus having a big impact in the Senate, too. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try. We\u2019ll see,\u201d Paul said. Another Obamacare issue is the fate of efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, which is opposed by most Democrats. Two pro-abortion rights senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, won\u2019t commit to approving the bill with the Planned Parenthood provision in it, endangering GOP hopes of easily getting the Affordable Care Act repeal legislation through the Senate. Other senators are also flexing their muscles on key issues. As Trump continues to deny and downplay Russia\u2019s role in hacking Democratic political groups in an effort to influence the election, as determined by the US intelligence community and third-party experts, Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham have been vocal in their condemnation of Russia\u2019s interference. Republicans don\u2019t agree on how to replace Obamacare McCain and Graham are working with Democrats, including Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, on legislation that would impose sanctions on Russia beyond those announced by the White House last month, which would force Trump to accept the sanctions or publicly revoke them. McCain and Graham both emphasized that their work on Russia wasn\u2019t out of the mainstream. \u201cI think there\u2019s a supermajority for what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Graham said when asked about how much influence a few senators could have. But McCain acknowledged that the narrow Senate majority gives heft to a small voting bloc. \u201cThat makes it more impactful,\u201d he acknowledged, while also emphasizing the bipartisan nature of the effort. The narrow majority has also allowed Republicans to hold sway over Trump\u2019s nominees. When Trump nominated Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, McCain and Graham joined Sen. Marco Rubio in expressing concerns and questions about Tillerson\u2019s friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom Tillerson has interacted for his business interests in Russia. McCain has said since meeting with Tillerson some of his concerns have been answered and Rubio said Thursday he will meet with Tillerson early next week, but the nominee is sure to face tough questioning on the issue during his confirmation hearings on Wednesday. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which will hear Tillerson\u2019s nomination, is one of the committees that only have a one-vote majority for Republicans this Congress \u2013 meaning any unsatisfied Republican could vote against advancing a nominee to the floor and make the nominee\u2019s path more difficult. Membership on that committee includes Rubio; Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who is up for re-election this year, has sparred with Trump in the past and is likely to be targeted by Democrats; and Paul, whose foreign policy views tend to be more isolationist than his party\u2019s and who is against nation-building. Rubio demurred when asked if he and his colleagues could seek to increase their influence by forming a bloc, as did Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The two close friends, along with fellow good friend Utah Sen. Mike Lee and blue-state Republican Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, have already teamed up on legislative advocacy in the first three days of this Congress. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone around here\u2019s thinking in those terms,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBy and large, we worked real hard to have a majority so we can undo a lot of the damage that\u2019s been done to this country over the last few years. So I\u2019ve never heard or think there\u2019s any effort ongoing to create some sort of bloc to steer policy and create some sort of leverage.\u201d Still, if three members voted in concert, they could prove a make-or-break bloc on legislation. And Cruz and Lee have not shied away from taking on members of their own party in the past. And it\u2019s not just Republicans who could take advantage of the narrow majority. On Thursday, 13 Democrats put out a statement appealing to Republican leadership on Obamacare, billing themselves as \u201cmoderate Democrats\u201d open to working across the aisle, including Democrats such as North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, who are up for re-election in red states in 2018. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat in a red state also up for re-election next term, has also been looking to reach across the aisle, skipping a meeting with President Barack Obama and Democrats on the Hill this week in favor of talking to both sides. Manchin said he hopes Republicans also understand the importance of working with a few members of the other side, citing how many Democrats it will take them to overcome the 60-vote filibuster threshold. \u201cThey understand, it\u2019s going to take eight. If they can hold all the Republicans at 52, then it will take eight of us to get anything moving,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to have to be working with 10, 12, truly sitting down with 10 or 12 moderate Democrats as you think that you want to move things forward.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Tom Perriello, a former Virginia congressman and an ex-diplomat in the Obama administration, is set to shake up the Democratic primary in the highly anticipated 2017 Virginia gubernatorial race. A Democratic source with knowledge of Periello\u2019s plans confirmed them to CNN. A second senior Democratic source said Perriello has informed Lt. Governor Ralph Northam, up until now the only announced candidate, of his intention to run. The New York Times first reported Perriello\u2019s plans, and official announcement could come as soon as Thursday. Perriello himself did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Perriello confirmed his bid Thursday morning, tweeting: \u201cI\u2019m running for Governor. VA will remain the firewall vs Trump- our values worth defending: http://tomforvirginia.com.\u201d I\u2019m running for Governor. VA will remain the firewall vs Trump- our values worth defending: https://t.co/pkKSJ4uHqJ https://t.co/CR3D83Z5ru Perriello\u2019s plans complicate the Democrats\u2019 strategy in Virginia, a state with likely the most important political contest in 2017. Only two states, Virginia and New Jersey, will hold governor\u2019s races this year and the results are often viewed as a way to judge voters\u2019 impressions of the newly elected presidential administration. Democrats had thought they had avoided an ugly primary battle when the state\u2019s popular attorney general, Mark Herring, chose to run for re-election instead of challenging Northam in a primary. Perriello\u2019s entry creates an interesting dynamic. He served one term in the conservative, sprawling 5th District of Central Virginia before being swept out of office in the tea party wave of 2010. His two years were spent balancing his liberal politics with the conservative sensibilities of the largely rural district, which does include the progressive enclave of Charlottesville. He sided with conservatives on key issues such as guns (he once received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association) and abortion (he cast a ballot in favor the Stupak amendment which prevents federal funds from being used to pay for abortions). But Perriello ended his 2010 campaign in a liberal flourish, even bringing President Barack Obama to the district for a dramatic rally in the closing days of the campaign. He lost by 4 percentage points. Democrats plan to put Trump on trial through his nominees Perriello is viewed as a progressive champion among Virginia Democrats, while Northam is viewed as a more traditional, moderate Virginia Democrat. Born and raised in the state\u2019s Eastern Shore, Northam was a prep school baseball star before attending the famed Virginia Military Institute and then eventually becoming a pediatric neurosurgeon. He also served in the Virginia Senate and was known for his ability to work with both sides, but had a reliably liberal voting record, especially when it came to abortion rights. Meanwhile, Perriello has spent his years out of public office working for a liberal think tank in Washington before accepting an assignment as the Obama administration\u2019s Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa. Obama makes justice reform pitch in journal he once edited Both men have relatively low profiles when it comes to statewide Virginia politics, but Northam certainly starts the race with an enormous head start. He has already raised millions of dollars and has spent the last year criss-crossing the state as the presumptive Democratic nominee. He also still enjoys the support of most of Virginia\u2019s prominent Democrats including both senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, and Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Aides to the two senators and the governor confirmed to CNN they will stick with the Northam regardless of Perriello\u2019s entry into the race. This new development could be good news for Virginia Republicans, who are already anticipating their own bruising primary. Their contest could be the first major inter-party battle for the GOP since Donald Trump\u2019s surprise win in the race for president. Former George W. Bush aide Ed Gillespie is considered the frontrunner, but he is facing a feisty challenge from a slew of candidates including, Corey Stewart the former Virginia Campaign Chairman for Trump, State Sen. Frank Wagner and businessman Dallas Riggleman. Virginia hold its primary \u2013 which is open to all voters \u2013 on June 13. This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Liberal groups believe Republicans set a new precedent when they blocked Merrick Garland Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee could spend decades on the bench Liberal groups are holding standing-room-only meetings to prepare for the confirmation hearings of Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general, but many in the room believe the battle will be a dry run for a much bigger fight: the confirmation of Donald Trump\u2019s eventual Supreme Court nominee. The hearings to fill the ninth seat on the bench will center around the testimony of someone who will likely cement a conservative majority on the high court for years to come. The groups are now working on an unfamiliar playing field \u2013 without the anchor of a Democratic President. They are laying the groundwork for a major fight and hoping that the new ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \u2013 California Sen. Dianne Feinstein \u2013 will lead that fight. Jeff Sessions Fast Facts \u201cWe are not going to settle on a Supreme Court nominee,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told MSNBC on Tuesday night. \u201cIf they don\u2019t appoint someone who\u2019s really good, we\u2019re going to oppose him tooth and nail.\u201d Democrats  are also preparing to put Republicans on trial for the way they handled President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland. Liberal groups believe that when Republicans blocked hearings for Garland, they set a new precedent forever changing Supreme Court confirmation hearings. And they refer to the seat that Trump is about to fill as the \u201cstolen seat.\u201d On Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest warned that the fallout from the Garland fight would extend to future presidents. \u201cThat breakdown of comity in the United States Senate, that abdication of the basic responsibility of members of the Unites States Senate, by subjecting it to such intense partisanship and actually allowing partisanship, to supersede the constitutional obligation, it\u2019s discouraging,\u201d Earnest told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a precedent that I think Republicans will regret setting.\u201d Garland\u2019s nomination may have lapsed, but for his supporters, the wounds are fresh. \u201cFolks know that Republicans stole this seat and are extraordinarily disinclined to let them get away with it,\u201d said Drew Courtney, spokesman for the People for the American Way. Courtney says that anyone on Trump\u2019s list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees will provoke a big fight and that Republicans are mistaken if they believe that Democrats would accept someone off a \u201cwish list\u201d compiled by conservative groups such as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. \u201cEveryone understands that the stakes are enormous,\u201d he said. It was back in 2013 when then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, frustrated by Republican efforts to block lower court nominees, changed the rules and lowered the threshold to overcome a filibuster from 60 to 51 votes. Supreme Court nominees were exempt from the rules change and are still subject to the higher vote threshold. In his interview with MSNBC, Schumer signaled a hardline: that unless Trump nominated a \u201cmainstream\u201d candidate, Democrats might force Republicans to consider a rules change for Supreme Court nominees. Schumer said the Republicans may not have the 60 votes \u201cto put in an out of the mainstream nominee, and then they will have to make a choice: change the rules. It\u2019s going to be very hard for them to change the rules, because there are a handful of Republicans who believe in the institution of the Senate and don\u2019t change the rules.\u201d Pressed on whether he\u2019d work to hold the seat open, he replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Republicans, meanwhile, praise Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for following through with a promise to allow the \u201cpeople\u201d to choose Antonin Scalia\u2019s replacement after the election and they say every name on Trump\u2019s list of 21 is eminently qualified to take the bench. Most of all, they are keenly aware of the stakes and are committed to ensuring that the new nominee might become Trump\u2019s most lasting legacy. To be sure, while Trump\u2019s other nominees could serve for four years \u2013 or even eight \u2013 his Supreme Court nominee could spend decades on the bench. Justice Anthony Kennedy, for example, was placed on the bench six presidents ago. \u201cDonald Trump will pick from his excellent list of principled and highly qualified candidates who are committed to an interpretation of the Constitution as it was written,\u201d said Carrie Severino of the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network. Trump ally Newt Gingrich rejects the notion that the Sessions hearings will impact the Supreme Court fight one way or another. \u201cFirst of all, I think Sessions will be fine \u2013 most of the attacks on him are just false,\u201d Gingrich said Tuesday Gingrich added he thought that Trump would not stray from the list of 21 potential nominees he released during the campaign. \u201cI believe he has a moral obligation to name somebody who literally is on the list and was released in the campaign,\u201d he said. It was during the campaign that Scalia suddenly died and the White House put forward Garland, whom the President called a consensus candidate. Progressive groups supported the pick vigorously even though some had hoped for a different candidate who might have done more to rally the base. Throughout the spring they ran a campaign called #WENEEDNINE to push for hearings. By summer, Garland\u2019s name was no longer a headline. But progressives hope that will change in the next few weeks. \u201cThis is a moment in time for the broadest possible coalition of groups to go out to their members, affiliates and supporters to talk about the importance of the Supreme Court,\u201d said Nan Aron of the progressive Alliance for Justice. \u201cIn the background lurks this very fixed idea that we are looking at a stolen seat, a seat that should have been filled by an Obama nominee who was forward looking not backward in his view of the Constitution,\u201d she said. But building a coalition will be complicated and could take careful choreography. Unlike confirmation battles for a typical cabinet post, there are a variety of issues at stake and diverse perspectives. They include the hot button issues \u2013 abortion rights, voting laws, environmental regulations, union rules, campaign finance, gun control \u2013that often closely divide the high court. Liberal groups want delay of Sessions hearing Christopher Kang, the National Director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, has attended the meetings in preparation for the Sessions hearings and says it has been an important exercise for the groups to react without a package of material they might have come from the White House during the Obama administration. \u201cThis time it is up to us to build the record,\u201d he said. Sen. Patrick Leahy, a veteran of confirmation battles for years, is no longer the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, having moved over to Appropriations. Feinstein will take the helm, bringing with her some new staff. Progressives note that Feinstein was quick to act when Sessions left off some key information \u2013 his failed nomination as a federal judge \u2013 when he submitted his first questionnaire. She fired off a letter directly to Sessions asking him for more information. In a statement, she did not ask for a delay in the Sessions hearings but asked Chairman Grassley to join a request for information she felt was missing. \u201cI am sure you would agree that staff must have sufficient time to do the due diligence on any nominee for this vital position,\u201d she wrote. But some progressives are concerned that she might work differently from Leahy. They were surprised, for instance, in 2007 when she voted in favor of Judge Leslie Southwick a nominee of George W. Bush for the 5th Circuit. But Feinstein voted against Bush\u2019s nominees to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. For now, before a nominee is announced, Elizabeth Wydra of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center says that the \u201cunprecedented\u201d behavior of Senate Republicans last year \u201cseverely undermined bedrock norms of constitutional government.\u201d \u201cNow that Republicans are in control, they could take a first step in repairing some of the damage they inflicted by nominating a consensus candidate, in the mold of Garland,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "Obamacare and confirming Trump's nominees top the agenda Russia's involvement in the 2016 election also promises to be a top issue \u201cBuckle up\u201d was the advice Vice President-elect Mike Pence gave Hill Republicans about the hectic pace ahead for Capitol Hill\u2019s first 100 days in 2017. The Republican-controlled Congress returns Tuesday to begin an aggressive push on a range of policies that their new partner \u2013 President-elect Donald Trump \u2013 can help turn into law. The focus in January will be to start the wheels in motion to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and vote to confirm many of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. There will also be debate about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election \u2013 an issue the incoming President doesn\u2019t want to focus on, saying last week it\u2019s time to \u201cmove on\u201d \u2013 but many in his own party view as a serious threat. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is aiming to secure confirmation for many of Trump\u2019s top national security and economic team members around the time he is sworn in on January 20. While Democrats don\u2019t have the votes to block Trump\u2019s nominees, they are signaling an intense fight nevertheless. They are planning to leverage the high-profile committee hearings to draw contrasts with Republicans on key issues like health care, the environment and foreign policy. \u201cRepeal and replace\u201d has been the regular Republican refrain from virtually the day President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law became law in 2010. McConnell announced last month that the first vote of the new Congress will be to start dismantling Obamacare. The President isn\u2019t going quietly. Obama is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a rare meeting with all House and Senate Democrats to \u201cdiscuss fighting GOP plans to repeal (the Affordable Care Act),\u201d according to a senior Senate Democratic aide. The high-profile visit signals that the President will be personally involved defending the law that stands as his most important domestic policy legacy. Now that they have a GOP president to actually sign legislation that rolls back the law, congressional Republicans are acknowledging that it\u2019s complicated to simultaneously repeal Obamacare and put something else in its place. They control both the House and the Senate but they are limited because they don\u2019t have 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster that would be expected on efforts to get rid of Obamacare. Their plan is to use a budget process known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to wipe away the major planks of Obamacare. The Senate will begin debating a budget resolution this week as the first step. That allows them to use the procedure to pass the repeal in the Senate with a simple majority, avoiding an expected Democratic filibuster. Reconciliation rules do limit the items in the law that can be rolled back to those that have a direct impact on the federal budget, and Republicans still don\u2019t have all the details ready on which ones they will include. Democrats are preparing an aggressive public relations campaign to highlight how Obamacare has helped the 20 million now covered because of the law, and the other benefits they believe have occurred, such as better preventive care. On a conference call with House Democrats last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted that the ACA lowered costs and improved outcomes for millions. She compared the fight ahead against Republicans to the one she led in 2005 and 2006 when then-President George W. Bush traveled around the country championing a proposal to privatize Social Security, a plan that didn\u2019t gain traction with the public or in Congress. Events in House congressional districts are planned for January 7, and Senate Democrats are also teeing up several events in Washington this week to remind people about the elements of Obamacare they believe are popular. Pelosi, incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced that January 15 is a national \u201cOur First Stand: Save Health Care\u201d day of action for advocacy groups and Democrats to criticize Republicans for working to target the health care law, as well as other entitlement programs such as Medicare. While Republicans can pass the budget measure relatively quickly over a few weeks to begin unwinding Obamacare, the package that will contain the actual plans for repealing the law will take at least a couple of months to develop. Several committees in both the House and Senate will weigh in with their stamps on the details, including which taxes will go and which ones may need to remain in place until a new replacement plan is put in place. Democrats are also bracing for a big fight over funding for Planned Parenthood, an issue that has triggered multiple standoffs in the past with the GOP. It\u2019s unclear whether Republicans will include a ban on funding for the women\u2019s health care provider because of its role in providing abortion services as part of the initial budget bill. There is no consensus yet on when to address the issue, but conservatives are pressing for action soon and view the reconciliation process as the place to tackle it. Republicans are also struggling to come to consensus on how quickly they need to lay out their proposal to stand up a new health care system to take Obamacare\u2019s place. Conservatives are insisting they limit any transition period to two years. But GOP leaders are wary that once they begin unraveling the complicated federal and state programs now providing coverage, it will take three years or more to practically implement a new system. Multiple Republican aides say it\u2019s more likely that replacement plans will be voted on in a piecemeal fashion over multiple years, perhaps even after the 2018 midterm elections, to ensure there are not major marketplace disruptions or economic fallout for insurers, states or the private sector. Trump\u2019s transition team describes the mix of business leaders and former military leaders selected for Cabinet posts as a group of outsiders set to shakeup the way Washington works. Republicans are confident that they have solid support and will get help of many of the red state Democrats, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, to confirm them. So far, Rex Tillerson, the oil company CEO Trump tapped to serve as secretary of state, is the only pick who is raising some concerns with a handful of Republicans. They want more information about his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and how he will deal with myriad foreign policy issues where the US has tangled with Russia like Syria, Iran and recent cyberattacks. Democrats are complaining that Tillerson, and many other Cabinet nominees, have been \u201cvery slow\u201d in providing information to the committees ahead of the upcoming hearings that committee chairs are targeting to hold in the second week in January. They are threatening to drag out votes on nominees if they don\u2019t receive complete financial disclosure and ethics reports in advance of hearings so Senators can review the materials. Who\u2019s in Trump\u2019s Cabinet? \u201cRepublicans shouldn\u2019t expect their nominees to sail through if those nominees won\u2019t provide the disclosure that past nominees provided and that senators, and the American public, deserve,\u201d Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, told CNN. Any delay would just be symbolic, but if Democrats use the full amount of debate time allowed under Senate rules, then a vote on each nominee that would normally take place in one or two days could stretch out a week. That could mean it could take months to clear through all of the president\u2019s nominees if Democrats decide to put up a fight, and other priorities like Obamacare repeal could also be delayed. Democrats have been critical of virtually every person Trump has selected, but they realize they can\u2019t wage war on all of them. In addition to highlighting conflicts Tillerson\u2019s business dealings might present, multiple Senate Democratic sources say they are digging into the stock trades of Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Under the law known as the \u201cSTOCK Act\u201d Price has disclosed information about his trades involving health and pharmaceutical company stocks. One senior Democratic leadership aide suggested they view the issue of conflicts arising from votes in Price\u2019s post as budget chair coming around the time of these financial transactions as \u201cseriously, seriously troubling.\u201d There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Price. Phil Blando, a spokesman for Trump\u2019s transition team, had previously told CNN Price \u201ccomplied fully with all applicable laws and ethics rules governing his personal finances.\u201d And if confirmed would comply with the law, Blando added. Obama\u2019s announcement last week of new sanctions against Russia for its cyberattacks during the presidential election are putting Hill Republicans in a tough spot. Virtually all the top GOP leaders in Congress publicly backed the sanctions, although they criticized how long it took to put them in place, along with the administration\u2019s overall foreign policy. US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia carried out a steady and deliberate cyberoperation targeting top Democrats email accounts and the Democratic National Committee.  Senate Armed Service Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, is holding a Thursday hearing on the threat posed by foreign governments targeting US computer systems, including Russia, which will be the first public hearing since agencies revealed the links they found to Russia in the attacks. Get ready for another year of global tumult McCain, along with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, have vowed to draft legislation imposing additional sanctions to penalize Russia, and Democrats have agreed to craft a bipartisan proposal. Both McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have publicly denounced Russia\u2019s moves, but any bipartisan push to move sanctions legislation puts them in the precarious spot of using valuable time in the first 100 days of the new administration on an issue that puts them at odds with Trump. Democrats are criticizing new Republican proposed rules governing decorum in the chamber of the House of Representatives. In response to a summer sit-in that Democrats used to take over the House floor, GOP leaders are adding a provision to impose fines as high as $2,500 for any member who uses social media application to broadcast activities from the floor. Some Democrats are calling the proposal \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d \u201ca gag rule\u201d and \u201cPutinesque,\u201d but the changes are expected to pass. It\u2019s unclear if a legal challenge could force the GOP to back down.",

Sarah Sanders is teaching us a thing or two about the definition of confounding. As in, bewildering, astonishing, baffling, perplexing, mystifying or \u2013 just plain confusing. Keli Goff, who writes for The Daily Beast, told me, \u201cSomeday 100 Ph.D. theses will be written on Sarah Sanders.\u201d It\u2019s difficult for many women to understand how a woman can so glibly defend men who are accused of sexual harassment. It\u2019s one thing to say your boss \u2013 Donald Trump \u2013 denies the allegations leveled against him by at least 15 women, but quite another to come up with a tortured, yet clever, way to discount Trump\u2019s female accusers. \u201cThe people of this country, at a decisive election, supported President Trump,\u201d Sanders said this week. \u201cAnd we feel like these allegations have been answered through that process.\u201d How Sarah Sanders humiliated the press Even more confounding to her critics, Sanders has also praised Trump for his behavior toward her. \u201cCertainly, as a woman myself, I\u2019ve never felt anything but treated with the highest level of respect and been empowered to do my job. And I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen the President do, day in and day out, since we\u2019ve been here and during the campaign.\u201d Sanders\u2019 verbal gymnastics enrage and astound liberal women. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing. Amazing how she doesn\u2019t even flinch when she has to say these incredibly absurd things,\u201d Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman told me on HLN. MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski has called for Sanders to resign unless she \u201capologizes\u201d for Trump \u201cbeing a sexist pig\u201d over his suggestive tweet about Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. As you know by now, Trump tweeted that Gillibrand \u201cwould do anything\u201d for campaign donations. I don\u2019t think Sanders will resign, Mika, but I find it fascinating how women are reacting to Sanders\u2019 moxie (if you lean Trump) or her sometimes convoluted answers \u2013 like a verbal game of \u201cTwister\u201d (if you prefer factual press briefings). It\u2019s become hysterical. And not in a funny way. Which brings me to Chelsea Handler. The feminist activist and entertainer seems befuddled when it comes to criticizing a woman who has a job only two other women have held in the history of this country: Dee Dee Myers and Dana Perino. Handler has not only called Sanders a \u201ctrollop,\u201d but has portrayed her as a hick who is just plain dumb. Handler tweeted a video of a faux Sanders in a \u201cmakeup tutorial.\u201d The comedian portraying Sanders talks in a stereotypical Southern accent and is slathering her face with excessive amounts of makeup. CNN to WH: Is Moore support a moral question? \u201cI\u2019m gonna go ahead and get this moisturizer and slather it on,\u201d faux Sanders says. Later, in the video faux Sanders paints her lips \u201cRepublican red\u201d and says, \u201cThe more lipstick you use, the younger you look. In fact, the other day Roy Moore tried to pick me up.\u201d The schtick is not funny or clever. It\u2019s just plain mean. And it invalidates every sound argument Handler might have. Although, oddly, Sanders\u2019 father, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, seems just as confounded about his daughter as the hysterical, liberal left. Huckabee rushed to his daughter\u2019s defense on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d but instead of extolling her prowess at what must be a difficult job, he brought up abortion and parenting. \u201cThe sad thing about it is she (Handler) boasts about two abortions she had at 16,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cI think she\u2019s jealous of my daughter. My daughter has a husband who loves her and is wonderful to her. My daughter has three delightful children. \u2026 She goes to church and lives a life Chelsea Handler has never known.\u201d In other words, Handler, a bitter, godless baby-killer should shut up about this daughter/wife/mother. It\u2019s like \u201cMean Girls\u201d meets \u201cFootloose,\u201d that \u201980s movie featuring an uptight local minister who insisted everyone abide by \u201850s-style norms. However, none of this rhetoric makes it any easier to understand why Sanders, a mother of three, lies for a man who defended Roy Moore, an accused child molester.  And if I were to try to address this seeming dissonance, I would do it without denigrating Sanders\u2019 appearance or extolling her family values \u2013 because, frankly, who cares? I believe we\u2019re way overthinking things. Sanders has a job to do, and she\u2019s doing it more effectively, at least in her boss\u2019 mind, than her predecessor, Sean Spicer. Or maybe she knows that former press secretaries \u2013 even failed secretaries \u2013 have a rich afterlife. After all, Spicer was not only granted a fellowship at Harvard, but is now writing a book and hitting the lucrative speaking circuit. See, it pays to be confounding.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. The video is excruciating to watch. President Trump nominated Matthew Petersen, a member of the Federal Election Commission, to serve a lifetime appointment on the federal district court in Washington, D.C. He is being questioned \u2013 politely but insistently \u2013 by John Kennedy, a Republican Senator from Louisiana. The subject, at first, is Petersen\u2019s experience in litigation, or, as it turns out, his lack thereof. Petersen admits he has never tried a case, never argued a motion, never taken a deposition by himself \u2013 basically that he has never done any of the tasks that are crucial to the work of the courts. Kennedy then moves on to Petersen\u2019s knowledge of the law, which turns out to be similarly lacking. Petersen doesn\u2019t know about the Daubert standard (which covers the admissibility of expert testimony), motions in limine (which attempt to restrict evidence heard in trials), or the abstention doctrines (which cover the relationship between federal and state law). The Senate may or may not approve Petersen, even after this embarrassing performance. He has close connections to Republicans in both the Senate and the White House, and used to work with Don McGahn, the White House counsel. Trump is the one in 'tatters,' not the FBI But the real message of the video is about the unsung successes of the Trump administration and Republican-controlled Senate. All through the last two years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, bottled up the President\u2019s nominations to fill federal judgeships. Most famously, McConnell refused to allow consideration of Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. But McConnell\u2019s blockade considered the lower federal courts as well, leaving dozens of vacancies for the new President to fill. And President Trump has filled them, with the enthusiastic concurrence of the Republican majority in the Senate. Because of all the vacancies, Trump is on the fastest pace to fill judgeships since Richard Nixon, two generations ago. And Trump has filled these seats with highly partisan conservatives. Most of them, to be sure, have also been highly qualified and knowledgeable, like Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed for the Scalia seat earlier this year. In recent months, the quality control on the nominations seems to have slipped. Embarrassments like Petersen, and Brett Talley (who also never tried a case) and Jeff Mateer (who called transgender children part of \u201cSatan\u2019s plan\u201d) have reached the Senate, and Talley and Mateer have already been withdrawn. (A similar fate probably awaits Petersen.)  But the larger point is that judicial conservatives have made huge progress during the Trump presidency. Since most federal cases never reach the Supreme Court, these judges will be able to shape the law that affects millions of people. Their agendas are clear: anti-abortion rights, anti-gay rights, opposition to affirmative action, limitations on voting rights and lower barriers between church and state. Petersen may have had a bad day in the Senate, but the conservative cause is otherwise flourishing in the courts.",

The insurance company Geico sponsors my home state\u2019s most sacred sporting rituals \u2013 the Geico 500 NASCAR race at Talladega and college football, over which the Alabama Crimson Tide still rules! But would The Gecko want to move to Alabama? He is not white, sounds foreign and is, you know, kind of fey \u2013 and this is the state that in 2011, passed the most draconian anti-immigrant law in the nation. But image-savvy businesses may have qualms about lending their adorable mascots to the Heart of Dixie if Roy Moore is the winner of next Tuesday\u2019s Senate election here. He is an avowed Constitution-denier, slavery sentimentalist, segregation-upholder, gay-basher, Jew-damner, woman-shunner and alleged one-time fancier of teenage girls, two of whom have accused him of sexual abuse \u2013 accusations that he denies. Given the economic backlash against discriminatory legislation passed in North Carolina and Indiana, many Alabamians \u2013 \u201cmainstream\u201d Republicans alongside the chronically thwarted liberals \u2013 are bracing, if Moore wins the election, for what Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox told me could be a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d blow to state commerce and self-esteem, notably to the 24-karat \u201cbrand\u201d of Alabama\u2019s second-best-known celebrity, the Tide\u2019s coach, Nick Saban. As Saban further assumes the Christ-like mystique of his walking-on-water predecessor, legendary football coach Paul \u201cBear\u201d Bryant, after Alabama\u2019s ascension to the playoffs for the national title \u2013 and as Tuesday\u2019s electoral crossroads gains scriptural meaning nationwide \u2013 a natural question arises: What would Saban do? A lot more is at stake on Tuesday than getting on the right side of money. After decades of jokes proposing that Alabama \u201cbuild a school the football team could be proud of,\u201d the University of Alabama has finally been getting some extra-gridiron respect, its national cred evident in rising out-of-state enrollment \u2013 more than 60% of entering freshmen. Auburn University, too, caught some luster from alums such as Apple CEO Tim Cook, along with its football team, this season\u2019s Southeastern Conference runner-up. And yet it hardly requires a college degree to see that students, let alone teaching talent, would think twice about moving to a state supplying half the country\u2019s GDP of late-night satire. Such embarrassment has been the historical constant of Alabama\u2019s \u201celites,\u201d and they have borne it with exasperation, silence and paralysis. Thus, I was not surprised when of the 27 Auburn and Alabama system officials I contacted \u2013 a few presidents, along with bankers, industrialists and lawyers on the boards of trustees \u2013 none would weigh in on the Senate race. Ex-Breitbart spokesman leaves GOP over Moore And though the University of Alabama\u2019s general counsel assured me there was no legal or ethical problem with Saban (\u201cor any employee,\u201d he added) speaking out as an individual, the two Alabama trustees who would talk to me (as long as they weren\u2019t named) echoed the Tide radio play-by-play man Eli Gold, who says that Saban \u201cis 1,000% a football coach.\u201d Indeed, Saban (though he is registered to vote in Alabama) is so politics-deaf that on November 9, 2016, he claimed he didn\u2019t even know there had been an election the previous day. On reflection, one trustee said, \u201cBut if he\u2019s really worried about it affecting the program \u2026 ,\u201d then he added wearily, noting President Donald Trump\u2019s popularity in Alabama, \u201cI don\u2019t know what we do. Whatever you say about our candidate, you could say about the guy in the White House.\u201d True, but still no prophylactic against fiscal pain (See: the philanthropists\u2019 flight from Mar-a-Lago). Though advertisers threatened to desert Sean Hannity after his defense of Moore backfired on Fox, the bowl-season brands I consulted were decidedly not interested in discussing a hypothetical Sen. Moore. According to Bill Hancock, executive director of the College Football Playoff, the race \u201cnever came up in the room\u201d during the deliberations that made Alabama the debatable pick over Ohio State for the semifinals. Hancock added with a laugh, \u201cYou can say I said, \u2018Oh my goodness, it never came up!\u2019 \u201d Chick-fil-A, which will host Auburn in the Peach Bowl, declined comment, perhaps mindful of Moore\u2019s resonance with the anti-gay-marriage debacle involving its own founding family. Nor would Dos Equis, a sponsor of the Sugar Bowl (where Alabama will face Clemson), comment on \u201cthe most interesting man\u201d in Alabama \u2013 Moore is a \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d enthusiast. As for the Gecko, Geico did not return my calls. Such corporate tact will come as a relief to Maddox, who is already worried that Moore\u2019s candidacy will scare off the companies he\u2019s wooing to Tuscaloosa, to join the local Mercedes-Benz plant once greeted as Alabama\u2019s own economic miracle. For sponsors to boycott Alabama now \u201cwould do nothing but help Roy Moore,\u201d he says, creating \u201can us versus them, national versus Alabama dynamic \u2013 now it becomes about pride rather than anything else. And pride goeth before a fall.\u201d How low will the GOP go? Maddox is a Democratic candidate for governor in 2018 and one of the state\u2019s classic romantics, who believes adamantly in \u201cour people\u201d and insists that \u201cour leadership has not reflected\u201d them. In this majority-Republican state, he considers it like unto a miracle that the Democratic Senate contender, Doug Jones, a prosecutor of child murderers, is holding his own in the polls against an accused fondler of teenage girls. If Jones loses, no one will be able to blame his \u201chistoric unpopularity,\u201d a private email server or two X chromosomes. His abortion-rights position will undoubtedly be the \u201cright\u201d reason given, but the real reason would more likely be that he\u2019s a Democrat, which has become a cute synonym among some white Alabamians for African-American. (Full disclosure: Jones is a friend of mine, and I would vote for him if I were registered in Alabama.) Among the more crushing regrets of Alabama\u2019s heartbroken liberals is that Bear Bryant didn\u2019t translate his bulletproof popularity into moral authority and move the state to the right side of civil rights history in the 1960s. If the Ghost of Winningest Coaches Past were to visit Saban this season, I suspect he might urge his heir to think bigger than his own crowning legacy, a stadium full of houndstooth apparel, honoring his signature hat. Local sports reporters haven\u2019t broached the legacy thing with this coach, although columnist Joseph Goodman says Saban could \u201cinfluence the race with one sentence. He wouldn\u2019t even have to endorse anyone. He could just ask, \u2018What\u2019s best for the future of Alabama?\u2019\u201d But Goodman, a Birmingham native, points out that Saban is from West Virginia. And \u201cto really care about dysfunction in a state like Alabama when you make $8 million a year,\u201d he told me, \u201cI think you have to be from here.\u201d  Saban, who actually will be paid $11.125 million this season, declined my invitations to discuss leadership and \u201cthe awful responsibility of Time\u201d outside of 60 minutes on Saturday. So, it remains up in the air whether the coach, come Tuesday, will get a senator he can be proud of when he and his team take the field on New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 or if he\u2019ll be left the high priest of a pariah state.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Tim Stanley: Jimmy Carter's defense of Trump makes more sense when you consider the similarities between the two presidents Like Trump, Carter was a political outsider when he ran for office and often deviated from his party's establishment thinking, writes Stanley Jimmy Carter and Donald Trump make an unlikely pair. For Trump and his conservative base, Carter\u2019s presidency was defined by American decline. During the 2016 election, Carter said that Trump\u2019s campaign had \u201ctapped a waiting reservoir\u2026 of racism.\u201d And yet in an interview with The New York Times, Carter now says that Trump has been treated worse by the media than any president before \u2013 and that he would be happy to go to North Korea to help the White House negotiate with Kim Jong Un. What alternate reality is this? I suspect two things are going on here. First, the 93-year-old Carter is thinking about his own legacy. He might have had a miserable record as president, but post-presidency he\u2019s become a force for international peace and development \u2013 and by offering to go to North Korea, he\u2019s informing Trump and the American public of the sterling work done by The Carter Center, an organization he established to improve lives by advancing democracy and resolving conflicts. Don\u2019t forget Carter\u2019s visit to North Korea in 1994 that facilitated a short-lived nuclear deal with the US. But he isn\u2019t just looking for work. Carter is consciously or subconsciously reminding us of his unusual status in American politics. He has more in common with Trump than you might first think \u2013 or at least less in common with the Democratic establishment than might be apparent. Brown disagrees with Carter take on Trump In some regards, Carter was the Trump of the 1976 presidential election. He was a businessman, a peanut farmer and, as a former governor of Georgia, an outsider in a Washington where many dismissed the Deep South as backward and reactionary. Carter\u2019s pitch as president was very, very different to Trump\u2019s: He pledged never to tell a lie and offered a technocratic, moderate brand of liberalism that tried to pull the country together after years of Vietnam and Watergate. Trump\u2019s divide and rule rhetoric, by contrast, has been compared to Richard Nixon\u2019s. Four years in the White House and a post-presidential effort to be as useful as possible recast Carter as some sort of Democratic grandfather figure. In reality, he often departed from the objectives of the American left. Carter rejected the radical national health insurance program favored by liberals like Sen. Ted Kennedy. He wanted to increase the defense budget. He opposed federal financing of abortion and talked openly about his relationship with Jesus. Trump, too, has broken with his party\u2019s orthodoxy, on everything from free trade to the Iraq War. In many regards, Carter is a progressive \u2013 particularly on race \u2013 but for a sense of the cultural fissures between him and the modern Democrats, consider what he said in The New York Times interview. On NFL players who won\u2019t kneel for the National Anthem: \u201cI think they ought to find a different way to object.\u201d On tearing down Confederate statues: \u201cThat\u2019s a hard one for me \u2026 I have never looked upon the carvings on Stone Mountain or the statues as being racist in their intent. But I can understand African-Americans\u2019 aversion to them, and I sympathize.\u201d Carter\u2019s nuanced statements will sound to some like a faint echo from a lost age of American politics, when liberals and conservatives were temperate in their language and didn\u2019t rush to seize the low or high ground of the culture war.  Finally, Carter, has never had much time for ego, be it from Democrats or Republicans. Readers can infer from the interview that he thinks Obama promised more than he delivered, and he says that he voted for Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s Carter\u2019s pride that has long insulated him from hero worshipping whomever happens to be the Democratic leader at that moment. He\u2019s usually only concerned with his own presidency, and the accusation that he either wasn\u2019t a very good president or an insufficiently reforming one probably stings. If Trump is under fire, Carter knows exactly how that feels. He\u2019s spent some of his career taking attacks from similar groups of people: Hollywood, the media, even the Democratic Party. When Carter sought re-election in 1980, he was opposed not only by Ronald Reagan, the eventual winner, but a third-party ticket headed by congressman John B. Anderson, who enjoyed the star-studded backing of, among others, Paul Newman and Lauren Bacall. If Trump is smart, he\u2019ll welcome Carter\u2019s comments and accept any help he offers. When it comes to the North Korean problem, a miracle would sure be welcome.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Douglas Heye is a CNN political commentator and ex-deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Anti-establishment candidate Roy Moore wins Alabama's US Senate runoff to face Democrat Douglas Heye: His victory shows personality beats policy, and that should worry the GOP Whether in Washington, Alabama or the 2016 primaries, the force of personality has come to outweigh the demand for specific solutions to our nation\u2019s challenges. Volume \u2013 and anger \u2013 turned up high are what tend to get rewarded. For Republicans hoping to build a long-term GOP majority, that should be troubling. Democrats, however, are relishing the victory of Roy Moore \u2013 the insurgent who won Alabama\u2019s US Senate runoff Tuesday night. Democrats knew the nomination of a candidate such as Moore, who trails controversy and was backed by Stephen Bannon, Sarah Palin and others, can help them define Republicans nationally and on December 12 potentially pick up a Senate seat in Alabama they otherwise would have considered a lost cause. Moore is a former Alabama Supreme Court justice whose controversial statements about President Barack Obama, gays and so on could help put Republican candidates on the defensive the same way that Todd Akin of Missouri and Richard Mourdock of Indiana did in their respective, failed 2012 Senate campaigns. (They had made highly controversial comments about rape, abortion and pregnancy.) Votes being counted in Alabama Senate race between Roy Moore and Luther Strange And to be sure, Moore\u2019s vanquished opponent, the Trump-backed Luther Strange, came into the race with his own flaws. He was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions by the very (now former) governor he was investigating as Alabama attorney general, Robert Bentley. In Alabama, they didn\u2019t love Bentley; his popularity was near the bottom nationally and Strange\u2019s support from Washington Republicans made him the perfect candidate to be picked off by an anti-establishment figure such as Moore. Indeed, Moore\u2019s victory was widely predicted despite some closing in the polls in the final week of the campaign. His arrival at the polling place Tuesday morning, astride a galloping horse, could be seen as a pre-victory dance. Based on the rhetoric we saw in the closing days of the runoff, Alabama Republicans, regardless of whom they supported, were prepared to vote \u201cno\u201d on Washington. Campaign support for Moore\u2019s candidacy from Bannon, Palin and even British \u201cBrexit\u201d champion Nigel Farage indicates that the growing GOP divide is less about policy than it is about personality. It also demonstrates how taking \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is my friend\u201d either too far or just far enough threatens to tear the Republican Party further apart at a time when it\u2019s struggling to advance any kind of meaningful agenda. Moore\u2019s campaign was more about sticking it to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the \u201cestablishment\u201d than anything the candidate might do for his home state.  (This predicament might have been avoided had Bentley taken McConnell\u2019s reported advice to appoint a woman to the seat.  The selection of then-Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey \u2013 now Alabama\u2019s governor \u2013  or hard-working US Rep. Martha Roby might have avoided a full-on civil war.) What\u2019s more, Bannon\u2019s vociferous support of Moore over the Trump-backed candidate may further show that the former White House chief strategist indeed views Donald Trump as a vessel for his priorities more than anything else. To be sure, for all of the President\u2019s campaigning for Strange (a mixed-blessing, as it turned out) and for all the hand-wringing and money spent in Alabama\u2019s Senate special election, the division and undercutting actually rather closely resemble the state of today\u2019s Republican Party.",

He has worked closely with the Senate sponsors on the drafting of the Graham-Cassidy legislation. The views expressed here are solely his. Rick Santorum: Senator Rand Paul's opposition to the Graham-Cassidy bill could potentially kill the bill If that happens, Senator Paul would go from Obamacare's most principled foe to its most beloved savior, writes Santorum On Monday, Senator Rand Paul said the Graham-Cassidy bill will not repeal Obamacare. This is the same faulty argument I heard from a few self-proclaimed principled conservatives in 1996 when we successfully challenged President Bill Clinton to keep his promise to end welfare as we know it. They said we promised in the election to end welfare \u2013 not, as Senator Paul now puts it, to \u201crearrange the furniture a bit.\u201d But Welfare Reform of 1996, like Graham-Cassidy, eliminated an uncapped entitlement, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, that was spiraling out of control and block-granted the money to the states with a cap on future spending. Also, like Graham-Cassidy, it gave states more \u2013 but not complete \u2013 flexibility in designing their programs. That approach passed the Senate with 74 votes. There was one Republican holdout, Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, who, along with a small contingent of libertarian organizations, complained that this was not ending welfare but simply rearranging the furniture. They complained there weren\u2019t enough tax and spending cuts and still too many federal strings attached. According to a Heritage Foundation report, however, within three years of passage, welfare caseloads were reduced by over 50% nationwide. Poverty rates among some of the poorest demographics hit all-time lows, and employment among the chronically unemployed hit all-time highs. The program has worked so well the block grant for welfare has not been increased for 20 years, saving hundreds of billions of dollars. In 1996, welfare, as we knew it, ended. In today\u2019s language, it was repealed and replaced. Was every element of the old welfare system changed? No. Was all welfare spending repealed? No. In fact, according to the Urban Institute, unlike Graham-Cassidy, in the first few years after welfare reform was passed, states received more federal funds than they did prior to 1996. GOP senators unveil alternative health plan Ending welfare as we know it was about ending a broken system and replacing it with a conservative approach that would save money and help low-income Americans enter the workforce. It was not about what the definition of \u201cend\u201d was. Some offered amendments to completely end any federal income support for low-income Americans. Those amendments, like Rand Paul\u2019s repeal only amendment, failed miserably. Does Graham-Cassidy end or repeal Obamacare? Let\u2019s look at what Obamacare is, and you can decide. Obamacare is a federal law that requires every American to have and most businesses in America to provide health insurance. The penalty for noncompliance is a tax. The health insurance must be offered on a state or federally run exchange. Those insurance products must be approved by the federal government and must include coverage for abortions. In order to help lower-income people buy these government mandated plans, Obamacare provides tax credits and payments to insurance companies to offset these increasingly expensive plans. Obamacare also expanded the federal health program for low-income Americans \u2013 Medicaid. If a state agreed to all of the requirements under Obamacare, it received money to pay for initially 100% of the cost, now 90% of the cost of the program. Thirty-one states and Washington DC have expanded their Medicaid programs. Everything I have described is repealed under Graham-Cassidy. Everything. No more health insurance mandates. No tax subsidies or payments to insurance companies. No Medicaid expansion. No abortion being paid for by public funds. Now each state will have resources in a block grant, divided equally across all states, to design a health plan that fits the needs of its people.  Does it repeal all of the taxes? No, \u201cjust\u201d $250 billion, including the anti-innovation medical device tax. Does it repeal all the spending to help Americans purchase insurance? No, \u201cjust\u201d $385 billion ($250 billion in tax cuts and $135 in direct spending cuts) over the next ten years. Unlike welfare reform, Graham-Cassidy will likely pass or fail by one vote. The symbolic protest that the bill doesn\u2019t eliminate every aspect of the old system was harmless in 1996. That protest for \u201cperfection\u201d by Senator Paul could be fatal for the last chance to repeal and replace Obamacare. If that happens, Senator Paul would go from Obamacare\u2019s most principled foe to its most beloved savior.",

He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Scott Jennings: Trump is making the right choices for the federal judiciary after the Obama-era made it too left-leaning Democrats' criticism of the President's conservative court nominees shows that they are out of touch with citizens who take their faith seriously, he writes Sitting atop the Frazier History Museum in downtown Louisville on Monday morning was the who\u2019s who of Kentucky\u2019s legal community, all gathered to witness the investiture of John Kenneth Bush, President Donald Trump\u2019s latest appointee to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Overlooking the banks of the Ohio River, 6h Circuit Chief Judge R. Guy Cole, Jr. pointed out that the limited number of cases taken by the Supreme Court each year makes appointments to the circuit court \u2013 the level just below the high court \u2013 among the most important any president makes. On that score, President Trump has hit home run after home run by appointing conservative lawyers to the various circuit court vacancies. In Bush, he found a highly qualified, Harvard-educated lawyer dedicated to the US Constitution and the nation\u2019s founding principles (he even named his dogs after Founding Fathers). During his confirmation, liberals expressed outraged that Bush had once written that America\u2019s two \u201cgreatest tragedies\u201d were \u201cslavery and abortion.\u201d Imagine that \u2013 a pro-life, Republican president nominated a pro-life judge. A few weeks before Bush was nominated, the 6th Circuit received from Trump another Kentuckian, Amul Thapar, previously appointed federal district judge by President George W. Bush. My advice: take Thapar in the first round of your fantasy future Supreme Court Justice draft. You won\u2019t regret it. Thapar is a rock solid conservative judge whose name is on the lips of every Federalist Society member in Washington. He\u2019s close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and well-thought of by key White House lawyers. Trump nominates 16 judges as Democrats look ahead to Supreme Court fight Trump is driving liberals nuts with his circuit court nominations. Notre Dame law professor Amy Barrett, nominated by Trump for the 7th Circuit, was pilloried in a committee hearing by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein for being \u2013 gasp \u2013 a Catholic. Feinstein has come under criticism (including from the presidents of both Notre Dame and Princeton) since she had a melt down over Barrett\u2019s faith, further exposing just how out-of-touch today\u2019s Democratic Party is with Americans who still take their faith seriously. I suspect Feinstein was just as worried about Barrett\u2019s age and resume as she was her Catholicism. Barrett is in her mid 40s and counts a clerkship with the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia among her past jobs. She\u2019s a strong conservative who will fill an important seat for a very long time. The same can be said of Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, who Trump nominated to yet another vacancy in the 6th Circuit. Young, Scalia-trained additions to the federal bench have Democrats pulling their hair out. President Trump has made 14 nominations for current or future circuit court vacancies, with three already confirmed (Kevin Newsom of Alabama, another strong conservative, was confirmed last month). Trump is outpacing President Barack Obama in circuit court confirmations and overall judicial nominations at this point in their presidencies. Sources in the White House tell me to expect more waves of conservative judicial nominations this fall.  While Trump faces trials and tribulations on other policy matters, he\u2019s absolutely nailing his judicial appointments. Obama appointed about 40% of the federal judiciary by the time he left office, while Bush 43 appointed just over one-third of it. Obama\u2019s appointees were, in many cases, extremely liberal, ideologically driven people who dragged their circuits drastically to the left. Presidents have enormous impact on the judiciary, especially if their party controls the Senate for some part of their term. If President Trump\u2019s first year in office is any indication, conservatives should be very happy with this reshaping of the federal bench, particularly at the appellate level. Undoing the damage done to the appellate courts by Obama is a key reason why Trump must do everything he can to maintain Republican control of the US Senate in the 2018 midterm election. If Feinstein\u2019s reaction to Barrett is any indication, Democrats would love nothing more than to shut down the Trump Train\u2019s drop-offs at the federal courthouse.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Jill Filipovic: Democratic party may be open to backing anti-abortion candidates who can help them win back Congress She says this is an option that should not even be on the table, is an insult to women and a losing strategy The chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, said in an interview this week that his party intended to support candidates who can win, regardless of their position on abortion rights. There will be no abortion \u201clitmus test\u201d in the Democrats\u2019 drive to win back the House, he said.  His comments echoed earlier ones from Nancy Pelosi, Charles Schumer and Bernie Sanders. That\u2019s not just an insult to the women (and men) who make up the Democrats\u2019 base. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. Much of the left has learned all the wrong lessons from Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat. They could focus on increasing turnout among their base \u2013 women and African-Americans \u2013 but Democrats have instead taken a rhetorical page from both Donald Trump\u2019s sexism and Bernie Sanders\u2019s populism by trying to appeal to disaffected white guys. This pivot to the right on women\u2019s health is particularly insidious, reflecting an anti-feminist backlash across the political spectrum. Democrats may say they are trying to field the most competitive team of candidates they can to win a majority in Congress, and in some districts that candidate might be anti-abortion.  But this treads a dangerous path: ceding to demands that the entire political system cater to the perceived values of a group that largely stopped voting for Democrats in the 1960s, when the party pushed the Civil Rights Act and equal rights for women. The public embrace of anti-choice candidates is just one plank of this party overhaul. The new Democratic platform emphasizes building infrastructure, lowering prescription drug costs and creating jobs. What I would tell Gorsuch about my abortion These are all valuable goals, but making them the entire focus of the media blitz at the expense of policies aimed at serving women and people of color seems to be a naked appeal to the white working class, who some political observers have decided voted for Trump out of economic anxiety. This narrative is belied by the social science, which showed bigotry had much more of an influence on Trump supporters than personal finances. It\u2019s not just \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d the party is trying to transform into votes. Funding candidates who oppose legal abortion contradicts any claim that Democrats are the party of the masses, let alone the ignored and underserved. Women are more than half the population, and one in three of us will have an abortion in her lifetime, according to a 2011 study from the Guttmacher Institute. Nearly every American will have a friend, lover, colleague, girlfriend, sister, boss, wife or mother who has had an abortion, even if they never know it. Women of faith and their abortions Feminists focus on reproductive rights for good reason: a woman\u2019s ability to decide for herself when and if to have children shapes much of the rest of her life \u2013 whether she completes her education, whether she marries for love, whether she parents when she feels adept and ready, whether she fulfills her professional potential, and whether she\u2019s able to follow her own personal path wherever it leads. Supporting laws that give the state the power to compel women to continue pregnancies is misogynist and illiberal. Expecting Democratic politicians to stake out clear ground on abortion rights is not a \u201cpurity test\u201d or a difference in opinion on policy or efficacy, like divergent views on the best ways to reduce inequality or suggesting we should repair the ACA before promoting a single-payer system. It\u2019s a basic question of human rights: Are women sovereign citizens in our own bodies? If your answer is no, the Democratic Party shouldn\u2019t fund your campaign. It\u2019s disturbing to see the United States\u2019 ostensibly progressive party so quickly abandon both its own most loyal voters and progressive ideals, all in a frenzied grab for the same Trump supporters who have dominated sympathetic media coverage of the election. It\u2019s also a losing strategy. Most Democrats are pro-choice (about the same proportion of Republicans who are pro-life), and fewer than one in five Americans says they only support candidates who agree with them on abortion rights. One imagines those one in five are probably the most strongly pro-choice or pro-life, and that the strongest pro-life belief \u2013 that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, even rape, incest, or life of the pregnant woman \u2013 probably correlates with many other religious and conservative beliefs as well.  It seems unlikely that abortion alone is the one issue alienating many voters from the Democratic Party. What is obvious, though, is that abortion rights are an animating issue for the Democratic Party base, and support for abortion rights gets a whole lot of women marching, donating money, and volunteering for Democrats. The party has a lot to lose by alienating them in a dodgy gamble to scoop up Trump voters, where a \u201cwin\u201d apparently means building the ranks of the party by adding more people who are hostile to women\u2019s rights. Clearly, we have enough of those guys already.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Drew Westen is professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University and founder of Westen Strategies, a strategic messaging firm. His is the author of \u201cThe Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.\u201d He has been a consultant or adviser to many candidates and organizations, including the House and Senate Democratic Caucuses, and he informally advised the Barack Obama campaign in 2008. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Drew Westen: To get ready for the 2018 elections, Democrats need to learn from their loss in Georgia The Democratic Party needs likable candidates who can convey a message voters will understand and endorse, writes Westen The ongoing debate about what went wrong for Democrats last week, when they lost a winnable race in Georgia\u2019s 6th congressional district, is about far more than finger-pointing within the party. It\u2019s about whether the Democrats can learn from their mistakes before the coming battle for control of Congress.  You can\u2019t fix a problem if you don\u2019t get the diagnosis right. I had a front row seat to the election, and Ossoff\u2019s campaign. I live in Georgia\u2019s 5th, right next door, and I know my neighbors a few miles away well. We share the same media market, so I saw the same ads \u2013 hundreds of times \u2013 as they did. Ossoff didn\u2019t lose because this was a referendum on Donald Trump, the Democratic Party, or Nancy Pelosi. Neither candidate mentioned Trump, Ossoff never mentioned that he was a Democrat, and the low-quality ads placing cardboard figures of Pelosi next to real pictures of Osoff looked like those mild amusements at carnivals or festivals where you stick your face through a hole next to Abraham Lincoln. Ossoff lost because that was one of the worst campaigns I\u2019ve ever seen. I suspect his campaign team didn\u2019t know him very well, and if they did, it sure didn\u2019t show. The goal seemed to be to find something vaguely Republican for him to say, and to keep his head down. If the other three special elections looked anything like it, it\u2019s no wonder the Democrats lost them all. Georgia 6th loss isn't the death knell for Democrats The good news is that Democrats now have a case study for 2018 on how to lose an election with virtually unlimited funds, in the most expensive race in Congressional history. The bad news is that they didn\u2019t get the message from 2016: that if you don\u2019t have a likable candidate who connects with people, with a message that jumps out at you, you\u2019re going to lose. My hat goes off, and my heart goes out, to Jon Ossoff, for his dedication over many months, and for making it as close as he did. He took one for the team, but shouldn\u2019t have had to. He should be in Congress. That the campaign did nothing to create a connection between the candidate and the voters, and had no clear message, is difficult to believe. This is campaign messaging 101. You start by introducing the candidate as a person, weaving together his life history and values with those of the people he wants to serve, so that it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s the right person, with the right values, for the times. You have a pithy version of that core narrative, written in the language of the kitchen table, so people will talk about it, and which is memorable, so that it sticks. Why an unpopular Trump and his party can still win You don\u2019t allow your opponent to attack or brand you without an answer unless her message is so inappropriate that it speaks for itself. You do your best to brand her, preferably before she can brand herself. You pre-empt attacks or concerns you know voters will have about you, like why they should vote for someone who\u2019s only 30. You don\u2019t have to be nasty, but you do have to make voters concerned about voting for your opponent. You do not run on an issue or issues. Voters should be able to assume your positions on issues from your values. But you should have a signature issue or two, and voters should know why those issues or the broader values they reflect are so important to you, preferably by telling the story of why that is. Did you have a parent or grandparent you really admired, who taught you some lesson you\u2019ve never forgotten? Did you see people suffering in some way and decide you were going to do something about it? When you boil it down, 50 years of research suggests the same thing I\u2019ve learned through 10 years of talking with, and testing out in large national samples, what matters to ordinary Americans, and what makes a message or candidate compelling. All voters are really looking for are the answers to two questions: do you understand and care about people like me, and do you share my values? It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a \u201clow-information voter\u201d or someone who follows the news closely. The only difference is that those of us who are more engaged can invent better rationalizations for why we do or don\u2019t believe that if we\u2019re going to burn up a planet, we ought to pick one we don\u2019t live on. Jon Ossoff concedes Georgia race So what was wrong with Ossoff\u2019s campaign? Having watched so many ads for so many months, I should know who Jon Ossoff is \u2013 not from Karen Handel\u2019s amateurish attack ads, but from him. I should know his biography. I should know how his values emerged from that biography, and how that shaped what he wants to do in Congress. And if I\u2019m a Republican, or lean that way, I should know why I should even consider voting for a Democrat. But after all those months and all those ads, I couldn\u2019t answer a single one of those questions. I didn\u2019t have a clue who he is or where he came from. I have no idea what he\u2019s done with his life and career so far, and what he believes in and why. I don\u2019t even know why he was running for Congress. To my knowledge, he never offered that story, either from the start to pre-empt being branded, or after the campaign was in full swing \u2013 and certainly, with a campaign with as much money as his, he could have done it with a 60-second spot. It wasn\u2019t until a couple days after the race was over that I even learned, after asking several people who didn\u2019t know either, that he actually grew up in Atlanta. Ossoff's liberalism just wasn't right for Georgia district I certainly saw nothing in any ads, from him or his opponent, that would make me dislike him. But it might have been nice to have reason to like him. He had no narrative, no message, and no connection to me, and if he didn\u2019t to me, I doubt his ads created much of a connection to anyone else who didn\u2019t go to one of his events. They were impersonal. They were abstract. The one ad he ran that was effective was an attack ad, with a doctor, presumably an oncologist, talking about how Karen Handel had led an effort at a foundation to cut off funds for breast cancer screenings because of her position on abortion, and revealing that the doctor, herself, was a survivor. That was powerful. But the campaign\u2019s goal seemed to be just to fly under the radar and hope voters wouldn\u2019t notice the \u201cD\u201d by Ossoff\u2019s name. Its primary theme was standard Republican fare, cutting government waste \u2013 \u201cbecause it\u2019s your tax dollars.\u201d Like so many Democratic candidates who wind up in the political graveyard in red or swing districts, Ossoff ran the typical \u201cI\u2019m almost as good as a Republican\u201d campaign, choosing a core Republican value and being the second-best of two candidates at it. If government waste is your biggest concern, you want a member of Congress who\u2019ll caucus with the Republicans, because if you have a mole you want removed, and your dermatologist pulls out a jackhammer, you can be pretty sure he\u2019ll get it. That\u2019s how Republicans tend to cut waste. I saw his ads about cutting waste. Yeah, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be just as successful as all the other waste cutters in Washington. It isn\u2019t believable, and it isn\u2019t among the first two or three dozen things that were on voters\u2019 minds last Tuesday. Probably the most important thing that was on the minds of many in Georgia\u2019s 6th and in districts around the country, especially if they\u2019re small business owners, their employees, or anyone whose company doesn\u2019t offer health insurance, is that they finally have some security for the first time, and they don\u2019t want to lose it. As my grandmother's world darkens, Medicaid helps preserve her dignity So why not run as a Democrat, who cares about a little girl named say, Emma, a six-year-old child whose leukemia is finally in remission, but whose life is on the line if Republicans, by design or by accident, cut the lifeline that saved her life in the first place? Why not show with your words, your intonation, and your actions \u2013 by visiting kids like Emma in what is identifiably Northside Hospital, and naming the hospital by name, because it\u2019s one of the best hospitals in the state, with affiliated doctors all over the district, and it conveys that you know that district and care about the people in it. And why not make clear that you understand what your opponent doesn\u2019t: that this is not about abstractions. This is not about a name, either, \u201cObamacare\u201d vs. \u201cTrumpcare.\u201d This is about Emma. This is about common sense, that health care is too important to too many people to eliminate what we have in one fell swoop, on one day, and replace it immediately with something new and untested. If you want to scrap the existing law rather than fix its major problems, then test your new plan out first in a couple of states for a couple years and see if it works. Emphasize the business model: you pilot test a new product and see if it works before you take it to market.  Now you\u2019re beginning to create a new idea in that district \u2013 the idea of a sensible Democrat, someone who cares about making sure everyone is covered, and that premiums are affordable, while keeping an eye on the cost to taxpayers. Now that\u2019s a good reason to vote for the guy with the \u201cD\u201d by his name if you\u2019re a Republican in Georgia\u2019s 6th. He cares about people like Emma, and about her mom and dad, who were desperate before and are growing desperate again. He shares your values of making sure we don\u2019t forget the \u201clife\u201d part of \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d and of protecting our children and seeing the next generation thrive. And he is already demonstrating that he\u2019s interested in solving problems using common sense and evidence. At least until the Democratic Party rebuilds a brand for itself, that\u2019s how you begin to rebrand it, district by district.",

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Krystal Ball: Democrats lack a positive agenda, and it's costing them elections They need to reconsider their approach to the economic big picture, Ball writes Democrats have lost two more special elections. More writers have posted hot takes reiterating the lesson Democrats should have burned into our minds after the 2016 election debacle: resisting Donald Trump is not enough. If Democrats want to win, they need to articulate a positive agenda. This is a problem because right now, the Democratic Party doesn\u2019t have one. Here\u2019s the bottom line. The Democrats must stand for more than abortion rights, the minimum wage, and trash talking. But those calls for a new vision are always curiously vague, demanding a vision but not suggesting one. But people desperately want a vision with substance and they rightly sense that big changes are needed to make that happen \u2014 it\u2019s why the calls to replace Nancy Pelosi as minority leader are growing ever louder. Democrats have been unable to express a bold, coherent economic vision \u2014 because they are afraid of the truth. The truth is that the only real solutions to address the economic changes which have swept our nation are too radical for them to even suggest, let alone seriously back \u2013 namely, universal basic income, or as some call it, Social Security for all. While still too scary for Democratic politicians, Social Security for all has found support among a diverse and controversial array of thinkers \u2013 former Service Employees International Union President Andy Stern, controversial conservative author Charles Murray, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Nixon (yes, really!). The basic idea is simple: eliminate most other safety net programs and replace them with a one-size-fits-all cash handout which would be sufficient to provide a dignified, frugal life. In my book \u201cReversing the Apocalypse,\u201d I advocate for a funding mechanism that would be tied to the amount of job-killing automation in the economy. The more robots replace workers, the more companies making use of those robots pay into the Social Security for all pot, and the richer the benefits paid out. We have two economies right now. One for the creative-class professionals and one for the people who labor in various states of exploitation to make sure those lucky folks can have sushi and SoulCycle classes when, where and how they want them. Democratic lawmaker: Pelosi is worse than Trump in some areas of the country The economic transformation underway is the central issue of our time. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, three of the most common jobs are cashier, sales clerk and fast-food worker. On average, none of these jobs pays enough to support a family, or is likely to provide benefits, or in some cases even inform you what your schedule might be far enough in advance for you to get a babysitter. Adding insult to injury, all of these most common jobs, and many more, are threatened by automation. Research and data show that a large portion of our jobs have been or are in danger of being automated out of existence or seriously scaled back. Raising the minimum wage would help make low-wage service jobs more survivable in the short term, and that would be no small victory. But raising the minimum wage won\u2019t change the structural fact that we have an economy which does not have nearly enough decent jobs for the number of people who need them. And $15 per hour doesn\u2019t help you much if a robot takes your job. With the rise and expansion of Amazon and the recent series of retail layoffs, the situation facing many American workers is a bleak one. It\u2019s a sweeping solution to the problem, but Social Security for all is what we need. It\u2019s better than the big infrastructure push Democrats are so keen on. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s plenty of work to be done in the country now, so infrastructure is a good short-term fix for creating work for people. At some point, though, all the bridges are built, broadband lines laid and airports modernized. What then? Social Security for all is also better than another popular option with Democrats, which is to pray that some magic fairy dust will create a new industry with great middle-class jobs. Proponents of this idea will tell you a story about how technology caused displacements in the past, but these displacements were all just temporary pain as workers reskilled for a new industry. Unfortunately, there is little indication that such a new industry exists now or is just on the cusp of being born. Dem rep on Pelosi: 'It's time for people to know when to go' The best solution to our economic quagmire \u2013 and the problem of the Democrats\u2019 lack of agenda \u2013 is the one that has Dems so nervous they\u2019d apparently rather keep losing to a Republican Party that for many has all the appeal of chicken pox. But to have a chance at winning or making a difference, Democrats need to swallow the fear, skip the government make-work middleman, and just hand out cash to every single American citizen. Social Security for all would allow American workers to pursue business ideas without fear of poverty. They could experiment with small-scale enterprises that may or may not be fundamentally economical without a subsidy. They could make the choice to stay home full-time with their kids or elderly parents. Other policies flow from the core idea of Social Security for all. For example, in order for citizens to actually be able to live a dignified life without work, single-payer health care is a must. Also, once we\u2019ve actually provided a mechanism for a basic living for every American citizen, we could aggressively incentivize and encourage innovation. Once our people were secure, we could truly embrace a global economy without reservations. And as Bill Gates has pointed out, one way to help pay for these changes would be to institute a robot tax, or taxing the income generated by automated labor the way the government now taxes human labor.  Many Democrats have judged Social Security for all to be an idea too terrifying to take seriously. But the values behind it are actually a return to the historic ideals of the Democratic Party. In FDR\u2019s famous Four Freedoms Speech, he called for a universal freedom from want. This freedom from want was not dependent on your SAT score or the number of hours you spent in a mind-numbing job search or passing a drug test. Freedom from want wasn\u2019t reserved for those who lucked into prosperous families or lucked into a genetic predisposition toward the type of symbolic manipulation and verbal precocity that happen to be highly prized in our modern economy. In FDR\u2019s conception, freedom from want was your due just because you were a human being who showed up on this planet. We used to believe in that. If you\u2019ll recall, FDR won re-election three times on those old radical ideas. Perhaps its time for the Democratic party to stop running scared and embrace the policy that they know deep down is right.",

She also was a consultant for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Follow her: @jrpsaki. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Jen Psaki: Sunday marks 100 days since Women's March, the milestone worth noting Psaki: Women see threat to reproductive rights, equal pay and advancement While the world is focusing this weekend on the end of the first 100 days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, there\u2019s a more vital milestone to mark: This Sunday marks 100 days since the Women\u2019s March. And as we explore that big question of how not just to re-energize the Democratic Party but how to expand our base, we have an answer \u2013 it has been provided by the earliest days of the Trump administration: Look to American women to lead the charge. The organizers of the Women\u2019s March deserve credit for tapping into something \u2013 a nervous energy, a need to do something, feelings of guilt among some who didn\u2019t vote, didn\u2019t donate, didn\u2019t volunteer. But now we are moving forward, and it is the women who have become citizen activists since the election who deserve credit. They have been the backbone of the resistance. And that should scare the heck out of the Trump team. Women's marches around the world So far this year, Emily\u2019s List, an organization that supports Democratic women candidates who support abortion, says it has heard from 11,000 female candidates expressing interest in running for office in 2018. Last year, it heard from 900 such women. Women have organized postcard writing campaigns against nominations, such that of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and sent countless letters to the editor after the reinstatement \u2013 and expansion of \u2013 the global gag rule, which restricts aid to women\u2019s and men\u2019s health organizations around the world. Women showed up at town hall meetings to question their members of Congress, including Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada, and, recently Sen. Jeff Flake in Arizona, about plans to \u201cdefund\u201d Planned Parenthood \u2013 a move that would leave women across the country with nowhere to turn for essential reproductive health care. They expressed outrage when Vice President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote to allow the Republican Senate to undermine access to birth control through the Title X family planning program. This move would let states cut off funding to any organization that provides abortion services, even though federal money has not covered abortion services for more than 40 years. Trump signs anti-Planned Parenthood law While the prospect of electing the first female president didn\u2019t get enough women to vote the way many of us anticipated, the systematic effort by the Trump team to roll back protections for women\u2019s health, for equality in the workplace and for women\u2019s economic empowerment has done the trick. Unfortunately, many politicians still fail to recognize how issues such as access to birth control, the right to choose to have an abortion and equal pay connect to economic prosperity for women. They are often treated like topics that should be discussed in a once-a-year holiday dedicated to women. The truth is we are not going to have more women in the boardroom, more women running for office and more women running national organizations if we make it harder for women to choose what medical care they receive and when they have children. Women know this very well. And they recognize that even as this administration gives lip service to things such as \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment\u201d and paid family leave, it is undercutting the very things that ensure women can lead safe, healthy and successful lives. Pence vows to stop funding abortion providers You cannot say you are fighting for women\u2019s economic empowerment, but then oppose a woman\u2019s ability to choose when or whether she has children. You cannot say you are fighting for women to participate fully in the economy and then not fight for access to affordable birth control, child care or paid family leave. A true fight for economic empowerment would not leave women behind. And this is not just about a Republican in the White House. The Democratic Party has some work to do as well. We have a big tent, as we should. That is key to how we will win again one day. But talking about the need for women to have access to birth control shouldn\u2019t be controversial within that tent. Almost 75% of American women support retaining Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funding for it, and that includes a whole lot of independents and Republicans, according to a Kaiser health tracking poll released last month. They also support women being able to use Medicaid to get a pap smear at a local health clinic or a Planned Parenthood clinic, and ensuring that organizations dependent on Title X are able to stay open. These things should all be core to who we are as a party. Ivanka Trump tweets support for equal pay The Democratic Party must not treat women\u2019s health and economic empowerment as an afterthought \u2013 but instead put them at the forefront.  It hasn\u2019t always been smooth for party leaders to talk about birth control and access to preventative health care. But women across the country sure have to face these issues every day. So let\u2019s not paper over them. Let\u2019s say pap smear out loud and talk about birth control on the stump. Believe me, the majority of people in the audience, women and men, will be quietly nodding their heads. Let\u2019s understand that women are now the majority of college students, and they\u2019re earning more than half of masters and doctoral degrees. That nearly half of breadwinners in this country are women. That these women need equal pay, paid family leave, affordable child care, good schools and safety for their kids \u2013 and they need to be able to decide when and whether to grow their families. And Democrats need to be the party that stands for them. We need to stand up for the 1 in 5 women who turn to Planned Parenthood for health care. We need to stand up for the overwhelming majority of women who have used birth control. Those women are already standing up for the ideals they believe in \u2013 and for their families and the people they love. They need a party that has their backs. To turn the tide in 2018 and beyond, Democrats don\u2019t need to run from reproductive rights \u2013 they just need to show voters what\u2019s at stake in Trump\u2019s America. That\u2019s what American women are doing right now, and in record numbers.",

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Alice Stewart: Idea that the base will abandon Trump for changing his stances is simplistic Parts of the base are very happy with him and others are taking a wait-and-see attitude A series of policy reversals by President Donald Trump has supporters and critics alike asking the question: Is the candidate who vowed to drain the swamp getting swamped in Washington?  Those on the left say he\u2019s abandoning his base and that in turn, they will abandon him. In other words: it\u2019s about to get real for the reality star turned president. But not so fast. Before you write off the base, you have to understand who the base is. Trump got the most primary votes of any Republican in history. He did that by expanding the GOP establishment vote to solidify support from three key groups: social conservatives, the \u201calt-right,\u201d and the Rust Belt coalition. All of which are responding to the recent course corrections by the president. In a little over a week, Trump reversed on several key policy positions: he ordered missile strikes in Syria after opposing military action there for many years, he dropped his view that NATO is obsolete, he walked back the claim that China is a currency manipulator and indicated he is no longer certain he will replace Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen when her term expires next year. Keep in mind, if voters thought that Trump\u2019s tendency to change his positions was an unforgivable sin, he never would have won the GOP nomination and never would have been elected president. Democrats are being hypocritical about Trump's war powers First, social conservatives have felt burned by the GOP over the past decade. They did not get their candidate of choice in 2008 or 2012, but the party relied on them to man phone banks, knock on doors and get out the vote in the general election. While Trump was not the first choice for many of them, they quickly came to see him as a willing advocate. The Trump transition team brought them into the conversation and truly listened to them. In 2016, social conservatives no longer felt like a GOP afterthought. Social conservatives wanted a Scalia-like Supreme Court justice and they got it with the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch. For many, this was the single biggest factor in their support of the president. These pro-life conservatives also wanted Trump to honor the anti-abortion message he campaigned on, which he did last week with the signing of an order allowing states to withhold federal money from abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood. Victory on these issues was like eating dessert before dinner for them; they got the sweet stuff they wanted and they didn\u2019t have to wait. They are not troubled by recent head fakes by the President \u2013 they are playing long ball. Secondly, the \u201calt-right\u201d movement, viewed as anti-intervention and anti-multiculturalism, embraced candidate Trump\u2019s populist isolationism message. The movement had lived largely online, but came out to campaign events and voting booths for Trump. Many ardent supporters are now vocal opponents of Trump\u2019s decision to order the missile strike against Syria. Some question whether he should have the nuclear codes if he\u2019s making military decisions based on emotions. These people want a lot more, a lot faster from the administration. Trump demonstrated the Art of the Show with Xi Alt-right leaders are also up in arms over Trump\u2019s chief strategist Steve Bannon losing his seat at the National Security table and rumors of Bannon\u2019s departure due to infighting with the President\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. It\u2019s not the end of the world if Bannon is shown the door, but it would be problematic with this portion of the Trump base. The third facet of Trump\u2019s support is the Rust Belt coalition that voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but switched to Trump in 2016 because they saw him as the working man\u2019s champion. The Rust Belt\u2019s revenge turned blue states to red for Trump. Working-class voters in the nation\u2019s heartland supported the President\u2019s trade and economic message. These are not hard-core issue conservatives, but they like knowing their president is going to stick it to China and roll back burdensome federal regulations that stifle the economy.  Trump must not forget his power base is the American worker. If he delivers on the economy, the Rust Belt coalition is not going anywhere. Bannon's departure would rip the mask off the 'blue-collar Trump' The West Wing reversals are clearly ruffling some feathers in the base. Asked about the President\u2019s shifting positions, White House press secretary Sean Spicer says it\u2019s the various circumstances, not Trump, that have changed. He even made the dubious claim that \u201csome cases or issues, are evolving towards the President\u2019s position.\u201d Draining the swamp is an easy campaign slogan, but  Trump is learning that successful governing is much more difficult than winning campaigns.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Rachel Sklar is a New York-based writer and co-founder of Change the Ratio, which aims to increase visibility and opportunity for women in tech and new media, and TheLi.st, a network and media platform for women. She is a former lawyer. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Rachel Sklar: Democrats were right to fight Gorsuch, because \"not crazy\" should not be the new definition for \"normal\" When Nunes is a faded historical footnote, Gorsuch will still be on the Supreme Court determining the law of the land, she writes The past 11 weeks of the Trump administration have looked anything but normal, except for one thing: the nomination of judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. That announcement was rolled out with the traditional pomp by a President who followed the script, and a silver-haired nominee who spoke well and looked the part (insofar as such parts have always been cast with silver-haired white men). A few weeks later, while the craziness surrounding the Trump administration swirled to new heights, (two words: Devin Nunes) the confirmation hearings went forward mostly as such hearings do, with Senators asking probing questions to which the nominee offered practiced, neutral responses. Despite some damaging moments (two more words: frozen trucker), the consensus was that Gorsuch had performed well, would be confirmed, and would notch up a rare win for Trump. Now, all of this is in the rearview mirror. Neil Gorsuch has been sworn in as a Supreme Court Justice, and at 49, will likely serve many years of this lifetime appointment, likely outlasting most if not all of the current members. Meanwhile, the numbers suggest Trump will have more vacancies to fill in his term. That\u2019s just how things work in the normal course of things. But that\u2019s all that\u2019s been normal about any of this. And when things are not normal, you cannot behave as though they are. That is why Senate Democrats were right to filibuster the nomination and reject it \u2013 by 44 votes, which meant that Gorsuch failed to meet the 60-vote threshold to win the nomination. That threshold no longer exists. Senator Mitch McConnell, predictably, led a GOP vote to change it to a simple majority confirming their nominee to the court. The whole thing seemed inevitable, and many wondered: why didn\u2019t Dems keep their powder dry until it was really needed? Because this time, it was really needed. Because \u201cnot crazy\u201d should not be the new definition for \u201cnormal.\u201d This is a Supreme Court seat. Gorsuch will likely be on the Court for decades, and influencing bedrock law and policy for even longer. And even though every step of that process has been overshadowed \u2013 Comey! Nunes! Syria! \u2013 it still deserves to be examined, and remembered, for just how not-normal it all was. This was never his seat. Okay, let\u2019s just get this out of the way. Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination was never normal, well before he was just a glimmer in the Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society\u2019s eye. Because under the Constitution, President Obama had the power to appoint a justice to the Court to fill Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat, and he duly appointed Merrick Garland. But Mitch McConnell and his merry band of insta-Constitutional scholars insisted that the Constitution really meant that the President could only make that appointment for the first 75% of his term. Which no doubt was just what the framers meant to say! And so Merrick Garland twisted in the wind as the GOP blocked any chance of his even getting a hearing \u2013 leaving the seat vacant and waiting for the next President. Which the Democrats have always firmly maintained was \u2013 what\u2019s that word? Oh, right: stolen. And of course, Russia: In addition to the lingering scandal over how Gorsuch was nominated, there is also a scandal looming over the legitimacy of the President who nominated him: very real, very serious accusations about Russia\u2019s meddling in the US election, and the many questions about who on Donald Trump\u2019s team may have known or been involved. Don\u2019t just take my word for it \u2013 take the FBI\u2019s, which has been investigating this since July. Senate Democrats protested, saying it was \u201cnuts\u201d to make a lifelong appointment from a Presidency under such a cloud, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked for a delay \u2013 perfectly reasonable given that Gorsuch will have to wait to join the next round of oral arguments.) Alas, \u201creasonable\u201d is another word for \u201cnormal\u201d and, as we know, that\u2019s not how things roll these days. Welcome to the Supreme Court, rookie Gorsuch\u2019s far-right record: Here\u2019s a whole other reason to block this nomination that has everything to do with Gorsuch: his record! Though Gorsuch was hailed as a safe, classic pick (Harvard Law, clerked for Supreme Court Justices White and Kennedy, years on the bench), a moderate he is not. Assessed as being to the right of Scalia (who voted against marriage equality, Obamacare, affirmative action, equal pay and abortion rights, and for Citizens United, Hobby Lobby and to water down the Voting Rights Act), Gorsuch is widely regarded by progressive organizations as a regressive threat to women\u2019s rights and a stalwart of the religious freedom arguments that translate into denying women contraception and gay people consumer services. And he is widely regarded by anyone who watched his confirmation hearing as heartless on frozen truckers. He didn\u2019t actually say much: There\u2019s no question Judge Gorsuch is charming \u2013 a folksy, football-loving, Douglas Adams-referencing, Byron White-loving guy who is also, it must be said, something of a silver fox. (Oh come on, you noticed. And you know Trump did.) But otherwise, he didn\u2019t say much, preferring to subscribe to what I like to call the Ronan Keating theory of confirmation responses, which is to say, you say it best when you say nothing at all. (Not a love song, by the way! Just to clear that up, \u201cNotting Hill.\u201d) But when Gorsuch was actually saying things, he was saying them rather patronizingly, particularly to female Senators, and in some cases barely concealing his annoyance at the temerity of being questioned at all. He had the dubious distinction of being accused of mansplaining not just to women, but to the entire Senate. So maybe he is for equal rights, after all! (Eh, probably not.) ThinkProgress Justice editor Ian Millhiser summed it up thusly: \u201cLet-Me-Talk-Down-To-You-Like-I-Am-Your-Father Gorsuch is the worst Gorsuch.\u201d \u201cI am a judge. I am my own man,\u201d Gorsuch earnestly declared, which pairs nicely with Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon reassuring CPAC that he\u2019d faithfully fulfill the Conservative mission. Which is the truth? Confirmation hearings are meant to help one answer such questions, not blandly smooth them over. How will he vote going forward? From what he actually said in his hearings, it\u2019s hard to tell. Follow the Dark Money: Gorsuch may not have talked much, but money sure does. The Judicial Crisis Network launched a $10 million campaign explicitly to \u201cpreserve Justice Scalia\u2019s Legacy\u201d and \u201ctarget vulnerable Democrat Senators\u201d (after spending $7 million blasting the Garland nomination). Oh, and the NRA spent $1 million on an ad lauding Gorsuch. During the hearings, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse noted the anonymity of the donors to the campaign and asked Gorsuch point blank why anyone would pay $10 million to support his confirmation. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask them,\u201d said Gorsuch, deflecting. But JCN is certainly pretty clear about its priorities: anti-affirmative action, anti-contraception, anti-abortion, pro-gun rights and, of course, preserving that Scalia legacy. And lo, the investment paid off. Things left unexplored: A news cycle on steroids meant that some potentially disquieting things about Gorsuch were barely a blip on the radar. Several female senators of color say that they were told Gorsuch would not be available to meet with them, despite multiple attempts to schedule such meetings. This included Kamala Harris, the former Attorney General of California. If so, that is eye-poppingly egregious. Also, shortly before the hearing, a former student alleged that Gorsuch told his class maternity benefits are a way for women to potentially exploit companies. (The student registered concerns about the incident with the University of Colorado Law School last April, five months before Gorsuch\u2019s name was included on a list of potential Trump nominees, but the University confirmed that it had never informed Gorsuch of the student\u2019s complaint and had not further investigated. The school apologized to both the student and Gorsuch for how the episode was handled.) It would have been impossible to verify or debunk this claim without any sort of scrutiny \u2013 but it\u2019s precisely the sort of claim that urgently merits it. Finally, an eleventh-hour story surfaced suggesting Gorsuch may have played fast and loose with attribution in some of his scholarly writings. (I spent some time looking at the impugned passages and it does indeed seem as though further scrutiny ought to have been applied). It may seem square to some, but whether or not a nominee to the Supreme Court hews to rigorous academic standards does matter in determining fitness for a lifelong appointment. None of these issues got the thorough examination they warranted. Gorsuch was not actually \u201cconfirmed\u201d: Not normal: when your SCOTUS nominee is not confirmed, so you change the rules governing the entire confirmation process for Presidential appointments in order to completely cut out the other party \u2013 in a two-party system \u2013 even when that party\u2019s nominee actually won the popular vote. (By 2.9 million votes, it\u2019s always worth noting.)  Let\u2019s say it again: Neil Gorsuch was not confirmed.  Each of these aberrations deserved further consideration by the Senate (and, it should be said, the media). Are they as bananas-nutty as Devin Nunes leaping out of his car to run to the White House for a cloak-and-dagger intel exchange? Obviously not. But when Nunes is a faded historical footnote, Gorsuch will still be on the Supreme Court determining the law of the land. Gorsuch\u2019s SCOTUS appointment is for life. Dems were right to think of all the other lives that appointment will affect. And fight for them. That\u2019s the only normal any of us should be willing to accept.",

Erika Bachiochi: An authentic women's movement must be unabashedly anti-abortion Under Trump, she writes, it is imperative that our efforts as feminists be unmistakably pro-woman I did not vote for President-Elect Donald Trump and continue to question his fitness to serve. Thus I am unsurprised that hundreds of thousands of women would want to protest his election this coming Saturday, the day after the inauguration. I am surprised, however, that the leaders of the Women\u2019s March on Washington\u2014and most feminists today\u2014are so unwilling to listen to an alternative feminist perspective, one with deep roots in feminist history and a good deal to offer to women today. As a pro-choice activist who helped lead my college\u2019s Women\u2019s Center in the 1990s, and now, decades later, as a pro-life feminist, I too have looked forward to the day when a strong and accomplished woman would lead our nation. But however strong and accomplished, Secretary Clinton was not the woman for me. To me she represents all the contradictions of abortion rights feminism, contradictions also conspicuous in the guiding principles of the Women\u2019s March. In my view, an authentic women\u2019s movement\u2014one that properly extols human dignity, care, and non-violence\u2014must be unabashedly pro-life. With both Trump\u2019s inauguration and the 44th anniversary of Roe v Wade decision fast approaching, I have been concerned that Donald Trump the man\u2014as president of the United States\u2014would actually strengthen in the American imagination the popular feminist fallacy that abortion is necessary to women\u2019s equality. After all, Donald Trump as \u201cpro-life candidate\u201d fit perfectly the pro-choice caricature of an abortion opponent: degrading to and disrespectful of women. If I could say just one thing to those at the Women\u2019s March, it would be this: the constitutional right to abortion has only made men like Trump worse. Contraception fails. It just does. But constitutionalizing the right to abortion as Roe did in January 1973 hasn\u2019t relieved women of the consequences of sex or the vulnerabilities of pregnancy. Rather it has detached men even further from sex\u2019s procreative potential and, for the poor in particular, increased the vulnerability of both women and children. That is, easy abortion empowers the male illusion that sex can finally be completely consequence-free. For men, anyway.  The ascendancy of abortion rights feminism over the last fifty years has failed to remedy the sort of objectification of women on particular display by our president-elect in the unearthed Access Hollywood video and beyond. As pro-life feminists have long argued, the undisciplined testosterone-driven male libido, interested in no-strings-attached sex, benefits most from an abortion-permissive culture. And when male sexuality goes undisciplined, bereft of the deep emotional bonds once demanded by self-respecting women, sex is sought for pleasure alone. For the most callous of men, women become mere pleasure-providers, the objects of the male libido\u2019s aggressive demands. Indeed, worry over the tendencies of dissolute men was a key reason women\u2019s suffragists of the late 19th century did not see abortion as the panacea their successors have. Unlike today\u2019s abortion-rights-feminists, the suffragists feared that sex unmoored from its procreative potential would increase male sexual immorality and infidelity. The suffragists were seeking just the reverse: \u201cVotes for women, chastity for men\u201d was actually a suffragist slogan. The abortion debate is more complex than you think And yet, in a bitter irony (with encouragement from some men), those carrying the feminist mantel in the 1970s abandoned this vision of sexual integrity for both sexes and legalized abortion became the sine qua non of sexual freedom. Transforming male-oriented institutions\u2014and the men that governed them\u2014was just too difficult: conforming women\u2019s bodies seemed a far easier path. If men could reduce sex to sport, denying the intimate connection created with the women they bedded and the children they fathered, well, women ought to be able to do the same. Only we can\u2019t. Sex-induced hormones connect us more than \u201ccasual\u201d sex would seem to allow. And women must worry about pregnancy, about how carrying a child would impact our bodies, and how caring for a child would shape our futures. And so, women also tend to see more clearly the vulnerability inherent in the human condition, the human goods brought about in giving care, and how our politics affect those at the margins. How Trump's election reignites the abortion wars So why would women ever think it \u201cbetter\u201d to treat sex, the act that creates new dependent human life, so casually, as if it lacked profound consequences for connection and caregiving? Why would any feminist think it is a moral advance for women to imitate male abandonment of the vulnerable through abortion? Influential women such as Anne-Marie Slaughter thankfully have begun to highlight a more authentic feminist logic: if society better valued caregiving, then perhaps men would do more of it, and we\u2019d see greater collaboration in the home, more equity in the workplace, and more family-friendly policies. But as pro-choice law professor Robin West has noticed, the constitutionalizing of abortion rights in Roe stands in dramatic tension with a political agenda that better values caregiving.  Were it not for the wedding of modern feminism with the sexual revolution, many more men, I think, would more readily value the culturally essential work of caregiving. Both research and my personal experience suggests that men who aren\u2019t beholden to the fleeting attractions of sexual pleasure do value caregiving, and consider the nurture and education of their children their most essential work. I dare say that these men are the very picture of the emotionally available, responsible, and engaged husbands and fathers my feminist sisters and I once dreamed of.  Abortion rights will not produce more such men; but a greater appreciation that sex is a serious enterprise just might.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Michael D'Antonio: Vice President Biden said that Trump should grow up and adjust to his new role Trump has adjusted his persona when needed but he's never faced anything like this, writes D'Antonio Vice President Joe Biden had some sharp words of wisdom for the incoming President-elect last week. \u201cGrow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult,\u201d he said in an interview on PBS. \u201cYou\u2019re president. You\u2019ve got to do something. Show us what you have. You\u2019re going to propose legislation. We\u2019re going to get to debate it. Let the public decide. Let them vote in Congress. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d Biden\u2019s remarks came during a continuing stream of inflammatory Trump tweets, including ones that called Senate Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer a clown, mocked America\u2019s intelligence agencies and gave credit to Internet outlaw Julian Assange, whose WikiLeaks site aided Russia\u2019s efforts to influence the 2016 election. Biden\u2019s point is exactly right: If he is to be successful in his new role, Trump needs to make the shift from insurgent campaigner and tweeter to president of the world\u2019s superpower. On January 20, as he takes the oath of office and the weight of the presidency falls on his shoulders, Trump will, for the first time in his life, be employed outside his family\u2019s business.  At age 70, he will become accountable to the American people who will begin to learn whether this man with no experience in public service is up to the most demanding political job in the world. Has Trump ever made such a shift in roles? He hasn\u2019t had to reboot himself in anything like the manner now required. But over his long career he has had to make big adjustments. For example, when his companies ran out of money to pay their lenders and filed for bankruptcy in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009, he had to accept the strict terms and oversight required by bankruptcy agreements. The 1991 case was especially chastening, as Trump was even placed on a monthly budget by his creditors. In transition: President-elect Trump When Mark Burnett came to him with the idea for \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d TV show, Trump had to overcome his natural reluctance when it came to firing people (he actually hates doing it). And finally, when he rode down the escalator at Trump Tower in the summer of 2015, he had to assume the role of contender for the Republican party nomination. To woo the hard-right conservatives who provide much of his base in GOP primaries, he had to morph into a right-wing conservative even though he had once favored abortion rights, tax increases and stricter gun control. During the election campaign Trump was eagerly watched for signs that he would ease away from his bombast and offer more than rambling displays of emotion to the voters.  In other words, we waited for him to become \u201cpresidential.\u201d At that time the key word was not \u201ctransition\u201d but \u201cpivot,\u201d and Trump\u2019s advisors often predicted that a turn toward normalcy was at hand.  At one point Trump himself recognized the need for change and announced, \u201cI will be so presidential you will be so bored. You\u2019ll say, \u2018Can\u2019t he have a little more energy?\u2019\u201d Why proving the source of a cyberattack is so damn difficult The pivot never came.  Instead Trump continued to improvise in response to news events, promoting doubt about his opponent while revealing few details about just how he would fulfill his promise to Make America Great Again. The strategy failed to win Trump a majority of votes. Indeed, Hillary Clinton bested him by nearly 2.9 million votes. But thanks to the Electoral College he won anyway. After winning the election Trump remained devoted to his game of gesture and symbols, picking little fights with companies like Boeing and Toyota while foregoing serious work such as learning about national security in the formal briefings presidents have accepted going back to the Kennedy administration. As he neglects his serious duties in favor of indulging himself on Twitter, Trump tells us that he will not change his style merely because he was elected president. Putin's 'act of war' against American democracy A president\u2019s style does matter. And so far, Trump\u2019s tweets have upset those who value stability in world affairs and generosity of spirit in the Oval Office. However the new administration\u2019s policies will matter every bit as much as its tone, and here the President-elect has demonstrated more flexibility than some would expect. When his fellow Republicans moved to neuter the ethics board that oversees Congress, Trump objected and they reversed course. More recently he has observed the rush to repeal the Affordable Care Act and warned the GOP to \u201cbe careful\u201d lest they create a problem worse than the one they claim to be fixing.  On health care and the ethics office episode, Trump deviated from his party\u2019s orthodoxy and aligned himself with what he believes most American people want. These acts displayed the fact that he is eager to be seen as decisive, and is more concerned with his own popularity than political orthodoxy.  This is, after all, the man who just this week referred to himself as a TV \u201cratings machine\u201d as he criticized his replacement on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d Arnold Schwarzenegger. Trump\u2019s policy adjustments may not show that he is a grownup in the sense that Biden prefers. But they do show he has the potential to transition from candidate to president.  He\u2019ll likely remain a crude, insulting and ill-tempered man, but as a president he could still find a way to some success.",

The Reddit user who initially claimed credit for President Trump\u2019s tweet that showed an image of Trump tackling CNN issued an apology Tuesday for the video and other offensive content he has posted. The user wrote in a lengthy post on Reddit that he does not advocate violence against the press, and he expressed remorse there and in an interview with CNN for other posts he made that were racist and anti-Semitic. A\u00a0senior administration official told CNN Monday that the video was not pulled from Reddit.

            "article_content": "Less than 12 hours removed from a searing loss in Alabama\u2019s Senate race, President Donald Trump woke up Wednesday morning with a simple message: I was right. \u201cThe reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!\u201d Added Trump a few hours later: \u201cIf last night\u2019s election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate.\u201d Ahem. Cough. Throat clear. Let\u2019s review the facts, shall we? In the Republican primary to fill the remaining three years on Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 Senate term, Trump endorsed Strange, who had been appointed to the post by Republican Gov. Robert Bentley shortly before he resigned from office amid a sex scandal. 5 takeaways from Doug Jones' massive victory in Alabama When Moore handily defeated Strange in the runoff, Trump \u2013 or someone with access to his Twitter account \u2013 deleted three pro-Strange tweets. Trump quickly jumped in on Moore\u2019s side following the runoff. \u201cSpoke to Roy Moore of Alabama last night for the first time. Sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race,\u201d he tweeted on September 27. \u201cHe will help to #MAGA!\u201d And even after large swaths of the Republican party in Washington walked away from Moore following a series of allegations from women that he had pursued relationships with them as teenagers (Moore was in his 30s), Trump doubled down on his support for Moore. Moore, in Trump\u2019s mind, was just like him. Falsely accused of inappropriate behavior, savaged by the liberal media, attacked by his own party. Trump believed Moore would win because he believed Moore was following the Trump playbook. And everyone \u2013 in Trump\u2019s mind \u2013 who follows the Trump playbook wins. It\u2019s the only possible outcome. 5 takeaways from Doug Jones' massive victory in Alabama Except that Moore lost. And lost in one of the most Republican states in the country, a place where Democrats hadn\u2019t won a Senate race in 25 years. Which means that Trump went 0-for-2 in Alabama \u2013 swinging and missing on both Strange and Moore. But losing is not an option for Trump. He is a winner. He wins. And he only associates with winners. Those are the facts (as he imagines them to be). Which brings us back to the tweet this morning. The assertion that somehow Trump was right about this race all along is patently false. But that Trump felt compelled to even attempt to make that case is incredibly revealing about who he is. For his entire adult life, Trump has been telling himself a story about his life. In that story, Trump is always the hero, always the one who no one listened to but always got it right. That story occasionally comports with agreed-upon facts \u2013 although more often it does not. That doesn\u2019t matter to Trump. He believes it, which is all that matters. Anyone who says he is wrong or exaggerating or flat-out lying is just a hater and a loser who is jealous of Trump. It\u2019s a perfect circle of flawed logic. Create a narrative that makes you look good. Insist that anyone who doesn\u2019t buy into your narrative is fake or jealous. Repeat. That is who Trump has been his entire adult life. The presidency has not and will not change him. The Alabama results have not changed him. Nothing will change him.",

            "article_content": "Dowd has said he drafted the tweet, but denied that it admitted obstruction Trump recently lashed out at the FBI Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney\u2019s claim that the President cannot be guilty of obstructing justice raises two stunning possibilities that could cast the Russia investigation and its threat to his White House in a new and even more serious light. First, Trump lawyer John Dowd\u2019s comments in an interview with Axios raise the question of whether Trump\u2019s legal team has already accepted that special counsel Robert Mueller has grounds to conclude Trump did in fact obstruct justice by firing FBI Director James Comey. If that is the case, Dowd\u2019s interview, after a weekend of spinning by Trump and aides following the announcement of a plea deal for former national security adviser Michael Flynn, leads to another profound question. Trump lawyer says a president can't 'obstruct justice.' Can that be true? Has the White House already embarked on a public relations strategy designed to lessen the chances that the Republican-led House would draw up articles of impeachment against the President based on any recommendation by Mueller? Dowd\u2019s claims did not come in isolation. They followed the President\u2019s attacks on the FBI and his raising of doubts that justice would be served by the Mueller investigation at the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s reputation is in Tatters - worst in History!\u201d Trump tweeted. After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness. On Monday, the President told reporters at the White House that he feels \u201cvery badly for Flynn\u201d and then made an unsubstantiated claim against a target he often uses to distract from his own legal and political vulnerabilities. \u201cHillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfair.\u201d Taken together, the Dowd and Trump comments had the feel of an orchestrated offensive to repair the damage wrought over the weekend, to discredit Mueller\u2019s findings ahead of time and to offer ammunition for pro-Trump media. Trump\u2019s broadside against the FBI has prompted some talk about why the bureau\u2019s new director, Christopher Wray, who was nominated by the President to replace Comey, has not stepped up to publicly defend his agents. Wray told his staff in an agency-wide email Monday that the bureau should be prepared for scrutiny. \u201cBecause of the importance of our mission, we are also entrusted with great power, and we should expect \u2013 and welcome \u2013 people asking tough questions about how we use that power,\u201d Wray wrote in the internal message, obtained by CNN. FBI agent dismissed from Mueller probe changed Comey's description of Clinton to 'extremely careless' Wray did not mention Trump in the message. Several former senior law enforcement officials however said that Wray was probably doing the right thing by staying out of the political firing line. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do any good to take this President on in a public forum,\u201d said Rory Little, a former associate deputy attorney general, on CNN. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give the President the opportunity to fire you while you are trying to do your job,\u201d he said. Underlying Monday\u2019s flurry of controversy is a third issue \u2013 whether Dowd\u2019s position has any legal grounding in itself, and whether it would stand up to challenge as a defense of the President\u2019s action if Mueller finds against him in an investigation that was originally set up to probe whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during last year\u2019s election. Dowd\u2019s interview reverberated through Washington a day after veteran Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that she saw the outlines of an obstruction of justice case forming against Trump. It follows a series of tweets fired out by the President\u2019s Twitter account at the weekend that immediately turned the notion of obstruction of justice from a point of conversation around the Mueller probe, into an apparently active possibility. Dowd told Axios: \u201c(The) President cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under (the Constitution\u2019s Article II) and has every right to express his view of any case.\u201d The motivation for Dowd\u2019s introducing his point at this moment \u2013 long before Mueller has concluded his probe \u2013 is just as interesting as the legal point he makes itself. \u201cIt tells you that the President\u2019s legal team is concerned that the President obstructed justice,\u201d Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Monday. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason for the President\u2019s legal team to go out there and claim that the President cannot obstruct justice unless they are concerned that he may have liability for that,\u201d he said. The new debate about obstruction exploded after Trump\u2019s account tweeted during the weekend that he had to fire Flynn because Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence and the FBI about his conversations with Russian officials. If Trump knew that Flynn had lied to the bureau when he asked Comey by the former FBI director\u2019s own account in February to go easy on his fired national security adviser, he could be seen as advocating a cover-up of a crime. Dowd eventually insisted that he, not Trump, had written the tweet. As the stunning implications of Dowd\u2019s comments were playing out in Washington, there was also intense interest in the substance. Dowd was effectively arguing that Trump as the chief law enforcement officer can direct the Justice Department on the use of federal resources. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan disputed that argument. \u201cI don\u2019t happen to agree with that theory and I think most legal scholars would not agree that the President could obstruct an investigation of his own office,\u201d said Callan. \u201cBecause then it\u2019s personal, it\u2019s not just him doing the job to help the country, it is him obstructing justice directly.\u201d After this article was published, Callan further clarified his position to make the point that in certain circumstances, a president can be prosecuted for obstruction of justice. \u201cThe president can be guilty of an obstruction of justice where he terminates or impedes an investigation to protect his own personal interests and those of his staff from a charge of criminality rather than seeking to advance a legitimate public policy objective,\u201d Callan said. WH lawyer told Trump that Flynn misled FBI and Pence The idea that a President cannot obstruct justice may be a workable legal argument to contend with any future criminal action against Trump. Legal scholars have yet to resolve a constitutional dispute over whether a sitting president can be indicted. But it may not protect the President politically. After all, Richard Nixon once claimed after his resignation that \u201cwhen the President does it, that means that it is not illegal.\u201d But the articles of impeachment drawn up by the House of Representatives that helped force his resignation included one accusing Nixon of obstructing justice. Similarly, the articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton included an accusation that he had \u201cprevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice.\u201d In his interview with Axios, Dowd disputed widespread claims that the tweet from Trump\u2019s account on firing Flynn admitted obstruction. \u201cThat is an ignorant and arrogant assertion,\u201d he said. UPDATE: This story was updated with additional comment from Callan. CNN\u2019s Laura Jarrett contributed to this report.",

The Washington Post \u2013 which obtained an advanced copy of the book, \u201cLet Trump Be Trump\u201d \u2013 reported several anecdotes from the campaign, including that then-press secretary Hope Hicks used a steamer to press Trump\u2019s pants while he was still wearing them and that Trump\u2019s typical order from McDonald\u2019s consisted of \u201ctwo Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish and a chocolate malted.\u201d Lewandowski firing: Power of Ivanka? \u201cSooner or later, everybody who works for Donald Trump will see a side of him that makes you wonder why you took a job with him in the first place,\u201d they wrote in the book, according to the Post. \u201cHis wrath is never intended as any personal offense, but sometimes it can be hard not to take it that way. The mode that he switches into when things aren\u2019t going his way can feel like an all-out assault; it\u2019d break most hardened men and women into little pieces.\u201d They said they \u201cboth had moments where they wanted to parachute off Trump Force One,\u201d but added they got used to the environment. Lewandowski paints a positive image of his former boss, according to the Post, and used the book to slam Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman who Lewandowski blamed for his leaving the campaign. Critics react to Trump's tweet on firing Flynn After Lewandowski left the campaign, CNN hired him as a political commentator in June 2016. He resigned that position in November 2016. In one part of the book, Lewandowski writes about a time when Trump was on a helicopter and learned that Manafort said, \u201cTrump shouldn\u2019t be on television anymore, that he shouldn\u2019t be on the Sunday shows,\u201d and that Manafort should appear instead. Lewandowski wrote that Trump was angrier than he\u2019d ever seen and ordered the pilot to lower the altitude so he could make a cellphone call. \u201cDid you say I shouldn\u2019t be on TV on Sunday? I\u2019ll go on TV any time I g\u2013dam f\u2014ing want and you won\u2019t say another f\u2014ing word about me!\u201d Trump yelled at Manafort, according to Lewandowski. \u201cTone it down? I wanna turn it up!! \u2026 You\u2019re a political pro? Let me tell you something. I\u2019m a pro at life. I\u2019ve been around a time or two. I know guys like you, with your hair and skin \u2026\u201d According to the Post, Lewandowski called it \u201cone of the greatest takedowns in the history of the world.\u201d He recalled that shortly after, he \u201cimmediately got a phone call\u201d from Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law \u201ctelling me I wasn\u2019t a team player and that I\u2019d thrown Paul under the bus.\u201d He wrote that Manafort soon arranged for him to be fired from the campaign.",

Seven women besides Kayla Moore served as character witnesses for Roy Moore on Friday, pushing back on allegations that the 70-year-old Republican candidate had pursued sexual relationships with teenagers when he was in his early thirties \u2013 and blaming the media and the Republican establishment for spreading lies about him. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle,\u201d Kayla Moore said, addressing members of the media from the steps of a courthouse. \u201cWho knew?\u201d She blamed the Washington establishment for attacking her husband and called him \u201can officer and a gentleman.\u201d The Roy Moore scandal: Follow the latest A number of the other women who spoke said they had known the Moores for years.

Now that I\u2019m at CNN, I still value PK\u2019s wisdom about Congress \u2013 and politics more generally. So when Joe Biden embarked on his media tour for \u201cPromise Me, Dad\u201d \u2013 a memoir of the year in which his eldest son died from brain cancer \u2013 I reached out to PK to talk about the former vice president and his future political ambitions, including a potential 2020 presidential bid. Our email exchange is below \u2013 edited only slightly for flow. Chris: OK, PK. We may be at different media organizations but through the power of electronic mail, we can still communicate! Let\u2019s talk Joe Biden. He\u2019s been all over the media in the last 72 hours \u2013 he was on the \u201cToday\u201d show so much on Monday I thought he had been hired as a new anchor \u2013 promoting his new book about the death of his son, Beau, and his life up until now. In these interviews, he has the same pat response about 2020: If I had to decide today, I wouldn\u2019t run. But I am not shutting the door on it for 2020. Two questions: 1. Do you believe him that he wouldn\u2019t run if he had to announce today? (I sort of don\u2019t.) 2. What makes up his mind \u2013 to run or not run \u2013 between now and, let\u2019s say January 2019? Is it external stuff? Personal things? Both? Neither? PK: Greetings old friend. How is it working with Mark Preston again? OK, don\u2019t answer that question, it would involve too many expletives and would divert us from the topic at hand, Biden. First off, it should be noted that the frame of this book \u2013 \u201cPromise Me, Dad\u201d \u2013 was crafted long before Donald J. Trump was sworn into office. It actually was crafted in expectation that Hillary Clinton would be president and Biden would be almost solely focused on the cancer moonshot. I wrote a piece over several months in 2016 about Biden\u2019s heavy focus on stumping for Senate Democrats, trying to flip the majority last fall. On one trip, flying from Los Angeles back east in September 2016, he told me about the book proposal: a year in his life, from learning Beau\u2019s cancer was back, to watching him fight for his life, to his death, to America\u2019s outpouring and his consideration of a late-breaking bid for president, to him standing in the Rose Garden with Obama and Dr. B, saying he wouldn\u2019t run. He wasn\u2019t even sure he could write the book, given the emotional ground he would have to plow. So, this book itself is not the usual presidential campaign book. It was originally meant to be a bookend to his career. But life and circumstances change, sometime in a moment\u2019s notice, sometimes over several years, and no one knows that better than Joe Biden. So now he sits among the top tier of the type of people who would be mentioned in 2020. I think the answer to your two questions are unknowable, because the first scenario is actually more like a UK-style snap election \u2013 and that\u2019s the sorta campaign Biden would be most likely to run, a brief sprint of a few months from nomination to general election. But those don\u2019t exist in America. So, question two is more important, and I think Biden is being pretty open and pretty honest when he says that he\u2019s waiting to see how the field develops. He wants to be president, of course, he\u2019s ridiculously open about that ambition. But he also knows that change elections don\u2019t usually go to 77-year-olds who spent 44 years in federal office. Over the next 18 months he\u2019s waiting to see if someone, even a few people, emerge as real credible contenders to Trump. Because, at the moment, no such person really exists. Chris: Preston\u2019s new glasses deserve their own Twitter feed. (And yet, there are NO pics of him in the glasses on Google Images. I smell a conspiracy.) On Biden\u2019s age:  He would be, of course, the oldest person ever to be elected president. He would take that record from one Donald John Trump, who was elected at age 70. Which sort of gets me to my point: We are living way longer. Our politicians, not surprisingly, are also living longer \u2013 and running for (and staying in) office longer. The top tier of the 2020 field is not exactly spring chickens with or without Biden. Bernie Sanders will be 79 on election day! Elizabeth Warren will be 71. Hell, Trump will be 74 on Election Day 2020! That\u2019s my pro-Biden point. My anti-Biden point is this: Everyone \u2013 myself included! \u2013 put him in the top tier of potential 2020 candidates. But, that \u2013 admittedly early \u2013 handicapping is based solely on the fact that he spent eight years as Barack Obama vice president. After all, Biden\u2019s own record as a presidential candidate is way less impressive. He dropped from the 1988 presidential primary in 1987 after a plagiarism scandal. In 2008, he was never close to being a serious contender and never, really, had a moment in which he appeared to be building momentum in the race. So, aside from having been picked by Obama to be vice president, what\u2019s the convincing evidence that Biden would be a great presidential candidate befitting his top tier status? PK: OK, I\u2019ll start with your last point/question, then work back to the age issue. Biden belongs in the top tier both because he served as Obama\u2019s VP, giving him universal name ID, and because of his deep knowledge of foreign policy that began through a couple decades of service on the Senate foreign relations committee. Those are top-tier credentials. Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, Biden has, better than any Democrat at the national level, cultivated an everyman image that has an appeal to voters in white working class exurban areas near Scranton and to inner-city black neighborhoods of North Philadelphia. No one will ever accuse Biden of being an elitist. That trip I mentioned earlier, from LA to back east, that was the night that Clinton made her \u201cdeplorables\u201d remark at a fundraiser. He had just spent 20 minutes lamenting how his party had become perceived as the party of \u201cpedigree,\u201d the party of Ivy elites. His head exploded when we relayed to him the full quote of what Clinton had just said. All of that gives him an appeal to the voters that Democrats lost from 2008 and 2012 to 2016 \u2013 particularly those across the Midwest, in places like Erie, Pennsylvania; Toledo, Ohio; Macomb County, Michigan; Racine, Wisconsin. But, but, but, you can\u2019t talk about Biden being in the top tier for 2020 without first addressing the issue of age, and as it relates to how voters will view it and also whether or not it\u2019s the right idea for the nation. Biden\u2019s own health has been pretty good for a 74-year-old, for sure, and his mother lived till she was 92. The issue won\u2019t necessarily be whether he\u2019s fit to serve come January 2021, but what toll the presidency takes on even the healthiest of people. He turns 75 next week. In the fall of 2024, he would be presumably running for re-election at the age of 81. Put another way, if Biden served two terms, he would turn 86 on November 20, 2028, as he was passing the Oval Office to his successor. The distance from 74 to 86 is big for any human, let alone one that would spend eight years of that span in the toughest job in the world. I\u2019ve watched, up close, as number of senators who were incredibly sharp and energetic in their mid-70s, turn very slow and plodding by their early 80s. We have to think, as a society, whether we want the leader of the free world to be challenging Father Time. Chris: So, that\u2019s interesting. I hadn\u2019t thought of the age issue as much as you have. It\u2019s true that Biden would be super old \u2013 that is a technical term \u2013 if/when he ran for re-election. At the same time, Trump will be 74! Anywho. Let\u2019s assume \u2013 and you are convincing on this front \u2013 that Biden is a top tier candidate along with either or both Warren and Bernie. What\u2019s your sense for what that race looks like? My strong sense is that either or both Warren and Sanders seek to cast Biden as establishment. As too centrist. Too compromise-oriented.  Clinton 2.0. (Or 3.0) (Or 4.0). (Yes, I know it is ironic that Biden would be cast as the heir to Clintonism given his stated disdain for the campaign Clinton ran in 2016.) Do you agree? And what\u2019s your sense of how Biden would respond to that characterization/attack? PK: To be sure, I\u2019m not saying that Biden, or anyone in their 80s, cannot do the job. It\u2019s just a serious issue, and yes, I\u2019ve seen it firsthand, in my own family, watching someone go from completely with it and snappy in their late 70s, to wheelchair-bound by mid-80s. And I\u2019ve seen the drift of a bunch of senators in the last six years or so. It\u2019s tough. In terms of how the race shapes up, Biden will get pegged as the establishment guy, no other way about it. And he\u2019ll have to embrace it, not run from it. No use pretending to be something else. Sanders and Warren will position themselves ideologically to his left on banking/financial issues, both because of his Senate background in a state that was home to many credit card companies and his general view of not trying to scapegoat people, which can sometimes sound like defending the banks. And he was an avowed defender of TPP, which Sanders vehemently opposed. (Biden\u2019s Senate record on trade is mixed, opposed to NAFTA and \u201cyes\u201d on normalizing trade with China.) A key issue for Democrats, more broadly, is how they define ideology going forward. Over the last eight years, Republican voters have increasingly abandoned traditional conservative issues and policy positions and instead adopted emotion and anger as their primal ideological demand. If Democratic voters want emotion and anger and ferocity and strong denunciations of Trump more than liberal policy positions, that\u2019s a net positive for Biden. No one is ever going to accuse him of emotional moderation. No. One. But if Democratic primary voters are looking for someone who screams \u201cGlass Steagall\u201d and \u201csingle payer,\u201d that\u2019s bad for Biden and would leave him in a position resembling the original Joe-mentum: Lieberman, who began the 2004 campaign atop the polls just because of his name ID from having been the VP nominee in 2000. Chris: I don\u2019t think Biden is a re-run of Lieberman. Lieberman was VERY much a conservative Democrat. Take Biden\u2019s record as a whole and it\u2019s hard to imagine him being pegged that way. Yes, he is a compromiser \u2013 the fiscal cliff deal he cut with Mitch McConnell in late 2012, for example \u2013 but on virtually every issue liberals care about, he\u2019s going to be with them. All of this brings us to the only question that really matters: Does Biden run or not? I think he does \u2013 barring some sort of unforeseen health hiccup between now and the end of 2018/start of 2019. He had the presidential bug before he was the VP for eight years. And, as Mo Udall famously said, \u201cthe only cure for presidential ambition is embalming fluid.\u201d Biden wants to be president. He thinks he\u2019d be good at it. And he believes in his heart of hearts the country needs him. I think he\u2019s going to be in.  You? PK: Yeah, first things first, Biden would obviously start as a much more credible candidate than Lieberman, but the 2003 Lieberman was not as out of step ideologically at that time as he was by 2010-12. My point is, overall, I think Biden\u2019s emotional nature \u2013 just re-watch his 2016 address to the DNC in Philly, it\u2019s as good as Joe Biden has ever been in that format \u2013 will compensate for some ideological baggage the liberals will throw at him. Ultimately, no one really knows if he\u2019ll run, not even Dr. B, as Jill Biden is known to his staff. Go find that 1974 Washingtonian profile, his first national profile after his wife and daughter died in the Decmeber 1972 car crash. He openly admitted he wanted to be president, in his second year in the Senate. The question \u2013 as has often been the Biden conundrum \u2013 is whether Biden makes a decision, a pure, definite decision. Or, as has happened more often than not in his career, Biden makes a decision \u2026 by not making a decision. If he\u2019s running, it will be pretty clear by late 2018. You\u2019ll see names like Greg Schultz and Steve Schale interviewing folks for jobs. Greg ran Ohio for Obama, became essentially Biden\u2019s political director in 2013 and would\u2019ve likely been campaign manager had Biden jumped into the 2016 race. Steve ran Florida for Obama and never caught the DC bug, stayed down there but became part of Biden Family in 2015. He would\u2019ve had a big role in 2016 and will have one in 2020 \u2026 if Biden gets in. But if this whole decision lingers and lingers, deep into 2019, then that means we\u2019re going through the same thing again, as happened in 1984 and 2004 and 2016. In each case, he kept thinking about running, kept talking about running, without ever actually running. This is Biden\u2019s decision-making style on a lotta things, driving some folks mad. The act of trying to decide becomes the decision itself \u2013 because by the time the decision is really ready to be made, it\u2019s too late to make any decision but no-go. One thing we know, for sure, is he\u2019ll enjoy this ride. In July 2016, he bounced on stage to the Rocky theme song (\u201cGonna Fly Now\u201d) and delivered as good a speech as Clinton\u2019s team could\u2019ve hoped. He and Dr. B headed off the stage and the crowd in Philly was in full rage. Just at the last step, he stopped, as Jill left alone, he turned around and \u2013 thinking it was the last time he\u2019d ever really have on a stage like that \u2013 soaked it in for one last second, gave a final wave and left.",

            "article_content": "House Republicans have an ambitious timeline for passing tax reform legislation Meanwhile, both chambers have high profile hearings in the Russia investigations With just 24 legislative days left in 2017, House Republicans will embark on their last chance for a big legislative victory when they release their plan to overhaul the tax code. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady plans to unveil the House\u2019s tax legislation Wednesday. Only a few Republican lawmakers are crafting the details of the tax overhaul, but rank-and-file House GOP members will finally get briefed on the legislative text Wednesday morning at a closed-door meeting. The release of the bill will mark the official start of the race to tax reform and Republicans have unveiled an ambitious timeline. The House Republicans plan to mark up their bill the week of November 6 and pass it out of the House the week of November 13, leaving little room for any error. But it\u2019s a heavy lift. Members from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California are already balking at a proposal to eliminate deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT. Eliminating the deduction would help pay for the across-the-board tax cuts, but Brady has said he knows he needs pro-SALT members on board if he wants to keep tax reform alive. Brady said in a statement over the weekend that the plan would restore itemized property tax deduction in hopes of winning over some Republicans. Rep. Leonard Lance, a New Jersey Republican and one of the lead negotiators in the SALT debate, called the move a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d but added, \u201cThere is more work to be done on the SALT issue.\u201d And that\u2019s just one sticking point. When the tax bill is revealed next week, expect Republicans from both chambers to voice concerns over any number of deduction roll backs. Already, President Donald Trump came out publicly against any changes to 401(k) retirement plans and some Republicans fear Trump could torpedo controversial provisions in the tax bill with a single Tweet. Asked if he was concerned about Trump\u2019s role in the roll out, House Speaker Paul Ryan joked last week that \u201cHe\u2019s going to be in Asia,\u201d a reference to a 12-day visit Trump is planning, which will include stops in China, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and Vietnam. \u201cThat was kind of a joke,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI was sort of joking on that one.\u201d Representatives for Twitter, Facebook and Google will appear before both the Senate and House intelligence committees Wednesday, in open hearings as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the last presidential election. Christie: Mueller's targets should be concerned Colin Stretch, vice president and general counsel for Facebook, Sean Edgett, general counsel for Twitter and Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel for Google will all be testifying on behalf of their companies on the social media influence in the 2016 election and steps they are taking to mitigate further interference. But not before the Judiciary committee\u2019s subcommittee on crime and terrorism gets a bite at the social media apple, announcing late Friday that they will be a hearing Tuesday to \u201cdetermine ways to combat and reduce the amount of Russian propaganda and extremist content online.\u201d The subcommittee, chaired by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, will also be hearing from Stretch and Edgett, as well as Richard Salgado, director of law enforcement and information security at Google. Thursday, the House intelligence committee will hear from former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page as they continue to investigate Russian Interference in the 2016 election. The committee issued a subpoena to Page, after he told them earlier this month he would plead the Fifth Amendment to keep from turning over a \u201cvast array\u201d of documents the panel requested, which he argued was \u201cbeyond the charter\u201d of its probe. In a rare Monday evening hearing, the Senate foreign relations will hear from Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the administration\u2019s perspective on the need for a new authorization for military force that would potentially replace the existing AUMF, which has been in effect since 2001. RELATED: How one vote opened the door for more than 15 years of war Some lawmakers have been briefed by the Pentagon on the US military operation that left four servicemen dead in Niger, and many continue to say they have more questions and want the Defense Department to release more information from its own review. Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and chairman of the committee, has tangled in recent weeks with the President, telling CNN\u2019s Manu Raju last week that Trump\u2019s legacy would be the \u201cdebasement of our nation.\u201d On Wednesday, The House foreign affairs committee will get a firsthand person\u2019s account of life in North Korea when they hear from Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who served as the reclusive country\u2019s Deputy Ambassador to the United Kingdom before his defection last year. It's one thing to criticize Trump. It's another to vote against him. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will be pushing this week to confirm some of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, including four nominees to the influential and powerful circuit courts. The President criticized the slow pace of the confirmation process at a Cabinet meeting last week, putting McConnell under pressure to push through judges at a faster pace. The four circuit court nominees \u2013 Allison Eid for the tenth US Circuit Court of Appeals, Stephanos Bibas for the third Circuit, Joan Larsen for the sixth Circuit and Amy Coney Barrett for the seventh Circuit \u2013 face Democratic filibusters and McConnell may keep the Senate in session Friday and Saturday to get it done. In the wake of the deadly fires that have ravaged California, the House will take up legislation this week to address the federal response to forest fires, and change how forest management programs are funded. The bill would allow the Forest Service to tap emergency funds for firefighting, just as FEMA can do when it comes to natural disaster responses, rather than having to raid funding from other programs \u2013 like fire prevention \u2013 if it runs out of firefighting funds. But, the bill also adds a controversial change to forest management programs, which would allow the Forest Service to thin trees on certain lands without going through EPA environmental reviews. Also on Wednesday, the House homeland security committee will hear from FEMA Administrator Brock Long, who will make his first appearance before the House of Representatives. He is expected to update the committee on FEMA\u2019s response to Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria and to the wildfires that have decimated California\u2019s wine country.

            "article_content": "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico are going swimmingly \u2013 thanks, in large part, to how well he is handling everything. \u201cPuerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 just stated: \u2018The Administration and the President, every time we\u2019ve spoken, they\u2019ve delivered,\u2019\u201d Trump tweeted Friday morning. On Thursday night, Trump tweeted this: \u201cPuerto Rico is devastated. Phone system, electric grid many roads, gone. FEMA and First Responders are amazing. Governor said \u2018great job!\u2019\u201d Earlier Thursday, Trump scolded the press for its coverage of the story: \u201cFEMA & First Responders are doing a GREAT job in Puerto Rico. Massive food & water delivered. Docks & electric grid dead. Locals trying really hard to help but many have lost their homes. Military is now on site and I will be there Tuesday. Wish press would treat fairly!\u201d The facts on the ground in Puerto Rico tell a very different story. Huge swaths of the country still don\u2019t have power. Drinking water is running low. So is food. The country\u2019s credit card system remains down. A flash flood watch is in effect for the weekend. As San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz said on \u201cNew Day\u201d Friday: \u201cThis is not a good news story. This is a people are dying story.\u201d (She was responding to an incredibly tone-deaf comment by acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke on Thursday afternoon.) The simple fact is that Trump was caught flat-footed on the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Puerto Rico, distracted by both a fight he picked with pro-athletes over the National Anthem and the Alabama Senate race where his preferred candidate was resoundingly defeated on Tuesday. That Trump, in the face of all facts to the contrary, continues to insist that things in Puerto Rico are coming around and that his administration\u2019s response to the hurricane has been pitch perfect is broadly consistent with the President\u2019s tendency to create an alternate reality when the fact-based one doesn\u2019t look so good for him. Witness Trump\u2019s bizarre attempt this week to argue that his side actually does have the votes needed to pass legislation that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and that the only reason it hasn\u2019t passed yet is because a GOP senator is in the hospital. \u201cWe have the votes for health care,\u201d Trump insisted Wednesday. \u201cThe problem is we can\u2019t have them by Friday, because the reconciliation ends on Friday. So we\u2019ll have to do it in January or February. But I feel we have the votes. I\u2019m almost certain we have the votes, but with one man in the hospital we cannot display that we have them \u2013 plus some people wanna go through a process just to make themselves feel better. That\u2019s OK.\u201d Er, no. First off, Republicans don\u2019t have the votes. At best, they have 46 \u201cyeses\u201d since three GOP Senators are hard \u201cno\u2019s\u201d (John McCain, Rand Paul and Susan Collins) and three more (Ted Cruz, Lisa Murkowski and Mike Lee) have yet to say whether they would or could be for the legislation sponsored by Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Second, there are no senators in the hospital. Trump appears to be referring to Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who is recuperating from a medical procedure in the Magnolia State. \u201cThanks for the well-wishes,\u201d Cochran tweeted in the wake of Trump\u2019s claim that he was hospitalized. \u201cI\u2019m not hospitalized, but am recuperating at home in Mississippi and look forward to returning to work soon.\u201d Cochran also made clear he would be ready and able to return to Washington to vote for the Graham-Cassidy legislation if the votes were there to pass it. SPOILER ALERT: They aren\u2019t. Trump\u2019s attitude to the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election and potential collusion with his campaign is similarly distanced from reality. At a speech a week ago in Alabama in support of appointed Republican Sen. Luther Strange, who lost his primary bid Tuesday, Trump repeatedly sought to downplay the seriousness of Russia\u2019s involvement in the election. \u201cI call it the Russian hoax,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cOne of the great hoaxes.\u201d  He added, in a heroic feat of red herring-ness: \u201cAny Russians in the audience? Are there any Russians in the audience? I don\u2019t see too many Russians.\u201d Here\u2019s the thing: The FBI, CIA, NSA and the former Director of National Intelligence all agree that Russia not only actively sought to meddle in the election but that they did so with the express purpose of helping Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton. Unless you believe all of those intelligence agencies are somehow involved in a massive conspiracy to make the President look bad, then Trump\u2019s repeated insistence that the Russia story is a \u201choax\u201d is way, way, way off base. I\u2019ve written before that Trump is forever telling himself a story of his life and his actions that make him look like the righteous hero \u2013 never placing a foot wrong and always being proven right. The facts \u2013 from Puerto Rico to healthcare to Russia \u2013 tell a very different story, however.  And, while Trump has proven an uncanny ability to sell an alternate reality to himself and his supporters, the facts have a funny way of winning out in the long run. You can only live in a world of your creation for so long before fact-based reality bursts your bubble. The question for Trump is how long he can keep this up.",

But two of Trump\u2019s key 2016 campaign allies say to forget that, saying that Strange is tainted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and $10 million in advertising muscle from a McConnell-aligned super PAC. \u201cThey think you\u2019re a pack of morons. They think you\u2019re nothing but rubes,\u201d said Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign chief executive and, until his recent ouster, White House chief strategist. Inside a sweaty barn south of Mobile, Bannon told voters that ignoring Trump\u2019s endorsement and voting for Moore is the way to support Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cWe did not come here to defy Donald Trump. We came here to praise and honor him,\u201d Bannon said. It's Pence vs. Bannon in final day of Alabama Senate race A Moore win would \u201crejuvenate\u201d the movement Trump started, said Nigel Farage, the British \u201cBrexit\u201d champion. \u201cThis point about getting Judge Roy Moore is to help the President, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, as the crowd packed into a Southern Alabama barn shouted, \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cSometimes you\u2019ve got to show tough love to your own guys,\u201d said Tim James, the son of former Republican Gov. Bob James. Trump, James said, is \u201cgonna think twice before he jumps in a family feud again.\u201d The bitter intra-party battle for the seat Sessions vacated in February comes to an end Tuesday. But a win by Moore \u2013 which national and state Republicans acknowledge is a strong possibility \u2013 would inject fuel into anti-establishment candidates\u2019 bids to unseat several other sitting Senate Republicans. Already, Bannon is backing Danny Tarkanian over Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada and Kelli Ward over Sen. Jeff Flake in Arizona. Republican primaries in the 10 Democratic-held Senate seats in states Trump won that are on the ballot in 2018 could see similar brawls. It\u2019s part of why the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund has spent $10 million in the primary to boost Strange and tear down Moore. Trump touts 'Big Luther's' loyalty, electability at Alabama rally The other part of the McConnell camp\u2019s calculus: Moore, who was twice ousted as state Supreme Court chief justice \u2013 once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument, then for ignoring the US Supreme Court\u2019s same-sex marriage ruling \u2013 campaigns on installing Christianity at the center of American public life and rejecting LGBT rights. His long history of controversial remarks would be a fundraising boon for Democrats, and would lead to uncomfortable questions for Republican senators about whether they agree or disagree with their new colleague. For his part, Moore seemed to be animated on the campaign trail by the spending against his relatively shoestring campaign. \u201cWill we send them a message? Very clear \u2013 Alabama can\u2019t be bought,\u201d he said Monday night. \u201cMitch McConnell needs to be replaced!\u201d Trump on 2016: 'No, Russia did not help me' The irony of the pro-Moore crowd\u2019s insistence that he, not Strange, would be a more reliable ally, is that Moore has broken with Trump on health care \u2013 saying he\u2019d vote against the latest GOP Obamacare repeal bill because it doesn\u2019t fully eliminate the law. For Trump, the fate of Strange \u2013 a reliable vote in the Senate and someone who brags about his \u201cclose, personal friendship\u201d with the President \u2013 will demonstrate just how strongly his word can influence the outcome of GOP battles. A Strange win could ease the concerns of some other Republican lawmakers who fear primary battles. Trump has spent heavily from his own political capital in the Alabama race. The President visited Huntsville for a raucous Friday night rally, and Vice President Mike Pence was on hand Monday night in Birmingham to close out Strange\u2019s campaign. Ben Carson breaks with Trump, praises Roy Moore in Alabama Senate race Sensing the danger of McConnell\u2019s support for Strange, Trump also called into Alabama\u2019s \u201cThe Rick and Bubba Show\u201d Monday morning to insist that the two senators hardly know each other. \u201cAs you know, Mitch is not, polling-wise, the most popular guy in this country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey like to label (Strange) because he happened to be there for a number of months in the Senate, so they like to label him as Mitch\u2019s best friend but he\u2019s not. He hardly even knows him. He\u2019ll be fighting Mitch.\u201d Trump pledged Friday night in Huntsville to campaign for Moore if he won. But in Monday\u2019s radio interview, he warned that Moore would face a stiff fight against Democratic nominee Doug Jones in the December general election. \u201cRoy Moore is going to have a very hard time getting elected against the Democrat,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd Luther, they won\u2019t even be fighting.\u201d",

            "article_content": "\"Luther's going to win easily,\" Trump said Trump also blasted McCain at the Friday night rally President Donald Trump sought to make the case to Alabama voters Friday night that Sen. Luther Strange is more electable than his opponent, Roy Moore. At a raucous rally in Huntsville, the President warned that that former judge Moore could lose the state\u2019s Senate special election to a Democrat \u2013 but if Strange, who already holds the Senate seat, wins Tuesday\u2019s primary, \u201cit\u2019s over.\u201d With the endorsement, Trump took what he admitted was a risk \u2013 pumping his own political capital into an effort to carry Strange to victory, even though a Moore win could put a dent in Trump\u2019s influence. Trump said he \u201cmight\u2019ve made a mistake, I\u2019ll be honest,\u201d by wading into the race. The story behind Trump's once-wavering Luther Strange endorsement But, he said, \u201cLuther\u2019s going to win easily and Roy is going to have a hard time winning\u201d a December general election against Democrat Doug Jones. Trump\u2019s comments about electability came as he acknowledged that Senate Republicans can\u2019t spare a single vote. He pointed to Sen. John McCain\u2019s announcement Friday that he opposes the latest GOP health care bill \u2013 effectively ending the party\u2019s chances for now at repealing Obamacare. His decision to visit Alabama and campaign for Strange, Trump said, was all about loyalty. The President bluntly told the crowd that when he was handed a list of 10 senators he needed to lobby to support his health care effort, some insisted on dinners and meetings with their families before Trump could win them over. But when he called Strange, the new senator appointed in February to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said, in Trump\u2019s retelling: \u201cSir, don\u2019t even waste your time talking anymore. You have a lot of business to do. You have my vote.\u201d Trump said he told first lady Melania Trump about the call. \u201cI went home and told my wife, that\u2019s the coolest thing that\u2019s happened to me in six months.\u201d Trump also defended Strange against Moore\u2019s accusations that he is doing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s bidding, saying that Strange has only known McConnell for months. The charges have stemmed from a pro-McConnell super PAC spending $9 million to boost Strange. Trump and McConnell have butted heads as Republicans\u2019 frustration has mounted over the party\u2019s failure to repeal Obamacare and enact other Trump agenda items, with Trump publicly blasting the Senate leader on Twitter repeatedly in recent weeks. At the rally, Trump said he knew Strange had trailed in the polls. But he said: \u201cI think you\u2019re going to come back and you\u2019re going to kick everyone\u2019s ass and you\u2019re going to be great. You\u2019re going to be great. Because he got saddled with things he should not have gotten saddled with.\u201d Still, Trump\u2019s hedges \u2013 at one point he said he\u2019d support Moore if he wins the primary \u2013 reflected a White House still cautious about Strange\u2019s chances against a figure with decades-long relationships in Alabama politics. Moore, who campaigns on placing Christianity at the center of public life and opposing LGBT rights, was twice ousted as state Supreme Court chief justice \u2013 first for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument then for refusing to recognize the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Trump blasted McCain at the Friday night rally, calling the Arizona Republican\u2019s choice to oppose the latest GOP effort to repeal Obamacare \u201chonestly terrible\u201d at a rally in Alabama. Recalling the list of 10 \u201cno\u201d votes he was told he needed to court, Trump said, \u201cJohn McCain was not on the list, so that was an unexpected thing. Terrible. Honestly terrible.\u201d Trump added that McCain\u2019s \u201clast campaign was all about repeal and replace, repeal and replace.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it eventually,\u201d Trump vowed, referring to his pledge to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Trump added that he still believes Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who like McCain has said he will vote against the bill, could change his mind. \u201cI haven\u2019t given up on him, because I think he may come around, OK? Wouldn\u2019t it be ironic if he took John McCain\u2019s place \u2013 and they definitely do not like each other. Wouldn\u2019t that be ironic?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat would be very ironic, for those of you that know the inner workings of the Senate.\u201d And he railed against the Senate\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d 60-vote threshold to pass legislation, complaining that \u2013 with Republicans controlling only 52 seats \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to pass bills. He said the GOP can pass bills under special budget reconciliation rules that require just 51 votes, \u201cbut that\u2019s a trick. That\u2019s just a trick.\u201d Trump after 'lock her up' chant: Talk to Jeff Sessions The rally had some of Trump\u2019s hallmarks. He claimed that audience members would be \u201cturning over your rifle\u201d if Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 election. And when the audience chanted \u201clock her up,\u201d he responded that they should talk to Sessions about it. Trump also said he\u2019d like to see NFL owners respond to players kneeling during the National Anthem by saying: \u201cGet that son of a bitch off the field right now, he\u2019s fired. He\u2019s fired!\u201d \u201cFor a week, (that owner would) be the most popular person in this country,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbecause that\u2019s a total disrespect of our heritage. That\u2019s a total disrespect for everything we stand for. And he complained about NFL efforts to enforce penalties designed to prevent concussions. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining the game, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining the game.\u201d Trump on 2016: 'No, Russia did not help me' Trump called the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election \u201cone of the great hoaxes,\u201d and said it is an \u201cexcuse\u201d for Democrats after they lost the contest. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s the thing they did best,\u201d Trump said of Democrats. \u201cThey did a rotten job of running, but they convinced people of this hoax. That was probably the thing that they did best, but it was one great hoax.\u201d He added: \u201cNo, Russia did not help me, that I can tell you, OK?\u201d Trump also bragged about his victory, touting his focus on electoral votes rather than the popular vote, and said he hopes Clinton runs again in 2020. \u201cIf Hillary runs again in four years, which I hope she does, we\u2019re going to teach her to spend more time in Michigan. We\u2019re going to teach her to go to Wisconsin,\u201d Trump said. The trip south comes after Trump spent a stiff week in New York City meeting world leaders at the United Nations, which he called \u201cvery productive\u201d at Friday\u2019s rally. Trump took aim again at North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear aspirations, calling him \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and promising that \u201cwe\u2019re going to handle it, folks\u201d at a rally in Alabama. \u201cWe can\u2019t have mad men out there shooting rockets all over the place. And by the way, Rocket Man should have been handled a long time ago,\u201d Trump said, adding that former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton should have dealt with North Korea during Obama\u2019s tenure. \u201cHe should have been handled eight years ago, and four years ago, and honestly \u2013 and 15 years ago, and 20 years ago, and 25 years ago. This shouldn\u2019t be handled now, but I\u2019m going to handle it because we have to handle it.\u201d Trump touted his administration\u2019s executive accomplishments, including withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and advancing the Keystone XL pipeline. He pointed to efforts to reform the Veterans Affairs department and increase defense spending. Of the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, Trump said: \u201cDid you see what I did to that? Boom, gone.\u201d He pitched his next major legislative agenda item, tax reform, saying that it will be \u201cthe biggest tax cut\u201d and that he\u2019d rescind his endorsement if Strange didn\u2019t support it. The Alabama Senate primary marks the first time Trump is directly confronting his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who is aggressively supporting Moore while framing the primary as a chance to reject McConnell. Bannon has been rallying anti-establishment conservative donors and influencers and using the conservative news site Breitbart.com to attack Strange. But Strange used Bannon\u2019s support to poke at Moore at a debate on Thursday night. \u201cMany of the people who are supporting you look like the unemployment line at the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were fired.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Manafort is under investigation for possible tax and financial crimes Manafort has not been accused of any wrongdoing Special Counsel Robert Mueller has issued subpoenas to a former lawyer for Paul Manafort and to Manafort\u2019s current spokesman, an aggressive tactic that suggests an effort to add pressure on the former Trump campaign chairman. The subpoenas seeking documents and testimony were sent to Melissa Laurenza, an attorney with the Akin Gump law firm who until recently represented Manafort, and to Jason Maloni, who is Manafort\u2019s spokesman, according to people familiar with the matter. Manafort is under investigation for possible tax and financial crimes, according to US officials briefed on the investigation. The allegations under investigation largely center on Manafort\u2019s work for the former ruling party in Ukraine, which was ousted amid street protests over its pro-Russian policies. Exclusive: How a request about Russians made its way from West Virginia to Trump's team It\u2019s unclear what specific information the Mueller investigators believe Laurenza and Maloni may have. But issuing subpoenas to a lawyer of someone under investigation is unusual, in part because it raises potential attorney-client privilege issues that prosecutors tend to try to avoid. Maloni, as a public relations representative, doesn\u2019t have the same attorney-client privilege protections. Subpoenas have not been sent to WilmerHale, Manafort\u2019s other most recent lawyers. WilmerHale is the law firm where Mueller worked before being appointed special counsel. Manafort has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Maloni declined to comment. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Laurenza referred questions to a spokesman who didn\u2019t immediately comment. Trump attorney reached out to Kremlin to pursue Moscow Trump Tower project The subpoenas are among dozens that the Mueller investigative team has sent out in recent months since taking over the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The Manafort investigation has been ongoing for years and as recently as last summer appeared to be stagnated. At the time, Justice Department officials had come to believe there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to pursue charges, as CNN has previously reported. The probe has taken on new life since the beginning of this year, and appears to be taking an aggressive turn under the Mueller investigators. Andrew Weissmann, who is one of the senior lawyers overseeing the investigation, is known for aggressive tactics. Last month, the Mueller team ordered a dawn raid on Manafort\u2019s home in Washington\u2019s Virginia suburbs, as Manafort slept in his bedroom. The financial documents retrieved were largely ones Manafort had already turned over to congressional investigators. Manafort is now represented by Kevin Downing, a Washington lawyer and former Justice Department prosecutor who specializes in tax issues.",

            "article_content": "Roy Moore and Luther Strange will now face off in a September 26 runoff Strange, previously Alabama's attorney general, filled the seat in February President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s money carried their preferred candidate over the first hurdle in Alabama\u2019s Senate race Tuesday. But the results showed why the second hurdle will be much tougher to clear. Sen. Luther Strange, the national Republicans\u2019 preferred candidate, topped Rep. Mo Brooks to finish second Tuesday and advance to a runoff against controversial former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore. But Moore was the clear first-place finisher, earning 39% of the vote, compared to 31% for Strange and 19% for Brooks, with 95% of precincts\u2019 results tallied. Moore and Strange will now face off in a September 26 runoff to determine who will face Doug Jones \u2013 who cruised through Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary \u2013 in the December special election to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 former seat. Strange, previously Alabama\u2019s attorney general, was appointed to fill the seat in February by former Gov. Robert Bentley. That Strange\u2019s office was investigating Bentley, who resigned amid a sex scandal shortly after appointing Strange, provided fodder for Moore and Brooks to question the propriety of his selection. Strange\u2019s competitors also bashed him over McConnell\u2019s support \u2013 and the millions in television advertising from McConnell-aligned groups, the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, poured into the race. They also seized on a split between Trump and McConnell over health care \u2013 with Trump bashing the powerful Senate majority leader on Twitter for failing to shepherd the GOP\u2019s effort to repeal and replace Obamacare through the chamber. At his election night party in Montgomery, Moore said he would \u201cdefeat this Washington elitist crowd out of Washington.\u201d He said the efforts of \u201cthe silk-stocking Washington elitists to control the vote of the people of Alabama have failed.\u201d And then he took square aim at McConnell. He said he wanted the other primary contenders \u201cto join with me to defeat the Washington crowd, led by Mitch McConnell, who attempted to defy the vote of the people of Alabama\u201d by spending millions on TV ads bashing Moore and Brooks. Moore predicted that \u201cthe most negative campaign ads in the history of Alabama\u201d will be aired against him by pro-Strange groups, and said it\u2019s up to voters to reject them. \u201cWill they choose a voice for Alabama or a voice for the Washington elite? It\u2019s very clear,\u201d he said. Moore also offered a glimpse of his religious-themed rhetoric at his party Monday, where, unlike most election night events, no alcohol was served. \u201cWe need to go back to the recognition that God\u2019s hand is still on this country and on this campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must be good again before we can be great. And we will never be good without God.\u201d On the campaign trail, Strange is sticking close to Trump \u2013 not McConnell. \u201cThe President\u2019s endorsement says it all,\u201d Strange told CNN. \u201cThe people of Alabama want someone who will support the President\u2019s agenda. That\u2019s what I\u2019m running on, and for him to say he wants me in Washington as a partner is a critical factor.\u201d And in congratulating him for advancing to the runoff, both the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC and the NRSC emphasized his support from Trump. \u201cWe are proud to have strongly supported President Trump\u2019s No. 1 ally in this race, and we believe the President\u2019s support will be decisive as we head into the next phase of this campaign, which Sen. Strange will win in September,\u201d said Steven Law, the former McConnell chief of staff and Senate Leadership Fund president. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pick for Senate successfully advanced to the run-off election, and we are confident he will be elected to remain in the Senate come December,\u201d said Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, the NRSC chairman for the 2018 election cycle. If Moore wins the September runoff, his history of controversial stands in favor of his understanding of Christianity and its role in public life could become a major headache for Senate Republicans. Moore is known for being stripped of his Supreme Court seat in 2003 for refusing to take down a monument of the Ten Commandments. He was elected Alabama\u2019s chief justice again in 2013, but suspended in 2016 for refusing to enforce the US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. He also in 2006 argued in an op-ed that Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, should not be in Congress because he is Muslim. His hard-line views on social issues were on display Monday night: Moore said the military needs to train \u201cto fight wars, not for social experiments and transgenderism and feel-good stuff that\u2019s going on.\u201d He also said that by failing to keep loaded guns at home, \u201cyou\u2019re not doing what God would have you do and protecting your children.\u201d At one point, Moore reached into his briefcase and pulled out laminated pages from Joseph Story\u2019s 1833 \u201cCommentaries on the Constitution\u201d and began reading from them to Vox.com reporter Jeff Stein. \u201cIt was the general, if not the universal, sentiment in America that Christianity ought to be favored by the state,\u2019\u201d Moore said, reading from the laminated pages. His comments came at an open carry gun rights group\u2019s meeting at Mr. Wang\u2019s Restaurant in Homewood on Monday night. While there, Moore complained to the crowd of \u201cforces coming in from the north here and trying to buy your vote\u201d \u2013 a clear reference to ads from groups affiliated with McConnell. Speaking to reporters after the event, Moore wouldn\u2019t commit to supporting McConnell as Senate majority leader. \u201cI don\u2019t even know Mitch McConnell. I know what he\u2019s done, and I don\u2019t favor Mitch McConnell,\u201d Moore said. \u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t think I would support Mitch McConnell. I\u2019ve seen him do some very negative advertising \u2013 false advertising; attacks on candidates, myself included,\u201d he said, referring to spots aired by the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC. In fact, the only time Moore seemed to take issue with Trump is over his endorsement of Strange. He noted that Trump and McConnell are \u201cfeuding\u201d \u2013 a reference to Trump\u2019s criticism of the Kentucky senator on Twitter over the Senate\u2019s failure to repeal Obamacare \u2013 and called Trump\u2019s endorsement a \u201cbad decision.\u201d After Moore spoke, Bruce Wade, who leads the Bama Carry group, bashed McConnell-aligned groups\u2019 spending on the race, saying, \u201cthink what that money could have done for all the homeless veterans.\u201d \u201cAlabama voters are a lot smarter than they give us credit for,\u201d Wade said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t appreciate them telling us how to vote.\u201d",

Trump\u2019s nomination of Clovis, a fervent supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign, has drawn criticism from Senate Democrats and climate activists, who have attacked his lack of scientific credentials and skepticism of climate science. Clovis is currently serving as the senior White House adviser to the USDA, but as his old blog posts highlight, his background is strongly rooted in the politics of conservative talk radio. His nomination requires Senate confirmation. Clovis did not respond to an email from CNN\u2019s KFile requesting comment. A spokesperson for the USDA said, \u201cDr. Clovis is a proud conservative and a proud American. All of his reporting either on the air or in writing over the course of his career has been based on solid research and data. He is after all an academic.\u201d A spokesperson for the White House did not return a request for comment. In his writings, Clovis directed most of his ire at then-President Obama and the progressive movement. In a post from September 2011, Clovis wrote in reference to Obama, \u201cHe was brought up by socialists to be a socialist.  His associations were socialists or worse, criminal dissidents who were bent on overthrowing the government of the United States. He has no experience at anything other than race baiting and race trading as a community organizer.\u201d The month before, Clovis said the 2012 Republican primary candidates needed to call out progressives for what they were \u2014 \u201cliars, race traders and race \u2018traitors.\u2019\u201d At times, Clovis adopted a conspiratorial tone in his blog postings, openly pondering whether the Obama Administration would place conservative activists on a kill list that included terrorists like Anwar al-Awlaki and accusing Obama-era czars of using taxpayer money to buy the support of academics who would claim science was settled. In one blog post in April 2011, Clovis contrasted the successful recovery efforts following the 2008 floods in Iowa with the chaos in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, attributing the difference to Iowa\u2019s culture \u201cfocused on family, community and the primacy of faith in life.\u201d Clovis wrote in September 2011 that then-President Obama had \u201cno experience at anything other than race baiting and race trading as a community organizer.\u201d \u201cThe president, like the rest of us, is clearly a product of his upbringing, his associates, his education and his experience,\u201d wrote Clovis. \u201cHe was brought up by socialists to be a socialist.  His associations were socialists or worse, criminal dissidents who were bent on overthrowing the government of the United States. He has no experience at anything other than race baiting and race trading as a community organizer. He has never run anything.  Finally, his education at some of the best colleges in America was deeply influenced by socialists or worse on those campuses. He supposedly earned degrees in political science and law, but his actions reflect a shallow education and chronic underachievement in nearly every thing he has done.\u201d In August 2011, Clovis wrote progressives were \u201cliars, race traders, and race \u2018traitors.\u2019\u201d \u201cMy caller was most concerned about the fact that our candidates seem to be afraid of taking on the race baiting,\u201d Clovis wrote. \u201cI could not agree more.  The current crop of candidates need to get that titanium spine we keep hearing about and call out the progressives for what they are \u2013 liars, race traders and race \u2018traitors.\u2019\u201d In the same blog post, Clovis said Democrats were attempting to keep minorities \u201censlaved\u201d to the government. He said progressives wanted to eliminate people of color from America but saw government enslavement as a second option. \u201cWe can go back 100 years and trace how the progressives, socialists and fellow travelers have done everything possible to keep minorities in this country enslaved to government.  This is particularly true in the African-American community.  The progressives have systematically attacked the individual, the black family unit, the black female and the black male to essentially eliminate people of color from the American landscape.  Because elimination has become impractical, subservience to government is an acceptable second option. In June 2011, Clovis wrote that civil rights icon W. E. B. Du Bois was \u201cthe first race-trader\u201d for getting southern blacks to support Woodrow Wilson for President. (DuBois supported Wilson during the 1912 election, but later broke with him during his presidency.) \u201cAfter the Civil War, African-Americans voted almost en masse for Republicans,\u201d wrote Clovis. \u201cThat all changed in the election of 1912 when first term governor Woodrow Wilson was able to convince WEB(sic) DeBois to back his candidacy. That year, 60% of eligible African-Americans voted for Wilson. This loss of a small but homogeneous voting block to the other side hurt the Republicans and would continue to hurt them until the present day.  DeBois was the first race-trader and did a magnificent job of convincing his fellow blacks to back a southern racist for president.  What ever was the deal that would allow someone of DeBois\u2019s stature to side with such an incredibly flawed individual?  To this day, I have not been able to find adequate scholarly work to explain this remarkable shift in allegiance.  Wilson was a progressive and a racist.  In my books, the two were, are, and will remain, synonomous(sic).\u201d Clovis said the minority community would some day \u201cwake up\u201d to their enslavement. \u201cLike putting the frog in the pot then turning up the heat, minorities have been enslaved by government operatives who care nothing for the nation and everything for power,\u201d wrote Clovis. \u201cSomeday, men and women of color will wake up to the incredible deception that has been visited on their communities.  Someday, these wonderful, courageous Americans will rebuff collective dependency and will embrace individual accountability and the covenant we find in our Constitution. In other blog posts, Clovis repeatedly argued that progressives were attempting to enslave citizens to the government. \u201cThey want power for an elite group of individuals who want to perfect man through constant social engineering,\u201d Clovis wrote in July 2011. \u201cThese same people want to enslave people in a way of life that drains the very heart out of an individual, destroys the family, dismantles the efficacy of religion in our lives and destroys the fabric that holds our communities together.  Through radical egalitarianism, progressives will take from those who produce and will give to those who will not\u2013in turn enslaving both.  There is nothing moral about slavery, and progressives want just that\u2013total dependence on the state.\u201d Clovis pushed this sentiment repeatedly. Clovis also expressed a deep disdain for former President Obama, who he said hated American greatness and had an \u201canti-American mentality.\u201d \u201cThese must be desparate (sic) times for the president as he seems to be recognizing that perhaps there are people out here who do not like his policies and have really stopped liking him as a person,\u201d Clovis wrote in September 2011. \u201cHe is clearly a progressive socialist who hates the greatness of this nation and is doing all he can to make permanent changes in the structure of the country before he leaves office.\u201d \u201cThe President, as Chief Executive, is responsible for this the lawlessness of his administration,\u201d wrote Clovis in a May 2011 blog post. \u201cWhat is perhaps most troubling is that the president clearly has disdain for the American people, American exceptionalism and the Constitution of this great nation.  He is a threat to our domestic tranquility and must be voted out of office at the earliest opportunity.\u201d In multiple posts in January 2012, Clovis refers to President Obama as \u201ca Maoist\u201d and \u201canti-colonist.\u201d \u201cBarack Obama is inherently dishonest, a pathological liar and a person who has surrounded himself with sycophantic, co-dependent people who are more clearly identified by their association with him than by their own accomplishments,\u201d wrote Clovis. \u201cHe is a Maoist, anti-colonialist who is also a pathological narcissist.  This is a very dangerous combination.\u201d He wrote a week later, \u201cWe need to make sure we have done everything we can to beat Barack Hussein Obama and his progressive, Maoist, anti-colonialist followers.\u201d Clovis wrote in May 2011 that unions came out of the \u201cCommunist closet\u201d to support socialist \u201cBarack Hussein Obama\u201d and wanted to seize the means of production. \u201cThough it comes as no surprise, headlines today reveal that the National Education Association, the largest union in the United States, public or private, has asked its rank and file to support the re-election of Barack Obama.  Similarly, the Service Employees International Union came out of the communist closet over the weekend, letting the world know that they are fellow travelers in pursuit of seizing the means of production and irradicating(sic) personal property rights in our market system.  When one examines the reach of unions in America, one is startled to find out that some 15 million foot soldiers stand ready to march into battle for the socialist we now know is Barack Hussein Obama.\u201d Clovis speculated in an October 2011 post that the US might start putting pro-life, small government activists on the same terrorist kill list as Anwar al-Awlaki. \u201cOver the past three days on my radio show, we have been having a great discussion of the policies and consequences of the administration\u2019s latest actions in assassinating Anwar Al Awlaki.  Along with Al Awlaki, Samir Khan, an American citizen as well, died in the Predator attack that killed Al Awlaki while he was in Yemen.  What is not at issue is that Al Awlaki was a despicable human being who was bent on carrying out his jihad against America.  He was likely the individual behind the underwear bomber and the Fort Hood shootings.  Was he bad?  No Question.  However, he was an American citizen and he should have been extended his Constitutional protections.  What is frightening is that a panel of mid-level bureaucrats is determining who gets killed and who doesn\u2019t.  Are you comfortable with that?  I am not, particularly when this administration wants to Mirandize enemy combatants on the battlefield and wants to try foreign-born, non-citizen terrorists in federal court with all the protections of our most sacred civil document.  What am I missing here? This situation is not only indicative of being on a steep, slippery slope, but that we are sliding down this slope at breakneck speed.  We already have documentation that this administration thinks that returning veterans, pro-life advocates and small government advocates are all potential terrorists. This is written down in Department of Homeland Security policy documents.  Is it such a stretch to think that at some point that those who pose a threat to this administration might not move up the list generated by this secret panel? Possible? You bet. Probable? Who knows.\u201d Clovis accused Obama-era czar\u2019s of buying academic support to say subjects of legislation were \u201csettled science.\u201d \u201cAs we continue this discussion of the amorality of the progressive movement in the country, we must include discussion of how this administration has circumvented the law and the Constitution by establishing over 40 \u2018Czars\u2019 who have been charged with, among other things, ensuring support for administration positions by cooking the books,\u201d Clovis wrote in a June 2011 blog post. \u201cThe Czars are suspected of using taxpayer money to buy \u2018academic\u2019 support for controversial legislation.  By coordinating responses to issues, the administration can create the perception that what they are suggesting is \u201cmainstream\u201d or \u201csettled science\u201d or \u201csupported by rigorous studies.\u201d  Of course, none of what is being advanced is even close to what is mainstream, settled or otherwise researched.  By cooking the books and using taxpayer money to do it, this administration is conducting a nefarious, sinister propaganda campaign against the citizens they have sworn to protect.  One can do a lot of things in politics, but deceiving the American people is not one of them.  When the whole story of this is finally revealed, officials of this administration ought to be in jail.\u201d Clovis wrote in April 2011 that a difference in culture is why people of Iowa reacted better to natural disasters than the people who faced Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. \u201cMapleton suffered the worst of the damage,\u201d Clovis wrote. \u201cA large part of the town of 1200 was devastated by a F3 tornado that blew through about 7:30 pm.  The little town was shut down by law enforcement until around 2:30 in the morning so that power lines could be restored and gas lines could be secured.  By sunrise on Sunday morning, much of the situation had been contained and folks were already moving out into the little town to start the clean up.  By the time the governor showed up\u2013before noon\u2013the streets were clear and people were out in force cleaning yards and policing up the debris around town.  The power is back on but the gas lines will take a week or so to repair.  Not to worry, this is Iowa. This type of resilience is so typical of this part of the country.  From Texas to North Dakota and across the western part of the Midwest, the culture of this society is focused on family, community and the primacy of faith in life.  Each episode like this seems to end the same way\u2013neighbors helping neighbors get back to life as close to normal as possible.  Thus, the difference in the reaction of the people in Iowa to the floods of 2008 to that of the nation during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Dean Heller becomes the fifth Republican senator to say he won't back a health care bill GOP Senate leader can only lose two members of their 52-senator caucus Dean Heller on Friday became the latest Senate Republican to say he opposes the current GOP health care bill. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not the answer,\u201d the Nevada Republican said at a news conference alongside Gov. Brian Sandoval in Las Vegas. \u201cAnd I\u2019m announcing today that in this form, I simply will not support it.\u201d Almost immediately, the pro-Trump group America First Policies decided to launch what a source with the group says will be a major television, radio and digital ad buy against Heller \u2013 a remarkable attack on a member of Trump\u2019s own party whose seat is endangered in 2018. It was not immediately clear whether the group intends to back a primary challenger to Heller. Heller, like four other GOP senators who announced their opposition to the Obamacare repeal bill that was unveiled Thursday, left the door open to negotiations. But he said \u201cit\u2019s going to be very difficult to get me to a \u2018yes\u2019\u201d on the bill. GOP Senate leaders can only lose two members of their 52-senator caucus in support of the bill in order for it to pass. Heller said he spoke with Senate Republican leaders and Vice President Mike Pence on Friday morning. RELATED: Here\u2019s where Republican senators stand on the health care bill Heller said it is a \u201clie\u201d that the Senate Republican health care bill would lower premiums. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything in this bill that would lower premiums,\u201d he said. Heller, a Republican who is up for re-election in 2018, is the Democrats\u2019 top target in the upcoming cycle. Already, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is preparing to challenge him. He said the changes he is seeking to the bill would go in the opposite direction of those sought by other current \u201cno\u201d votes \u2013 conservative hard-liners including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee. Sandoval, a Republican who decided to opt into expanding Medicaid, said 210,000 received health coverage because of the decision. He said the state\u2019s uninsured rate declined from 23% before the Affordable Care Act to 11 or 12% afterward. Senate GOP finally unveils secret health care bill; currently lacks votes to pass Sandoval specifically pointed to people who were making a little more than $16,000 per year. \u201cThese are our friends, these are our families, and these are our neighbors. \u2026 They are living healthier and happier lives because of that decision \u2013 I don\u2019 think that can be overstated enough.\u201d Sandoval said he would do \u201ceverything in my power\u201d to make sure those people can maintain the quality of life they currently have. He thanked Heller for working \u201chand in hand\u201d with him. Sandoval also asked if it\u2019s \u201creally realistic\u201d for people earning $16,000 per year to buy insurance on the exchange if they lose Medicaid eligibility. He pulled out the Senate Republican bill. \u201cThere\u2019s still an opportunity to make this bill better,\u201d he said. This story has been updated. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Trump's 71st birthday was on June 14 Our #TBT series is looking back at presidential birthdays Of all the men who have served as President, it seems unlikely that any of them loved birthdays more than former President George W. Bush. To mark President Donald Trump\u2019s June birthday, our #TBT series has been highlighting other moments from previous presidential birthdays. The only way to appreciate the full scope of Bush\u2019s love of birthdays is to look at several case studies. In the CNN Politics Instagram post above, you can see photos of Bush celebrating before and during his presidency. George W. Bush was born on July 6, 1946. (Someone has a birthday coming up!) Bush clearly learned to love birthdays from an absolute pro. His father, former President George H.W. Bush, went skydiving to mark his 75th, 80th, 85th and 90th birthdays. In the first photo above, you can see then-President Bush blowing out candles on a simple cake on his 60th birthday during a visit to Chicago. The main thing that stands out about this image is the President\u2019s form. Look at how prepared he is to make a wish and blow out all of the candles in one breath! Clearly six decades will teach you a thing or two about how to approach a birthday cake. Bush\u2019s love of birthdays extends beyond his own big day. In the second photo, you can see the President licking icing off his fingers after presenting Sen. John McCain with a birthday cake for the senator\u2019s 69th birthday in 2005. Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s 61st birthday was also an occasion for someone to have their cake while Bush ate it, too. Everyone else in the photo is smiling and posing while Bush 43 digs into a piece of cake, living his best life. Growing up, the birthday kid always got the first piece. In Washington, that honor goes to the President. The Presidents Bush are not the only ones in their family who enjoy a birthday celebration. Days before the 2000 election, then-candidate George W. Bush celebrated his wife Laura\u2019s 54th birthday onboard his campaign airplane. Any guesses as to what she may have wished for that year? Former President George W. Bush will celebrate his 71st birthday this year. And whether it\u2019s on a tarmac, an airplane, on the road or at the office, he has shown us that birthdays are worth celebrating no matter where you are.",

            "article_content": "Asking \"what comes next\" as it pertains to his 2020 plans is a nonstarter with Sanders There is now, in effect, a campaign-in-waiting on the left The waves of howling applause and standing ovations rolled in at the appointed times, the lines that stirred the faithful in 2016 as potent at the outset of the Trump era as during a grueling Democratic primary contest that saw Sen. Bernie Sanders finish as its defiant runner-up. This was Saturday night in Chicago, at the People\u2019s Summit, and as Sanders addressed loyalists from around the country, rows of diehard supporters, many wearing red, chanted and waved placards with at least one banner declaring an intention to \u201cDraft Bernie.\u201d Asking \u201cwhat comes next\u201d as it pertains to his 2020 plans is a nonstarter with the Vermont independent. The future, as organizers here are quick to argue, is happening now. Coalition-building on the left, fighting to take hold and remake a party Sanders has pointedly refused to formally join, and strategizing ahead of the 2018 midterms are, truly, the work of the day. Projecting out four years is a stickier wicket, one Sanders has assiduously avoided discussing in any meaningful way. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit early to be talking about 2020,\u201d a spokesman told CNN over email. \u201cHis focus right now is on defeating Trump\u2019s disastrous agenda, to defeat the Republican health care bill that would take health care away from 23 million people and on advancing a progressive agenda to help working families across the country.\u201d Sanders might not enjoy the constant queries, but they are not going away, and not simply because nosy narrative merchants in the mainstream media cannot abide \u2013 or sell readers on \u2013 the nuances of movement politics. Sanders\u2019 plans are important, as many activists here readily concede, for reasons they learned the hard way, as his campaign became increasingly hamstrung by the limits of its insurgency. For most here, though, falling short in 2016 was only a first step. Sanders to faithful: Take down Trump, take over Democratic Party \u201cAbsolutely, he should run again,\u201d said freshman California Rep. Ro Khanna, who unseated a fellow Democrat, eight-term congressman Mike Honda, last year. \u201cIf you look at from the perspective of anyone in the past, if they come that close to the nomination, they\u2019d almost be the de facto nominee the next time. I don\u2019t think he should be anointed \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t make the mistake of 2016 again \u2013 but absolutely he should run.\u201d Khanna made the political case: Sanders, he said, has the vision, the stamina and \u201ctrust at a time when people don\u2019t trust anyone in politics\u201d \u2013 but also zeroed in on more pragmatic concerns. \u201cOne of the advantages he would have this time is he\u2019ll have an infrastructure, (the support of) more elected officials and the apparatus to be strong,\u201d Khanna said. Among the loyalists at the People\u2019s Summit, a three-day convention organized by National Nurses United, the most active and vocal pro-Sanders union, there is broad support for another presidential run. And while most would prefer he again fight for the Democratic Party nomination, others are itching for an independent campaign. The \u201cDraft Bernie\u201d group wants Sanders to break away from the Democrats and form a \u201cPeople\u2019s Party,\u201d which he would use to launch either his own 2020 bid or as a platform to lift up another progressive national candidate. 1 of many ways https://t.co/L4oqgyI1gf left mark at #PPLSummit Safe to say attendees, ppl who tuned in, & establishment know about us now :) pic.twitter.com/iYHv51ZdsH Maria Svart, national director of the Democratic Socialists of America, told CNN the organization would support Sanders if chose to run, but wasn\u2019t holding its breath waiting for an announcement. She also spoke about the importance of not leaving the decision until too late. \u201cHe needs to build capacity now and build the ground team,\u201d Svart said. \u201cHe needs to make a plan, to do what he didn\u2019t have time to do last time around, which is absolutely necessary this time around.\u201d Unlike in 2015, when Sanders entered the race and began to draw raucous crowds, and 2016, when his suddenly formidable challenge to Hillary Clinton finally faltered, there is now, in effect, a campaign-in-waiting on the left. Sanders\u2019 own \u201cOur Revolution\u201d is a formidable political organization, if for no other reason than its vaunted email list. And an increasingly activated and savvy progressive movement would flock to do the grassroots work most candidates would struggle to match. Still, Jane Sanders is, like her husband, plainly annoyed by the speculation. Kirsten Gillibrand drops f-bomb during speech on democracy \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the wrong question,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer last November, days after Trump defeated Clinton. \u201cNobody cares (about Sanders\u2019 2020 plans) except the political pundits. He is not \u2013 he\u2019s concerned about 2017.\u201d Six months later, the realities of the presidential campaign life cycle are beginning to demand a more nuanced response. Sanders\u2019 silence on the matter could eventually put off other potential candidates, allies who might not enter if the godfather of the \u201cBerniecrat\u201d movement was lurking on the sidelines. \u201cI would say that we intend to play a role in the 2020 election,\u201d Sanders told CNN during a brief interview on Saturday, adding with a rare fatalist note: \u201cWhat that is remains to be decided, but nobody should step back. They should be completely engaged now and the leadership will rise. It will emerge.\u201d Nina Turner, the former Ohio state senator now being pushed by progressive groups there to run for governor next year, was less circumspect. Jeff Merkley isn't on the 2020 radar -- and that might be part of the plan \u201cI want him to continue to do the work of building a people\u2019s movement that is bigger than him,\u201d she said, the added with a knowing smile, \u201cAnd then secondly, yes, I want him to run for president in 2020. Why not?\u201d Of 2016, Turner said, Sanders simply \u201cneeded more time\u201d to match Clinton\u2019s organization and reach out to voters. But there is another clock that might be working against Sanders. Even among devoted supporters here, his age \u2013 Sanders will be 78 when 2020 contests begin \u2013 is a prevailing area of concern. \u201cI like the idea of him running for president because I think he would do a good job, I just don\u2019t think that most of the public will believe that he has the strength and endurance to make it another eight years, let alone four, as president,\u201d said Ben Klahn, who organized for Sanders in Michigan. Klahn recalled a friend telling him recently that she hoped Sanders would \u201cchoose someone who really represents him and his ideals and what he stands for and sort of anointing them and having them carry on the movement. To take it from his hands and run with it.\u201d Like who? \u201cOh god, I have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cNo idea.\u201d The world is behind you @BernieSanders!  #PPLSUMMIT pic.twitter.com/8zkfJ1Qteb Sanders might consider the Democratic Party a mess \u2013 he described its \u201ccurrent model and the current strategy\u201d as an \u201cabsolute failure\u201d in a rip-roaring speech Saturday night. But the state of his own movement, though humming along at the grassroots level with a coherence unusual for the left, suffers from at least one very familiar problem: the lack of a bench at the highest echelons. Were Sanders to stand down, progressives would be met not just with a lack of consensus on who to back in 2020, but few easily named options. Where the liberal center of the party has ambitious elected officials in the mix like Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California, to name a few, the progressive field is quieter. Were she to run, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has made inroads with the party establishment, has the bona fides to woo the left, but her decision to endorse Clinton over Sanders is still painful for activists who expected her support. People for Bernie Sanders co-founder Winnie Wong, one of the lead organizers in Chicago, compared the state of play among progressives with the moderate liberal wing of the party, embodied by the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank run by longtime Clinton ally Neera Tanden. 2020 Vision: Biden's family is serious; Harris stays focused on Trump; Franken cancels on Maher \u201cCAP has a slate of people that they think maybe will become their candidate,\u201d Wong said. \u201cWe do not.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a general consensus among all these groups here that there isn\u2019t a single candidate that we are uniting behind,\u201d she added, \u201cbut we would obviously unite behind and organize up behind Bernie.\u201d If they get the chance.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook or subscribe to his email newsletter. Will he or won\u2019t he? That\u2019s the question every policy wonk who cares about climate change has been asking since election night in November. With the he, of course, being Donald Trump. And the topic being the Paris Agreement on climate change \u2013 and whether the US President plans to bail. For weeks, Trump and his administration have been taunting the media and global leaders with possible deadlines \u2013 which then are retracted \u2013 and with meetings of senior Cabinet officials, which have been postponed. First, the decision was going to come before the G7 meeting in Europe. Then, on Saturday, Trump tweeted during that meeting that he will make his \u201cfinal decision\u201d on this all-important climate accord \u201cnext week!\u201d (Punctuation his). This eternal back-and-forth prompted John Upton, a writer at Climate Central, to say Trump is drawing all of us into his \u201cgame show.\u201d Narrative tension, set. Tune in for the showcase showdown \u2013 except instead of cash or cars the question here is whether the all-important Paris Agreement will survive and, consequently, whether the planet is likely screwed. It's a game show. https://t.co/UkUMz67gsh Of course, it\u2019s not new for the reality TV host-turned-president to be critiqued for using cliffhanger TV production techniques to keep the American public craving new episodes in his presidency. But it\u2019s worth stepping back for just a moment to remember exactly how much is at stake in what Trump calls his forthcoming \u201cfinal decision\u201d on this matter. I don\u2019t want to sound alarmist, but there is simply no overstating the stakes here: The Paris Agreement is critical to the survival of life on Earth as we know it. Humans are pumping massive amounts of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, primarily by burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation, and by relying on high-pollution agricultural practices. (Want to lower your carbon footprint? Eat less beef and lamb.) All of these activities are warming up the atmosphere and oceans, and the consequences of inaction are unthinkably steep. Rising seas could drown low-lying island nations and flood cities from New York to Shanghai. Scientists expect runaway warming would help bring about a mass-extinction event in which three-quarters of all species could be lost in coming centuries. And warming creates deadlier heat waves, more intense drought and so on. It\u2019s bad-bad. Really. The Paris Agreement isn\u2019t enough on its own to stop all of that, but it is our best shot at moving in the right direction. The accord was adopted by 195 countries in December 2015 and has been signed or ratified by 147 of them, including the United States, according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Decades in the making, the Paris Agreement is seen by policy experts as the \u201cnorth star\u201d for climate progress. It sets the important goal of limiting warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius. And it calls, essentially, for an end to the damaging era of fossil fuels, hopefully by about midcentury or soon after. Two weeks ago, I attended international negotiations about the Paris Agreement in Bonn, Germany. There was optimism in the air at that conference despite extreme lack of clarity \u2013 the will he or won\u2019t he? \u2013 from the Trump administration. The reasons for all the hope? Part of it is raw determination. People who know climate science also understand the urgency of this crisis \u2013 and that there\u2019s no time for waiting or idling. A host of countries \u2013 from China to Germany \u2013 have committed to stay with the Paris Agreement regardless of whether the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest annual polluter, dumps it. They\u2019re moving forward. The other reason for hope: A new report from Climate Action Tracker, a scientific analysis project of three research groups, says China and India \u2013 the top and third-biggest climate polluters, respectively \u2013 are doing much better at curbing pollution than expected. China\u2019s use of coal has flat-lined, and India is talking about a massive transition to electric cars. These changes, and others, many of which are linked to deadly air pollution in both countries, are expected to offset additional pollution created as a result of the Trump administration\u2019s pro-fossil fuel policies. The new data leave open the possibility that even if the United States withdraws from the Paris Agreement there is still the chance \u2013 and it\u2019s just a chance \u2013 the rest of the world could rally to meet the Paris goals. \u201cIn the long run the US has to be in the game and has to reduce emissions, otherwise we won\u2019t get to the Paris goals,\u201d Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist of Climate Analytics, a nonprofit that worked on the report, told me in Bonn. \u201cBut in the short run, it\u2019s not a catastrophe. \u201cIt\u2019s not insignificant, but it\u2019s not a catastrophe.\u201d \u201cNot a catastrophe\u201d is not a scenario anyone should be happy with, though. The reality remains: Each year, the United States does more than almost any other nation to pollute the atmosphere and warm the climate. Those carbon emissions \u2013 all emissions \u2013 matter at this point. Imagine reading this news from Shishmaref, Alaska, a community I visited in December that in 2016 voted to relocate because warming in the Arctic has been so dramatic it\u2019s causing the coast there to crumble. In denying climate science (97% of climate scientists agree the world is warming because of humans, according to peer-reviewed research and NASA) this US administration is going it alone on one of the most critical issues of our time. Like, alone-alone. Spicer-in-the-shrubbery alone. Even North Korea has a climate change plan. ExxonMobil urged Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. So have tons of other major US corporations, including Apple; 75 mayors; the Republican governors of Massachusetts and Vermont; and a whole bunch of colleges. Much has been made of the potential diplomatic fallout of Trump withdrawing from this accord. Those arguments are compelling but are less likely to convince American conservatives than this: The United States also risks being left out of a new and changing economy if it walks away from Paris. Clean energy is the future \u2013 corporations and governments are betting on it. Plus, it\u2019s the only viable future. By abandoning Paris, Trump would risk ceding international leadership to China, which appears ready to become (irony of ironies) the leading voice for climate action and clean energy policy. The United States also would be ceding de facto leadership in the future economy. Trump needs to recalibrate. Instead of only thinking about making America great again, he needs to ensure American can be great in a changing global economy. He can think America first and planet first simultaneously. Trump\u2019s decision on Paris is a choice between an existential crisis, including a burden on future generations, rising seas and mass extinction \u2013 and clean energy jobs here and now. The choice should be obvious. But which future will Trump choose? Tune in later this week.",

            "article_content": "The election that wouldn\u2019t end will, in fact, never end. America has two ex-candidates, the victorious Donald Trump and the vanquished Hillary Clinton who just can\u2019t let it lie. In a stunning interview Tuesday, Clinton, the former Democratic nominee, vented her still raw emotions and blazing bitterness over her defeat by Trump \u2013 pointing to Russia and FBI Chief James Comey as the key drivers of her loss. Clinton trolls Trump over 2016 popular vote Trump, for his part, rarely lets more than a few days go by without boasting about his outsider win. Then, remarkably for a victor, he disputes the result \u2013 claiming without evidence that millions of illegal voters handed Clinton a popular vote triumph. RELATED: Journalist: Trump brought Electoral map handouts of his wins to interview The prospect of regurgitating the most bitter election on record must horrify Americans who were forced to live through it for roughly two years. But given Clinton\u2019s public anger over her loss and Trump\u2019s unwillingness to move on, a long-range rhetorical rematch is inevitable, especially since Clinton has a book coming in the fall. The President is extraordinarily touchy about the merest suggestion that his victory is not totally authentic. Clinton has now given her supporters, many of whom believe she was cheated out of breaking the highest, hardest glass ceiling in politics, even more reasons to view Trump as illegitimate. And the President is unlikely to take a pass at Clinton\u2019s unflattering description of his performance, including her renewal of her claim that he was unprepared for office. He\u2019s already taken to Twitter to respond to Clinton\u2019s claims. \u201cFBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?\u201d FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony... ...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign? Trump's entire speech on 100th day Clinton\u2019s interview was so interesting because it was so unusual. She was unplugged, candid and unvarnished, ditching the cautious, stilted political speak that has constrained her public persona for decades, seemingly now at a point of her life where she does not care what people think. It was a side of Clinton that friends know well but has not often been much in evidence in her public life, as she has fought claims she is inauthentic and calculating. \u201cIf the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,\u201d Clinton said, thrusting herself back into the public spotlight before an audience watching the interview conducted by CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour at the Women for Women International summit in New York. \u201cI was on the way to winning until a combination of (FBI Director) Jim Comey\u2019s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off,\u201d she said. \u201cThe evidence for that intervening event is, I think, compelling, persuasive, and so we overcame a lot in the campaign,\u201d Clinton said, also adding that she believed misogyny played a role in her defeat. Clinton\u2019s comments were so visceral and politically electrifying that it seems impossible that Trump can resist returning fire. Fact-checking Trump's claims on voter fraud In fact, she seemed positively to be goading the President. \u201cIf he wants to tweet about me, then I am happy to be the diversion because we have a lot of things to worry about,\u201d Clinton told Amanpour. \u201cHe should worry less about the election and my winning the popular vote than doing some other things that would be important for the country.\u201d And in another jab, she suggested that if Trump launched a fusillade on Twitter, it would be \u201cbetter than interfering in foreign affairs.\u201d Trump has been struggling to assert his authority on Washington and appears to be pining for a genuine political foe that can become his foil. A knock-down, drag-out feud with Clinton \u2013 a political figure as polarizing as himself \u2013 could cheer his base and rally Republicans who are still cool to him who also deplore the former secretary of state. It might also prompt him to renew his charges that claims that Russia intervened in the election on his own behalf represent a plot framed by Democrats still chafing at Clinton\u2019s loss. While Clinton\u2019s remarks went further than she has before in taking responsibility for her defeat, they were somewhat characteristic in the selective way that she rationalized it. \u201cI take absolute personal responsibility. I was the candidate, I was the person who was on the ballot. I am very aware of the challenges, the problems, the shortfalls that we had,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cDid I make mistakes, oh my god, yes, you will read my confessions, my request for absolution. But the reason I believe we lost were the intervening events in the last 10 days.\u201d But blaming Comey for the loss appears to absolve Clinton of her campaign\u2019s failure to effectively counter Trump\u2019s electorally appealing message in industrialized Midwestern states that went red instead of their usual blue. The Clinton campaign and Democrats believe that the intervention of Comey 11 days before Election Day depressed turnout among swing voters and badly damaged Clinton. But on the other hand, Comey\u2019s comments were related to the investigation into the private email server that Clinton set up as secretary of state, in apparent infringement of government guidelines. It was that issue and her handling of it throughout the campaign that helped revive questions about the character and honesty of the Clintons that had remained largely dormant since former President Bill Clinton left office in 2001. Her performance did not impress some critics. \u201cShe does what she does, which is play lip-service to the things that she thinks she is supposed to say but you can tell very quickly she doesn\u2019t really mean it,\u201d said S.E. Cupp, a CNN conservative commentator. \u201cShe seems to be squarely blaming this on events around her.\u201d But Guy Cecil, who ran a pro-Clinton Super PAC last year, said on CNN after Clinton\u2019s speech that the former secretary of state was justified in her complaints. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to say you take responsibility while also acknowledging what is very clear, what independent analysts have shown over and over again\u2026 which was that the Russian WikiLeaks and Comey had had an impact on the election and were probably determinative.\u201d The former secretary of state\u2019s return to the spotlight on Tuesday will inevitably spark questions about whether she is considering a return to front-line politics. Her remarks equally appeared calculated to show that Clinton believes she has a voice and a rightful place in the political fray. But a confidant of Clinton told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny that \u201cshe is not running for anything \u2013 but she\u2019s just not hiding.\u201d And it\u2019s not clear that a revival of the Clinton wars will be welcomed by Democrats. Liberals and progressives are also still battling over the 2016 election, in this case the primary campaign won by Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders. The party also needs to be looking for a new generation of leaders as it prepares for mid-term elections in 2018 and an attempt to unseat Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Yet its familiar faces \u2013 Barack Obama, Sanders and now Clinton \u2013 who appear to be attracting the most attention so far \u2013 underlining its weak bench of up-and-comers ready for the big time.

            "article_content": "Republicans pulled Friday's expected vote That's despite White House attempts to woo votes President Donald Trump likes winning. But on Friday he failed. Lacking sufficient support, Republicans were forced to pull their bill to replace Obamacare from the floor of the GOP-controlled House. Speaking soon after accepting defeat, Trump didn\u2019t shoulder the responsibility himself, nor did he pin the blame on House GOP leadership or any of the warring Republican factions\u2019 whose competing demands ultimately sunk any chance of a consensus bill. Instead, he blamed Democrats and vowed to let Obamacare \u201cexplode.\u201d \u201cWe had no Democrat support. We had no votes from the Democrats. They weren\u2019t going to give us a single vote, so it\u2019s a very very difficult thing to do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think the losers are (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi and (Senate Minority Leader) Chuck Schumer because now they own Obamacare. 100% own it.\u201d The words flew in the face of Trump\u2019s intense and personal engagement in lobbying members of Congress to support the House bill, efforts the White House touted in recent days as they hinted at Trump\u2019s negotiating expertise. That tune changed on Friday after Trump\u2019s first legislative failure, when Trump dubbed himself a mere \u201cteam player.\u201d But while Trump publicly declined to level any criticism against House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2013 who Trump said \u201creally worked hard\u201d \u2013 or the House Freedom Caucus, which withheld support even after Trump made major changes to the bill in their favor, he and his advisers had begun the finger-pointing a day earlier. Standing on the precipice of a legislative failure likely to damage the political capital he will need to steer the priorities he truly cares about through Congress, Trump was \u201cpissed\u201d Thursday night, one source close to the President said, and so were his advisers. Blame fell everywhere but in the Oval Office. Trump card: White House plays its hand in health care battle Several senior administration officials on Thursday night began blaming a flawed strategy pushed by Ryan and former House member Tom Price, now Health and Human Services secretary, for the embarrassing debacle. It was a strategy Trump signed up for when top aides and Ryan presented him with the plan to make good on his Obamacare repeal campaign promise so he could swiftly move on to issues he is more passionate about and familiar with like tax reform and infrastructure spending. \u201cThis was all Ryan and Price,\u201d said one senior administration official. \u201cThey agreed upon this plan the day (Trump) hired Price.\u201d Nevertheless, Trump himself answered affirmatively when asked Friday morning if Ryan should stay on as speaker in the face of failure. A second senior administration official concurred while a third instead pinned the blame on the House Freedom Caucus, the group of hardline conservatives who have held out support for the bill, demanding a slew of 11th-hour changes that sent the House GOP jigsaw puzzle into disarray. Trump team ultimatum: No more talks, time to vote \u201cThere is a growing frustration in the White House over how the Freedom Caucus has handled the negotiations. The President has tried to address their concerns and they keep moving the goal posts,\u201d said a senior White House official. \u201cIf this bill goes down, I don\u2019t think the President is going to have any appetite to work with them.\u201d But a source close to Trump described the President as more frustrated with his staff for convincing him to back the House GOP leadership plan in the first place. Painting the President as a political neophyte who has only been in Washington for two months, the source said Trump has become \u201cfrustrated with his staff\u2019s inability to get this done\u201d and argued that Trump was misled by those staffers who urged him to tackle Obamacare head first and hitch himself to Ryan\u2019s plan. \u201cHe was talked into doing this bill first. It was not negotiated well on his behalf,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe\u2019s relied on his staff to give him good information and they haven\u2019t. And that\u2019s the problem.\u201d The source close to Trump described a president who felt bamboozled by Ryan and his own staff, duped into thinking that passing health care would be the quick victory he needed to make good on a campaign promise central to his election and push forward on other policy fronts. Trump is likely to blame Ryan and his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, the source said, since he \u201cbought\u201d into Ryan\u2019s plan and helped convince Trump to get on board, according to another senior administration official. Trump also blames staff for his own late personal engagement in lobbying members of Congress and the lack of presidential travel to key districts that would help flip votes rather than himself, one source said. But there is plenty of blame to go around, as all factions within the West Wing worked arduously to help craft and sell the bill. As Trump headed to Mar-a-Lago the first Friday of this month, both Priebus and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon stayed at the White House, working late into the night on tweaks to the bill, according to one senior administration official. The White House deployed its top conservatives to corral the House Freedom Caucus, with Bannon, counselor Kellyanne Conway and senior White House policy adviser Steven Miller joining Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s already longstanding engagement in the legislative push. And weeks after Trump pledged the full weight of his presidency and White House officials touted Trump\u2019s personal engagement in selling the bill, the President appears prepared to accept none of the blame if his gambit fails. In two rallies in the last two weeks, he barely talked about health care and failed to build a consensus among disparate Republican factions. Talked up as a \u201ccloser,\u201d the President who ascended to the presidency on the merits of his negotiating prowess only became intimately involved in the work of wooing and grappling with members of Congress to win their support in the last 10 days. By that point, Republican senators were becoming increasingly vocal in their objections to the bill while the House Freedom Caucus ramped up its calls for major changes that would unsettle the bill\u2019s delicate balance aimed at appealing to all factions of the GOP. Now, some Republicans have begun to direct at least some of the blame toward the Oval Office, arguing that Trump failed to follow through on his pledge to put sustained pressure on Republican members of Congress in order to pass the bill. For that, senior administration officials pinned the blame on the House speaker, who, along with his leadership team, crafted the bulk of the House bill months before Trump even took office. But as one senior administration official argued to CNN that hardline conservative members needed to pass the bill were not brought into the process until too late, Ryan\u2019s office quickly responded with prepared pushback. \u201cThe speaker and his staff have met with conservative members of our conference nearly every week as the bill has made its way through the four-committee process,\u201d a Ryan aide said in a statement. \u201cThe speaker maintains an open door policy for members in his office \u2026 He regularly texts with members, including (Rep. Mark) Meadows. The speaker\u2019s senior staff are always available, including our chief of staff.\u201d Still, more blame is likely to fall. One source wondered late Thursday night why Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and one of the most powerful West Wing forces, was away on a ski vacation with his wife, Ivanka Trump, while other White House staffers toiled away at an increasingly fraught mission. Trump, though, appeared to press for victory even Friday morning, making calls to House members despite the pre-emptive finger pointing from the White House. The President is \u201cdetermined\u201d to pass the bill, a senior administration official said. He also took to Twitter, making his final appeal to Republicans. After seven horrible years of ObamaCare (skyrocketing premiums & deductibles, bad healthcare), this is finally your chance for a great plan! The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan! \u201cAfter seven horrible years of ObamaCare (skyrocketing premiums & deductibles, bad healthcare), this is finally your chance for a great plan!\u201d he tweeted. Hoping to pressure conservatives, he added: \u201cThe irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Mark Preston contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge in Hawaii is making headlines after temporarily freezing President Donald Trump\u2019s revised ban on travelers from several Muslim-majority countries. In a 43-page ruling, US District Court Judge Derrick Watson issued a scathing rebuke just hours before Trump\u2019s revised travel ban was to go into effect Thursday. \u201cThe illogic of the government\u2019s contentions is palpable,\u201d he said of the ban, which would have temporarily barred travelers from six Muslim countries from entering the United States. Watson\u2019s ruling came after he heard Hawaii\u2019s case against the revised ban. The revised ban replaced the one Trump signed in January that was stopped by another federal judge. Here are five things to know about Watson: The former President nominated Watson five years ago to serve on the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. At the time of his nomination, Obama issued a blanket statement describing him and six other nominees to US District Courts as qualified and ready to serve. \u201cThese individuals have demonstrated the talent, expertise, and fair-mindedness Americans expect and deserve from their judicial system,\u201d Obama said at the time. The Senate unanimously confirmed Watson in a 94-to-0 vote. What you need to know about the travel ban Watson was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He graduated in 1991 from Harvard Law School. Prior to that, he attended Harvard College, graduating in 1988. When Watson was confirmed,  he was the fourth person of Native Hawaiian descent to serve as an Article III judge in the United States, according to the Congressional Asian Pacific Americans Caucus. \u201cToday, Judge Watson made history. I am confident he will serve Hawaii with distinction and honor. He has dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice and fairness in our legal system,\u201d Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said at the time. Article III judges serve on the US Supreme Court, the federal courts of appeals and district courts. A timeline of President Trump\u2019s travel bans Trump rails against court ruling blocking travel ban When it comes to the law, Watson is no rookie. Before becoming a judge at the US District Court, Watson was an assistant United States attorney in the District of Hawaii and Northern District of California. Before that, he was partner at a San Francisco law firm, where he focused on product liability and environmental cost recovery litigation. He also served as a US Army Reserve captain.

The views in this commentary are his own. Gary Shapiro: Some people show support for Trump, others show disdain for him, but no one is willing to listening to the other side's perspective We need to adopt a nuanced view that embraces the President's virtues and accepts his weaknesses One year into the Trump presidency, every commentator, journalist and Facebook friend seems to want support for their feelings toward the President, whether positive or negative. If you disagree, you are their enemy. They talk in their own echo chambers, watch their own affirming news channels and discuss current events with their like-minded friends. After a year of reckless divide and political turbulence, I have one wish: For everyone to get beyond the box-checking nature of politics, listen to each other and recognize we are bigger than our political views about the President. I did not vote for President Trump, but he was fairly elected under the Constitution and laws of our democracy. I love our nation and our democracy \u2013 and I supported the results of the election, even though my candidate didn\u2019t win. I believe the Russians tried to influence the election as the Chinese did years ago prior to the election of President Clinton. But, as Democratic pollster Mark Penn noted, the relatively minor resources spent by the Russians had no measurable impact on the results, and their work pales in comparison to the billions of dollars spent by the candidates. The results of last year\u2019s election were clear and incontestable. And President Trump is doing well by many measures we historically use to assess presidents. Employment in America has reached a high, unmatched during any of President Obama\u2019s eight years in office. The economy is strong. The stock market is up dramatically since the election. The President has established personal relationships with many major nations\u2019 leaders, including Canada, China and Poland. Randazza: Even Trump has a right to free speech Trump is unconventional. He has a different temperament than his recent predecessors. Consistency, care in choosing words, facts, a focus on national unity and even moral leadership are not Trump\u2019s core strengths. Trump is a New York fighter from the upper echelons of the real estate industry. American voters knew that when they voted for him. And they got exactly whom they elected \u2013 he has not changed much since his campaign days. Still, as President, Trump has done well. He forced a discussion in boardrooms about what ethical obligation a company has to its nation. He has, through the force of his message, created a focus on American jobs. Indeed, this year a record number of Americans were confident in the security of their jobs. He has also given many Americans who feel left behind hope and a voice. He has hired and surrounds himself with many excellent people. They are not naive ideologues but highly competent patriots, who recognize that they are serving their country, not just their President. Yet, it seems that most Americans are willfully blind to either Trump\u2019s strengths or to his weaknesses. Unemployment numbers not 'phony' to Trump anymore There needs to be a different, more complex view. All of us are nuanced. Generally, we mean well and want to do the right thing. But in reality, all of us, including President Trump, are neither perfectly good nor perfectly bad. With a nuanced perspective, we can stop demonizing those who don\u2019t share our view. I, for one, refrain from taking either side of the pro-Trump/anti-Trump debate. Why can\u2019t we simply refuse to be divided as a nation? Why can\u2019t we as a nation do as we do with our family members and accept that they will not always agree with us, but they\u2019re still part of who we are? Let\u2019s try to see his virtues as the President and embrace them. Let\u2019s accept his weaknesses and work around them. After a year of turmoil, let\u2019s shift our focus to areas where we agree. There are many. We all want a better life for our children. We all want a more prosperous nation. We want good jobs. We want better schools. We want our veterans and families to get the support they deserve. We want our nation to lead in innovation. We want our people to be healthy and have health care. We want our seniors to feel comfortable, secure and appreciated. We want every American child to have an opportunity to succeed.  We are blessed to live in an incredible nation \u2013 a model of  democracy. But our nation is relatively young; we don\u2019t share thousands of years of culture or a common religion, so we are easily torn apart on divisive social issues. What we do share, however, is something special \u2013 the gift of living in the greatest nation on Earth. We owe our children a better life \u2013 and we can start by refusing to hate and demonize each other.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. SE Cupp: Everyone should applaud the pick of Mueller for special counsel, but the adulation will likely be short-lived Cupp: Trump will try to rally base to push back; GOP will continue to defend Trump; and Dems will turn on Mueller if he doesn't bring down Trump The bombshell news on Wednesday that Robert Mueller will be a special counsel to lead an independent investigation of President Donald Trump, was met with giddy hoorays on the left and sighs of relief on the right. For their part, Democrats are smelling impeachment in the water, while Republicans are just glad the pressure\u2019s finally off them to \u201cdo something\u201d about Trump and his daily drag on the party. But putting partisan politics aside (yes, that\u2019s a thing), the real winners here are the American people. A very anxious citizenry, both pro- and anti-Trump, deserves answers and accountability. Faith in our institutions is at an all-time low, and whatever Mueller finds has the real possibility of restoring some of that faith. And, just think about the sixth-grade civics class that gets a front-row seat to democracy in action. But while everyone can and should applaud this development, the good times are likely short-lived. Here are the five things to watch for: Trump will not go quietly into that good night. While any sentient primate facing a special counsel would know to lay off social media and refrain from antagonizing his investigators, Trump sees things differently. He\u2019s already tweeted that \u201cthis is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!\u201d And he\u2019s complained that \u201cthere was never a special councel (sic) appointed\u201d for Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. Graham: Russia probe seems to be criminal This might be an ominous play \u2013 if Trump knows the investigation will likely dig up some pretty rotten-smelling dirt, he may have decided the only court he can win in is that of public opinion, specifically his public. And they just love his tweets. Democrats will definitely overplay this. Mueller\u2019s investigation can literally go anywhere. He can subpoena Trump\u2019s tax returns, old \u201cApprentice\u201d outtakes, even Trump\u2019s fourth-grade report card, if he thinks it will reveal something relevant. With Mueller\u2019s mandate this broad, and Trump\u2019s life and cash so complicated, overzealous Democrats needn\u2019t feel compelled to manufacture drama. And yet, it\u2019s almost certain some will. The day the special counsel was announced, for example, Rep. Al Green of Texas took dramatically to the House floor to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment. The danger here, of course, is that if the investigation reveals no smoking gun, Trump\u2019s supporters will insist \u2013 and with some authority, then \u2013 that nothing his detractors say should ever be believed. And that is very dangerous territory to enter. Sen. McCaskill clarifies Comey firing timeline Republicans will definitely underplay this. Though they are relieved the pressure\u2019s off them to investigate Trump more thoroughly, many will continue to run defense for Trump, even if just to please their constituents back home. It\u2019s not a good look. Rep. Jason Chaffetz  of Utah already rushed to the cameras to question the need for a special counsel that Trump\u2019s own appointed deputy attorney general called for. \u201cI have not seen any evidence of actual collusion,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cWhere is the actual crime that they think they need a special prosecutor to prosecute? I just haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d Er, maybe that\u2019s because Chaffetz\u2019s own Oversight Committee has refused to investigate it? Democrats will definitely turn on Mueller. Robert Mueller\u2019s unimpeachable integrity should have its own Twitter handle, it\u2019s gotten so much love from the left and the right over the past 18 hours. And deservedly so. But how long will it take for Democrats to flip the script (a reverse Jim Comey) if the investigation fails to turn up anything damning enough to get Trump kicked to the curb? What I know about Robert Mueller And will anything short of high crimes and misdemeanors \u2013 the threshold for impeachment \u2013 satisfy Democratic bloodlust? Mueller won\u2019t grandstand for Democrats\u2019 approval, and if he doesn\u2019t produce, he\u2019ll no longer have it, just you watch. Trump goons, be afraid. Trump\u2019s cadre of campaign cartoon villains, from Paul Manafort to Carter Page to Michael Flynn, should prepare for the worst. With new reports the Trump campaign had at least 18 points of contact with Russian officials during the election, it\u2019s likely one or more of his Russophile affiliates will be ensnared in this investigation. And especially if Trump manages to squeak through unscathed, someone will be a fall guy.",

He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Tim Stanley: Roger Ailes mastered for conservatives the media they hated With Ailes' death, there's a sense that Fox's future is as uncertain as Trump's, he says Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t be President if not for Roger Ailes. The media giant \u2013 who died Thursday at 77 \u2013 revolutionized American politics. First, he rebranded conservatives for the TV age. Then he created a news channel for them to dominate. Love him or loathe him, you inhabit the imagination of Roger Ailes. Ailes\u2019 life reflected a great conservative paradox: The right claims to hate the media, and yet it\u2019s often a better master of it than the left. When, as a young producer, Ailes met Richard Nixon backstage at \u201cThe Mike Douglas Show\u201d in 1967, Ailes famously told him that if he dismissed TV as a gimmick, then he\u2019d never make it back to the White House. Nixon hired him. The formula they cooked up was a mix of earthy, small-town values and slick TV advertising: conservatism as a product. Nixon was polished, smothered in makeup and made to deliver tough-minded orations in a soft voice. \u201cIf your audience likes you,\u201d Ailes explained, \u201cthey\u2019ll forgive just about everything else you do wrong.\u201d Author compares Fox News to a cult Ailes and Nixon conquered TV \u2013 and yet the press still got under their skin. Fighting back wasn\u2019t enough: Journalists could always, they complained, spin what you said and make you sound like an illiberal thug. So Ailes came to believe that the right had to work around the traditional media by setting up its own operation. Just as Trump talks about replacing White House press briefings with \u201cwritten responses for the sake of accuracy,\u201d so Ailes once considered providing pro-administration videos for local networks. Later, in 1996, he became the founding CEO of Fox News \u2013 and realized a long-held conservative dream. Now they could provide a right-wing perspective without liberal commentary, what they deemed \u201cfair and balanced.\u201d With the conservative movement located firmly on TV, it made perfect sense that its latest standard bearer should, himself, be a product of the small screen. Trump is straight out of the Ailes playbook. He\u2019s not as charming as Ailes\u2019 most talented client, Ronald Reagan, nor as qualified for high office as George H.W. Bush was. But he combines the Nixon-era values of country and faith with an unscripted quality that suggests its own kind of integrity. The whole audience doesn\u2019t like Trump \u2013 some hate him \u2013 but enough love him to forgive his errors and keep the show moving from season to season. Fox News powerhouse Roger Ailes dies But this star proved to be a prima donna. During the 2016 election, Trump clashed with then-Fox host Megyn Kelly, whom he called a \u201cbimbo,\u201d and skipped one Fox debate altogether. There was a sense in this political season that it was the candidate, rather than the broadcaster, who was calling the shots \u2013 setting the agenda not from a TV studio but on a Twitter feed. And Ailes\u2019 own disgrace at Fox, when he was accused of sexual harassment by, among others, Megyn Kelly, marked the end of an era of which Trump is perhaps the last champion. It is no longer \u201cacceptable\u201d to grab women by anything, or even to boast about it, as Trump did, like a horny adolescent. With Kelly out at Fox and Bill O\u2019Reilly \u2013 its most popular anchor \u2013 also out amid similar accusations, there\u2019s a sense that the future for Fox is almost as uncertain as it is for the President. As for Ailes, his reputation is controversial but immense. Nixon probably owes him his election in 1968, the elder Bush the same in 1988. Ailes did for conservative politicians what the advertisers did for dog food and washing detergent \u2013 turned them into a consumer product that rose and fell less on their material qualities than on their bright and exciting packaging.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Errol Louis: The Trump-Murdoch connections are more than harmless coincidence They raise ethical, journalistic and business questions, he writes Add the bromance between President Trump and media mogul Rupert Murdoch to the long list of messy conflicts of interest that define \u2013 and cast a shadow over \u2013 the Trump White House. \u201cIt is my distinct honor to introduce the commander in chief, the President of the United States, my friend Donald J. Trump,\u201d the Australian-born Murdoch said at a recent banquet honoring US and Australian veterans who fought in the battle of the Coral Sea, a pivotal World War II engagement. The two men hugged as Trump came to the podium. Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, the media corporation whose holdings include Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and other properties, is more than just a wealthy pal, and his words were more than ceremonial. When The New York Times published a front-page analysis of the people outside the White House whom Trump contacts for advice, Murdoch was the first one listed. He and Trump speak by phone almost every day, according to the Times. \u201cThe president\u2019s relationship with Mr. Murdoch is deeper and more enduring than most in his life, and the two commiserate and plot strategy in their phone calls, according to people close to both,\u201d the paper said. The connections extend to family: Until recently, Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, was one of five people overseeing a nearly  $300-million trust fund for Murdoch\u2019s daughters from a previous marriage. (Ivanka Trump resigned as a trustee after Election Day.) O'Reilly's firing: What took so long? The Trump-Murdoch connections might all seem like harmless coincidence \u2013 just a couple of billionaire buddies whose families get along \u2013 but it goes much deeper than that. In several cases, Trump appears to be using his presidential powers to provide a commercial benefit to Murdoch. It\u2019s a troubling reminder that Trump, years ago, openly boasted about trying to make money by campaigning for office. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,\u201d he said in 2000. That mentality hasn\u2019t changed. Since getting elected, Trump has clearly been using the presidency to make money for himself and his family \u2013 and, apparently, selected close friends including Murdoch. Of the first seven sit-down television interviews Trump granted after taking office, five were with Murdoch\u2019s Fox News (the other two were with ABC and the Christian Broadcasting Network). Murdoch no doubt thanked the commander in chief for the ratings boost during one of their regular phone calls. Bill O'Reilly addresses exit in new podcast Trump frequently praises Fox on Twitter. But it has left some journalists inside the Murdoch empire complaining about softball treatment and a pro-Trump tilt. Grumbling from reporters at The Wall Street Journal grew so great that the editor, Gerard Baker, held a newsroom-wide meeting to defend the paper\u2019s coverage. Another possible conflict involves Trump\u2019s vow during his presidential campaign to block the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner, CNN\u2019s parent company. It\u2019s widely acknowledged that the merger would create a powerful rival to Murdoch\u2019s empire (only a few years ago, Murdoch tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to acquire Time Warner himself). Now the Trump-Murdoch alliance is about to endure its most serious test. Trump recently leaped to the defense of Murdoch\u2019s business when scandal engulfed Fox News. In the wake of an explosive New York Times story that revealed that 21st Century Fox paid $13 million in settlements to five women claiming sexual harassment or verbal abuse by Bill O\u2019Reilly, the top Fox News host, only one prominent public figure came to the defense of O\u2019Reilly. That person was the President of the United States. O\u2019Reilly has denied the harassment allegations. \u201cI think he shouldn\u2019t have settled; personally, I think he shouldn\u2019t have settled,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cBecause you should have taken it all the way. I don\u2019t think Bill did anything wrong.\u201d In the end, despite Trump\u2019s expression of support, dozens of advertisers dropped O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, and Murdoch\u2019s sons forced the host out.  But the US Justice Department is probing possible illegal conduct inside 21st Century Fox related to money paid to settle sexual harassment claims by former Fox News President Roger Ailes. As first reported by CNN, the investigation centers on  whether the company\u2019s shareholders were properly informed about the money being spent on the harassment allegations. (Ailes has denied the harassment claims.) All of which raises a key question about ethics and conflicts of interest in Trump administration. Will Trump, deeply entwined with Murdoch, curtail or end the Justice Department investigation of Fox in exchange for favorable news coverage? Stay tuned.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Capt. Mark Kelly is a United States Navy combat veteran, retired NASA astronaut, and co-founder of Americans for Responsible Solutions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Mark Kelly: There is a vocal majority in our country that is demanding action to prevent needless gun tragedies We are prepared to fight the new administration and the new Congress on policies that threaten our communities, he says I flew 39 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm and left our planet four times in a spaceship. I always thought I had a risky job. But it wasn\u2019t until my wife, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was nearly assassinated that I learned she had faced a more present danger. Since that horrible day six years ago, I\u2019ve also learned a lot about life and about second chances. Nearly all people who experience the kind of injury Gabby suffered \u2013 a bullet to the head at near point-blank range \u2013 die. And those who do not die often have personalities and cognitive abilities that are drastically changed. But Gabby lived. Gabby was given another chance at life \u2013 and at service. So this fall, we traveled across the country to campaign for candidates up and down the ballot who have supported common-sense gun violence prevention policies. We met some really interesting people along the way \u2013 gun owners, law enforcement officers, veterans \u2013 and we learned that they, too, are fed up with our nation\u2019s gun violence crisis. How dangerous is this crisis? Every year, about 33,000 Americans die from gun violence. Americans are nearly 20 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than people in other high-income peer countries. Fortunately, there is a vocal majority in our country that is demanding action to prevent needless gun tragedies that claim innocent lives. This November, we saw voters support gun violence prevention candidates for Congress, most notably in New Hampshire\u2019s Senate race, where Gov. Maggie Hassan defeated incumbent Sen. Kelly Ayotte. Our organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC, launched an aggressive campaign to hold Sen. Ayotte accountable for her poor record on gun safety. In tight congressional races like Nevada\u2019s 4th and Florida\u2019s 7th Congressional Districts, gun violence prevention candidates ran \u2013 and won \u2013 on strengthening gun laws. In fact, 73% of our endorsed candidates won, and voters in three states \u2013 Nevada, Washington, and California \u2013 approved gun safety ballot measures in greater numbers than votes in those states for Hillary Clinton, showing this issue is compelling to people across the political spectrum. In the wake of the 2016 election, we at Americans for Responsible Solutions are redoubling our commitment to preventing gun tragedies that occur every day in this country. First, in the days after the election we launched the Firearms Accountability Counsel Taskforce (FACT), comprised of the country\u2019s top law firms. These firms are devoting hundreds of lawyers, thousands of hours, and millions of dollars, pro bono, to taking action against dangerous gun policies and holding the corporate gun lobby accountable for unlawful business practices that endanger public safety. Borrowing from successful impact litigation movements to achieve marriage equality, make automobiles safer, and hold Big Tobacco accountable, we are going on offense to create safer communities. Second, we will be prepared to fight the new administration and the new Congress on policies that threaten our communities. The gun lobby is seeking to allow guns into schools \u2013 an issue education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos expressed support for during her Senate confirmation hearing just this week. They\u2019re also pushing to ignore states\u2019 rights by mandating the unrestricted \u201cconcealed carry\u201d of firearms and allow free access to dangerous silencers, which would let criminals conceal murder and introduce a menacing new threat to our communities. These policies are a public safety threat, as the son of two New Jersey police officers, I believe law enforcement will not stand for them. Third, we will elect more gun violence prevention champions and fight for gun safety policies in 2018 and 2020. To do this, we will continue to reach out to nontraditional allies, including rural and independent voters who support commonsense solutions to our gun violence problem. We know that a plurality of rural voters who helped propel President Trump to victory want stronger gun laws. And we will do everything in our power to engage these constituencies.  In addition to communicating with voters about their candidate choices, we will also begin addressing more fundamental attitudes about the safety of firearms and the responsibility of owning them \u2013 because the critical fights over policy and politics must not come at the expense of a meaningful conversation about culture. Finally, we will work with anyone who is committed to making our families safer \u2013 including President Trump. Although the gun lobby spent a record $30 million supporting his campaign, Donald Trump has recognized and endorsed some new measures to reduce gun violence.  Even his nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, whose nomination has been strongly supported by the gun lobby, has acknowledged that we need to do a better job of enforcing our nation\u2019s existing federal gun laws. We firmly believe that keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people, like suspected terrorists, domestic abusers, and gun traffickers, shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. Gabby and I returned to public service in the hopes that we could save lives by bringing Americans together around responsible, commonsense gun safety policies \u2013 Americans who are Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and gun owners like us. That goal does not change with Donald Trump in the White House. We remain inspired by the countless Americans who\u2019ve had enough of the gun lobby\u2019s influence and our government\u2019s failure to pass meaningful solutions to reduce gun violence. Now, more than ever, we must turn that sentiment into action and continue the fight for safer communities.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Frida Ghitis is a frequent contributor to CNN, and a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review. She is a former CNN producer and correspondent. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Frida Ghitis: Trump's interview with European papers was a gut punch to Europe; he seems willing to upend alliances in favor of Putin She says if Trump does not follow lead of advisers like Mattis, US and Europe risk fracturing a mighty economic, political and military bloc Is Donald Trump preparing to surrender America\u2019s interests to Russia? President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s interview with the Times of London and Germany\u2019s Bild on Monday was a punch in the gut to Europe. He appeared to signal that the United States may turn its back on its allies, thereby weakening America and strengthening Russia, and throwing away what America helped build over three-quarters of a century. Judging by what we have heard from Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin should not have been just satisfied with Trump\u2019s election. He should have been overjoyed. There are few issues of friction between Russia and the West in which Trump has not already indicated he plans to take Putin\u2019s side. US ambassador rejects attack on intel agencies In Trump\u2019s astonishing statements to the newspapers, he described the European Union as an instrument of German domination. Germany and its leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel, one of America\u2019s most important allies, were a particular focus of Trump\u2019s thinly-veiled attacks. Trump said he trusts Merkel and Putin equally, placing the leader of a country at the core of the trans-Atlantic alliance in the same category as the leader of a nation that has antagonized the United States at every turn. \u201cI start off trusting both,\u201d he said dismissively, \u201cbut let\u2019s see how long it lasts.\u201d How Putin must have enjoyed this! Trump repeated his claim that NATO is obsolete, and breezily declared he doesn\u2019t care what happens to the European Union, calling Britain\u2019s decision to leave \u201ca great thing.\u201d That position is remarkable because since World War II every single US administration has supported European integration as a way to strengthen the Western alliance and promote its shared values. The Russia file is politically charged for the President-elect. A new CNN/ORC poll shows 8 in 10 Americans say they\u2019re paying close attention to the issue. And although there is deep disagreement over the significance of recent intelligence reports, an area of overwhelming consensus is disapproval of Putin, with just 12% saying they have a positive view of the Russian president. Let\u2019s pause here to recall: There is a reason why the US and Europe have been allies, while Putin\u2019s Russia has stood on the opposite side. Europe and the US share basic ideals about democracy, human rights and individual freedoms. Now Trump is increasingly aligning himself with the leader of a country that has steadily dismantled a fledgling democracy; one where and critics of the president die in mysterious circumstances, where government-sanctioned attacks against LGBT citizens have sent people fleeing, where opposition politicians run away for their lives. Despite this, Trump has dismissed criticism of his Putin-friendly statements by arguing that it\u2019s better for America to have Russia as a friend than a foe. What he appears to be pursuing, however, is not simply restored relations with Moscow, but the overturning of decades of purposeful American policy in a way that fulfills the geopolitical aspirations of Putin\u2019s Russia. This is not the art of the deal, it is surrender. Of course, we still don\u2019t know what Trump will do once in office, particularly since some of his own nominees disagree vehemently with his stance on Russia. Flynn contacted Russia day of new US sanctions For example, Gen. James Mattis, the likely secretary of defense, got it right during his Senate confirmation when he explained that, \u201c\u2026the most important thing is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with (in) Mr. Putin.\u201d Putin, he said, \u201cis trying to break the North Atlantic alliance.\u201d Mattis prescribed, \u201cworking with allies to defend ourselves where we must.\u201d Indeed, if Putin aims to destroy the European Union and NATO, he won\u2019t need weapons. Trump will be doing it for him if his policies match his utterances, instead of the admonitions of key players like Mattis. What might that look like? For one thing, Trump has repeatedly hinted at plans to lift sanctions imposed by the West after Russian forces seized the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine and sent unmarked Russian soldiers into eastern Ukraine to foment a civil war there. This has raised anxiety among Russia\u2019s closest neighbors \u2013 an alarm shared even in Western Europe. Europeans saw what Putin did in Ukraine and fear the US would do nothing to stop Putin from creating havoc in their countries. Is Donald Trump changing his stance on NATO? (Pro-Russian positions, it\u2019s worth noting, were hallmarks of the Trump presidential campaign. Back when the campaign was led by Paul Manafort \u2014 who has close ties with the pro-Russian side of Ukrainian politics \u2013 the Trump campaign forced the Republican Party to change its platform, removing both criticism of Russia and vows to support Ukrainian independence.) Not surprisingly, Europe, is preparing for the possibility of life without the close ties with the United States, which were forged in the ashes of World War II. Merkel said, \u201cThere is no eternal guarantee for a close cooperation\u201d in trans-Atlantic relations. \u201cWe Europeans,\u201d she declared, \u201chave our fate in our own hands.\u201d  The possible fracturing of a 70-year-old alliance \u2013 a mighty economic, political and military bloc \u2013 would be a huge loss for Europe and a spectacular victory for Putin. But it would also constitute a historic loss for the United States. America\u2019s strength derives not only from the size of its military forces, but also from the power of its alliances and its ideas. Trump, if he follows through on his disruptive threats, would make the United States a weaker country\u2013one that does not enjoy the support of the greatest military alliance in history, which has put the US at the center of a powerful family of nations that share views on economic, social and political freedoms. Sure, getting along with Putin would be nice, but not at the expense of America\u2019s values; not at the cost of weakening America. Not at the cost of betraying America\u2019s true friends.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Vava Tampa is the founder of Save the Congo!, a London-based campaign tackling the human tragedy engulfing the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The opinions expressed in this column belong to the author. Tampa: Obama has bagged no tangible African success. In fact, his much-discussed and oversold Africa policy is in jeopardy Yet all is not lost -- he still has one chance to secure his legacy in Africa In 2009, seven months after entering the Oval Office, President Obama pledged a new Africa policy. \u201dAfrica,\u201d he declared in the Ghanaian Parliament, \u201cdoesn\u2019t need strongmen. It needs strong institutions.\u201d Pro-democracy activists like me took this seriously \u2013 and for good reason. Africa\u2019s strongmen have caused the deaths of millions. The bloodiest killing field has been Africa\u2019s Great Lakes region, where political strongmen have responded to instability in the 20th and 21st centuries by committing crimes against humanity and, in some cases, genocide. In my beloved Congo \u2013 Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest country \u2013 over 5.4 million people were killed between 1998 and 2008 in wars and proxy wars, the International Rescue Committee says. These wars continue to claim an estimated 45,000 lives a month, according to the UN\u2019s Ross Mountain, with 1,100 women and young girls reportedly raped every day. 100 moments from Obama's presidency In neighboring Rwanda, 800,000 people were slaughtered in the space of three months during the Tutsi genocide in 1994. And in Burundi, which was the scene of on-and-off wars and mini-genocide between 1962 and 2005, over a million have been killed. Thousands more have been killed recently in a repressive campaign to suppress political opponents, which is undoing many of the gains made since the Arusha Accords in 2005 and raising the prospect of another all-out war. These are the nightmares that many of us believe inspired Obama\u2019s new Africa doctrine. And when Donald Trump takes over at the end of this month, I hope he makes \u201csupporting strong institutions instead of strongmen\u201d his priority in Africa. Fast-forward to 2017, with barely a few weeks left until end of his mandate, and President Obama has \u2013 by most accounts \u2013 bagged no tangible African success. In fact, his much-discussed and oversold Africa policy is in jeopardy. It wasn\u2019t supposed to go this way, of course. What went wrong? In short, he didn\u2019t stand up to strongmen. Washington totally failed to twist the arm of Burundi\u2019s President Pierre Nkurunziza enough to stop him from clinging to power beyond his constitutional term limit. It then failed to put in place conditions that would make it very difficult for other strongmen in the region to follow suit. The implication and long-term consequences of this failure are only now becoming clear. West of the Congo River, Sassou Nguesso has, through actions that may be legal on paper but morally wrong and politically dangerous, followed suit and changed Congo-Brazzaville\u2019s constitution to cling to power. Paul Kagame in Rwanda has, through similar maneuvers, managed to change his country\u2019s constitution so that he can cling to power even before his term, which expires at the of 2017, comes to an end. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, dozens were killed in protests when President Joseph Kabila attempted to do the same thing. Black Lives Matter, but only if they're American The list may very well go on. What happens next is anybody\u2019s guess. But all is not yet lost. Africa\u2019s Great Lakes, the region that seems pitifully prone to strongmen and mass killing \u2013 and where Washington has squandered opportunities to support strong institutions, as Obama promised in Ghana \u2013 is the very place that Obama can still guarantee his legacy in Africa. But only if action is taken before he leaves office. The crisis in Africa\u2019s Great Lakes region \u2013 anyone who has studied the region will tell you \u2013 is like a three-legged stool: knock off one leg and the stool will fall. In other words, victory in Congo could bring an end to the reign of strongmen in the region and beyond. And to help secure victory at this crucial juncture we need Washington to impose \u201clife-changing\u201d sanctions on the things and people Kabila values most: his family, their fortune and their ability to move freely in Africa and across the globe. Some might argue that \u2013 in the wake of the recently-signed power-sharing deal brokered by Congo\u2019s Catholic Church that would end his rule \u2013 imposing sanctions would make Kabila combative. Mixing shrewd diplomacy with threat of sanctions, some have argued, is better. That argument is flawed.  Indeed, what Kabila\u2019s actions over the past two years tell us is this: he has no intention to step down and he will continue to crush anyone who questions his legitimacy. Imposing \u201clife-changing\u201d sanctions, at least for the recent killing of pro-democracy protesters, will not only send a powerful message to Kabila that further targeting of protesters will come at a price, but will also give Rassemblement \u2013 the opposition\u2019s main umbrella group, which signed the power-sharing deal with Kabila\u2019s camp \u2013 leverage to push for a peaceful creation of a transitional government, as well as preparation for a free and fair presidential election at the end of this year as conditions for sanctions are being eased. This can only be secured by Obama. Failure to do so could have pernicious consequences \u2013 both for Congo\u2019s pro-democracy movement, and, of course, for Obama\u2019s own Africa legacy.",

            "article_content": "Ryan has worked on tax reform for 25 years in politics House expected to pass bill Wednesday, its second vote in as many days When House Speaker Paul Ryan slams down the gavel to send a huge Republican tax bill to President Donald Trump on Wednesday, he will fulfill a lifetime\u2019s ambition of steering a generational economic reform into law. GOP tax plan: Senate to vote Tuesday night, House to revote Wednesday \u201cThis is a promise made, this is a promise kept,\u201d Ryan said Tuesday, after an initial House vote on a measure that he has been working towards since signing on as an aide to his mentor, conservative fiscal guru Jack Kemp, in 1993. Never mind that Ryan\u2019s Democratic critics have castigated him for repudiating a reputation as a policy wonk and years of warnings about the perils of bloating deficits and swelling government debt, by embracing a bill that does exactly that. Ryan is simply savoring the taste of victory. \u201cMy colleagues, this is a day that I have been looking forward to for a long time,\u201d Ryan said on the House floor. \u201cMy minute can last for as long as I want it to last,\u201d he said, after being interrupted by a protestor, in an aside that revealed how deeply he was savoring a political win that had looked unlikely through a brutal 2017. RELATED: Paul Ryan tells Republicans \u2018I\u2019m not leaving this job\u2019 Wednesday will be especially sweet for Ryan, over and above his role in putting the most sweeping tax reform bill since the Reagan years on a fast track to Trump\u2019s desk. The final vote will also represent one last, and long-delayed victory over a political nemesis, former President Barack Obama, because the bill also repeals the individual mandate, the centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, the 44th President\u2019s signature domestic achievement. That buried victory will close a circle opened years before, in April 2011, when Ryan was humiliated by an Obama attack during a speech on the economy at George Washington University. Obama warned that Ryan\u2019s budget plan was based on a \u201cvision of the future that is deeply pessimistic,\u201d leaving many Republicans convinced that the then-President was deliberately trying to embarrass his foe. Obama later admitted that the attack was a mistake, and said he hadn\u2019t known ahead of time that Ryan would be sitting in the front row. The tax reform win also offers Ryan a long-awaited dividend for the often taxing and painful experience of dealing with another President: Trump. Throughout the 2016 campaign Ryan, who had forged himself an urbane and clean living image in his 2012 vice presidential run on Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s ticket against Obama, was forced to respond to Trump\u2019s outrageous tweets and comments. Ryan often declined to defend Trump but also risked tainting his own image by pointing out that voters did not face a \u201cbinary choice\u201d and were choosing between Trump and Hillary Clinton, implying that for all his faults, the Republican would be far better for America than the Democratic presidential nominee. He also often mentioned the power of presidents to choose Supreme Court justices and stressed the importance of a sending a conservative to the White House \u2013 or as close to that goal as Trump was likely to get. The new tax law, as well as Trump\u2019s choice of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who is already carved out a conservative legacy is payback for his continuing political tightrope walk alongside Trump. When the President signs the tax bill, it will end a year of turmoil for Ryan that started with the highest of hopes with Republicans assuming a monopoly on power in Washington with Trump\u2019s inauguration. Months later, the speaker tasted humiliation, when he was forced to pull an Obamacare repeal bill from the House floor in March. He rebuked his \u201c10-year opposition party\u201d that was accustomed to being against things, and not for things, amid signs his hold on his restive caucus was fraying. Ryan also endured scorched-earth attacks pro-Trump media figures \u2013 an unusual experience for someone who had been a darling of the conservative grassroots. A health care repeal bill did eventually pass the House \u2013 but it failed in the Senate, rising huge doubts about the GOP\u2019s capacity to wield power in Washington. Ryan is vowing that the tax bill was just the start for the GOP and that a new era of reform is brewing in 2018 as he eyes social programs that are beloved of Democratic voters. But with the mid-term elections fast approaching and Trump\u2019s popularity weighing down on his party, and hopes rising among Democrats that they could capture the House next year, it\u2019s also possible that the tax win will be the zenith of his speakership. That\u2019s one reason why rumors have been swirling for weeks about Ryan\u2019s future, amid speculation he could step down at the end of this election cycle. CNN reported last week that the speaker had been \u201csoul searching\u201d about his future. But on Tuesday, he told Republican colleagues: \u201cI am not going anywhere anytime soon.\u201d",

            "article_content": "FBI officials' texts have given ammo to critics of special counsel Robert Mueller The story first came to light two weeks ago On December 1, all eyes in Washington were fixed on former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. It was another sign that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election was gaining steam. Nearly 24 hours later, top officials at the Justice Department had a problem. Rod Rosenstein: No good cause to fire Mueller Media reports surfaced Saturday morning that two top FBI officials had traded a series of text messages trashing then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and supporting Hillary Clinton. Later that day, Mueller\u2019s office, in a rare move, was quick to issue a statement addressing the texts \u2013 perhaps a recognition of the potential political upheaval brewing. Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed FBI Director Christopher Wray to make \u201cany necessary changes to his management and investigative teams.\u201d The head of the House Intelligence Committee threatened top officials at the Justice Department and FBI with contempt of Congress citations, hurling accusations that they\u2019d been less than forthcoming about the text messages. Defenders of the President, in search of any avenues to discredit, diminish and distract from Mueller\u2019s work on the Russia investigation, have now focused their gaze directly inside the Justice Department and FBI, pouncing on newly perceived vulnerabilities that have bubbled up within a striking two-week span. Until two weeks ago, Peter Strzok was not a household name outside the counterintelligence field, but within the FBI he\u2019s considered one of the bureau\u2019s top experts on Russia. Strzok had played a lead role in the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server and was involved in the FBI\u2019s recommendation that no criminal charges be filed against the former secretary of state. He later helped oversee the beginnings of the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. CNN reported in mid-July that Strzok had joined Mueller\u2019s team, but his time there was short-lived. He was removed after Mueller learned on July 27 about a stockpile of text messages exchanged between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page through November 2016 in which the pair dreaded Trump winning the election. The texts were uncovered as part of a separate internal investigation looking into the FBI\u2019s actions leading up to the 2016 election. That investigation is ongoing. People who worked with Strzok describe him as a seasoned agent who never allowed political opinions to influence his work. His role as a leader in the Clinton email investigation was overseen by top FBI officials, some with Republican political leanings, and the prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia, who helped oversee the investigation included Republicans, according to current and former officials close to the matter. Strzok\u2019s role in the Trump-Russia probe also doesn\u2019t fit the portrayal by Republican critics, these officials say. CNN has reported that FBI counterintelligence agents who interviewed Flynn initially weren\u2019t in favor of pursuing charges against him for lying in his interview with the FBI in January about conversations he had with Sergey Kislyak, Russia\u2019s former ambassador to the US. Strzok was among those who didn\u2019t view Flynn\u2019s answers as purposely false statements, the officials said. An attorney for Strzok did not respond to a request for comment. Page could not be reached for comment. The Justice Department and the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment for this story. Various congressional investigators spent days clamoring to see the text messages for themselves and, in an unexpected move, the Justice Department rapidly turned over a set of roughly 375 texts to lawmakers on December 12 \u2013 the eve of a key congressional hearing \u2013 noting the \u201cextraordinary accommodation\u201d of releasing them in the midst of an internal investigation. Reports detailing the extent of Strzok and Page\u2019s dislike for Trump soon popped up from every major news outlet \u2013 priming the pump for a narrative that loomed over an oversight hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Months-worth of FBI employees' texts dreading Trump victory released to Congress \u201cThese text messages prove what we all suspected: High-ranking FBI officials involved in the Clinton investigation were personally invested in the outcome of the election, and clearly let their strong political opinions cloud their professional judgment,\u201d said House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2013 who appointed Mueller after Sessions recused himself from all campaign-related matters \u2013 found himself in the unenviable position Wednesday of urging that lawmakers see a fine distinction between political affiliation and bias, while offering a strikingly uncompromising defense of Mueller and the integrity of his investigation, calling him an \u201cideal choice for this task.\u201d Rosenstein encouraged the House panel to await the results of the inspector general\u2019s investigation, of which the texts are a pertinent part. The Justice Department has agreed to make Stzrok available for interviews with congressional investigators. Strzok and Page regularly traded barbs on a variety of political figures from independent Sen. Bernie Sanders to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, but Republican lawmakers appear to have zeroed in on specific texts that they say may have moved beyond name-calling. In one instance, highlighted in a tweet by Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Page references a phone so that she and Strzok could \u201ctalk about Hillary because it can\u2019t be traced\u201d \u2013 raising questions about whether any messages on additional devices exist. In another text sent in August 2016, after the Clinton investigation closed, Strzok says, without explanation: \u201cI want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy\u2019s office\u201d \u2013 an apparent reference to Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe \u2013 \u201cthat there\u2019s no way he gets elected \u2013 but I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take that risk. It\u2019s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you\u2019re 40 \u2026 .\u201d Page does not appear to have responded, according to records reviewed by CNN. The text doesn\u2019t directly mention the FBI\u2019s ongoing counterintelligence efforts on Russian meddling in the election, but the timing of it means it was sent in the early weeks of the FBI\u2019s probe into potential contacts between Russian operatives and Trump campaign associates. It doesn\u2019t, however, answer what \u201cpath\u201d was being evaluated within the FBI at the time. Republicans ratchet up Mueller criticism Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters Tuesday that Mueller needs to \u201cclean house.\u201d \u201cI think he needs to vet the people he\u2019s working with, because I think he\u2019s undermining public confidence in his own investigation by having people that have been so politically active and who have made critical comments of the President and his team,\u201d Cornyn added. Meanwhile, others have pointed to the fact that Mueller is a lifelong Republican, and they say attempting to correlate Democratic political contributions made by his team members over the years with biased work will only result in a rabbit hole of hypocrisy when some top Justice officials have a history of donations to Republicans. Pointing to those Republican contributions Wednesday, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-California, suggested that it is a \u201csilly argument\u201d to claim \u201cif a Department of Justice employee exercises a First Amendment right to make political contributions that somehow that they cannot do their job,\u201d and shows \u201ca desperation that some people have about the Mueller investigation.\u201d Compounding the notion pushed by Trump, his advocates in the media and some Republicans on Capitol Hill that the Justice Department\u2019s \u201cdeep state\u201d is out to get the President is the case of Bruce Ohr, the Justice Department official now in the crosshairs of an unproven theory connecting him to the Trump dossier. Less than a week after news of Strzok\u2019s texts broke, Fox News reported that Ohr had been demoted amid the discovery of certain meetings with Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson and Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer who assembled the dossier. (The exact timing and number of meetings is not yet public.) On Monday, Fox News also reported that Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS during the 2016 election, according to House Intel Committee investigators. Simpson provided more detail about his interactions with the couple in an unrelated court submission Tuesday, explaining that the firm contracted with Nellie Ohr to help with its \u201cresearch and analysis of Mr. Trump,\u201d and that Simpson met with Bruce Ohr, \u201cat his request, after the November 2016 election to discuss our findings regarding Russia and the election.\u201d The story has drawn attention because certain congressional investigators have demanded that the Justice Department explain the extent to which the dossier served as the FBI\u2019s basis to apply for warrants to conduct surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act on Trump associates. RELATED: Fusion GPS co-founder: Steele didn\u2019t pay sources for dossier on Trump But what remains unclear is why Bruce Ohr requested the meeting with Simpson and what was said at his meeting with Steele. Nevertheless, the President\u2019s lawyer, Rep. Jim Jordan of Texas and other Republicans have called for a second special counsel to investigate. \u201cThink about what we\u2019ve learned in the last several weeks. We first learned who paid for the dossier, then we learned about Peter Strzok and last week we learned about Bruce Ohr and his wife, Nellie. I mean this is unbelievable,\u201d Jordan said Wednesday. Rosenstein tried to explain to the House panel that while Ohr, a career Justice official, worked in his office up until last week, Ohr had no role in the Russia investigation. Where do the past two weeks leave the Justice Department as Mueller plows through his investigation? Officials there are girding for the inspector general\u2019s office to drop a detailed report that\u2019s been in the works since January and will address the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email probe, including then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s controversial move to announce less than two weeks before the presidential election the discovery of additional emails potentially relevant to the investigation of Clinton, and whether FBI Deputy Director McCabe should have been recused from the case for alleged ethical conflicts surrounding his wife. Jill McCabe ran for political office in Virginia as a Democrat and received contributions from then-Governor Terry McAuliffe, a close friend of the Clintons. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz told congressional committees this week that his team uncovered \u201cpolitically oriented text messages\u201d between Page and Strzok as part of their review, alerted Rosenstein and Mueller, and is in the process of completing witness interviews. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s allies appear ready to take aim at another target on Mueller\u2019s team: prosecutor Andrew Weissmann. An email from January shows the lawyer applauded his then-boss, acting Attorney General Sally Yates, for refusing to enforce the President\u2019s original travel ban, and Weissmann also attended election-night festivities for the Clinton campaign at the Javits Center in New York, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. But even the most vocal critics of Mueller\u2019s team and the Justice Department, like Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, appear to recognize that top officials are stuck between a rock and a hard place on many of these issues. \u201cRosenstein\u2019s got a really hard, maybe impossible, job, which is defending a bunch of stupid decisions that other people made,\u201d Gowdy said. And December isn\u2019t over yet. CNN\u2019s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Moore was not the GOP establishment's first choice Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon backed Moore against incumbent Sen. Luther Strange Democrat Doug Jones won Tuesday night Mitch McConnell was worried about Alabama. Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions was now President Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general, opening up a Senate seat McConnell would need to focus on in November 2018. Early this year, he started seeing reports in local Alabama press that gave him pause, someone close to the senator told CNN. The Alabama governor was considering holding a special election this year, rather than next. Should he be concerned about a possible date change that could add new pressure on the party? Sen. Luther Strange, appointed to replace Sessions, said not to be. Had that conversation gone differently, McConnell might have sought to persuade Gov. Kay Ivey to keep the 2018 election date. He might have called upon the White House to intervene. Instead, Washington Republicans were caught flat-footed when Ivey announced in April that she would schedule the special election early, for this year. The decision was the first in a series of unimaginable missteps and miscalculations that led to one of the biggest Republican political disasters in recent years, culminating in Republican Roy Moore\u2019s defeat Tuesday to Democrat Doug Jones. The result marked the first time in more than two decades that a Democrat had won a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama. The blame game begins inside the White House after Alabama stunner \u201cThe remarkable thing is, it\u2019s one big, gigantic self-inflicted wound,\u201d said Josh Holmes, McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff and campaign manager. \u201cThe election itself did not need to happen.\u201d From that first fateful decision until Tuesday, the race unfolded for the Republican Party as a political case study in Murphy\u2019s Law: whatever could go wrong, did. And GOP strategists now fear the party could remain stuck in the morass into 2018 and beyond, symbolically linked to Moore even as they try to put his loss behind them. The race will be remembered as much for Moore as for the test he posed to Washington Republicans, and the divisions he exposed among them, especially between McConnell and the White House. This is the story of how the Alabama Senate race unfurled and ultimately unraveled, as told to CNN in conversations with nearly a dozen people aligned with the Trump administration, Senate Republicans and the political wing of Steve Bannon, the President\u2019s former chief strategist who bucked the party and backed Moore. Judge Roy Moore was no national Republican\u2019s first choice. During the first round of the Republican primary, influential conservatives coalesced behind Rep. Mo Brooks, while McConnell and the National Republican Senatorial Committee favored Strange. Bannon's '#war' on the GOP suffers embarrassing blow But the President\u2019s team was on the fence. Some White House advisers strongly favored endorsing Strange, including Rick Dearborn and the legislative affairs team, Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and the vice president\u2019s advisers, according to multiple sources inside and outside of the administration. They argued that Strange had been loyal to the President and would be a key vote on major legislation like tax reform. Dearborn, a former chief of staff to Sessions, also maintained deep Alabama connections. His wife, a GOP strategist in the state, is staunchly anti-Moore. The President\u2019s political office, however, which at the time included Bannon, cautioned against intervening in the primary, fearing the move would carry unnecessary political risk and, possibly, provoke a backlash among Trump\u2019s core supporters. \u201cTo me, getting behind Luther was inconsistent with who we are and how we got here,\u201d said one source familiar with the internal discussions. In the end, one administration official said, there wasn\u2019t extensive debate or hand-wringing. \u201cThe President ultimately wanted to do the right thing\u201d and endorse Strange, the official said, \u201cbecause Luther had been with him on every vote without even asking.\u201d Alabama election: Doug Jones scores stunning win, but Moore won't concede If Strange\u2019s loyalty to Trump was a selling point, however, he was weighed down politically by his initial appointment to the Senate by Gov. Robert Bentley, who afterward left office under the cloud of a sex scandal involving a top aide. Plus, Brooks and then Moore sought to frame Strange as a creature of the Republican establishment \u2013 at a moment when that label was toxic in Alabama. Meanwhile, efforts by national Republicans to help Strange were backfiring. The McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund spent tens of millions of dollars to boost him \u2013 furthering attacks by Strange\u2019s rivals that he was bought and paid for by Washington Republicans. When Bannon departed the White House in August, he and his allies saw McConnell\u2019s investment in the race as an opportunity to score points for his own populist-nationalist movement by waging a proxy fight against the Senate leader. \u201cI was with Steve at his dining room table, and he looked at me and said, \u2018Surabian, we\u2019ve got to do this,\u2019\u201d recalled Andy Surabian, Bannon\u2019s former deputy in the White House, now a senior adviser to the pro-Trump Great America PAC. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Mitch McConnell, there\u2019s a good chance Steve Bannon would have never gotten involved in this race at all.\u201d Steve Bannon wants to destroy the Republican Party With the President still backing Strange, Bannon threw his support to Moore \u2013 ensuring that some of his allies would follow. By the end of September, just before Election Day, they had organized dual rallies in support of Moore: Sebastian Gorka and Sarah Palin appeared at one in Montgomery, and Nigel Farage, Duck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson and Bannon headlined another in Fairhope. \u201cThat was a shot across the bow to not only the President, but also Bannon\u2019s detractors, including Matt Drudge, who claimed if Steve was fired he would not have any influence,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign aide who is in Bannon\u2019s circle. \u201cThere\u2019s more power on the outside.\u201d A few days earlier, the President had traveled to Alabama for a rally of his own \u2013 a decision he reached as a result of a meeting with Sen. Bob Corker, in which the President indicated to Corker that he believed Strange would win. Corker warned Trump that the race was not going as smoothly as he thought. To settle the debate, \u201cthey got some consultants on the phone,\u201d including former National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director Ward Baker, \u201cand confirmed what Corker was saying,\u201d said a source briefed on the conversation. \u201cAt the end of the conversation, (Trump) committed to go to Alabama.\u201d But by the time the President stood on stage in Huntsville on September 22, even as he heaped praise on Strange, Trump also seemed uncertain about his decision. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I might have made a mistake,\u201d Trump said. The morning after the runoff election when Moore defeated Strange, McConnell called Moore to congratulate the new Republican nominee. The conversation lasted just a minute, said one source familiar with the call, and Moore said little. But his victory spoke volumes \u2013 and Republicans in Washington were getting the message. Bannon hailed the victory as the start of a \u201crevolution.\u201d The President expressed his support for Moore, and deleted some of his earlier tweets supporting Strange. In early October, Moore made the rounds in Washington, meeting with lawmakers including Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, the NRSC chairman. As Trump and Republican groups lined up behind Moore for the general election, however, few believed they would need to actively support him. There was little doubt he would be the next senator from Alabama. And one month later, the race seemed to be progressing as expected. After the GOP runoff, Brian O. Walsh, president of the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action, said he had put a note on his calendar to poll the race November 9. That morning, he called the group\u2019s pollsters \u2013 and, a few hours later, he urgently called them back. They would need to rethink their questions. A Washington Post story had just published, featuring four women who alleged Moore had pursued sexual relations with them when they were teenagers, including one who said she was just 14 years old at the time. The White House wants Roy Moore's vote, but doesn't want to talk about Moore Among Republicans in Washington, \u201cthere was a lot of shock, a lot of awe, a lot of confusion as to how nobody discovered it before that day,\u201d said one party strategist familiar with the Senate race. \u201cEveryone just sighed and said, \u2018Well, here we are.\u2019\u201d As the Republican National Committee and the NRSC cut ties with Moore\u2019s campaign, McConnell and other Republicans called for Moore to step aside. Behind the scenes, party operatives assessed possible scenarios: they could attempt to circumvent Moore with a write-in candidate, persuade Ivey to delay the election, or run Moore out of the race altogether. Republicans' response to the Roy Moore story sure sounds familiar Although McConnell would in the following days float Sessions as a potential write-in ringer, that idea quickly fizzled. \u201cShort of (University of Alabama football coach) Nick Saban or Jesus Christ, you were going to have a really tough time,\u201d said the Senate Republican campaign official. \u201cSo it kind of took the write-in off the table.\u201d Strategists in McConnell\u2019s orbit soon landed on an obscure legal precedent, which suggested that Ivey could call a new special election if Strange stepped down and another replacement was appointed, the official said. Sen. Richard Shelby and Vice President Mike Pence, in addition to the vice president\u2019s staff, were in communication with Ivey \u2014 but the governor wouldn\u2019t budge. Meanwhile, McConnell\u2019s allies pitched the White House on the plan, \u201cand initially they were interested,\u201d said a Senate campaign official. But, internally, the President\u2019s political shop worried that such a Hail Mary would be \u201cthe kind of scheme that voters in Alabama would see right through,\u201d according to two sources familiar with their discussions. \u201cNone of it was realistic,\u201d said an administration official. Crucially, as Republicans processed and sought to work through the crisis, the President was out of the country completing an extended swing through Asia \u2013 leaving a vacuum at home, with no clear guidance to his allies. Meanwhile, the talk among Republicans of ousting Moore was energizing Bannon and his network anew. In one internal discussion, \u201cwe all agreed that McConnell was trying to kill two birds with one stone and take down Steve with Moore, and we weren\u2019t going to let that happen,\u201d said Nunberg. But Bannon first needed to bring some of his influential allies onto the same page. On November 14, Fox News anchor Sean Hannity stunned some conservatives when he delivered an ultimatum to Moore: \u201cremove any doubt\u201d about the allegations against him, or \u201cget out of this race.\u201d Hannity\u2019s bold and unexpected stand drew a phone call from Bannon, who urged Hannity to tone down his rhetoric and let Alabama voters decide, a source told CNN at the time. The following evening, Hannity softened his tone, saying the issue \u201cshouldn\u2019t be decided by me.\u201d There were still other fires to extinguish. That same week, in an interview with the Associated Press, Ivanka Trump said of Moore: \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for people who prey on children. I\u2019ve yet to see a valid explanation and I have no reason to doubt the victims\u2019 accounts.\u201d The statement would be featured prominently on mailers and in television ads against Moore. Ivanka Trump slams Roy Moore: 'There's a special place in hell for people who prey on children' Through intermediaries and directly, Bannon and his network warned the White House that the President could anger his political base were he to call for Moore to step aside, multiple sources familiar with those discussions said. Bannon remained in semi-regular contact with Trump by phone. An unrelated event soon convinced some Republicans that the landscape was shifting. On the morning of Nov. 16, as the White House political team met, news was breaking of a woman accusing Sen. Al Franken of sexual misconduct. Al Franken accuser: 'I've been angry about it ... for over 10 years' Watching the story unfold, White House political director Bill Stepien predicted a pivot point, telling his colleagues, \u201cThis changes the conversation, and this will dramatically change public opinion and open the door for Moore,\u201d according to sources who were present. \u201cThe light bulb went on for everyone,\u201d recalled one official who was in the meeting. Suddenly, the public discussion of sexual misconduct was bipartisan. Following the Thanksgiving holiday, Trump marked a new phase of the campaign as he began to hint at an endorsement of Moore, attacking Jones in a public statement on Twitter. Trump \u201c(knew) that this is not a sure thing,\u201d said a source familiar with the President\u2019s endorsement. \u201cHe was willing to put his own political capital on the line.\u201d The simple reason Donald Trump endorsed Roy Moore A few days later, Bannon announced to CNN that he would return to Alabama for a rally December 5 to kick off the final week of the campaign, saying he \u201c(looked) forward to standing with Judge Moore and all of the Alabama deplorables in the fight to elect him to the United States Senate and send shockwaves to the political and media elites.\u201d It had become clear that Moore would not be challenged by a last-minute write-in candidate or persuaded to leave the race, and some Senate Republicans grew quieter. On December 3, McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he would \u201clet the people of Alabama make the call\u201d on Moore. McConnell\u2019s circle insisted he was not softening his previous stance on Moore, so much as \u201c(acknowledging) that despite our best efforts, Moore will be on the ballot,\u201d said one source familiar with McConnell\u2019s thinking. The next day, Trump explicitly endorsed Moore and later called him from Air Force One en route to Utah, saying, \u201cGo get \u2018em, Roy!\u201d Groups aligned with the President, including the Republican National Committee and America First Action, followed his lead, announcing they would spend money on the race. Walsh said the decision by America First was a \u201cclinical\u201d one, informed by data on the race, the President\u2019s posture, and the legislative implications. \u201cYou can\u2019t simply write off a US Senate seat,\u201d Walsh said. But the President\u2019s endorsement violently ruptured the GOP, with McConnell\u2019s wing of the party standing on the other side of the chasm. The NRSC and SLF announced they would not re-engage in the race. McConnell: 'Let the people of Alabama make the call' on Moore Following Trump\u2019s decision to endorse Moore, the President on one occasion attempted to speak about the race with McConnell, said a Senate campaign official familiar with the conversation. \u201cAnd McConnell indicated they\u2019re going to have to agree to disagree on that issue, and they should talk about other issues instead,\u201d the official said. The reckoning is likely just beginning. Roy Moore won't concede With Moore\u2019s defeat, the President suffers one more political bruising that could cause Republicans to question his broader political strategy moving into 2018. McConnell could be pressed by donors and party loyalists to defend his decisionmaking that resulted in the party losing a crucial Senate seat. And Bannon\u2019s allies have promised to continue taking on McConnell into the midterm elections. \u201cThe war inside the Republican Party is only going to get more vicious and more bloody,\u201d said a source familiar with Bannon\u2019s plans. Ultimately, however, all three camps will be forced to grapple with a historic failure in the race for an impossibly safe Senate seat. \u201cIf you can figure out how to screw up a state as red as Alabama,\u201d Holmes said, \u201cyou can lose basically anywhere.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Special Counsel Robert Mueller appears to be relying on an obscure 218-year-old law to apply pressure to officials in pursuit of a broader investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election, though experts doubt prosecutors would ever use it to seek charges. In court filings, Michael Flynn acknowledged he lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about calls with foreign officials, including the Russian ambassador, to try to influence the outcome of a UN resolution in December 2016 while a member of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team. Michael Zeldin, a former prosecutor who was a special assistant to Mueller in the Justice Department, said the outreach to foreign governments by Trump\u2019s team at the time the Obama administration was in dispute with Israel over the vote is \u201cfacially\u201d a violation of the Logan Act. Russia investigation zeroes in on Trump inner circle Flynn\u2019s contact with the Russian ambassador \u201cseems to violate what the Logan Act intended to prevent,\u201d Zeldin said. He added that even though the Logan Act hasn\u2019t been used successfully \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that Mueller wouldn\u2019t consider using it to pressure defendants.\u201d The Logan Act, which was passed in 1799, forbids private citizens \u201cwithout authority of the United States\u201d from negotiating with foreign governments with an \u201cintent to influence\u201d measures or conduct of that government regarding any \u201cdisputes or controversies.\u201d No one has been successfully prosecuted for violating the Logan Act, which Congress passed in response to the actions of George Logan, a Pennsylvania doctor who went to France as a private citizen and tried to negotiate with officials there, according to the Congressional Research Service. Lawyers say there are questions about the constitutionality of the law pertaining to its vagueness and the First Amendment right to free speech. Michael Flynn pleads guilty to lying to FBI \u201cI think it\u2019s a pressure point for other related offenses,\u201d said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas law school and a CNN contributor. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s no way in which any indictment is going to rise and fall on the Logan Act. The question is whether there\u2019s some broader conspiracy. It increasingly looks like a pretty wide-reaching cover up.\u201d Lawyers say the conversations could also be used by Mueller\u2019s team as it looks for possible evidence of conspiracy, a quid pro quo between Trump campaign officials and Russians or pursues a case of obstruction of justice. In court filings, Mueller\u2019s team stated: \u201cFlynn\u2019s false statement and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on the FBI\u2019s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.\u201d A senior White House official on Friday defended Flynn\u2019s conversations and claimed the Obama White House knew about the discussions. \u201cNone of the conversations were improper and were authorized by the Obama administration,\u201d the official said. Sources: Kushner was the 'very senior' transition member mentioned in court filing Court filings show that Flynn said he was directed by a \u201cvery senior member of the presidential transition team\u201d to make contact with foreign governments, including Russia, on December 22, 2016, to \u201cdelay or defeat a UN resolution to condemn Israeli settlements.\u201d A source familiar with the investigation said that Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, is the \u201cvery senior\u201d transition official mentioned in the documents. Kushner met with Mueller\u2019s investigators last month to discuss Flynn, CNN has reported. The following day, the Russian ambassador told Flynn Russia would not vote against the resolution. The resolution passed. An attorney for Kushner did not comment. CNN reported at the time that the Israeli government reached out to Trump for help in pressuring the Obama administration to veto a UN Security Council resolution condemning settlement activity. But the Israeli official told CNN that his country also approached the Trump campaign after it felt that it had failed to persuade the Obama administration to veto the planned vote. The official said that Israel \u201cimplored the White House not to go ahead and told them that if they did, we would have no choice but to reach out to President-elect Trump.\u201d Shortly after the vote, Trump tweeted: \u201cAs to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\u201d One day after the vote, Trump condemned it on Twitter: \u201cThe big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace. Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!\u201d Flynn also admitted to making false statements to the FBI about conversations he had with Kislyak beginning on December 28, 2016, about sanctions enacted by the Obama administration. In one call, Flynn discussed with \u201ca senior official\u201d on the Trump transition team who was with other transition officials at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort that they not want Russia to escalate the situation in light of the sanctions. The following day, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would not retaliate against the US for the sanctions. KT McFarland was the senior transition official at Mar-a-Lago who was described as discussing with Flynn what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian ambassador about US sanctions, according to sources familiar with the matter. An attorney for McFarland declined comment. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Some Republicans see Tuesday's election results as a Trump referendum Other GOP members of Congress say the off-year elections don't mean much Republicans on Capitol Hill admit Tuesday night\u2019s election in Virginia, where Democrats routed GOP candidates up and down the ticket, sent a message they need to pay attention to, but they are divided about what drove the defeat or what their party needs to do ahead of the 2018 midterms. Exit polls showed that President Donald Trump\u2019s tenure in office energized Democrats to come out in larger numbers than they have in past recent elections, especially in suburban areas, where the President\u2019s policies are less popular. These are the same areas where the most competitive House seats are located, and where Democrats believe they can potentially flip enough seats to win back control of the House of Representatives. \u201cI predicted this, OK? And unless we get our act together, we\u2019re going to lose heavily,\u201d said Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, pointing to two recent speeches he\u2019s given where he warned about the President\u2019s divisive rhetoric and impact on the Republican Party going forward. But other Republicans in Congress believe what happened is less about Trump and more about frustration from the GOP base that elected leaders are not following through on key campaign promises. \u201cI think people want results and we got to start delivering results, or we\u2019ll have more election results like that,\u201d Sen. John Thune, the third ranking GOP leader in the chamber, said Wednesday. Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, another leading House conservative, echoed that sentiment. \u201cWe need to start making our legislation match our campaign rhetoric and to date we have not done that,\u201d Meadows said. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of the GOP leadership, said people shouldn\u2019t reach broad conclusions based on Tuesday\u2019s lopsided election results, pointing to historic trends about off year elections. \u201cMidterm elections are always tough for the party in power,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that New Jersey isn\u2019t exactly a red state and Virginia is becoming more blue all the time.\u201d Cornyn said Trump remains very popular in many states where Democratic senators are running for re-election next fall and he is not worried that a Trump backlash could result in his party losing control of the Senate in 2018. \u201cCertainly not in the ten states that he carried that Democrats are running for re-election in, including the five he carried by double digits,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cHe\u2019s still enormously popular in some of those places that that\u2019s how the Senate outcome will be determined.\u201d 5 takeaways from the Democrats' big night Some lawmakers believe voters pulled the lever based on issues they care about in local communities, rather than the White House\u2019s message. \u201cAs you guys know, almost every race has very local elements, very local elements, so I think you want to be careful trying to draw giant national conclusions when every race has local aspects,\u201d said Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska. \u201cSometimes those local aspects are what drives the race.\u201d Virginia GOP Rep. Dave Brat argued the opposite, telling CNN, the reason to GOP lost was \u201cwe failed to nationalize the election.\u201d He said candidates should have emphasized increased costs stemming from the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and stressed the growing economy. Brat, who represents a district near Richmond, became irritated when asked if the strong Democratic turnout in statewide as well as local races gave him pause about running for re-election to his House seat next year, saying to CNN, \u201care you joking?\u201d Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, said he wasn\u2019t clear what message Virginia voters sent but cautioned his Republicans colleagues from dismissing the outcome. \u201cWe ought to be paying attention to what transpired in Virginia. It\u2019s nothing that Republicans can say, it\u2019s irrelevant, it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a message out there and we need to take some time and discern what that is.\u201d What united all Republicans is the notion that the current political environment only increases the pressure on them to pass the main agenda item they are working on now, a sweeping overhaul of the tax code. Without it, they say their own base could stay home. \u201cIf we don\u2019t produce, it\u2019ll get worse,\u201d South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in power, you know there\u2019s gonna be a backlash. It\u2019s not so much of a repudiation of Trump. People don\u2019t see our majority as being effective and we got a base problem.\u201d Virginia GOP rep.: Tuesday night was a referendum on Trump But Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, who recently announced he won\u2019t run for re-election in 2018 because he would likely lose to a challenge from a pro-Trump candidate on the right, argued the problem is the makeup of the party is the issue. \u201cYou can only drill down on the base so hard,\u201d Flake told CNN. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing the limits of that.\u201d GOP Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said tax reform is \u201chuge\u201d and growing as a key issue Republican voters are watching. Republicans' 2018 problem: Trumpism only works for Trump He also stressed that other conservative promises need to be a focus too, like rolling back former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. \u201cFor our base to engage they are looking at what are we going to do in \u201918 on mandates, on the different approaches we have to repealing Obamacare,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be something important, just like Democrats have a base with things that are important to them as well and we can\u2019t always try to ride the fence on those issues.\u201d Who wins and loses under the House GOP tax bill: Let the wonkery begin Meadows said confirming Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court Justice isn\u2019t enough to motivate those who backed the party in 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s only so long that actually carries weight with our base so there needs to be equal motivation across the board.\u201d But Moran also said his GOP leaders need to move beyond just tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare and act on issues with Democrats. Congress \u201cought to be working in a broad bipartisan way on issues that affect Americans across the country,\u201d he said. Pressed if the GOP was facing a choice between policies espoused by the last GOP President, George W. Bush, and the current one, House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox radio host Brian Kilmeade his party is already tied to Trump. \u201cWe already made that choice. We\u2019re with Trump. We already made that choice. That\u2019s a choice we made at the beginning of the year. That\u2019s a choice we made during the campaign,\u201d Ryan asserted, adding, \u201cwe ran on a joint agenda with Donald Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Lauren Fox and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The charges could be the first step in a series of actions by the special counsel The news will complicates the White House's argument that the Russia drama is a Democratic plot It took barely an hour for President Donald Trump\u2019s first, and best, defense to crumble after special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s charging spree. And in a cascade of developments, it quickly became clear that the Russia cloud engulfing the White House is only thickening \u2013 and may not be disbursed until deep into the President\u2019s term, if ever. \u201cTaken together, it seems to me that this is a very important interim development in the Mueller investigation, but only as an appetizer,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas Law School. \u201cAnd like most meals, if all we get is an appetizer, I think folks on all sides of the political spectrum will find the denouement rather unsatisfying. It\u2019s a tantalizing step, but only if it\u2019s the first \u2013 and not the last,\u201d Vladek said. All through the political storm whipped up by Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election, the White House had insisted there is no evidence of collusion between campaign officials and Russians. Trump has gone further, branding the whole thing as a \u201choax\u201d and a plot dreamed up by Democrats still mourning Hillary Clinton\u2019s shock election loss. Ex-Trump campaign adviser pleads guilty to making false statement And though that narrative was contradicted by assessments of US intelligence agencies, it just about held up as a line of political spin through the early twists of an extraordinary morning in Washington. Even after former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his sidekick Rick Gates were indicted by the Mueller probe on Monday on serious and sweeping charges of money laundering and tax fraud, the White House still had an opening. In what passes for good news for this crisis-rocked administration, Manafort and Gates were charged with offenses relating to their business dealings with a former pro-Russia regime in Ukraine, not over activity during the election. The President pounced. Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus????? ....Also, there is NO COLLUSION! \u201cSorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren\u2019t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201c\u2026.Also, there is NO COLLUSION!\u201d White House sources, meanwhile, coalesced around an argument that expectations of a big break in the case around allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia were now proven to be misguided. \u201cToday has zero to do with the White House,\u201d a source close to the administration told CNN. Trump\u2019s attorney Jay Sekulow pointed out to CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer in an interview that that the charges laid against Manafort and Gates pertained to \u201cbusiness activities \u2026 not campaign events.\u201d Who's who in Trump-Russia saga But Mueller had a surprise up his sleeve \u2013 one that cut deep into Trump\u2019s conceit that stories about Russian efforts to forge links with the Trump campaign were simply made up. An hour after the President\u2019s adamant tweet, it emerged that a former foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, had admitted lying to the FBI about contacts with foreign officials close to the Russian government who discussed \u201cdirt\u201d relating to emails linked to Clinton. Court papers also describe an email between Trump campaign officials suggesting they were considering acting on Russian invitations to go to Russia. The indictment does not prove that Trump knew anything about alleged collusion or that the campaign responded to Russian advances. But it is bad news for the White House nonetheless. For one thing, the Papadopoulos affair contradicts Trump\u2019s own assertion that it is now \u201ccommonly agreed\u201d that there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow. Mueller\u2019s pursuit of Papadopoulos shows that the special counsel remains deeply interested in the question \u2013 and could send a chill through other Trump associates and family members embroiled in the Russia drama. The case against the former foreign policy adviser also stands as the most comprehensive evidence yet put forward by Mueller of an attempt by Russian operatives to insinuate themselves with the Trump campaign. Given that Papadopoulos has admitted to trying to coordinate with the Russians during the campaign, it becomes harder for the White House to maintain that no one in Trump\u2019s orbit was guilty of collusion. One approach for Trump\u2019s defenders is to downplay the importance of Papadopoulos in the Trump campaign. \u201cGeorge Papadopoulos served on a committee. Campaigns have committees,\u201d Sekulow said, adding that his legal liability stemmed from a lie he told an FBI agent, not from any activity during the campaign. One former senior adviser told CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger that the foreign policy expert as a \u201czero\u201d and a \u201cnon-event\u201d in the campaign. But another source told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta that Papadopoulos interacted with the campaign a \u201csignificant amount\u201d though was not a familiar face in Trump Tower. In March 2016, however, Papadopoulos was featured in an Instagram picture posted by the Trump campaign at a meeting between the candidate and a group of foreign policy advisors. Trump defenders are also likely to say that the meetings pursued by Papadopoulos did not take place. But his activity adds to a previously known pile of evidence detailed meetings between Trump associates, family members and Russians that did take place, and over which people in Trump\u2019s orbit had not always been truthful. While the Papadopoulos revelations appeared to be the most potentially damaging to Trump, the indictments of Manafort and Gates will also leave a scar, notwithstanding the White House dismissal of them. Trump, after all, was supposed to be the President who would drain the Washington swamp \u2013 but the activities of which Manafort and Gates are accused reek of the insider-ism that Trump has long railed against. And the fact that the campaign manager who managed his convention is now charged with \u201ccrimes against the United States\u201d raises questions about his choice of associates. Trump\u2019s escalating campaign over the last week to discredit the Mueller probe and the deep distrust of the media and Washington authority figures means Mondays revelations are unlikely to harm the President among his closest, most loyal supporters. But the fact that the Manafort case alone will likely drag on for months \u2013 well into 2018 and possibly beyond \u2013 means that hopes in the White House that the Mueller process could be swiftly dismissed will be unfounded. The Republican Party itself now faces a midterm election year with the President being continually tainted by the Russia affair and with several of his former high-profile associates potentially facing jail time after a high profile trial. Democrats did not take long to preview their arguments. \u201cPaul Manafort and Rick Gates ran Trump\u2019s campaign and continued to be a part of his inner circle after Election Day,\u201d Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. \u201cThis underscores the seriousness of the investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. It\u2019s time for Republicans to commit to protecting this investigation and preserving the rule of law.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Cambridge Analytica was hired in the summer of 2016 as part of the Trump campaign's three-pronged data operation News of the email exchange comes amid federal investigations into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia The head of a data analytics company linked to the Trump campaign contacted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2016 regarding thousands of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails kept on a private server while she was secretary of state, according to four sources familiar with the outreach. Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, sent an email to several people including top Donald Trump donor Rebekah Mercer, relaying that he had emailed Assange seeking access to emails from Clinton\u2019s private server to turn them into a searchable database for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee, two of the sources said. Cambridge Analytica was hired in the summer of 2016 as part of the Trump campaign\u2019s three-pronged data operation, which was led by Brad Parscale and overseen by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. No one from the Trump campaign was copied on the email, the sources said. Nix sent the email in summer 2016, two sources said, but it is not clear whether he sent it before or after Cambridge Analytica was brought onto the campaign. Clinton campaign, DNC helped fund dossier research The Daily Beast first reported news of the email outreach. It occurred as Trump increasingly criticized Clinton for deleting thousands of emails from her private server. There is no evidence that the deleted emails were ever hacked or that Wikileaks ever had possession of them. The attempt at collaboration raises fresh questions about the willingness of people associated with the Trump campaign to work with Wikileaks for political gain. The site, which publishes leaked documents, released hacked emails in July from the Democratic National Committee and in October from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. US intelligence has said the Podesta emails were stolen by Russia and handed over to WikiLeaks through an intermediary. News of the email exchange comes amid federal investigations into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Parscale, the Trump campaign\u2019s digital director, was interviewed Tuesday by the House intelligence committee as part of that inquiry. Assange confirmed the exchange in a post on Twitter Wednesday. \u201cI can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica [prior to November last year] and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks,\u201d he tweeted. Protester throws Russian flags at Trump on Capitol Hill The 33,000 emails deleted from Clinton\u2019s private server have never materialized. Nix and Cambridge Analytica, which is backed by Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, did not respond to requests for comment. After the Daily Beast report published, the Trump campaign issued a statement by campaign executive director Michael S. Glassner: \u201cOnce President Trump secured the nomination in 2016, one of the most important decisions we made was to partner with the Republican National Committee on data analytics. Leading into the election, the RNC had invested in the most sophisticated data targeting program in modern American in history, which helped secure our victory in the fall. We were proud to have worked with the RNC and its data experts and relied on them as our main source for data analytics. We as a campaign made the choice to rely on the voter data of the Republican National Committee to help elect President Donald J. Trump. Any claims that voter data from any other source played a key role in the victory are false.\u201d The statement does not address contacts between Cambridge Analytica and WikiLeaks. In Parscale\u2019s congressional interview, he denied there was any Russian collusion with the campaign\u2019s digital operations, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Many of the committee\u2019s questions for Parscale were about the campaign\u2019s work with Cambridge Analytica, the sources said. The committee asked the digital firm for documents earlier this month, and Cambridge Analytica said it was cooperating. Trump attorney Cohen to meet with Hill investigators this week Parscale downplayed the campaign\u2019s connections to Cambridge Analytica, one of the sources said. He began working for the Trump Organization\u2019s digital team in early 2015 before Trump officially announced his plan to run for office. Parscale and employees from his firm, Giles-Parscale, incorporated some staffers from Cambridge Analytica into their data operation. They also worked with teams from data companies that were partnering with the Republican National Committee. In July 2016, Trump called on Russia to find the emails. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let\u2019s see if that happens. That\u2019ll be next,\u201d Trump said in a news conference. News of the outreach comes after an earlier disclosure that a Republican operative, Peter W. Smith, had been on the hunt for Clinton\u2019s missing emails during the campaign. Smith spoke to The Wall Street Journal in May, saying he and the colleagues he enlisted found five groups of hackers claiming to have 33,000 deleted emails from the private server Clinton used during her tenure as secretary of state. Trump says he hasn't been asked to do Mueller interview He said that he determined two of the groups were Russian. \u201cWe knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government,\u201d Smith told the Journal. Smith was found dead of an apparent suicide weeks after the interview. Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former White House chief strategist, was vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica until he stepped down to run the Trump campaign in August 2016, according to The New York Times. The Mercers are investors in Breitbart News, the far-right site where Bannon served as executive chairman before he ran Trump\u2019s campaign. Political strategist Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s long-time confidant, had boasted during the campaign of knowledge about upcoming Wikileaks publication of damaging documents, at one point telling the Boston Herald Radio that he expected \u201cJulian Assange and the Wikileaks people to drop a payload of new documents on a weekly basis fairly soon. And that of course will answer the question of exactly what was erased on that email server.\u201d Fusion GPS asks court to stop lawmakers from seeing financial records Stone was questioned privately by the House intelligence committee in September about the identity of his intermediary with Wikileaks. An attorney for Stone told CNN, \u201cMr. Stone has complied with the committee\u2019s requests. No further statement will be issued.\u201d After the hearing, Stone said he answered the committee\u2019s questions other than revealing the identity of his intermediary because that person was a journalist and the conversation was off the record. \u201cI\u2019m not going to burn somebody I spoke to off the record,\u201d Stone said. \u201cIf he releases me, if he allows me to release it, I would be happy to give it to the committee. I\u2019m actually going to try to do that.\u201d Stone has previously denied any contact with Assange and any advanced notice of WikiLeaks release of emails belonging to Podesta.

            "article_content": "The figure comes with a \"righteous fist to fight for the middle class\" A Kickstarter campaign to fund the action figure has raised over $70,000 since Tuesday If you\u2019ve ever wanted to carry around a pocket-sized, persistent senator wherever you go, now\u2019s your big \u2013 or, well, little \u2013 chance. A Kickstarter campaign to create an Elizabeth Warren action figure has raised over $71,000 as of Friday afternoon, far surpassing the campaign\u2019s original $15,000 goal. More than 2,000 people have donated since the campaign launched Tuesday. \u201cWe expected it to do reasonably well \u2026 literally the first day it did four times better than that,\u201d creator Jason Feinberg told CNN. The $19 figure comes equipped with everything that any practical, liberal female politician could ask for: sensible boots to march on Washington, rolled up sleeves to wrestle with big banks, even a righteous fist raised proudly in the air to fight for the middle class. Feinberg started making political action figures in 2008 for his company, FCTRY, after watching then-candidate Barack Obama speak at a debate in Iowa. Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders are also in the brigade of prominent pint-sized Democrats. Adding the Massachusetts senator to the mix had been in the back of Feinberg\u2019s mind, but actually creating the figure took a back seat during the 2016 election season. Feinberg had expected Clinton to win the presidential election, so his work with her and a complementary \u201cEvil Trump\u201d figure took precedence. \u201cWarren was like the antidote to that,\u201d Feinberg said. \u201cShe\u2019s a really positive figure who\u2019s also fighting, and that\u2019s really what we were trying to channel, that peculiar mix of strength and persistence.\u201d It was Warren\u2019s famous moment of persistence earlier this year that prompted FCTRY to start a campaign for her own figure. After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell interrupted Warren from reading a letter by Coretta Scott King on the Senate floor, he uttered what became a viral mantra of feminist resistance: \u201cShe was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\u201d \u201cRight then and there we glimpsed the future; where the far left would become the mainstream,\u201d FCTRY wrote on the Kickstarter campaign. \u201cThe fight had already begun \u2013 and Elizabeth Warren was leading the charge.\u201d Some of the profits from the Kickstarter campaign and Warren\u2019s figure sales will go toward Emily\u2019s List, a nonprofit organization helping elect pro-choice Democratic women to office.",

            "article_content": "'You go to Cyprus because that's where Russians launder money,' said Rep. Mike Quigley Manafort strongly denies any wrongdoing in connection with his work for Trump and foreign officials A Democrat on the House intelligence committee flew to Cyprus last week as part of the panel\u2019s broad investigation into allegations that Russian operatives and top aides on President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign colluded to influence the US election. \u201cYou go to Cyprus because that\u2019s where Russians launder money,\u201d said Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Illinois, in explaining the reason for his trip. The Mediterranean island nation has become a part of the sprawling probe following an Associated Press report last month that said as part of an anti-corruption investigation into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s work in eastern Europe, Treasury officials obtained information regarding financial payments Manafort may have received through Cypriot banks. The AP story cites a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. Manafort\u2019s finances and consulting work are drawing attention as Ukrainian officials try to determine whether he received improper payments as part of their corruption investigation into ex-President Victor Yanukovych \u2013 Manafort\u2019s former client. US authorities also are investigating possible Ukrainian corruption and any role Manafort might have played in Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In addition to reporting on Manfort\u2019s financial transactions in Cyprus, the AP reported earlier this week that a firm he headed received $1.2 million in off-the-books payments for work done in support of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Manafort strongly denies any wrongdoing in connection with his work for Trump and foreign officials. He has offered to testify in the House and Senate intelligence committees\u2019 investigations into Russia\u2019s election interference. \u201cLike many companies doing business internationally, my company was paid via wire transfer, typically using clients\u2019 preferred financial institutions and instructions,\u201d Manafort said in a statement to CNN last Friday. A source close to Manafort also told CNN Manafort did not choose to use any banks in Cyprus, but his clients made that choice. The source said Manafort used the US bank Wachovia to receive payments. Quigley spent two days in Cyprus this week with staff investigators from the House Intelligence Committee, but no other members of the panel. He declined to discuss who he interviewed or which documents he might have viewed. Broadly speaking, Quigley said the trip was critical to understanding how Russians move money. \u201cUnderstanding how that works is important to understanding how they fund their regime, what are the motivations for laundering money \u2026 \u201d Quigley said. \u201cYou launder money to avoid taxes, to avoid worldwide sanctions.\u201d In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d a week after the trip, Quigley declined to go into detail about what he might have learned or if he discovered any wrongdoing. \u201cI can\u2019t reveal what I was told in confidence,\u201d Quigley said. However, he still implored people to focus on questions related to Cyprus. \u201cThis is where a lot of money laundering takes place,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cThis is where the Russians act, and this is where key figures in the investigation have played as well.\u201d \"It has been known as Russia's laundromat\" @repmikequigley details trip to Cyprus for #Trump-Russia investigation https://t.co/ytmtJn1CEY Manafort\u2019s personal finances \u2013 including a series of multimillion-dollar real estate purchases from 2006 to 2012 while he was working with Ukrainians and a Russian industrialist \u2013 have drawn increased scrutiny. House and Senate investigators have not said yet when they plan to call Manafort to testify, but the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, has said it may take some time for investigators complete research before bringing in high-profile targets. Quigley said last week he is likely to travel overseas again as part of the investigation, but no details have been firmed up yet. Democratic members on the House Russia investigation have taken to specializing in certain aspects of the issue and focusing their research and questioning in specific areas. Quigley would not say what his specialty is. However, during the House intelligence committee\u2019s first public hearing last month, Quigley focused his line of questioning on how people can unwittingly be co-opted by Russian agents posing as businesspeople in Eastern Europe. Quigley also traveled to Ukraine in February he and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin met with Ukrainian leaders. Quigley said he was able to do some investigating while there, but did not disclose any details.",

O\u2019Donnell, then a co-host of \u201cThe View,\u201d slammed Trump the next day during the show\u2019s \u201chot topics\u201d segment. Trump fired back in a People Magazine interview, calling her \u201ca real loser.\u201d He called her a \u201cpig\u201d multiple times, comments Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton seized on during the election. He responded during a September general election debate, saying she deserved it. \u201cSomebody who\u2019s been very vicious to me, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, I said very tough things to her and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her,\u201d he said on the debate stage. His @realDonaldTrump Twitter account has tweeted about O\u2019Donnell 60 times since 2011. \u201cSorry, @Rosie is a mentally sick woman, a bully, a dummy and, above all, a loser. Other than that she is just wonderful!\u201d he tweeted in 2014, six months before he announced his candidacy. Sorry, @Rosie is a mentally sick woman, a bully, a dummy and, above all, a loser. Other than that she is just wonderful! \"@Chris_Nima: @realDonaldTrump Would you rather have a 3rd Obama term or make out with Rosie??\"  I'll take the third term! Please send a psychiatrist to help @Rosie, she\u2019s in a bad state. To @Rosie\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s parents--- get (cont) http://t.co/1c9yApM4 In 2013, he was asked whether he\u2019d rather have a third Obama term or \u201cmake out with Rosie.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take the third term,\u201d he tweeted, later adding that it would take \u201cOne trillion, at least!\u201d for that to happen. O\u2019Donnell has dished it right back, tweeting about Trump over 150 times, calling him a \u201cSTUPID LYING ARROGANT ONE SENTENCE SNIFFER,\u201d a \u201cSEXUAL PREDATOR,\u201d and a \u201cCON MAN.\u201d NO ITS U DONALD !! U SEXUAL PREDATOR !!! U ABUSER WE SEE YOU !!! #debatenight U STUPID LYING ARROGANT ONE SENTENCE SNIFFER --- U R A BAD BAD PERSON DONALD - snifffff sifffffff #debatenight On Tuesday evening, O\u2019Donnell told the crowd that she had only actually met Trump twice. Once during his wedding to Marla Maples, and once at a game show. \u201cI don\u2019t know him. I know he\u2019s a bully, he\u2019s a mean man, he hates women, he\u2019s taken away women\u2019s rights, and we will not stand for it,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t fear the rain,\u201d she told the crowd, promising to come back to the stage to lead a sing-a-long. The rainy speeches continued for over an hour before the protesters began the march toward the Capitol. O\u2019Donnell never returned to the stage, but an organizer told the crowd she\u2019d be marching. CNN\u2019s Deena Zaru contributed to this report.",

And judging from the line outside a Minneapolis tattoo parlor earlier this week, \u201cnevertheless, she persisted\u201d is still resonating strongly. On Tuesday, more than 100 women \u2013 and a few men \u2013 waited in line at Brass Knuckle Tattoo Studio to get a tattoo of the quote. Writer Nora McInerny accidentally ignited the movement when she created a Facebook event set to public rather than private. She knew a few friends who were interested in the tattoo, and thought it would be fun to get them together. Within a few days, 1,900 people said they were interested. Brass Knuckle was shocked by the turnout. \u201cThere were already people lining up at 11 even though it started at 3,\u201d Shawn Phelps, owner of the studio, told CNN. Graphic designer Chelsea Brink designed the phrase in three different variations, and three artists came in on their off day. There were about 150 people in line, but the artists had to stop after tattooing 70. \u201cThe three of us tattooed people from 3 p.m. until midnight, and then we couldn\u2019t do anymore,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cWe were running out of supplies.\u201d Hundreds of people have expressed interest in the tattoo since the event. \u201cYesterday the phone rang so much that it killed the battery,\u201d Phelps said, laughing. The event raised more than $4,000 for Women Winning, which supports the election of pro-choice women of all political parties to all levels of public office. The tattoos cost $75, but the studio says it only kept $20 to cover the cost of supplies. The rest was donated. \u201cIt was amazing and gratifying to see so many women gathered to support our mission of electing pro-choice women here in Minnesota,\u201d Lauren Beecham, executive director of Women Winning, told CNN. \u201cWe knew there were many interested on social media but we were floored by the incredible outpouring of support \u2013 which only mirrors the energy and passion we\u2019ve seen since the election.\u201d Brink is willing to share her art with anyone who wants it, under the condition that they make a donation to a woman\u2019s rights organization in exchange. \u201cThe whole point was not just to get a tattoo but to make it an active way to get involved and make a difference in our community,\u201d Brink told CNN. \u201cIt was pretty amazing to watch and be a part of it,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cIt ended up being such a movement that I\u2019ve never seen before. It was incredible.\u201d \u201cShe was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\u201d The line was delivered by McConnell after Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren read a letter written 30 years ago by Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., opposing the nomination of Jeff Sessions for a federal judgeship. Republicans accused Warren of violating Senate rules against impugning another senator, which was upheld by a vote. Democrats across the country immediately re-purposed the line as a battle cry in the form of T-shirts, phone cases, and the hashtag #LetLizSpeak. Just weeks after the historic Woman\u2019s March took place worldwide, women took to Twitter to share their stories of \u2018persisting\u2019 through sexism. As for the comments already piling up regarding the tattoos, McInerny isn\u2019t bothered. \u201cThis is not a tattoo for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is for every woman I know or don\u2019t know. People have taken this as some sort of personal affront when it isn\u2019t. It feels personally important to have these little reminders.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Betsy DeVos is expected to win Senate confirmation Tuesday but Democrats are still fighting At least one more Republican senator would have to vote against DeVos Democrats are mounting a 24-hour blitz to try and sink at least one nomination from President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, attacking education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos a day before her confirmation vote. Democratic senators promised to stay up all night debating DeVos early into Tuesday morning and also took to Twitter to urge residents to light up Senate phonelines. But Republicans are still expected to narrowly win her approval, with Vice President Mike Pence set to cast the first the tie-breaking vote in history for a Cabinet appointment. The DeVos fight has become emblematic of the knock-down brawls that Democrats have set for almost all of Trump\u2019s top nominees \u2013 dragging out, but ultimately unable to stop their approval. \u201cThe American people are speaking in one loud voice against this nominee. I\u2019ve had people come up to me and say \u2018I voted for Donald Trump, but I want you to vote against this nominee,\u2019\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday, kicking off the lengthy, final debate over DeVos. The secretary for the Department of Education might not the most consequential of positions inside the Trump administration, but the decision by two Republicans \u2013 Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine \u2013 to vote against her and a backlash among liberals angry at Democrats who supported other Trump nominees last month jelled over the weekend into the nastiest battle so far. Senate Republicans already voted last week against a filibuster of DeVos \u2013 setting up a final vote for her Tuesday. But despite the opposition to a filibuster, her nomination could still be spiked if Democrats succeed in winning one more Republican to their side, something Schumer alluded to in his comments. \u201cI understand the pull of party loyalty. I understand the deference to a new president. But from what we have seen in the first two weeks of this administration, party loyalty is demanding too much of my Republican colleagues,\u201d Schumer said. With less than a day until the vote, however, it\u2019s unclear who exactly that final vote could be. Democratic groups have focused their efforts on Republicans they see as vulnerable including Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, both union strongholds. Both Heller and Toomey have released statements in recent days reaffirming their support for DeVos. The DeVos battle is likely just the start for this week in heated nomination fights \u2013 attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions and Health and Human Services pick Tom Price are both awaiting battles in the full Senate. Their formal absence from the White House has been highlighted periodically by Republicans who say they are waiting for a health care plan from the new administration and the continuing battles over the travel ban. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 fresh off his successful strategy of stalling on President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court last year which culminated in conservative Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination last week \u2013 blasted Senate Democrats for stalling on Trump\u2019s picks. \u201cIt seems this gridlock and opposition has far less to do with the nominees actually before us than the man who nominated them,\u201d McConnell said Monday. \u201cThe Democratic leader and his colleagues are under a great deal of pressure from those on the left who simply cannot accept the results of a democratic election. They\u2019re calling for Democrats to delay and punt and blockade the serious work of the Senate at any cost.\u201d And Democratic senators themselves \u2013 who avoid direct attacks on their Republican colleagues as a matter of professional decorum inside the Capitol \u2013 stoked the anger of the base with a series of tweets urging people to light up the Senate phones. Congress has been bombarded with calls from both sides of the debate, but DeVos\u2019 nomination in particular appears to have sparked much of the anger. Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, told CNN last week that as many as 1.5 million calls per day have been pouring into the Senate this week about Trump\u2019s nominations in general, according to data from Schumer\u2019s staff. Multiple offices reported that a bulk of messages haves been related to DeVos. RELATED: Congress deluged with phone calls Democrats, backed by public school groups and teachers\u2019 unions, have lambasted her background bankrolling efforts to support opposing ideas like school vouchers. They also latched on to a surprisingly weak performance by DeVos at her confirmation hearing. For Democratic activists and party leaders still reeling from November, the focus on Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks is a better choice than pointing their ire at Gorsuch, which would draw vulnerable Democrats into the line of fire. Meanwhile, Republican groups supporting Trump continued their on-air battle to push from the other side, in support of the picks. \u201cPresident Trump needs a strong team, his team to make America great again. Don\u2019t let Washington get in the way,\u201d said a narrator for the spot from 45 Committee, a pro-Trump group that has spent $4 million in advertising so far supporting Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. The 45 Committee website was taken down Monday after hackers broke in and re-labeled sections of the site \u201cFake News\u201d and \u201cMake America S****y Again\u201d and scrawled \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d across one of the pages. Democratic senators, meanwhile, planned to take their protests through the morning \u2013 with a possible protest on the Capitol grounds and lawmakers signing up for shifts to talk against DeVos on the Senate floor. About 250 protesters, many of them teachers, gathered across the street from the Capitol Monday evening and chanted \u201cJust one more!\u201d \u2013 referring to the one more Republican vote they need. Protesters latched onto DeVos\u2019 testimony where she suggested guns may be required on some rural campus to fight off bears. The answer became a viral hit on the left \u2013 with one protester dressed in a bear suit Monday and another holding a sign reading, \u201cBetsy DeVos is \u2018bearly\u2019 qualified.\u201d",

The police restrained some of them, blocking them from entering the same area as the Trump protest group. Protest organizers in New Zealand\u2019s capital, Wellington, said about 700 people turned out there for a women\u2019s march. Marches were also held in Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin.

Follow him @deanofcomedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Outrage! That\u2019s what we saw from some Fox News on-air personalities this past week. So why the Fox freak-out? Simple: Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. In response to the investigation heating up, Fox News gave us a synchronized display of the same talking points \u2013 all designed to undermine Mueller and help Donald Trump. These Fox News personalities truly seem more outraged at Mueller than at the Russian government for attacking our democracy! There was the captain of Trump\u2019s cheerleading squad, Sean Hannity, declaring on his Fox News TV show that Mueller and his team of investigators were an \u201cutter disgrace.\u201d Hannity then amped up the hysterics by claiming that this investigation poses a \u201cdirect threat to you, the American people, and our American republic,\u201d as he called for Mueller to resign. Then there was Laura Ingraham, who said of the Mueller investigation: \u201cWhat a total travesty, they should all step aside \u2026 including Bob Mueller.\u201d Mueller attorney praised Yates as DOJ official, email shows Lou Dobbs also partook in the attack-Mueller reindeer games on his Fox Business network show, proclaiming it was \u201ctime to kill the investigation.\u201d Dobbs then bizarrely added that \u201cthe person who should be investigated is Barack Obama.\u201d Why? According to Dobbs, because the Russian interference \u201coccurred under his administration.\u201d Apparently he thinks that Obama helped Trump get elected so that Trump could try to dismantle every accomplishment of his presidency. Fox\u2019s Gregg Jarrett deserves an award for his unique take on how to dump Mueller. He called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia investigation because he had failed to disclose his own contacts with a Russian diplomat during his Senate confirmation process, to now \u201cun-recuse himself\u201d for the \u201csole purpose\u201d of getting rid of \u201cpartisans, including Robert Mueller.\u201d Even former Speaker of the House and Fox News political contributor Newt Gingrich, who had praised Mueller when he was first appointed in May as a \u201csuperb choice\u201d whose reputation was \u201cimpeccable for honesty and integrity,\u201d said on air this week that \u201cMueller is corrupt. The senior FBI is corrupt.\u201d This was like an updated version of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d as Fox News\u2019s on-air talent toed the party line in defense of the President. Why Mueller banished a top agent to the FBI's 'Siberia' The purported reason for much of Team Fox\u2019s outrage was because they had just learned that back in August, Mueller had removed an FBI agent, Peter Strzok, from his investigation, after finding out that Strzok and a colleague had exchanged messages that could be interpreted as pro-Hillary Clinton. This proved, as Hannity put it, that Muller and his colleagues are a \u201cpartisan, extremely biased, hyperpartisan attack team.\u201d Never mind that Mueller himself was a registered Republican and that he had been appointed to head the FBI in 2001 by Republican President George W. Bush. In reality, it was likely the recent guilty plea by Trump\u2019s former national security advisor Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI that has been scaring the bejesus out of  these Mueller-bashers. All of a sudden, the prospect of Trump being implicated in this scandal \u2013 or at least dogged by it for years to come \u2013 got very real. Presumably, the realpolitik goal of Trump\u2019s Fox News defenders is to undermine any findings by Mueller that could implicate Trump in wrongdoing. After all, impeachment is a political remedy, and with the GOP controlling the House of Representatives, where the impeachment process must start per the Constitution, Fox is doing its best to convince Republican voters that any anti-Trump conclusions by Mueller are biased and should be ignored \u2013 and to relieve some of the pressure on Republican House members to impeach Trump, should things get to that point. But while Fox may be able to convince its viewers to ignore Mueller, it won\u2019t be so easy to get those outside the Fox bubble to get on board. A recent Washington Post-ABC poll found that 58% of Americans approve of Mueller\u2019s handling of this investigation \u2013 with only 28% disapproving.  Even 38% of Republicans approved of Mueller\u2019s handling of this investigation. These numbers also spell trouble for Trump if he were to follow the advice of his Fox friends and fire Mueller.  Dumping Mueller \u2013 who has far higher approval ratings than Trump \u2013 could translate into a bloodbath for Congressional Republicans come the 2018 midterm elections, as voters could use these elections to send a message to the President. It\u2019s unsettling that some are more worked up about Mueller than the Russian government\u2019s attack on our election, our democracy. But at least we can rest easy knowing that, despite the Fox freak out, the Mueller investigation is continuing.",

First, no matter how much they might insist otherwise, Republicans consistently prioritize the economic advantage and security of big business and the very wealthy at the expense of middle- and low-income Americans. And, second, no matter how much he might insist otherwise, Donald Trump is in perfect lockstep with the core of the Republican economic agenda. Around 2 a.m. on Saturday, Republican senators passed an approximately 500-page package of legislation that had reportedly been influenced by over 6,000 corporate lobbyists \u2013 more than half of all the lobbyists in Washington, according to Public Citizen, a nonprofit organization representing consumer interests. In doing so, they effectively raised taxes on millions of middle-class and poor Americans in order to give giant tax handouts to big business and the wealthy. The GOP's rush to tax cuts was brainless And now, it\u2019s about to get worse. Reports are that Republicans will use the giant deficits created by their corporate giveaways to justify cuts to Social Security and Medicare \u2013 cuts that will further hurt middle class families and the poor. In other words, the Republican tax plan ostensibly increases the tax burden on middle- and low-income Americans while reducing the tax burden on corporations and the 1% \u2013 under the theory that giving more money to economic elites, while adding a projected $1 trillion to the deficit, somehow trickles down to those less fortunate. Economists have already said the economic promises of the Republican tax plan are smoke and mirrors, but adding more cuts to the social safety net amounts to a perfect storm. Most Americans see rampant inequality and poverty in our economy as a problem. The Republican tax plan sees it as a strategy on which to double down. Since Trump began his campaign for the presidency, both the left and right have painted him as extreme. Progressives (myself included) have portrayed Trump as a radical departure from conventional politics, both because he lacks the experience or seriousness to do the job but also because he seems to embrace extremist ideology. Just consider his tweets last week reposting videos from Islamophobic extremists. Trump supporters, on the other hand, have portrayed their hero as anathema to the Republican establishment \u2013 Trump is \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d and \u201cdraining the swamp.\u201d A vote for this tax plan is a vote against women and families Yet here we have a president who, as every indication suggests, supports a tax policy literally written by the paid Washington lobbyists who are the very muck of that swamp. And the bill advances the conventional stock-in-trade, pro-big business agenda that has and will always be the lifeblood of Republican politics. Trump campaigned pretending otherwise. In April 2016, Trump said he believes in raising taxes on the rich \u2013 including rich people like himself. In May 2016, Trump said on \u201cMeet The Press,\u201d \u201cFor the wealthy, I think, frankly, it\u2019s going to go up. And you know what? It really should go up.\u201d  As President, he\u2019s continued many of the same assertions, telling The Wall Street Journal in July of this year, \u201cthe truth is the people I care most about are the middle-income people in this country who have gotten screwed.\u201d Now, Trump is the one screwing the middle class to give himself a tax break. And still lying about it. \u201cThis is going to cost me a fortune,\u201d Trump told supporters in Missouri a few days ago. \u201cThis is not good for me.\u201d That was a lie. In fact, Trump could save more than $1 billion under the Republican tax plan that he is supporting. Of course, we\u2019d know more if Trump would finally release his taxes.  He also promised during the election not to cut Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare. And reiterated those promises a few weeks ago. But the tax bill sets up Republicans to do just that, pretending they have no choice but to make deep cuts in federal spending because they drained public money with corporate giveaways. The truth is no matter how much his supporters try to portray him otherwise, Trump is fully supportive of the conservative fiscal agenda \u2013 cutting government supports for poor and middle-class Americans in order to fund giant giveaways to corporations and the super rich. And no matter what he insisted during the campaign, or his lies to the contrary since, Trump has proven himself consistently loyal to one group and one group only \u2013 his fellow big business billionaires. That\u2019s who really won this election, and who are the winners of this tax bill.  The rest of us, to borrow a phrase from Trump, are losers.",

            "article_content": "CNN asked a group of women and men \u2013 actors, writers and other thinkers \u2013 to explore questions raised not just by the harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, but by a series of recent challenges to women that have reopened discussion about sexual harassment, gender and power: What is the biggest impediment to equality for women and girls today? And what made you realize anew that it was there? The views expressed here are solely those of the authors. I was privileged to learn orienteering as a Girl Scout, work as an au pair in Europe, and take wilderness survival classes in college. When I became an actress, naive as it sounds, I hadn\u2019t really hit an obstacle because of my gender. So when the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes came out, and I heard a presidential candidate brag about sexual assault, and with a kind of easy laughter, my knees went weak. And my heart went out to all the young girls who heard it on the news that night, and for the young women who were voting in their first presidential election. I had a similar feeling after recent news stories recounted allegations against Harvey Weinstein. These famous incidents make the news, but they are not singular. This behavior of white male dominance is understood and cherished \u2013 that\u2019s what I hear in the shared laughter on that \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. These conversations expose all the work we have to do, just to admit where we\u2019re at, so we can find our way to equality, and I see that as a sign of hope. Piper Perabo is an actress known for her role as CIA agent Annie Walker in the TV series \u201cCovert Affairs,\u201d for which she was earned a Golden Globe nomination in  2010. She has appeared in numerous films, including \u201cLooper,\u201d \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d \u201cImagine Me and You,\u201d and her breakout role in \u201cCoyote Ugly.\u201d  Perabo is also a voice of advocacy for the International Rescue Committee. As a teenager on a New Delhi bus, I would invariably feel a hand down my shirt or up my skirt. It was an everyday occurrence. That, on top of an assault at 9, just made the extraordinary event of sexual violence, into the most ordinary thing. I did what most of us do: kept silent. But even at 9, it was a calculated choice. I chose to stay silent because it was better than telling parents and teachers and they not doing/unable to do anything about it. By staying silent, I betrayed just myself. Speaking out would have led to my betrayal by the people I loved the most. Then, on December 16, 2012, Jyoti Singh Pandey, a 23-year-old medical student, boarded a bus in New Delhi. She was gang-raped, beaten and tortured by six men. Though she lived only for a few days, she found the strength to testify against her attackers, to demand justice for herself. The press called her \u201cNibhaya\u201d \u2013 fearless one. Her story inspired me and so many women across India and the world to break our silences. We\u2019d had enough. The dam had simply burst. We began to see the violence as extraordinary again. Silence is a hard thing to understand. I thought it protected me, but it protected my perpetrators. I thought it would end the violence, but it was actually what was perpetuating it. I thought the silence was all mine, but it was what made me deeply complicit in the culture of violence. Bana Alabed's message on #DayOfTheGirl My silence, layered on top of the silences of millions of other women, created a system where there was no accountability. When we broke it, we were sure the system would collapse, that our breaking of the silence would end the cycle of violence. But as more women dare to break their silences, many times at enormous costs to themselves, we are faced with an entirely new reality. There is no real fallout, no real consequences. Although Kate Winslet has denounced Harvey Weinstein, I\u2019ll never forget that line from an interview she gave: \u201cWhen Roman Polanski invites you to join him in any project, you really don\u2019t say no.\u201d Because I want her, I need her and everyone else to scream \u201cNo.\u201d Because so many of us couldn\u2019t \u2013 we were too young, too scared, too frozen. Does violence against women not count? (Polanski is the film director who fled the United States to avoid prison for raping  a 13-year-old girl in 1977.) Why would a university overlook a sexual harassment charge and begin to promote someone to dean? Why would it be up to the discretion of an officer to submit a rape kit when in reality, it should be mandatory? Does violence against women not count? That apology letter that Harvey Weinstein wrote wasn\u2019t the sound of a man oblivious to the gravity of the accusations of sexual harassment and assault that have been made against him. It\u2019s the sound of a man who has read so many scripts, he knows the ending better than anyone else. Expect him to lie low for a while, then emerge under a new company with a new name \u2013 maybe with a phoenix-rising logo \u2013 and go back to business as usual. The system will support his slow integration, while it will continue to betray those who have the courage to speak out. Poorna Jagannathan is an actress and producer best known for her portrayal of Safar Khan in the Emmy-nominated show \u201cThe Night Of.\u201d In response to the 2012 gang rape and death of Jyoti Singh Pandey, she initiated and produced the play \u201cNirbhaya,\u201d written and directed by Yael Farber. The allegations against Harvey Weinstein are grotesque and horrifying and familiar. How many women read about Weinstein literally blocking a woman\u2019s path, and thought, \u201cYep, I\u2019ve been there\u201d? How many women remembered their own experiences pushing away unwanted embraces and uninvited hands? Or worse? This isn\u2019t just a Hollywood story. This is an everywhere story. It\u2019s the story of men in power using and abusing it against women, cajoling and taking, berating and threatening, trapping and menacing. It\u2019s the story of women being doubted and called crazy or labeled as gold diggers or attention seekers, or more likely not saying anything at all because by all available metrics that\u2019s the safest, easiest way to go. And yes, it\u2019s the story of thinking that when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything. There are many things that are truly shocking about the Harvey Weinstein story \u2013 the brazenness of the overtures, the sheer number of women he allegedly harassed, intimidated and forced himself upon \u2013 but the mind reels at realizing just how many people had to have known something for so long. Assistants and producers and actors and publicists and colleagues (and \u201cprocurers\u201d to make things even grosser) \u2013 that this was such an open secret speaks to the normalization of treating women as casually disposable objects. And it speaks to a culture that not only tolerates, but lionizes, the men who treat them that way.

I have been working to prevent men\u2019s violence against women since I retired from pro football in 1994. Awareness of the problem has grown, but critical, underlying causes remain unchecked. Men are still silent. I came to realize we don\u2019t raise boys to be men, we raise them not to be women. In other words, we don\u2019t deliberately nurture boys to be emotionally whole (and nonviolent). We leave them vulnerable to a broader culture dominated by patriarchy and traditions of silence from men \u2013 about themselves, and the sexism and misogyny that harm women. To break that silence I examined the culture in which I was nurtured. This led me to a crucial question I ask all men. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst insult you heard as a boy?\u201d The answer: \u201cYou throw like a girl!\u201d  This charge enforces a narrow view of masculinity \u2013 demanding that boys \u201cman up\u201d \u2013 and delivers an insidiously dangerous message that girls and women are \u201cless than.\u201d My work is focused on the deliberate and intentional engagement of boys and men, not simply to prevent violence against women, but to help boys and men recognize how sexism diminishes them while simultaneously supporting a culture of misogyny and silence about men\u2019s violence against women.

The only way for women and girls to remain an influential part in society is to constantly engage in discussion, even when we aren\u2019t welcome. We constantly struggle with stereotypes against girls who are intelligent, articulate, and active members of school and society - a role still associated with men. An \u201cintimidating\u201d girl describes an intelligent girl involved in many extracurriculars, like we are. When one of us was repeatedly targeted and insulted by a male in our class, we were called \u201cmean\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d for standing up for ourselves. A 17-year-old girl from China recently told us that her parents wanted a boy, and therefore left her in an orphanage. She grew up assuming that male was the better sex, and told people that she wanted a career that helped males, such as a nurse or cook. She now knows women are just strong as men, and wants to be a scientist. We want other girls to be aware of their strength and potential, too. Women must have opportunities to be represented as powerful figures, from directors to politicians, or as mothers. We take issue with the fact that we don\u2019t feel enough is being done to change the view of \u201cgirl.\u201d Even as ordinary teenagers with school and homework, we believe, together, we can initiate change.

Remember the girl in Mali who cannot go to school, but watches her brother go every day. Remember the girl in Chad in a forced marriage, the girl who has never had a chance to explore her potential before becoming a wife, a mother. Remember the girl kidnapped from her school in 2014 in Northern Nigeria, who was forced to become the \u201cwife\u201d of a rebel army member and is going through hell daily. And remember the women right here in the United States, who have been assaulted and violated and disrespected by powerful men and silenced by corrupt systems of power and control. Remember that girl in every woman you encounter who deserves to discover her potential, her power, and how to fly. She must function in a world that too often treats her like prey, clips her wings, burdens her with tormented memories of fear and shame. Remember that girl today, the same girl inside so many women, full of wounds but bandaged over with silence and a smile. Remember the world she is in, so often hostile to her truth, to the fullness and volume of her voice. The world that convinces her she is always to blame. Take the time today not only to remember, but to listen, to learn, to start to understand what if feels like, in this world, for a girl. And resolve to make it better. For her.

I was speaking to my executive producer about the stories surrounding Harvey Weinstein \u2013 a man whose alleged despicable lechery and abuse of power was widely known among women in my line of business. And we came to the conclusion that though it\u2019s been too long coming, these revelations are a positive step forward. As media moguls like Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Roger Ailes and others fall, they send a strong message to other predators that this level of harassment will no longer be tolerated. But the bigger issue is that we don\u2019t teach men how to appropriately communicate their feelings to women. We don\u2019t explain to them that being rejected does not make them less of men.  We need to give them the correct vocabulary to express themselves. We need to help ingrain in them messages of self-love so that they don\u2019t act out their repressed frustrations on others. That\u2019s how we will make a safer society for us all. Erin Richards is an actress, writer and director. She stars as Barbara Keen on Fox\u2019s \u201cGotham.\u201d She is a spokesperson for Global Citizen, a social action platform for change. I joined the fight to close the gender gap in tech after a political campaign where I saw coding and robotics classes full of boys. I couldn\u2019t stop coming back to the faces I didn\u2019t see \u2013 I kept thinking, where are the girls? I started an organization to do something about that, but these days you can\u2019t flip on the TV or check your news feed without hearing about horrible mistreatment of women. Whistleblowers from college campuses to Silicon Valley to Hollywood have begun to bring rampant, closeted sexual harassment out of the shadows, yet for every brave woman who speaks out, hundreds of powerful men remain silent and thus complicit. These men could turn the tide far faster than women can \u2013 that\u2019s a sad but true fact \u2013 and yet they don\u2019t. As a result, casual, small acts of sexism may hang around for another whole generation. That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that as any psychologist or self-empowerment guru will tell you, how we respond and act in the face of that is up to us. I believe we need to stop trying to wrestle for power, respect and opportunities from others and instead make them for ourselves. Reshma Saujani is the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, a national nonprofit organization working to close the gender gap in technology. She is the author of \u201cWomen Who Don\u2019t Wait in Line.\u201d When you campaign and write books claiming to be a protector of women, it should take no time for you to condemn the despicable actions of movie mogul and Democratic donor Harvey Weinstein.  For some reason, it took former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama five days to tell the world they were disgusted by the allegations against Weinstein. What should have been an instant rebuke took nearly a week of public pressure to come forth. It just so happens this alleged sexual predator has been hiding in plain sight in Hollywood and Washington for decades and has donated  millions of dollars to Democratic candidates over the years. This includes Clinton and Obama. No word on whether they will return the money (though the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has said it will give its donations to women\u2019s rights organizations.) At the end of the day though this is not about politics. This is about a man whose behavior was demeaning and damaging to countless women. Isolated incidents of sexual abuse happen \u2013 what we have here is a trend enabled by people looking the other way for fear of retribution. The culture of complicity cannot continue. Let\u2019s hear these women out, let\u2019s support their courage, and let\u2019s hold this man accountable for his actions. Alice Stewart is a CNN political commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. It\u2019s become the vogue in Hollywood for women to wait decades before speaking out about past sexual assaults or harassment they\u2019ve faced over their career by powerful men. And while it\u2019s nice that these women are finally telling their painful stories publicly, I don\u2019t think they are heroes, or even especially courageous. Too harsh you say? Not at all. For me, settling for a huge financial settlement from your employer, writing a book or even worse \u2013 staying silent when confronted by a predator at work \u2013 is the weakest move we can make as women who profess to want full equality and respect. And while it may keep you safe for a moment or gainfully employed, your silence puts every other woman at risk for harassment, or much worse. Workplace harassment isn\u2019t just a Hollywood problem. Working women face these predators every day. I\u2019ve been there myself as a young woman on a fast-track career, who was harassed and groped by a bully at work. Many advised me to stay quiet. Instead, that week I reported the incident not just to human resources but to the head of the company. And yes, I was terrified that I\u2019d ruin my career. I didn\u2019t, as far as I know. Whether it\u2019s Weinstein\u2019s accusers, the scores of women who accused Bill Cosby, or even top anchors such as Gretchen Carlson who won a $20 million suit after Fox CEO Roger Ailes allegedly harassed her at work \u2013 it\u2019s hard for me to find much reason to hope that we are any closer to full equality using this passive-aggressive strategy to gain equal rights. Let\u2019s stop hiding our pain in the closet hoping it will go away. Hoping men will accept us if we stay pretty, silent and compliant. Each of us finding our voice is the only path to true empowerment.

I\u2019m sad to say I\u2019ve been aware of gender inequities since I was a young child, a refugee leaving Iran. It was clear that with the mandatory veil the new regime in Iran had decided that women were not worthy of choice. One would have hoped that traveling to the West and relocating to America would have meant an end to all that, but the sexism I experienced in the United States was consistent and with no end in sight \u2013 in the classroom by pupils and teachers, in the workplace by colleagues and bosses, everywhere. I\u2019ve been raped, assaulted or sexually harassed so many times in my life. I now think with the Trump administration we are further than ever from resolving all this. Our greatest impediment is a President who has proudly harassed and allegedly sexually assaulted numerous women. We need to set ourselves apart from this and work harder than ever to make this place safer for the generations to come. Women in this supposedly greatest nation in the world are currently second-class citizens at best, and we need to let it be known vocally this is unacceptable. Porochista Khakpour is the author of the novels \u201cSons and Other Flammable Objects\u201d and \u201cThe Last Illusion\u201d and the forthcoming memoir, \u201cSick.\u201d The recent sexual assault allegations about Harvey Weinstein saddened, but did not shock me. Not because I\u2019m an actress he allegedly assaulted or harassed, which I am not. But because, like most women, I know firsthand that the power men wield in our society routinely emboldens and corrupts them. Why do men in our society assault and abuse women?  Because they can. My first husband, an Ivy League graduate and Wall Street trader, beat me and held loaded guns to my head, rather than face his own childhood trauma of abuse, simply because he could. In my view, a powerful man who does not use his leverage to abuse women is the exception, not the rule. Our justice system is one in which (according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) fewer than 10% of men accused of rape or abuse ever spend a day in jail. For years, the rumors and accusations about Weinstein were not taken seriously enough or widely exposed. This conspiracy of silence allowed him to continue to destroy women\u2019s self-esteem and their lives with impunity. No matter your politics or views on Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Donald Trump, or Roger Ailes \u2013 or even a less powerful man such as the Stanford rapist Brock Turner \u2013 it\u2019s important to step back and look at what some American men do when granted power. Think about it long and hard, because behavior like this needs to change, and we\u2019re the ones to change it. Now. Leslie Morgan Steiner is the author of the best-selling memoir, Crazy Love, and the TedTalk \u201cWhy Do Victims Stay?\u201d She lives in Washington, DC. I\u2019ve been writing about women\u2019s rights for more than a decade, mostly online, with the attendant verbal attacks \u2013 first in blog and website comment sections, and later on social media. I\u2019ve had stalkers and received rape and death threats. There is not a day that goes by without someone berating me online, not a misogynist slur I have not been called hundreds of times. I thought I knew misogyny. And then the Republican nominee for President was caught bragging about grabbing women by their genitals, and won the election anyway. Women \u2013 and men \u2013 need to acknowledge what this means: We already knew that sexual abusers could for years operate under the radar of high-profile industries, as has been alleged with Harvey Weinstein. But women are even further away from safety and equality than the most cynical feminists believed when an admitted sexual predator can actually win a national election. It wasn\u2019t a surprise that someone such as Donald Trump would yuck it up about sexual assault, or that women accused him of doing what he said he did. Nor was it a surprise that the more craven members of the Republican Party would back him if it meant getting their way on racist immigration bans or tax cuts for the rich they sought. But nearly all of them? And so many men \u2013 most men \u2013 voted for him. And not as many, but still so very many, women \u2013 typically white women, typically married to men \u2013 voted for him, too. Women are nowhere near safe when so many of our family members and friends, our husbands and brothers and sons, support an unrepentant misogynist, or conclude deep disdain for women is something that can be put aside for politics; we are not equal when so many women decided the humanity of their sisters didn\u2019t matter. Now, the administration of an American president in 2017 is showing women what it thinks of them \u2013 weakening birth control access, attacking abortion rights, undermining fair pay laws and more. I assumed we could mostly agree that misogyny and sexual violence were bad; I assumed my online tormenters were sexist outliers. It turns out we can\u2019t, because they are Trump\u2019s America. They\u2019ve always been haranguing women on Twitter. I just didn\u2019t think they\u2019d make it to the White House.

I have never been asked, \u201cIs your daughter into magic?\u201d My daughter, Moxie, is into magic and is working her way through Teller\u2019s favorite book, \u201cThe Royal Road to Card Magic.\u201d Her little hands do a good clean false shuffle.  Mox got her favorite Valentine\u2019s attention by showing him a card trick (already more success with magic than I ever had). Backstage, one of the magicians who had \u201cFooled Us\u201d (on our Penn & Teller show of that name) told her she could become \u201cthe greatest woman magician in the world.\u201d Lack of women in magic is not in the top million most important feminist issues, but magic is my field and Mox is in my family. Magic is still a boy\u2019s club, and most magic patter is just formalized mansplaining. Mox can fix all that. Mox might become the greatest magician in the world. Penn Jillette, a writer, television host and frequent guest on a wide range of shows, is half of the Emmy Award-winning magic act duo Penn & Teller. His most recent book is \u201cPresto.\u201d The first step to achieving gender equity is understanding where the inequity lies. Discovering that requires the bravery of women to come forward with their stories. In this context, we assume the moment of courage is breaking the silence \u2013 which requires immense courage \u2013 but in reality, life after the silence is broken can be the hardest part. When I was in college, I worked as a hotline volunteer at a domestic violence shelter for Asian immigrant women. The women I spoke to were mostly mothers, and a significant motivation for leaving their abusers was the safety of their children. The majority of those women worked in garment factories, restaurants and in homes as caregivers or house cleaners. Many worked long hours, but it never seemed to be enough to pay the rent or put food on the table. And so they often ended up back in the shelter or back with their abusers. That women suffer abuse, harassment or inequity in the workplace is undeniable. But the challenges faced after speaking out are so enormous that many women keep their stories silent for years and years, as we read in the news, or are forced back into cycles of violence, as I heard on the hotline. We need to ensure women are heard, but also supported \u2013 with economic opportunities and supportive communities \u2013 afterward. The only thing worse than silence is isolation and vulnerability after the silence is broken.

As someone who attended a women\u2019s college, I\u2019ve been asked time and time again, often by men, what the objective of such an institution is in the 21st century. After all, women can now apply to schools whose classrooms were once off-limits and find themselves at the head of boardrooms that were once inaccessible, right? But in this century, the President of the United States brags that his star power gives him rights to women\u2019s bodies, as a trusty tool in committing sexual assault, and in this century, our first instinct is to subject repeatedly every decision women make (whether it be about their reproductive health, or speaking up against abuse) to an intense level of scrutiny that could do wonders if it were put to use in, say, anti-gun legislation, universal health care or education. The biggest impediment to gender equality I see in 2017 is a universal lack of trust toward women. This distrust is reinforced every single time a senior executive repurposes a female colleague\u2019s ideas as his own, and every time someone without the ability to become pregnant makes a decision on behalf of those who can. And while it\u2019s true that trust is usually earned, it just isn\u2019t up to women anymore to earn this trust; it\u2019s up to everyone else (from Harvey Weinstein to Donald Trump) to show that they are deserving of it. Oset Babur is an editor and culture writer whose work has appeared in Teen Vogue, Vice and The Guardian. It\u2019s commendable, of course, that after the raft of horrendous sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein and other major power brokers in the media, more and more women are speaking out against the men who abuse positions of power at their expense. Or against the industries that compensate men at a higher level than women. But the root of the problem lies much deeper. When Hillary Clinton lost a presidency to a white man far less qualified, far less prepared and far more volatile, it became clear that women were perhaps just as culpable as men in the fight against systemic inequality. And not just the 53% of white women who voted for Donald Trump \u2013 many who did so because they were uncomfortable voting for a woman, or could not get past the sexist stereotypes that were continually hung around this woman. But also the many millennial women who, too, resisted Clinton because of her gender. These are women who aren\u2019t turning out for feminism, or who don\u2019t take it seriously \u2013 who view the fight as outdated because they never had to fight it themselves. Or so they think. Because the fight is far from over. The allegations against Weinstein are only the latest expression of this. My greatest hope is that those who have the power, and need, to stand up for women will realize it\u2019s not only entirely relevant, but essential that they do so. My greatest fear, however, is that they will not. Peggy Drexler is the author of \u201cOur Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family\u201d and \u201cRaising Boys Without Men.\u201d Shortly after I decided to wear the hijab, I noticed a shift in how I was perceived in public and professional settings. My contribution to academic discussions as a college student was received with surprise at my intelligence, and now my work as journalist is oftentimes taken with a grain \u2013 or mountain \u2013 of salt by readers. Comments I\u2019ve received range from \u201cThe author of this wears a scarf\u201d to \u201cWe don\u2019t need to hear about America\u2019s problems from you in a hijab.\u201d My perceived intellect and the amount of influence I command in a room are dictated in others\u2019 minds by the clothes I wear. There is a similar struggle on the opposite end of the spectrum, where a woman\u2019s value and experiences in the workplace are determined by the amount of skin she chooses to show and how she chooses to show it. On one end, if she shows \u201ctoo little\u201d or chooses to cover with a scarf, she is considered sexually oppressed and intellectually stunted, whereas if she shows \u201ctoo much,\u201d she is reducing herself to her sexuality and ultimately asking to be assaulted. Nowhere is this clearer than in the most recent case of Harvey Weinstein, where the women who came forward were criticized for how they presented themselves. This kind of gender-based power dynamic permeates every woman\u2019s experience to some extent, whether she is fully covered or not, sometimes even before she enters the workplace.  Most recently, I was advised to exclude my photo from job applications \u2013 it is much easier to land an interview if I\u2019m misperceived as a male from an ambiguous background whose name might be a variant of \u201cNas\u201d than as a visibly Muslim woman who covers. I have wondered more than once how many times I got rejected from life-changing opportunities because of the way a male on the other end of the hiring process judged my worth based on the way I dressed. Naaz Modan is a content editor for Muslim Girl, a publication focused on Muslim women\u2019s issues and empowerment. I feel like there wasn\u2019t any singular moment when the degree of work needed was suddenly made plain. It\u2019s always been there \u2013 but always suppressed, overlooked and dismissed. I think that the reporting around sexual harassment in Silicon Valley, in which a disproportionate number of the victims stepping forward were Asian-American women, in particular hammered home to me that there are layered aspects to who\u2019s targeted, how they respond, whose stories are believed. Women of color are most frequently ignored, and Asian-American women frequently subjected to stereotypical expectations of silence and passivity. That intersectional context is too often set to the side in these debates, and it shouldn\u2019t be.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Edward Lucas is a senior editor at The Economist, where he was the Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002. He is also senior vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington think tank. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. In his best-seller \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Donald Trump makes an important point: Never show your negotiating partner that you are desperate. The thinking in the White House is that Vladimir Putin is eager to emerge from his international isolation. He will do a lot for a handshake. The only real problem for the US administration is how to placate critics, who would regard any deal as selling out to Russia. This weekend\u2019s protests in Russia underline that impression. Putin is facing the biggest upsurge in opposition in more than five years. Crucially, the protests involved many young people and happened in cities right across Russia, rather than only in the opposition\u2019s heartland of Moscow. Police brutality and clumsiness in dealing with the protests have stoked the sense of outrage that many Russians feel with their rulers\u2019 corruption and incompetence. Ducks, sneakers and mass arrests: Why are Russians protesting? Putin may indeed react to the protests by chucking his hapless Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, to the wolves. Medvedev\u2019s alleged grotesquely extravagant property empire (private ski slope, helicopter pads and even a duck house) was the subject of a scorching documentary by the opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Medvedev\u2019s spokeswoman told  state-run news agency RIA Novosti: \u201cIt is pointless to comment on the propagandistic outbursts of a convicted opposition figure, who has already announced he is running some kind of election campaign and fighting against the authorities.\u201d So would this also be a good moment to start d\u00e9tente with the West? Putin could hope for sanctions to be dropped, and at least a de facto recognition of his hold on Crimea, the symbolically important Ukrainian peninsular he seized in 2014. He would then be seen, in Russian eyes, as a leader who stood his ground and outwitted his foreign adversaries. But the real picture is different. It is not Putin who is desperate for a deal but Trump. His administration has run up hard against the realities of the US Constitution. No matter how much swagger and bombast you have, you must abide by the law, otherwise the courts block you. And you can\u2019t pass legislation without Congress. None of those things bother Putin. He portrays Western pressure and \u201cRussophobia\u201d as evidence of malevolence and bad faith. It enables him to portray Russia as a besieged fortress \u2013 and to explain his own shortcomings and repression of the opposition as the necessary conditions for national survival. Unlike in America, Russia\u2019s political and legal systems are not separate branches of government. They are just transmission mechanisms for the Kremlin. Putin can ride out the protests with a mixture of intimidation and token concessions. Whereas Trump may soon have to start worrying about what the midterm elections will do to the Republican majority in the Senate, Putin\u2019s re-election next year for another six-year presidential term is a near-certainty. For Putin, stagnation is business as usual. He no longer bothers to pretend he is trying to reform Russia. His main aim is simply to stay in power, while his cronies continue to enrich themselves. For Trump, last week\u2019s staggering failure to replace Obamacare is a harbinger of things to come. Delay and paralysis at home look set to be the hallmarks of his first year in office \u2013 and perhaps of the remaining three. Leave aside actual government, even getting nominees for administration positions through the Senate will be hard (not least because the Trump White House is still dithering and squabbling about the choice of candidates). Against that background, the only way that Trump can show his administration still has momentum is with a showy foreign policy success. And the list of options is rather scanty. If low-hanging fruit existed, previous administrations would have already picked them. So a deal with Putin that could be framed domestically as a foreign policy breakthrough, repairing the mistaken politics of past administrations is not just tempting but urgent. And the Kremlin leader knows that. Admittedly, the room for maneuver is constrained by the aftermath of the campaign. Trump\u2019s opponents already believe he and his aides treasonably colluded with the Russian intelligence services in a joint attack on Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. So a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d in which the administration blatantly trades the security of its European allies for Russian help in Syria now looks very unlikely. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny jailed for 15 days over protests There is scope for other deals. Even at the height of the Cold War, the United States negotiated arms-control agreements with the Soviet Union. It could certainly do so with the modern Kremlin, however little trust or common ground exists on other issues. Such talks could cover cuts in nuclear stockpiles, better military-to-military relations and safety measures to avoid the danger of accidental conflict. The best way to negotiate with the Kremlin would be to go low and slow: insisting, for example, on a lasting end to fighting in eastern Ukraine before starting on any discussion of sanctions, security or the status of the Palestinian territories. This sort of detailed, patient negotiations, however, is not Trump\u2019s forte. He would prefer something quick and high profile, even if it was largely empty of substance. Yet even that would be dangerous. Already the new American administration has changed the geopolitical weather in Europe. Flirting with the Kremlin used to carry a heavy political cost in American disapproval. Not any more. Pro-Russian politicians in France, Germany, Hungary and Italy can quite reasonably argue they are only saying the same things as the President of the United States: NATO is obsolete; isolating Russia is a mistake; the West has no real claim to the moral high ground. Report: Hundreds arrested at anti-corruption protests in Russia A Trump-Putin summit and deal, however flimsy, would start changing the landscape as well as the weather. It would make it much harder for politicians such as Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel to hold the line inside the European Union on issues such as sanctions. It would further demoralize the hard-pressed Atlanticists in East European countries such as Ukraine and Georgia. Worse, it would send a signal to Putin that the West is divided and ineffective \u2013 and make another Kremlin foreign policy adventure more likely. After Ukraine and Syria, the next site of Russian military intervention could well be Belarus, an obscure autocracy where the West has few interests at stake. In short, the price of Trump\u2019s born-of-desperation deal will be paid not by Americans, but Russia\u2019s neighbors. And who cares about them?",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: One week from the special election to fill the  Senate seat from Alabama and Republican Roy Moore seems to have momentum despite the allegations of assault and that sought relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. What changed and will Washington, DC Republicans accept him if he wins? Here\u2019s the latest from CNN\u2019s reporters. @ryanstruyk, politics data reporter: Happy Tuesday, folks. We\u2019re now just one week from the special election in Alabama and everything seems to be tipping back Roy Moore\u2019s way. The President is totally on board. The RNC is back in the game. Mitch McConnell says it\u2019s up to the voters. And this is all happening less than a month after the initial accusations broke and he was all but left for dead. So let\u2019s start here: Explain why (most of) the GOP is back on the Roy Moore train. @CillizzaCNN, editor-at-large: I\u2019ll start: Because they know a) they can\u2019t get rid of him and b) he is looking more and more like a winner It\u2019s pure political pragmatism. @ericbradner, politics reporter: Part of what\u2019s happening is that Trump is seeing his base stick with Moore and doesn\u2019t want to lose them. So his endorsement set off a chain reaction. It\u2019s why, for example, the RNC got back in Alabama. Mitch McConnell\u2019s orbit \u2013 the NRSC and the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC \u2013 is still staying out of it. @jennagiesta, director of polling and election analytics: In a special election on a weird day in December, the only way to win is to generate excitement for your candidate. There\u2019s no other reason for most people in Alabama to go to the polls that day except this one election. Without support from Trump, that excitement seemed to be flagging a bit. @CillizzaCNN: But McConnell is now hedging to \u201cI\u2019ll let the people of Alabama decide\u201d which is way different than \u201cRoy Moore should drop out.\u201d @ryanstruyk: So basically, Roy Moore went to bat against McConnell Inc. and won. @ericbradner: For sure. McConnell tried everything \u2013 EVERYTHING \u2013 to get Moore out of the race. Now he\u2019s giving up. @CillizzaCNN: And Moore\u2019s refusal to get out speaks to an important \u2013 and uncomfortable \u2013 fact in politics: It\u2019s REALLY hard to get rid of someone who doesn\u2019t want to go. Particularly when that person is an anti-establishment type who owes the typical party power brokers nothing @jennagiesta: See: Trump, Donald circa October 2016. @ryanstruyk: OK, so, with that thought in mind: The NRSC is still out of this race. Cory Gardner \u2013 the NRSC chair, not exactly small potatoes \u2013 has made headlines by saying he wants Moore expelled. Let\u2019s just assume for a minute that Roy Moore gets elected. What are the odds he gets expelled from the US Senate? Give me a percentage. @CillizzaCNN: 0% How can you do it? Expel a guy who just won an election \u2013 warts and all. And McConnell is now in the \u201clet the people of Alabama decide\u201d camp. If they decide they want Moore, how does McConnell justify expelling him? @ericbradner: Yeah, I mean I could hedge and say 1% \u2026 but I\u2019m with Cillizza. Alabama voters are well aware of the accusations Moore faces. @jennagiesta: Same. And Alabama voters are very clear that they\u2019d rather have a Republican in this seat, even in polls that show Jones with an edge. A Moore win would be a vote for the party. @CillizzaCNN: I think that Cory Gardner thing is an empty threat. That he probably wishes he could walk back. @ericbradner: McConnell set the process when the (Sen. Al) Franken accusation came up: Let the ethics committee deal with it. And Democrats bought into it in Franken\u2019s case \u2013 which doesn\u2019t leave them with any high ground here. @CillizzaCNN: Yup I mean This can be referred to the Senate Ethics Committee \u2013 and probably will. But that\u2019s like when your parents told you your goldfish was being flushed down the toilet so he could swim free in the ocean and then come back one day. That goldfish ain\u2019t coming back. (Maybe that was only my parents?) And the Senate Ethics Committee has proven itself to be totally toothless over the years. @jennagiesta: So given the very public statements about expulsion, safe to assume the Democratic ad-makers have their spots about how the GOP is the party of Moore already queued up for 2018? @CillizzaCNN: Yup \u201cThe party of accused child molester Roy Moore\u2026.\u201d @ericbradner: You could see lots of three-person lineups: Trump, Moore and (insert home-state Republican here). @ryanstruyk: What kind of an impact do we think that will have though? We saw how well the \u201cat least we\u2019re not as bad as the other guy\u201d argument went in 2016. @jennagiesta: I think it depends on whether you\u2019re starting with differential enthusiasm from each party\u2019s base. If Democrats are the more fired-up party to begin with, as they were in Virginia last month (really, it was a month ago!), then it probably adds fuel to the fire. But if the tax bill actually has the impact that Republicans clearly seem to think it will, then it\u2019s likely not enough. Not enough on its own, I should say. @ericbradner: Last year Trump wasn\u2019t president yet. For all the talk about Democrats needing a national message, midterms tend to be about the person sitting in the Oval Office \u2013 and, for sure, Democrats are fired up in a way they never were for Hillary Clinton. And Moore will be seen as an even more objectionable iteration of that personality and brand of politics. Republicans are convinced the tax bill is the solution to all their problems. I don\u2019t buy it at all. @jennagiesta: Gallup has new numbers out today from Friday and Saturday interviewing showing very little support for the bill as it was making its way through the Senate, just 25% of independents said they approved of it. Overall, it has just 29% support. @ryanstruyk: Okay, last question. It\u2019s the one on everyone\u2019s minds. A Washington Post poll over the weekend showed essentially a neck-and-neck race. Roy Moore seems to have some momentum. Does Doug Jones (have we even said his name yet?) still have a chance to win this thing? @ericbradner: Yes he does. Covering the race, it feels like things are moving Moore\u2019s direction. BUT @CillizzaCNN: [drums fingers] [waiting] @ericbradner: There\u2019s a reason Steve Bannon\u2019s going to Fairhope tonight, and President Trump is in Pensacola (nearby Florida) on Friday: They\u2019re in the Mobile media market. That\u2019s where you find the more affluent, moderate, business-type Republicans who could vote for Jones or sit this one out. And Moore\u2019s folks are clearly worried about that area most. @CillizzaCNN: 1. Eric is right 2. I think Moore wins. The allegations are simply not believed by lots of Alabama Republicans. And those who have doubts \u2013 well that\u2019s why Trump is going to Pensacola: To give those folks some cover. To say \u201cit\u2019s alright to be for Roy. I am.\u201d @ericbradner: On the Jones side: The Alabama Democratic Party isn\u2019t exactly a well-oiled machine, and national Democrats can\u2019t play in the Deep South, so Jones has been building this from the ground up. He has tons of money \u2013 but the organizational task he faced was just huge. He\u2019ll need a massive African-American turnout to make it close. @jennagiesta: I\u2019d agree with Eric that there\u2019s definitely a chance Jones wins. When Moore has been on the statewide ballot without these allegations holding him down and with top-of-the-ticket races drawing turnout, he still vastly underperformed other Republicans on the same ballot. He needs the turnout boost Trump can give him. And let\u2019s not forget how hard it is to pin down the real likely voters in polling for an election like this, there\u2019s huge variation across polls and methods, which makes it hard to know where things really stand. @CillizzaCNN: IF Jones wins: His chances of holding the seat come 2020 are roughly 0%. Which makes some of this moot. But, two years of another Democratic vote in the Senate is something Chuck Schumer takes every day and twice on Sunday. @ericbradner: Yup. And the 2020 map is so good for Democrats that they can lose this Senate seat but find a way to pick it up elsewhere without it drastically changing their calculus. @jennagiesta: Wait, wait, wait, it\u2019s way too early to break out the 2020 map!! @ericbradner: Cory Gardner, Thom Tillis, Joni Ernst\u2026 @jennagiesta: #oneelectionatatime @ryanstruyk: Time flies when you\u2019re having \u2026 er, never mind Side note, though: Cillizza is right. A 51-49 Senate would be a pretty big deal. It would certainly dial up the temperature to ram tax reform through before Jones is seated. And if the GOP only had 51 seats this whole time, instead of 52 seats, you\u2019d saying goodbye to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and states\u2019 ability to pull back Planned Parenthood dollars (and a few not-so-sexy rule cancellations.) @ericbradner: And no John McCain thumbs-down moment! @ryanstruyk: Speaking of which, I\u2019m kind of surprised we made it through this whole conversation without any breaking news or Trump tweets amiright aaaaaaand I probably just jinxed it so apologies in advance @ericbradner: Always a twitchy Twitter finger away\u2026 @ryanstruyk: You can keep following our coverage of the Alabama Senate race on CNN.com/Politics over the next week and during the big finale when Alabamans head to the polls next Tuesday, December 12. @ericbradner: (ALABAMIANS, WITH AN I, they would all shout right now.) @ryanstruyk: guess I\u2019m not getting any write-in votes now am I?",

            "article_content": "Republicans across the nation\u2019s capital are wringing their hands over the prospect: A special election in deep red Alabama somehow ends up flipping a Senate seat blue. And the stakes are high. More than a dozen votes in the US Senate so far this year would have failed or been in jeopardy with one fewer Republican member in the chamber, according to a new CNN analysis. Roy Moore is facing multiple accusations of sexual relationships with teenage girls while he was in his 30s and has denied the allegations. But dozens of Republicans have now called for him to exit the race, raising the prospect of a last-ditch write-in campaign or even his expulsion from the Senate if he\u2019s elected to the post. But, at least for now, Moore has remained steadfast on remaining in the race \u2014 raising the possibility of Democratic candidate Doug Jones winning in a major upset and tipping the scales of the US Senate in a dramatic way. This analysis uses the number of votes that would have needed to flip the other way to change the outcome of the vote, depending on whether the vote required a simple majority or supermajority and assuming Vice President Mike Pence would vote with most Republicans in the case of an even split. Close votes are common: In fact, a majority of votes taken in this year\u2019s Senate so far would have had the opposite outcome if 10 or fewer votes in the chamber had flipped. A third of the votes would have had the opposite outcome if five or fewer votes had gone the other way. And one in every 20 votes so far this year would have had a different outcome if just one vote had flipped to the opposite side. Here\u2019s a look at the votes that wouldn\u2019t have passed if just one more Democrat \u2014 perhaps Doug Jones of Alabama \u2014 had been seated in the chamber. Say goodbye to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos: In a Senate divided 51-49 between the two parties instead of 52-48, the two \u201cno\u201d votes from Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski would have been enough to tank DeVos\u2019s nomination in February. Pence would have never been called in to break the tie. A procedural vote in July that brought Republicans to the cusp of passing legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2014 and set the stage for Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain\u2019s dramatic late-night \u201cno\u201d vote that ultimately tanked the bill \u2014 would have failed too, by a slim 49-51 margin. A bill that allowed states to withhold federal dollars from organizations like Planned Parenthood also would have failed \u2014 on a procedural vote and the final passage. A Senate split along party lines 51-49 would have also failed to kill a rule making it easier for Americans to sue banks and credit card companies last month. And senators would have failed to nullify four other rules \u2014 two from the Department of Labor, one from the Department of Education and one from the Department of Defense \u2014 all of which required just one vote to flip in order to reject it outright. Still, many votes in the Senate have passed by wide margins. A third of votes in the Senate would have required at least 18 votes to flip in order to fail and a quarter would have required at least 32 votes to flip in order to fail. Meanwhile, Pence would have likely been called in to break more ties on other votes that just barely squeaked by. Most important, a critical vote on the budget that laid the groundwork for using a 51-vote threshold for tax reform passed by just a slim 51-49 margin, meaning one more Democrat in the chamber likely would have required Pence\u2019s tie-breaking vote for the resolution to pass. Sen. Rand Paul voted no. The nomination of Mick Mulvaney to be director of the Office of Management and Budget also would have ended up in a 50-50 tie, requiring Pence to push him across the finish line. Two other nominees \u2014 William Wehrum for assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and Marvin Kaplan for the National Labor Relations Board \u2013 would have needed a tie-breaking vote from Pence, as would a procedural vote on the nomination of Noel Francisco to become Solicitor General. A Senate divided 51-49 also would have required a tie-breaking vote from Pence to nix government rules on internet privacy and maintaining injury and illness records. On other votes, it\u2019s impossible to know. For example, votes to approve Steven Gill Bradbury as the top lawyer for the Department of Transportation succeeded, but if all the Democrats had showed up to the vote in a 51-49 Senate, his nomination would have failed.",

            "article_content": "Women swept battleground states and districts on election night Democrats won the Virginia governor's race thanks in large part to female voters It could have been another day of mourning. Instead, one year after the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lost the election, Democrats celebrated on Tuesday \u2013 in large part because of the women voters who helped propel their nominees into office and the record number of female candidates who themselves were elected. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam won the governor\u2019s race, a feat that wouldn\u2019t have been accomplished without women. He led women by a broad 21 percentage points, according to exit polls \u2014 a larger spread than when Democrats like Clinton won women by 17 points in 2016, Mark Warner won women by 12 points in his 2014 Senate re-election and Terry McAuliffe won women by nine points in his 2013 race for governor. Northam also more than doubled Clinton\u2019s lead among white college-educated women: He won them by a broad 15 points over Clinton\u2019s slim six-point lead. Republicans know Tuesday's elections had a message. They just don't know what it was. Another of the biggest forces in the Virginia races was Planned Parenthood, which helped Democrats defeat a Republican lieutenant governor nominee, Jill Vogel, who as a state senator had pushed a bill requiring women seeking abortions to undergo vaginal ultrasounds. Elsewhere in the state, a handful of first-time female candidates made history in races for the House of Delegates. Kathy Tran is one of the first Asian-American women to win a seat in Virginia. Danica Roem, once she takes office, will be the first openly transgender candidate ever to be elected and serve in a state legislature in the country. Tran said she was inspired to run after President Donald Trump was elected, realizing \u201cthe moment to stand up is now.\u201d \u201cI realized i couldn\u2019t sit on the sidelines,\u201d she told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cI never thought I would run for office. It was something not in my wildest dreams \u2013 partly because nobody ever looked like me that was elected to office. I think what we saw on Tuesday is that people are hungry for their government to reflect the diversity of their communities. \u2026 I\u2019m just really honored to break that barrier and to show that we can run, and we can win, and we can be a strong voice for our communities.\u201d Election night brings historic wins for minority and LGBT candidates Democrat Alison Kiehl Friedman, who is running for Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock\u2019s seat in Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District race next year, spent significant portions of her time knocking on doors for female candidates, including Tran. \u201cI think these delegate races are where the change happens,\u201d she told CNN before Tuesday\u2019s election. \u201cThe field of delegate candidates that I\u2019m knocking on doors for make me so proud to be engaged in a political process at a time when you turn on the news, there\u2019s not a whole lot that inspires pride. These are good people who care deeply, who despite all the demands are choosing to invest now because they love their country and their neighbors. Those are the kinds of voices that we\u2019ll need.\u201d The Center for American Women and Politics, a unit of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, said in a release that this week\u2019s election entailed \u201ca number of landmarks for women.\u201d Across the country, Michelle Kaufusi became the first woman elected mayor in the 157-year history of Provo, the third-largest city in Utah; New Jersey elected Sheila Oliver to be the nation\u2019s first black Democratic woman to serve as a lieutenant governor; and Jenny Durkan became the first lesbian mayor in Seattle\u2019s history, as well as the city\u2019s first woman mayor since the 1920s. Such wins sparked excitement \u2013 and optimism among liberals \u2013 for 2018. Some credit the organizers of last January\u2019s Women\u2019s March, who tweeted images and celebratory messages this week from the Women\u2019s March official account for each of the wins, as one of the main reasons why women were such a powerful force on Tuesday. \u201cRepeat after us: TOGETHER, WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE,\u201d the account tweeted, using the hashtag \u201c#2018WeGotYou.\u201d This is for the women who made history Tuesday night, and for the women who will make history in 2018.We're just getting started. This is only the beginning. Stay focused.\ud83c\udfa8: quietcreature pic.twitter.com/PZJ6Fa4ckS \u201cI think the Women\u2019s March momentum did two things that were really important,\u201d Jennifer Lawless, co-author of the book, \u201cWomen on the Run: Gender, Media, and Political Campaigns in a Polarized Era,\u201d told CNN in a phone interview Wednesday. \u201cIt generated this widespread activism to push back against Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. And it made women who ordinarily wouldn\u2019t participate in politics, or do much more than vote during a general election, become politically activated. We\u2019ve seen a heightened level of activism that translated into Democratic victories last night. And \u2026 some of those women who were activated threw their hats in the ring to run.\u201d The march also helped elevate grass-roots organizations whose sole purpose has been to help women run for office. Emerge America, founded in 2002 to train women to run for office, said 85 of the organization\u2019s 129 women on ballots in nine states Tuesday won their races for local and state office. In Virginia, of the 15 seats that flipped from red to blue, nine were won by Emerge alumnae. \u201cIs it any surprise that women are so energized both running for office and coming out to vote? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Andrea Dew Steele, founder and president of Emerge America, told CNN. \u201cI think this is really a repudiation of Donald Trump and everything he stands for. \u2026 I don\u2019t think that should be a shock to anybody. Women are really still feeling it; they are still pissed off.\u201d Emily\u2019s List president Stephanie Schriock said that 20,000 women across the nation contacted the organization after the 2016 election expressing an interest in some level of activism, whether that meant running for their local city councils or Congress. This is up 2,000% from the 920 women who contacted the nonprofit after the previous year\u2019s election cycle. Winners and losers from the 2017 election \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen (these numbers) at Emily\u2019s List,\u201d Schriock said in an interview with CNN. \u201cI can\u2019t even find the words to explain how inspirational and shocking this is. We\u2019ve spent 30 years sitting at women\u2019s kitchen tables saying, \u2018You should run.\u2019 \u201c Following the night of victories, the National Organization for Women issued a release with a headline that seemed to sum up the sentiment of many: \u201cWomen Win on Election Night 2017.\u201d \u201cIt is just wonderful to have these victories,\u201d NOW President Toni Van Pelt told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning to everybody in the country that women are standing up and they are standing together.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ryan Struyk and Eric Bradner contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Democrats see Ralph Northam\u2019s big win in the Virginia governor\u2019s race as a breakthrough moment for the left\u2019s digital efforts. A year after Republicans leapfrogged the Democrats\u2019 digital capacities on the way to President Donald Trump\u2019s election, progressive groups combined spent nearly $3 million on an innovative effort to modernize the party\u2019s digital advertising. If Democrats can win Alabama, the Senate is in play in 2018 The effort, organized by Planned Parenthood and coordinated by veteran Democratic digital strategist Tara McGowan, reached 2.4 million Virginia voters without Northam\u2019s campaign having to spend any money at all on digital advertising. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just talking, sharing what plans were \u2013 it was really the nitty-gritty details of putting together a program we all felt really good about,\u201d said McGowan, the head of the new digital firm ACRONYM. Coordination is standard in politics when several outside groups are working to aid the same candidate. But Virginia\u2019s laws allow campaigns and outside organizations to share plans and strategies \u2013 which opened the door for what became the Democratic Party\u2019s best-coordinated joint digital effort yet. Now progressive groups say they want to use similar tactics across the 2018 midterm map. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of groups that are looking to invest more in digital right now, and I think everybody knows that we have to. That wasn\u2019t the case two or four years ago necessarily,\u201d McGowan said. Of Democrats\u2019 catch-up efforts ahead of the 2018 midterms, she added: \u201cIf you had asked me this six months ago, I would not have felt nearly as confident.\u201d McGowan led weekly conference calls that were kicked off with a summary of the Northam campaign\u2019s messaging strategy from Northam digital director Alex Witt. The groups involved also kept up a running conversation on strategy and tactics on a Slack channel. The list of groups participating included the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer\u2019s NextGen America, the Virginia League of Conservation Voters PAC, the Eric Holder-led National Democratic Redistricting Committee, Progress Virginia and Black PAC. They were organized by Planned Parenthood \u2013 which was also the biggest spender. They combined for a budget of $2.9 million. The groups\u2019 coordination included sharing creative resources \u2013 that is, the ads themselves, and the content that went into them \u2013 as well as voter targeting and audience information and data that detailed how effective each ad had been. Rather than simply placing TV ads online, the groups developed vertical content \u2013 which is consumed much more easily on mobile phones on platforms like Facebook, Snapchat ads and Instagram stories. On Facebook, in particular, the groups took a new \u2013 and more complicated \u2013 approach to delivering their ads. Facebook allows advertisers to deliver a second spot to users who engage with the first one \u2013 and a third to those who engage with the second one. Most campaigns don\u2019t do that, because it\u2019s much more time-consuming than delivering a single, effective spot over and over, and because it\u2019s more expensive to produce the extra ads such a strategy requires. The progressive groups did, though. The groups poured late energy into targeting demographic groups that could sway the election. Planned Parenthood found that messages focused on women\u2019s health care moved black voters by about 20 percentage points \u2013 so it created more ads focused on that issue. Meanwhile, the groups saved money by making sure to target different audiences. Facebook determines ads\u2019 cost through an \u201cauction\u201d process. By gearing their ads for different demographics, the groups avoided bidding against each other. \u201cThis effort will set the precedent for coordinated investment and execution of a digital media program to reach, persuade and mobilize voters in a statewide race,\u201d said Jennifer Allen, CEO of Planned Parenthood Virginia PAC. The win in Virginia showed that \u201cbuilding a robust digital infrastructure to break through echo chambers and reach voters online is more vital than ever, and Priorities will be working to replicate our success in races around the country in 2018,\u201d said Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil.",

            "article_content": "Malinda Frevert will forever remember the day after Hillary Clinton\u2019s early morning speech conceding the presidential race to Donald Trump as \u201cSurprise Thursday.\u201d It was then, 36 hours after Trump\u2019s victory in November \u2013 a day filled with despair and disbelief for millions of Democrats \u2013 that groups like the liberal advocacy group Emily\u2019s List, where Frevert works, experienced an unexpected tidal wave of support. By the end of November, Emily\u2019s List had doubled its number of monthly donors. How Trump has made politics a spectator sport \u201cThat\u2019s when we realized that something was probably happening and we needed to get ready,\u201d said Frevert, who handles online strategy at Emily\u2019s List. Dozens of other liberal groups experienced a spike in interest immediately after the election. By January, membership at the ACLU skyrocketed to 1.6 million from just 400,000 on Election Day. Planned Parenthood took in more than 300,0000 individual donations.  United We Dream, an immigrant rights group, saw its membership spike to half a million people. The rush of enthusiasm took many by surprise. \u201cIt took us a couple of days to find our own footing,\u201d said Heather Holdridge, Planned Parenthood\u2019s director of digital advocacy. NAACP retools for the Trump era Several months into Trump\u2019s presidency, activists on the left are working to keep that post-election momentum going. That level of energy was on display recently at Netroots Nation, an annual gathering where progressives come to sharpen their skills, network and mobilize. The conference, which hosted speakers such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Al Gore, had some of the highest attendance in years, organizers said. Instead of focusing on the past \u2013 particularly the messy details that came out of last year\u2019s bruising Democratic primary between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Clinton \u2013 conference attendees said Trump has forced activists to look forward. \u201cTrump is a direct attack on some core American values of fairness, equality, of treating each other with kindness,\u201d said Victoria Kaplan, organizing director at MoveOn.org. \u201cIt has really unified people.\u201d This Trump supporter drives New Yorkers nuts With the next mid-term elections looming in 2018, groups like MoveOn are already mobilizing around the country through local organizing, town hall meetings and door-to-door visits. Indivisible, a new group founded in December after a congressional staffer posted a practical \u201chow-to\u201d guide for activists that went viral, has grown to about 6,000 local chapters nationwide. \u201cPeople are jazzed up,\u201d said Indivisible founder Ezra Levin. \u201cI think it\u2019s evident that this administration\u2019s priorities and this Congress\u2019 priorities are so far outside the realm of what is normal for American politics that you see a ton of folks coming out.\u201d Despite the enthusiasm, their battle against Trump and Republicans will be an uphill one. In terms of partisan numbers, elected Democrats have found themselves completely outnumbered in the post-Obama era. Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. What Trump's golf game tells us about him At the state level, it\u2019s even worse for Democrats. Republicans have majorities in 32 state legislatures, and in 24 states, they control the legislature and the governors\u2019 mansions. In the big special elections since Trump took office, Democrats have been able to raise massive amounts of money, but the donations have not resulted in victory. Contests in Georgia, South Carolina, Montana and Kansas \u2013 not progressive strongholds by any means \u2013 have all gone to Republicans. Democrats did win a special election in an Iowa state legislature special election in August in a district that voted heavily for Trump. But, buoyed by opposition to Trump, optimism on the left remains high. Activists point to the President\u2019s inability to pass his legislative priorities such as repealing the Affordable Care Act as a sign that he will continue to struggle in other areas that require passing bills into law. \u201cPeople are turning their anger into action and activism and looking ahead,\u201d MoveOn\u2019s Kaplan said. \u201cBecause we can\u2019t look back. We have to look forward.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The 2016 left its mark on the English language Following the 2016 election cycle, where a billionaire reality television star took American politics by storm, some words will just never be the same. SAD! From campaign slogans like \u201cFeel the Bern!\u201d and \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d to Donald Trump\u2019s favorite political insults, undertones of the 2016 race to the White House will echo for years to come in what were once very ordinary phrases in the English language. How Donald Trump won Here\u2019s a look at some of the most notable examples: Early on in the primary Trump labeled former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as \u201clow energy,\u201d and while the dig seems very mild compared to other nicknames Trump had for his opponents like \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d the insult stuck to the mild-mannered Bush like glue. \u201cI defined him. I gave him this term, \u2018Low energy.\u2019 I said he\u2019s a low energy individual,\u201d Trump explained to Jimmy Kimmel last December. \u201cWe do not need in this country low energy. Do you agree with that? We need high energy.\u201d You can no longer assess a person\u2019s energy without the ghost of the Trump vs. Bush battle creeping up on you. You will inevitably ask yourself, \u201cAm I a Trump or a Bush?\u201d Trump calls Obama \u2018a very good man\u2019 after historic White House meeting President-elect Trump and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are both New York City natives with \u201cyuuge\u201d New York accents. Their unique way of pronouncing \u201chuge\u201d when talking about \u201cyuuge\u201d movements or \u201cyuuge\u201d crowds stood out to Americans across the nation and this 2016 political buzz word is now forever archived in GIFs, Vines and the subconscious of politically engaged American minds. Before 2016 \u201clightweight\u201d was prominently used to describe a person or an item\u2019s weight, particularly in sports like boxing. But after 2016, \u201cLightweight,\u201d which is one of Trump\u2019s most prolifically used attacks, will forever be heard as an insult. Trump has referred to tens of people as \u201clightweight\u201d to imply that they are daft or unsubstantial. He repeatedly called FOX News\u2019 Megyn Kelly a \u201clightweight.\u201d I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter! \u201cI refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct.

The future of the Democratic party is Democratic socialism. #feelthebern Learning how to phone bank for @BernieSanders from the best. #IAcaucus #FeelTheBern pic.twitter.com/aHzQYltdn8 The passionate support that the Vermont senator got from young Americas across the county translated into an equally fiery campaign slogan and a hashtag that lived on months after Sanders exited the 2016 race. #FeelTheBern will always remind us of the Democratic socialist, who gave challenged Clinton during the 2016 Democratic primary. When Trump accused Clinton of \u201cplaying the woman\u2019s card,\u201d the former Democratic presidential nominee turned Trump\u2019s attack against him by embracing the phrase. Want one? Chip in now: https://t.co/7zG2HrebW3 #WomanCard pic.twitter.com/tEnbvq5a9r The Clinton campaign produced an actual \u201cWoman Card\u201d that they sent out to supporters who donate to the campaign. \u201cThe other day, Mr. Trump accused me, of playing the, quote, \u2018woman card,\u2019\u201d Clinton said in April. \u201cWell, if fighting for women\u2019s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.\u201d This became a popular line of attack against Trump throughout her campaign. When Trump called Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d during a debate dig, Clinton supporters embraced the phrase \u2013 capitalizing on the positive connotations of the word that have existed in American slang for years. \u201cNasty\u201d has been used as a synonym for \u201ccool\u201d and has also been used to describe a fierce woman \u2013 especially one with exceptionally good abilities. Trump made a big mistake using the word nasty. Cuts across gender, race, sexual orientation, and Janet enthusiasts. #NastyWomenVote #debate pic.twitter.com/xsIjW2T9MO \u201cNasty Woman\u201d T-shirts popped up around the country and streams of Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cNasty\u201d soared on Spotify. \u201cI just bought a NASTY WOMAN t-shirt. 50% goes to Planned Parenthood,\u201d one woman tweeted. Even Katy Perry wore a \u201cNasty Woman\u201d T-shirt while campaigning for Clinton last month. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d sparked heated debates across the country. Some argued that America is already great, others longed for a \u201cgreater\u201d past, while some pointed to a history of racism defined by slavery and Jim Crow and took issue with the \u201cagain\u201d portion of the slogan. TODAY WE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! \"America is already great. America is already strong & I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump.\u201d \u2014@POTUS After 2016, you can no longer say that America is great or long for greater times without appearing to take a political stand. Trump\u2019s slogan will also resonate whenever making anything \u201cgreat again\u201d is discussed. \u201cBad\u201d is one of Trump\u2019s favorite insults. He used it to comment on everything from his election opponents, to describing some Latinos as \u201cbad hombres\u201d during the final presidential debate last month. He punctuated several of his tweets about his former primary opponent Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with \u201cBad!\u201d Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! \u201cTed Cruz didn\u2019t win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!\u201d Trump tweeted in February. Ted Cruz does not have the right \"temperment\" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD! \u201cTed Cruz does not have the right \u2018temperment\u2019 to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!\u201d Trump tweeted later that month. It will be difficult to call something \u201cbad\u201d again without hearing Trump in your head. Trump is known for selecting nicknames for his opponents \u2013 Cruz became \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d Sanders became \u201cCrazy Bernie,\u201d Rubio became \u201clittle Marco\u201d and Sen. Elizabeth Warren is simply \u201cPocahontas.\u201d But none of his 2016 nicknames will be as prominently remembered as \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate? Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER they were subpoenaed by the United States Congress. Guilty - cannot run. Rigged system! At times, Trump would even drop \u201cHillary\u201d and simply called the former secretary of state \u201cCrooked\u201d in various tweets. So terrible that Crooked didn't report she got the debate questions from Donna Brazile, if that were me it would have been front page news!

But 12 years after the release of Bright Eyes\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m Wide Awake, It\u2019s Morning,\u201d which opens with \u201cAt the Bottom of Everything\u201d \u2013 a melancholy and sentimental critique of American society and politics \u2013 Oberst told CNN that President Donald Trump has set a bar so low that it has managed to make the musician \u201cnostalgic\u201d for the presidency of George W.

Instagram post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public. Oberst, who backed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016, is a critic of the political establishment and mainstream media himself, but he said that he worries that by branding the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d Trump is \u201cbrainwashing\u201d his supporters into believing in a fact-free narrative. \u201cOur disregard for reality is scary. \u2026 The thing that I find most upsetting about our current situation is that there\u2019s no consensus on reality,\u201d Oberst said. \u201cEmpirical evidence doesn\u2019t matter, facts don\u2019t matter. Nothing matters to these people. It\u2019s just this weird, cult personality. Everyone always compares (Trump) to a fascist strongman, but I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s far off, \u2026 with his family and his businesses and stuff, he wants to replicate Russian oligarchy in America.\u201d A request to the White House for comment was not returned. At the Wednesday show in Washington, Oberst unleashed on Trump amid anti-Trump chants from the audience, labeling the President \u201cracist,\u201d \u201chomophobic\u201d and then dedicated a performance of \u201cThe Roosevelt Room\u201d \u2013 a fiery and indignant \u201ctear gas riot song\u201d critiquing American politicians \u2013 to the first family. \u201cSometimes you have to let the poison out,\u201d Oberst told the crowd before returning to a more sentimental repertoire. \u201cI was the guy arguing with my friends at the bar \u2014 the Bernie and bust people \u2014 saying, \u2018you guys are idiots\u2019.\u201d Conor Oberst For his tour to promote his latest solo album, \u201cSalutations,\u201d which includes songs like \u201cToo Late to Fixate\u201d and \u201cA Little Uncanny,\u201d Oberst teamed up with a nonprofit organization to donate part of the proceeds to Planned Parenthood. \u201cWe decided to couple with Planned Parenthood obviously, because all of the threats of cutting funding and to me, growing up that was the place that if you were in trouble, that\u2019s where you went, especially if you are a woman,\u201d Oberst said. Banditos singer talks resistance and patriotism in the age of Trump During the 2016 election, Oberst was critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, but said that he ended up voting for her in the general election. \u201cIf you are an artist or an entertainer for your occupation, that doesn\u2019t mean you surrender your rights as a citizen.\u201d Conor Oberst \u201cI definitely supported Bernie, but then once Hillary had the nomination, I was the guy arguing with my friends at the bar \u2013 the Bernie and bust people \u2013 saying, \u2018you guys are idiots\u2019,\u201d Oberst said.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in seven GOP-held districts in or near Orange County An influx of outside spending is also already reaching some of those districts For Democrats hoping to turn President Donald Trump\u2019s unpopularity into an opportunity to take control of the House next year, this Orange County community is ground zero. Their target here \u2013 Rep. Ed Royce \u2013 is like several other established Republican incumbents in California who progressives hope can be toppled in a wave of anti-Trump backlash. In their bid to win the 24 seats necessary to take control of the House, Democrats are focusing on California \u2013 and particularly a swath of seven Republican-held seats clustered in or near Orange County. The reason those seats are being targeted: 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton bested Trump in all seven districts in the 2016 election. Clinton was the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to carry Orange County, and her victory there reflected the rapid demographic changes in the increasingly young, diverse and educated region. Royce hadn\u2019t planned a town hall meeting during the August recess \u2013 so Indivisible, Planned Parenthood and other groups scheduled one without him. Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez, who represents a nearby Southern California district, attended and fielded questions for hours instead. Meanwhile, five Democrats who are running against Royce mingled with the crowd of hundreds. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of built-up anger,\u201d said Gil Cisneros, who won a $266 million lottery prize in 2010 and is now challenging Royce. \u201cWe have to find a way to keep that going.\u201d \u201cIn some ways, this is an opportunity to really bring new people into the fold,\u201d said Sam Jammal, a former chief of staff to Rep. Tony Cardenas, an Obama administration Commerce Department official who is also running in the district. The event underscored the opportunities and challenges confronting Democrats headed into the 2018 midterm elections: The party\u2019s base is energized enough to draw a massive crowd on a Thursday night 15 months away from the election. But it has also attracted candidates in droves, which means a long, expensive primary season before a Democrat can fully focus on Royce, who already has $3.1 million in the bank. Royce and Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters\u2019 districts are located in Orange County. Rep. Darrell Issa\u2019s district extends from its south toward San Diego. Rep. Steve Knight represents the suburbs north of Los Angeles. And Reps. David Valadao and Jeff Denham represent California\u2019s Central Valley, not as near to Orange County as others but areas with similar demographics and recent election results that have led Democrats to believe their seats are also within reach. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the first time has moved its Western regional office to Irvine, California \u2013 a decision that reflects the group\u2019s early commitment to the region. The House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm has six staffers working in that office and six more organizers in target districts across the state. Republicans are moving more slowly, but emphasizing the jam-packed fields of challengers and underscoring the rifts those primary fights could expose within the Democratic Party. \u201cWhile Republicans are focused on their districts, Democrats are tearing one another apart in brutal, expensive races to the left,\u201d said Jack Pandol, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThus far, Democrats\u2019 big promises in California have won them nothing except more friendly fire that they are struggling \u2013 and failing \u2013 to control.\u201d An influx of outside spending is also already reaching the districts of Royce, Valadao, Knight and Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, has opened field offices in each of the four districts, and could open offices in more competitive California districts in the coming months. The affiliated group American Action Network plans to launch television advertising in the districts of Valadao, Knight and Denham at the end of this week that will give the three Republicans air cover as the party starts a tax reform push, touting popular planks of such an effort. Already, it has launched both English- and Spanish-language radio ads in those districts. Its organizers are also playing up individual House Republicans\u2019 district-focused strengths, such as Denham\u2019s work on water issues. \u201cCalifornia is really a state that we know that Democrats are going to be targeting, so we need to start early and be out there talking to voters about what these members are doing back in DC on their behalf,\u201d said Ruth Guerra, a CLF spokeswoman. On the left, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer\u2019s group NextGen America is focusing its early 2018 efforts on Royce, Valadao, Knight and Denham \u2013 \u201cfour districts where young people obviously can be the swing,\u201d Steyer said. He said his group will be on more than 200 college campuses in eight states in the 2018 cycle, organizing young people who will be part of a grassroots program that emphasizes face-to-face conversations and texts with potential voters. In the 2016 election cycle, Steyer said, young people were 23% more likely to vote if they\u2019d spoken with NextGen organizers than if they had not. That\u2019s particularly important in California, where the sky-high costs of advertising in the Los Angeles media market could keep Democrats \u2013 especially those who face competitive primaries \u2013 from keeping up with their Republican foes on the airwaves. In addition to geography, the House Republicans whom Democrats are targeting have a key vote in common: They each supported the House\u2019s bill to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and replace it with legislation crafted by GOP leadership and supported by Trump. In Rohrabacher\u2019s district, Hans Keirstead, a pioneer in stem cell research who sold his business for more than $100 million in 2014 and later bought it back, has given Democrats a top recruit with a science and business background in a district where Republican registration outpaces Democrats. Political chemistry: Scientists running for office in age of Trump Keirstead, a 50-year-old Canadian immigrant, said he plans to offer himself as an expert voice on health care with decades of experience in scientific research and pharmaceutical trials and approval \u2013 something he said Congress needs. \u201cThe breadth and depth in health care experience is lacking\u201d on Capitol Hill, he said, arguing that Republicans and Democrats \u201cboth want experts there \u2013 and they both want change.\u201d He faulted Trump\u2019s administration for slashing spending on Obamacare digital and television outreach and narrowing the enrollment period. \u201cThat had a direct effect of increasing premiums,\u201d he said. Then, he said, Trump\u2019s threats to end government payments to health insurers caused insurers to \u201chedge\u201d and increase premiums again. \u201cHere, months later, we say, \u2018oh, look at the rising premiums, continually rising.\u2019 It was just cresting to decrease,\u201d Keirstead said. \u201cThat crippling of Obamacare for nothing more than political gain really disappointed me. I just thought, putting politics in front of peoples\u2019 health \u2013 it\u2019s just so disgusting.\u201d During a tour of his Aivita Biomedical offices in Irvine, Keirstead also lambasted Trump\u2019s administration for proposing a budget that would slash the National Institutes of Health\u2019s funding for scientific research. \u201cWe\u2019re cutting off the future of medicine and health care,\u201d he said. Royce and Rohrabacher\u2019s offices did not respond to CNN interview requests. California Republicans say they are optimistic that their incumbents\u2019 fundraising advantage and their survival in 2016 will position them well in the midterms \u2013 when the party expects a gubernatorial race could help draw some additional Republican votes. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, in a presidential election with near-record turnout, these Republicans won rather handily, even though Hillary Clinton won their districts. They will more than likely outperform their margin of victory in 2018,\u201d said Jim Brulte, the California Republican Party chairman. \u201cWe are aware that Nancy Pelosi wants to be speaker. We are aware that she believes her return to the speakership runs through some of these seven California districts,\u201d Brulte said. \u201cWe are confident we will hold them \u2013 but we don\u2019t take anything for granted.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Libertarian Leaners: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ben Sasse The Moderate Wing: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Dean Heller The Bipartisan Group: John Kasich, John McCain, Jeff Flake The Twitter Opposition: Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Lindsey Graham Democrats aren\u2019t the only people in Washington who have stood in the way of Donald Trump\u2019s agenda over his first six months in office. Even members of the Republican President\u2019s own party haven\u2019t been the easiest to work with at the beginning of his term, disagreeing on everything from the Russia investigation to health care reform to those early morning tweets. The President\u2019s relationship with Republicans in Congress has become more complicated after he criticized senators for not passing a health reform bill and then large majorities passed a Russian sanctions bill over his objection. The Republican rebellion against Donald Trump So who are these Republicans who aren\u2019t always on board with Trump? They range from moderate governors to conservatives in the Senate \u2013 and when it comes to Trump\u2019s tweets \u2013 more Republicans than you might think. Here are the four tribes of Republicans who have stood up to Donald Trump. Some libertarian-leaning Republicans and conservatives on the far right of the political spectrum haven\u2019t been afraid to voice their opposition to Trump and his agenda. Sens. Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ted Cruz were three of the several initial holdouts in the Senate health care debate. Trump has a particularly unique rivalry with Cruz, who ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election and failed to endorse him at the GOP convention. Sen. Ben Sasse also often falls into this orbit. Meanwhile, on the House side, the libertarian-leaning Rep. Justin Amash from Michigan has also voiced his opposition to Trump. He\u2019s been one of the few Republicans to even mention the word impeachment and has been outspokenly critical at times against the President. The implications of the email thread are serious & disturbing. We deserve answers, not an ever-changing story. If there's more, tell us now. Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have repeatedly been the reliable GOP opposition in the Senate \u2013 on Betsy DeVos\u2019s nomination to become secretary of education, on allowing states to strip funding from Planned Parenthood and on multiple health care reform votes. Meanwhile, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and his state\u2019s governor, Brian Sandoval, opposed the GOP health care plan through much of the process, as did West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. Heller made a forceful speech in June opposing an early version of the bill, calling it \u201cnot the answer.\u201d Heller and Capito, however, did vote to advance the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d amendment backed by McConnell and most of the GOP caucus. Other moderates who haven\u2019t hesitated to oppose the President include Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, who like Heller, faces a tough re-election battle in 2018. Some more moderate Republicans and also conservatives have explicitly made arguments appealing to a higher sense of bipartisanship and integrity while opposing the Trump agenda. Sen. Jeff Flake waded into this camp in an excerpt of his book in Politico this week. \u201cThere was a time when the leadership of the Congress from both parties felt an institutional loyalty that would frequently create bonds across party lines in defense of congressional prerogatives in a unified front against the White House, regardless of the president\u2019s party,\u201d he wrote. Sen. John McCain made similar remarks from the Senate floor days after his brain cancer diagnosis and before sinking the health care bill. \u201cI hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again and by so doing better serve the people who elected us,\u201d he said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, one of Trump\u2019s primary rivals in 2016, has been calling for bipartisanship and critiquing the President from afar. Collins and Murkowski have also made these calls, especially during the health care debate. But many more Republicans \u2013 including some who don\u2019t usually hold themselves in opposition to the President \u2013 have voiced concern about his tweets. Trump has raised eyebrows throughout the campaign and his young presidency with tweets about everything from Russia to Hillary Clinton to criticizing his own attorney general. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell described Trump\u2019s tweets amid the health care debate as making his job \u201cmore challenging.\u201d Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse called a June tweet about MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski \u201cbeneath the dignity of your office\u201d and Sen. Lindsey Graham agreed. And Speaker Paul Ryan said he didn\u2019t \u201csee that as an appropriate comment\u201d lamenting that it did not help attempts to improve the civility of politics in Washington. Please just stop. This isn't normal and it's beneath the dignity of your office. Mr. President, your tweet was beneath the office and represents what is wrong with American politics, not the greatness of America. And Republican voters agree. A majority of Republicans (53%) said in a Fox News poll in June that Trump\u2019s tweets are doing more to hurt his agenda than help it. Six in 10 evangelical Christians and almost two in three whites without a college degree say they are not fans of Trump\u2019s tweets. Even a majority (51%) of self-reported Trump voters said his tweets hurt his agenda. And four in five Republicans say they either disapprove of Trump\u2019s tweet or wish he\u2019d be more cautious.",

            "article_content": "Senate Republicans are making moves to repeal at least parts of Obamacare A liberal group is trying to capitalize on a critical moment in the health care battle Progressive groups are launching a new data-gathering effort \u2013 starting at protests planned across the country this weekend \u2013 to turn the 2018 midterms into a single-issue battle over health care. Called \u201cHealth Care Voter,\u201d the campaign will kick off Saturday, where attendees at more than 125 protests will be asked to fill out cards pledging to cast their ballots based on how their lawmakers vote on rolling back Obamacare. It will also include digital ads pushing the pledge. It\u2019s an attempt to capitalize on a critical moment in the health care battle, as the Senate moves toward repealing at least parts of Obamacare. The initiative is how the groups \u2013 including Save My Care, Our Lives on the Line and Health Care for America Now, which are hubs of labor and progressive organizations\u2019 health care lobbying efforts \u2013 plan to gather voters\u2019 contact information, which can be used to direct those voters toward protests, town halls and more in the coming weeks and months. Progressives hope Saturday\u2019s \u201cOur Lives on the Line\u201d protests \u2013 initially set for the first day of lawmakers\u2019 summer recess, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed the start of that recess \u2013 will demonstrate the strength of their opposition at a key moment, with the Senate potentially still working on its bill. The organizers of the Women\u2019s March, the tax day protests and April 22\u2019s March for Science are involved \u2013 as well as Indivisible, a hub of left-leaning resistance with hundreds of local chapters; the Barack Obama-aligned Organizing for Action and Bernie Sanders\u2019 Our Revolution; leading progressive groups including Planned Parenthood, MoveOn.org, the Center for American Progress Action Fund and more. Trump calls out Murkowski over health care vote Meanwhile, Save Our Care \u2013 which is backed by many of those and other Democratic organizations \u2013 on Tuesday launched radio ads targeting four Republican senators over their votes to proceed to debating the Obamacare repeal effort: Nevada\u2019s Dean Heller, Arizona\u2019s Jeff Flake, West Virginia\u2019s Shelley Moore Capito and Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner. The Senate is in the process of voting on a series of amendments as Republicans push to repeal at least parts of former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. If the GOP succeeds, it would guarantee that health care will dominate the 2018 midterm election cycle \u2013 when Democrats hope to win control of the House and hold onto 10 Senate seats in states President Donald Trump won in 2016. And even if the repeal effort fails, progressives hope to use the GOP\u2019s effort to underscore the stakes of the midterms after two previous cycles \u2013 2010 and 2014 \u2013 that many Democratic voters sat out. \u201cThe American people will not sit by and be taken back to a time where people with pre-existing conditions died of easily treatable diseases, and people paid more for less comprehensive health care,\u201d said Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of the pro-women\u2019s equality group UltraViolet. \u201cOur lives depend on it, and our senators promised to protect us \u2013 now we promise to make sure their constituents know how they voted.\u201d",

            "article_content": "51-50 vote sets up days of debate and amendment votes The final bill language is up in the air Sen. John McCain returned to Washington for the vote Senate Republicans voted Tuesday afternoon to advance to floor debate on their efforts to re-write health care policy, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie. Reporter's Notebook: Inside the Senate chamber - an hour-long emotional swirl But hours later, the Senate decisively rejected a Republican proposal to repeal-and-replace Obamacare, a sign of the chaos expected to envelop Capitol Hill as GOP leaders work to find a plan their conference can agree to. Wednesday morning, floor debate on the legislation to overhaul the Affordable Care Act will continue, even though there aren\u2019t any guarantees the votes are there to eventually pass it \u2013 and it\u2019s unclear what a final bill will look like. But little may match the drama of Tuesday\u2019s vote on the motion to proceed, when Sen. John McCain returned from Arizona to applause from fellow senators to cast what would be a critical vote for the Republicans. Two GOP senators \u2013 Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski \u2013 sided with all Democrats in opposition, meaning all remaining Republicans and Pence were necessary for the motion to pass. Emotions were high all afternoon \u2013 as the vote began, protesters in the Senate gallery shouted \u201ckill the bill\u201d and \u201cshame, shame, shame!\u201d The vote came as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump dared their fellow Republicans to block their seven-year campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. The dramatic return of John McCain Senators late Tuesday cast their first vote on what could be dozens of amendments considered to it. This first vote dealt with a measure that combined a previous Senate proposal known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act \u2013 that was rejected by several Republican senators \u2013 with $100 billion in extra money for people on Medicaid desired by moderate Republicans and a proposal from conservative Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to allow bare-bones health insurance plans. Democrats moved successfully to kill the amendment, which was possible because it had not been officially scored by the Congressional Budget Office and therefore didn\u2019t meet the complicated reconciliation rules that the Senate is using to consider the bill. Republicans needed 60 votes to keep the amendment alive. It died on a 43 to 57 vote. The vote came after a Senate clerk was forced to read the text of the amendment aloud in the Senate chamber, all part of the delaying tactics Democrats employing to express their overall unhappiness with the bill. On Wednesday, senators are expected to cast a vote on a \u201crepeal-only\u201d proposal. It too is expected to be defeated because many Republicans as well as all Democrats reject repealing without a replacement ready. The vote was up in the air until the last moments, when several Republican holdouts announced their support, including Sens. Rand Paul, Dean Heller, Rob Portman and Shelley Moore Capito. Trump, who has repeatedly said he\u2019s ready to sign any repeal legislation, celebrated the vote, which creates a path to give him the major congressional victory that\u2019s eluded the White House thus far. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to announce that with zero of the Democrats\u2019 votes, the motion to proceed on health care has moved past and now we move forward toward truly great health care for the American people. We look forward to that. This was a big step,\u201d Trump said at a White House news conference. Senate protesters chant 'kill the bill,' interrupt motion to proceed \u201cI want to thank Sen. John McCain,\u201d he added. \u201cA very brave man. He made a tough trip to get here.\u201d But while Trump was happy with the result, he also acknowledged there\u2019s a long road ahead for the legislation and criticized the two GOP senators who opposed the motion. \u201cWe had two Republicans that went against us, which is very sad, I think,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very sad \u2013 for them. But I\u2019m very, very happy with the result. I believe now we will, over the next week or two, come up with a plan that\u2019s going to be really, really wonderful for the American people.\u201d Democrats are united against the bill, saying it would end health care coverage for millions of Americans. Republicans just dodged political disaster on health care \u201cAnyone who thinks this is over is sadly mistaken,\u201d said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York. \u201cThere are many, many Republicans who don\u2019t like this bill, who don\u2019t want to vote for it. They are under enormous pressure to vote for it. \u2026 Anyone who voted to move to proceed and certainly anyone who votes to send this bill to conference is virtually, certainly, voting to kick millions off health care, to make it much harder to get coverage if you have a pre-existing condition, to slash Medicaid and give a huge amount of tax cuts to the rich.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders Monday called the bill the \u201ccruelest, most destructive and irresponsible piece of legislation ever brought to the United States Senate in the modern history of this country.\u201d In a speech at the NAACP national convention, highlighted the possible effects of the bill\u2019s provisions, which include cutting Medicaid, defunding Planned Parenthood and roadblocks for those with pre-existing conditions. McConnell won over key holdouts on the procedural vote, but those senators haven\u2019t said they will back the final measure. Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said he would support the procedural motion to open debate on the health care bill, so long as leadership guarantees a vote on a full repeal of Obamacare. Endangered Republicans stick with Trump on key health care vote \u201cIf this is indeed the plan, I will vote to proceed and I will vote for any all measures that are clean repeal,\u201d Paul tweeted. Such an amendment would be expected to fail, however. Heller, who has complained that Obamacare repeal efforts could hurt Nevada residents dependent on Medicaid, nevertheless said he\u2019d vote to move forward. Heller is facing a tough re-election campaign in Nevada next year. \u201cObamacare isn\u2019t the answer, but doing nothing to try to solve the problems it has created isn\u2019t the answer either,\u201d Heller said in a statement. \u201cIf the final product isn\u2019t improved for the state of Nevada, then I will not vote for it; if it is improved, I will support it.\u201d Republican leaders Tuesday worked thread any needle they can to appease other holdouts. \u201cThe only goal is to get onto the bill. Nothing happens until we do, so that\u2019s the only goal,\u201d a Republican aide said. \u201cThese are the moments legislatively when you get creative. We\u2019re getting creative.\u201d This story has been updated. CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Sanders said Monday that health care is a \"right, not a privilege\" Sanders spoke to the NAACP national convention Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Senate Republicans\u2019 health care bill as \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d in a speech at the NAACP national convention in Baltimore on Monday. Calling the bill the \u201ccruelest, most destructive and irresponsible piece of legislation ever brought to the United States Senate in the modern history of this country,\u201d Sanders highlighted the possible effects of the bill\u2019s provisions, which include cutting Medicaid, defunding Planned Parenthood and roadblocks for those with pre-existing conditions. Sanders also criticized Republicans for not holding hearings on the bill and writing it \u201cbehind closed doors.\u201d \u201cThis legislation is overwhelmingly opposed by the American people, overwhelming opposed by virtually every health care organization in this country,\u201d Sanders said, listing a number of organizations that oppose the bill, including AARP and the American Cancer Society. Sanders\u2019 remarks were a part of the conference\u2019s policy discussions, which included a panel of Democratic legislators such as Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Virginia Rep. Bobby Scott, and Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee as well as Republican Virginia Rep. Scott Taylor. Sanders also briefly touched on a number of other topics during his speech including criminal justice reform, police department reform, minimum wage and Wall Street reform. The speech came as Sanders continues to be one of the most active potential Democratic candidates ahead of the 2020 election. In his 2016 run for the presidency, Sanders struggled to compete for African-American votes with eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Despite recent trips to West Virginia, Kentucky and Iowa, Sanders told SiriusXM\u2019s Mark Thompson on July 12 that it was still \u201ctoo early\u201d to talk 2020. \u201cI am not taking it off the table. I just have not made any decisions. And I think it\u2019s much too early,\u201d Sanders said.",

            "article_content": "Senate Republicans have been trying to thread the needle on health care reform Maine Sen. Susan Collins is the least conservative GOP Senator in our ratings Senate Republicans have been trying to thread the needle on health care reform for weeks, but their latest efforts collapsed on Monday when it became clear they couldn\u2019t rally the votes to pass the bill. So why can\u2019t they find agreement? Each senator has a different reason to oppose the legislation \u2013 from ideology to re-election concerns to the demographics and health nuances of individual states. With all Democrats opposed to repealing Obamacare and only 52 members in the chamber\u2019s slim majority, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell could afford to lose only two GOP defectors in his quest to push a bill through his chamber. But now four GOP  members \u2013 a moderate and three conservatives \u2013 publicly say they oppose the revised plan, and McConnell has moved to trying to repeal now and replace later. Why is this so hard? Republicans have been promising for years to repeal the law. When it comes down to the details of repealing the law, it turns out Republicans have a variety of opinions of how it should be done. The members McConnell needs to convince sit on the extremes in some categories of the party and country. To explain why the Senate\u2019s new Obamacare repeal plan is in so much trouble, here are nine charts focused on the 10 Republicans who opposed McConnell\u2019s original bill and four of those who had real problems with it. An analysis from the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation finds nearly one-in-six nonelderly residents of West Virginia and Kentucky would become uninsured under the original Senate plan, dialing up the heat on Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and Sen. Rand Paul to vote for a bill they can stand behind. Paul lashed out against McConnell\u2019s original plan, saying \u201cthey\u2019re not going to fix the death spiral of Obamacare.\u201d A revised Senate plan released isn\u2019t likely to change those projections. One-in-eight nonelderly residents in North Dakota, Ohio and Nevada would lose insurance, drawing attention from Sen. John Hoeven, Sen. Rob Portman and Sen. Dean Heller. More than three in 10 residents of Louisiana are enrolled in Medicaid, drawing attention from Sen. Bill Cassidy. The most recent Senate plan was slated to cut Medicaid spending by 35 percent over the next two decades, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Cassidy partnered with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham on Thursday to propose a plan B: keeping some of Obamacare\u2019s taxes but giving the money to states to control. Other senators from states over the national average of Medicaid enrollment include Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who says the plan \u201ccuts traditional Medicaid too deeply.\u201d Voting for the Senate bill is a particularly hard lift for senators in states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. One-in-ten residents in West Virginia are insured through the Medicaid expansion program \u2013 one of the highest rates in the nation. Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s Kentucky, Sen. Dean Heller\u2019s Nevada and Sen. Rob Portman\u2019s Ohio also exceed the national average of 5% of Americans. Alaska, represented by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, has also expanded Medicaid. The bill would dramatically cut funding for Medicaid in future years. State governments elsewhere in the country chose not to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito represents the state with the highest proportion of drug overdose deaths in the nation \u2013 42 per 100,000 deaths \u2013 almost three times the national average, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. She said in late June that the repeal and replace plan \u201cdoes not do enough to combat the opioid epidemic that is devastating my state.\u201d With one of the highest rates in the nation, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman also faces opioid concerns in his state with 30 drug overdose deaths per 100,000. The revised version of the health care bill had added an additional $45 billion for opioid addiction treatment. The proportion of uninsured Americans has dropped 6 percentage points since 2009, according to data from the US Census Bureau. But the boost nationwide has helped residents represented by Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito more than most. The uninsured rate in Texas has dropped 9 percentage points since 2009, and the uninsured rate has dropped 8 percentage points \u2013 more than cut in half \u2013 in both Kentucky and West Virginia. The most real and immediate re-electon threat is to Nevada Sen. Dean Heller. He won his seat by just a single percentage point in 2012, but his state voted for Hillary Clinton by a narrow margin in November. His seat is up for grabs again in just 18 months. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, on the other hand, was thought to be one of the most vulnerable Senators in the 2016 election, but he prevailed with some help from the top of the ticket. He won\u2019t face re-election until 2022, but his seat will likely be in the toss-up category again. In addition to Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker are both up for re-election in just a year and a half. Cruz has been successful in lobbying for a change to give insurers more flexibility to offer plans that don\u2019t comply with some Obamacare regulations. But Heller announced his opposition in an unusual news conference in late June back in Nevada, saying \u201cit\u2019s going to be very difficult\u201d for him to support the plan. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who has also been playing the fence on support for the health care plan, also faces the potential for a primary and general election battle during his re-election in 2018. Ideology marks one of the major hurdles for both the right and the left wings of the GOP caucus. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee \u2013 the three most conservative members \u2013 released a joint statement on the original Senate plan, saying \u201cit does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs.\u201d Elements of a proposal by Cruz were included in the revised version, drawing his support but possibly further alienating more moderate members. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse marks another conservative on the fence. Meanwhile, in the moderate wing of the party, possible defections include Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski \u2013 both of whom have already united to oppose the nomination of Betsy DeVos and a bill allowing states to block Planned Parenthood funding. Collins has been more vocal in her opposition to the bill so far, saying she needs a \u201ccomplete overhaul\u201d in order to back the bill. Ratings in the chart above come from DW-NOMINATE, a scoring system developed by political scientists based on Congressional voting records. While Maine Sen. Susan Collins has enjoyed a re-election margin nearly double the average member of the US Senate, her state narrowly voted for Hillary Clinton in November. And with some pundits wondering if she has her eye on the governor\u2019s mansion in 2018, the views of her constituents are also not far from her mind. While Trump won the Buckeye State by a wider-than-expected 8 points, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman still represents a purple state. He\u2019s just kicking off his new term and won\u2019t face re-election until 2022, but Medicaid expansion and drug crisis are keeping him on the fence. Graphics by CNN\u2019s Joyce Tseng.",

            "article_content": "June marked the unofficial start of the general election The meeting was scheduled for 4:00 p.m. in Donald Trump Jr.'s office It wasn\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s day. June 9, 2016 \u2013 the day that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with a Russian lawyer to get opposition research on Hillary Clinton \u2013 was a 24-hour period that the businessman-turned-presidential candidate likely hated: The spotlight wasn\u2019t on him. Donald Trump Jr. releases email chain on his Russian meeting But more than a year after that unseasonably cool Thursday in New York, what happened on June 9 has intensified the spotlight on Trump \u2013 now president \u2013 and his family. News of the meeting between Natalia Veselnitskaya, billed in an email as a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d and three of Trump\u2019s top campaign aides has rocked the Trump White House and led Clinton\u2019s vice presidential candidate, Sen. Tim Kaine, to speculate whether Trump Jr.\u2019s behavior amounts to treason. After months of grueling primaries, June marked the unofficial start of the general election and both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were starting to turn their focus on each other as the calendar turned to June 9. The day was a significant moment for Clinton: In a tweet to her followers at 1:50 p.m. ET, the former secretary of state announced that President Barack Obama endorsed her candidacy to succeed him in the White House. President Obama endorses Hillary: \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.\" https://t.co/KetvKoa853 Obama\u2019s backing of Clinton was always assumed, but Trump quickly responded. \u201cObama just endorsed Crooked Hillary,\u201d he wrote on Twitter at 2:22p ET. \u201cHe wants four more years of Obama\u2014but nobody else does!\u201d Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama\u2014but nobody else does! Clinton, in her most retweeted tweet of the entire campaign, responded to Trump: \u201cDelete your account,\u201d she wrote. Delete your account. https://t.co/Oa92sncRQY Trump\u2019s retort took two hours: \u201cHow long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up\u2013and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?\u201d How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted? https://t.co/gECLNtQizQ The back-and-forth was a preview of the biting, negative campaign that two New Yorkers would wage in the coming months. But little did anyone know that Trump\u2019s tweet about Clinton\u2019s deleted emails came 40 minutes after his son\u2019s meeting with Veselnitskaya was scheduled. Trump\u2019s attorneys and White House officials have said the President found out about his son\u2019s meeting only days ago. But on June 7, Trump teased on Twitter that he would deliver a \u201cmajor speech\u201d to discuss \u201call the things that have taken place with the Clintons.\u201d \u201cI am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we\u2019re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons,\u201d Trump said during a speech after winning the California, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and New Jersey primaries. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting. I wonder if the press will want to attend. Who knows?\u201d The speech was later moved to June 22 \u2013 due to the deadly terrorist attack at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando \u2013 but Trump called on Clinton\u2019s deleted emails \u201cto be found.\u201d \u201cShould be able to be found because the government \u2013 I will say, I\u2019ve always heard you can never really delete an email,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it should be able to be found if they really want to find them, but I don\u2019t think they want to find them.\u201d According to emails released by Trump\u2019s eldest son on Tuesday, the meeting was scheduled for 4:00 p.m. ET in Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s office at 725 Fifth Avenue \u2013 Trump Tower. The meeting, according Trump Jr.\u2019s lawyer, lasted 20 to 30 minutes. The emails, which Donald Trump Jr. released Tuesday ahead of a story by The New York Times set to detail the exchanges, show him willing to take information from someone described to him as a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d whose information was \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d The interlocutor who connected Trump Jr. with Veselnitskaya also publicized the fact he was at Trump Tower on June 9. Rob Goldstone, a publicist who represents the son of an Azerbaijani-Russian businessman close to the Russian government, posted on Facebook that he was \u201cpreparing for meeting\u201d at Trump Tower on June 9. Goldstone, in the emails released Tuesday, said he would not attend the meeting but would escort the lawyer to Trump Tower. Trump Jr. told Goldstone that if his emails are \u201cwhat you say I love it especially later in the summer,\u201d according to the email chain Trump Jr. released. Trump\u2019s only semi-public event of the day was his first fundraiser with the Trump Victory Fund, his campaign\u2019s joint fundraising effort with the Republican National Committee and a smattering of state Republican parties. At New York\u2019s tony Four Seasons Hotel, Trump met for lunch with dozens of top Republican donors to chart his fundraising plan for the general election. Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chair who now serves as Trump\u2019s chief of staff, attended the fundraiser and was seen walking into Trump Tower around 10:53 a.m. ET before the event. Trump left the donor meeting around 1:02 p.m. ET and returned to Trump Tower, the eponymous building where he both lives and works. The trip from the Four Seasons was less than two blocks. Trump remained at Trump Tower for the rest of the afternoon. Clinton, after a surprisingly grueling primary against liberal Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, unofficially cinched the Democratic nomination three days earlier, according to an Associated Press delegate count \u2013 on June 6 \u2013 before an event in Long Beach, California. After coyly mentioning the news that had already reverberated around the Long Beach City College gym, Clinton\u2019s focus now turned to unifying the Democratic Party and squaring up against Trump, who was already the presumed Republican nominee. Clinton crossed the country on June 7 and headlined arguably the most significant political event of her life as she became the first female presidential nominee from a major US political party, the crowning achievement on her storied career. \u201cWe believe that we are stronger together and the stakes in this election are high and the choice is clear,\u201d Clinton, who was introduced by a 3-minute video that acknowledged the history of the moment, told a cheering crowd at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. \u201cDonald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be the President of the United States.\u201d Clinton, according to campaign records, was home on June 9 as Trump\u2019s son met with the Russian lawyer. After a largely media free primary campaign, Clinton marked the turn to the general election with a series of interviews meant to celebrate Obama\u2019s endorsement and her turn to the general. Clinton \u2013 starting in the afternoon \u2013 did phone interviews with Bloomberg, Reuters, Politico and NPR from her leafy home in Chappaqua, New York, an estate that is a mere 35 miles from Trump Tower. It\u2019s unclear whether Clinton was speaking with reporters when the meeting at Trump Tower took place, but Clinton was reflecting more on her win against Sanders in the interviews than her future contest with Trump. Clinton told NPR she was \u201cthrilled\u201d by Obama\u2019s endorsement and was said she looked \u201cforward to working with (Bernie Sanders) during the campaign and then on after the inauguration.\u201d \u201cI think his campaign was good for the Democratic Party, good for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know how passionate he is about the issues he cares about. So we\u2019ll have a long list of matters to discuss when we sit down.\u201d Clinton would continue to make calls later in the afternoon and spent a largely uneventful night, according to an aide, at her New York home on June 9 before waking up and flying to Washington on June 10 for a speech to Planned Parenthood and a visit to a local muffin shop. \u201cIn the afterglow of clinching the nomination, she was celebrating our win,\u201d Nick Merrill, Clinton\u2019s spokesman said Tuesday, \u201cwhile the Trumps were colluding with Kremlin.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, Jeremy Diamond, Ashley Killough and Bonney Kapp contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Over a thousand activists marched around the Capitol building to \"filibuster\" the GOP health care bill 48 representatives gathered on the Capitol steps to don black veils in \"mourning\" for Medicaid cuts Over a thousand chanting activists walked a lap around the Capitol building Wednesday evening to protest the American Health Care Act. The march was part of a three-day \u201cPeople\u2019s Filibuster,\u201d co-organized by more than 19 groups, including the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and American Federation of Labor. \u201cWe had so many patient advocates show up in force,\u201d Planned Parenthood federal campaigns director Graeme Joeck said. \u201cWe hope this sends a clear message that our voices have put a delay, and that this bill will not last.\u201d Philadelphia resident Signe Espinoza, 24, kicked off the post-march rally by sharing her personal health care experience on stage. \u201cI rely on Medicaid. I have relied on Medicaid for a really long time, and my parents rely on Medicaid. If this vote passes, millions of people just like me will be affected,\u201d Espinoza said. Some protesters held printed white fliers with people\u2019s faces and the words \u201cI will lose my health care.\u201d Designed by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, these fliers are part of a campaign that asks Americans to share personal stories about the impact of health care on their lives. \u201cI think we realized that health care was going to be the first issue on the chopping block,\u201d CAP Action Fund campaign director Emily Tisch Sussman said. \u201cPeople had to see themselves in the victims, because unfortunately, so many people would become the victims. So we started working on the story bank immediately after the election, and it\u2019s only grown since then.\u201d More optimism than progress for Senate health care bill A number certain to strike fear in the hearts of Senate Republicans Forty-eight members of the House of Representatives also gathered on the Capitol steps to don black veils in \u201cmourning\u201d for Medicaid cuts. Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore organized the demonstration, according to her communications director Eric Harris. \u201cThe 22 million people who would lose care because of the repeal of Obamacare \u2013 that only scratches the surface of the people who would be harmed with a structural change in Medicaid,\u201d Moore said, citing numbers in the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s assessment of the Senate bill. These lawmakers and their colleagues from the Senate soon crossed the east lawn to voice their support, including Sens. Ron Wyden, Patty Murray, Chuck Schumer, Brian Schatz, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Was outside the US Capitol to show GOP we won\u2019t stand by while they try to pass a bill that would leave 22M more Americans uninsured by 2026 pic.twitter.com/ICYHdFYwk4 Many more lawmakers mingled in the crowd, listening to stories and sharing their thoughts on the future of the AHCA. As he left the stage, Booker articulated the legislative challenges ahead. \u201cLook, it\u2019s the start of a very tough week to 10 days ahead of us,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing given. We\u2019re fighting against very powerful forces, very entrenched interests, very wealthy interests.\u201d The CBO just made it much, much harder for Senate Republicans to pass health care Trump promises 'big surprise' on health care Democrats \u2013 and some Republicans \u2013 have not been included in health care negotiations up until this point. But given Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s decision Tuesday to delay the chamber\u2019s AHCA vote, Schatz expressed hope for bipartisan cooperation in the future. \u201cI think there\u2019s enough momentum on the Republican side internally to make (compromise) a more realistic possibility than it was at the beginning of the week.

            "article_content": "Democrats had hoped a win in Georgia would be a referendum on President Donald Trump The timing of the vote coincides with Republicans' attempts to pass a health care bill Karen Handel\u2019s victory in the Georgia special House election Tuesday night has House Republicans who recently voted for a deeply unpopular bill to repeal Obamacare breathing a sigh of relief. And it will now offer some cover \u2013 even political reassurance \u2013 to Senate Republicans who are gearing up to cast similar votes next week. The Democrat in the Georgia race, Jon Ossoff, was unsuccessful in flipping a traditionally Republican district in the Atlanta suburbs previously represented by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Had the 30-year-old first-time political candidate pulled off an upset, it would have dealt a major blow to the Republican Party\u2019s already complicated efforts to gut Obamacare. Democrats were prepared to cast the results of the closely watched special election as a referendum on President Donald Trump and the GOP\u2019s legislative priorities \u2013 chief among them the quest to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark health care law. Former Republican Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty said Handel\u2019s win provides the party with \u201chuge relief and somewhat of a political sedative\u201d heading into 2018, when Democrats are eager to try to win back control of the House. Conservatives on Capitol Hill anxiously await health care bill \u201cIt kind of calms the waters in terms of people looking for predictors or harbingers and what it means for 2018,\u201d Pawlenty told CNN. \u201cIt says: Perhaps the approach that\u2019s being taken in Congress and by the President are more acceptable to a swing district or swing-voting parts of the country than people are predicting.\u201d Since House Republicans narrowly passed a bill to repeal Obamacare in May, Ossoff was increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the legislation. GOP did not mention Trump after Georgia win The House bill would dismantle the main pillars of the current health care system, eliminating Obamacare taxes on the wealthy and insurers; getting rid of the individual mandate; significantly curtailing federal support for Medicaid; and allowing states to loosen key Obamacare protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The controversial proposal, which Handel said she would have voted for, would \u201cgut the protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions \u2013 hundreds of thousands of them,\u201d Ossoff argued at a debate earlier this month. Handel pushed back forcefully, pointing out that her sister was born without an esophagus \u2013 a pre-existing condition. \u201cFor you to suggest that I would do anything to negatively effect her is absolutely outrageous and unacceptable,\u201d Handel said. A recent Ossoff campaign ad featuring several breast cancer survivors accused Handel of having \u201ccut off funding for Planned Parenthood cancer screening\u201d when she was a senior executive at Susan G. Komen (Handel has long since denied such accusations, calling the fight against breast cancer her \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d). Jon Ossoff concedes Georgia race With health care so much of the focus in the Georgia special election, Democrats were ready to liken an Ossoff victory to that of former GOP Sen. Scott Brown in the 2010 special election in Massachusetts. At the time, Brown\u2019s unlikely triumph over Democratic Attorney General Martha Coakley was viewed as voters\u2019 sharp rejection of Obamacare, which Democratic lawmakers were in the middle of crafting. When Brown decisively won the office long occupied by the late-Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy, Democrats were forced to act quickly to pass Obamacare, despite deep reservations and divisions across the party about the legislation. Now, with Handel keeping Price\u2019s old seat in GOP hands, Democratic strategists insist that health care will still be powerful ammunition against Republicans in next year\u2019s congressional elections. \u201cI don\u2019t think that very many Republicans will take much comfort on the health care issue even if Handel does win,\u201d said veteran Democratic pollster Geoff Garin in advance of Tuesday\u2019s result. \u201cI think Republicans will continue to recognize that taking away coverage from millions of Americans and raising costs for millions more is a politically unpopular and dangerous enterprise.\u201d The secretive Senate health care process is wrong. Just ask Republicans. A draft of Republicans\u2019 plans in the Senate is expected to be released this Thursday, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who wants to put health care in the rear-view mirror before lawmakers leave Washington ahead of the July 4 recess. Senate Republicans have already been facing mounting pressure \u2013 including from the President himself \u2013 to address serious concerns that have been raised about the House GOP bill. Despite having celebrated the House passage of an Obamacare repeal bill last month, Trump privately told lawmakers recently that the House proposal was \u201cmean,\u201d and that the final product plan must be more \u201cgenerous.\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer reiterated that sentiment in the briefing room Tuesday. \u201cThe President clearly wants a bill that has heart in it,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cHe believes that health care is something that is near and dear to so many families and individuals.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Camerota pressed him on the broader impact of the local campaign Ossoff also was asked about a recent ad that linked him to last week's baseball practice shooting As polls opened for a highly anticipated congressional runoff election in Georgia Tuesday, Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff demurred when asked by CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota about the race\u2019s national implications. \u201cThe contrast in this district is between a career politician \u2013 my opponent, Karen Handel, who is notorious for cutting off funding for life-saving breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood \u2013 or a fresh voice who wants to work across the aisle to get things done, grow our local economy, (and) work to make health care more accessible and affordable for women and folks with pre-existing conditions,\u201d he said on \u201cNew Day.\u201d Who is Jon Ossoff? Camerota pressed him on the broader impact of the local campaign, focusing on whether he saw his potential election in a traditionally red district as a referendum on President Donald Trump\u2019s performance in office. When he kept his response locally-focused, she reminded him the race has garnered massive amounts of interest and money from people outside the state. \u201cOut-of-state money has poured in on both sides. It\u2019s become a little bit of an arms race,\u201d the Democrat admitted. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that my campaign is powered by small-dollar grassroots fundraising of an average contribution of less than $50 while my opponent\u2019s campaign has been bailed out by the same old special-interest super PACs peddling deception, fear-mongering and hate here in Georgia for months now.\u201d Trump shadows over Georgia's 6th district run-off \u201cYou want to see this race as about you against Karen Handel,\u201d Camerota pushed. \u201cUnderstood. You\u2019ve worked hard. But do you not see the national implications of this race, do you not think it\u2019s at all a referendum on Donald Trump?\u201d Ossoff again said he will \u201cdo the best job possible representing the people of Georgia\u2019s sixth district,\u201d so Camerota moved on to asking about a recent ad from \u201ca right-wing PAC\u201d that linked him to the recent shooting at a Congressional Baseball Game practice for GOP congressmen that left Republican House Whip Steve Scalise in critical condition. \u201cWhat can you even say?\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cThe man is fighting for his life. It\u2019s got no place in a political attack ad. This is exactly what Americans are sick and tired of. It\u2019s exactly why the folks in DC have clearly lost the plot, clearly don\u2019t understand what people care about, don\u2019t understand that most people out there \u2013 most people down here in the real world \u2013 want unity, want a commitment to getting things done that improves life for them.\u201d 5 things to watch in Georgia's high-stakes House special election Camerota followed up by asking him how he\u2019d promote that sort of unity. Ossoff responded that if he wins, the people of Georgia will prove that Americans want to work together to elect people who will serve their interests. He moved on to the subject of health care, condemning congressional officials for acting in their own partisan interests. To close out the segment, Camerota congratulated Ossoff on his recent engagement, then jokingly took credit for \u201cbadgering\u201d him into proposing to fianc\u00e9e Alisha Kramer. Handel had also been invited on \u201cNew Day\u201d but declined to appear. Watch New Day weekdays at 6am-9am ET. For the latest on New Day click here",

            "article_content": "The window is quickly closing if Senate Republicans want to vote on a health care bill before the July 4 recess. But if the GOP leaders are on the cusp of a vote, most senators aren\u2019t in the loop. Republican leaders continue to be under fire \u2013 even from their own members \u2013 for their tightly guarded process to repealing Obamacare. It\u2019s being kept under wraps by design. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell needs to be as close to 50 votes as possible before he unveils his legislation. Reveal it too soon and criticism from outside conservative groups, independent reviews and Democrats could have the bill unravel before it hits the floor. That means the critical lawmakers are also holding back. \u201cUntil I see the bill and the (Congressional Budget Office) assessment of the bill, I\u2019m not going to feel comfortable taking a position,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine. Democrats are also weighing their options this week on how to slow the GOP\u2019s health care efforts. Sen. Bernie Sanders said he is \u201cin favor\u201d of Democrats using parliamentary tactics that could essentially bring the Senate to a halt. \u201cI am in favor,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. \u201cI am in favor of the American people and members of Congress doing everything that we can to defeat that horrific piece of legislation that will hurt tens and tens of millions of people in our country.\u201d One Senate aide says Democrats\u2019 current plan is to hold the floor until midnight and members will use the time to tell constituent stories about the Affordable Care Act. Another twist: Tuesday\u2019s special congressional election in Georgia. A win for Democrat Jon Ossoff could be seen as a stark warning to President Donald Trump and the GOP Obamacare repeal efforts. Against that background, McConnell\u2019s task this week is two-fold: finish a bill and convince enough people to back it. Here are the players who will decide the fate of health care in the Senate this week. While the GOP has railed against Obamacare for years, there\u2019s one pillar of the health care law that plenty of Republican lawmakers now say is pivotal for their constituents: Medicaid expansion. The House health care bill proposes gutting the program, effectively ending enhanced federal funding for Medicaid in 2020. But Senate Republicans who hail from states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare say that would cut off vital resources for some of their most vulnerable constituents much too abruptly. Portman, a member of the Senate working group on the bill, has led the effort to convince leadership to accept a seven-year \u201cglide path\u201d \u2013 a longer transition period in which Medicaid expansion state governors can figure out an alternative to the program. It\u2019s unclear what concessions leadership will ultimately make on the Medicaid front. One sticking point in these deliberations is what will happen to patients who receive opioid treatment under expanded Medicaid. Senators like Portman are calling for more resources to be provided to governors so that opioid treatment funding doesn\u2019t end up on the chopping block. Up for re-election in 2018 in a state Hillary Clinton won, Heller is perhaps one of the most vulnerable Republicans in this health care debate. Heller also comes from a state that thanks to expanded Medicaid has seen its uninsured rate drop from 23 percent to 12 percent. The senator has been fighting alongside Portman to more slowly phase out federal money for Medicaid expansion. But Heller is facing a bit more pressure from back home. His Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval told the Nevada Independent this week he would prefer the expansion didn\u2019t go away at all. That\u2019s not going to happen in the Senate where non-expansion Republicans have argued that Medicaid-expansion states shouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep more federal money. Cruz is trying a new role in the debate over health care: negotiator. Rather than sticking to the firebrand, leadership-agitating strategy that defined his early years in the Senate, Cruz \u2013 and those who have been working with him\u2013 insist he is working constructively behind the scenes to get to \u2018yes\u2019 on health care. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Cruz is still one of the Senate\u2019s most conservative members who has said that he wants to ensure that the Senate health care bill actually lowers premiums. Like many conservatives, Cruz believes that in order to bring down the cost of health insurance, lawmakers need to repeal as many of the Obamacare-era regulations as possible. He also has advocated to repeal Obamacare taxes as soon as possible. A twist: Cruz is up for re-election in 2018. And a bad position for Cruz would be to on the opposite side of Trump who has said he likes the direction the Senate bill is moving. Murkowski has been frank about her frustration with how the Senate is crafting their health care bill. She was invited to the White House to meet with the President last week on health care, but told reporters after the meeting that she had no idea if she was having an impact in the process because \u201cI have no idea if we even have a bill.\u201d \u201cI mean I learn more from you all,\u201d she said to reporters. Murkowski is independent-minded and fiercely loyal to Alaska, which has some of the most expensive insurance premiums in the country. Murkowski has said she wants to make sure that the Senate bill\u2019s tax credits are more generous for those living in rural places like Alaska than the House bill\u2019s were. She also has been critical of defunding Planned Parenthood, an item that will likely be included if McConnell needs conservative support for his bill. Murkowski\u2019s not an easy get, but if leadership is amendable to her wishes, it could give an indication that the bill is moving in a more moderate direction. Collins isn\u2019t a member of the Senate \u201cworking group,\u201d but the Maine Republican is pivotal player in the health care debate \u2013 and a critical vote for leadership to win over. The moderate senator already released an \u201cObamacare replacement\u201d bill this year along with Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, aimed at giving states more power to determine their own health care policy. One option for states under this legislation: keep Obamacare if they like it. Collins has made clear that she sees serious problems with the legislation that House Republicans passed last month, and is a rare proponent of working with Democrats on a health care plan. She voted against Republicans\u2019 Obamacare repeal bill in 2015. She has also been very clear with her Senate leaders that if they want to create a high-risk pool like the House bill did, they need to allocate more money for it. She has argued that her state\u2019s high risk pool is a good model, but that it is an example of how much money is needed to ensure the program\u2019s success. She presented on her state\u2019s high risk pool to colleagues during a Senate lunch and spoke about it during the White House meeting with Trump. Along with Murkowski, she supports preserving federal funding for Planned Parenthood as well. Although she says it is just one of many factors that will have an effect on the way she votes. \u201cThere are a lot of important issues,\u201d Collins said last week when asked about it. Two of the most conservative members in the Senate are going to be major players in the race to count health care votes. Paul is already talking like he\u2019s leaning against anything that remotely looks like the House bill. There is, of course, no bill yet, but Paul criticized the House bill for allocating money for tax credits, which he says sound like another entitlement program. If anything, many expect the Senate bill will be more generous with those credits. \u201cWhat I\u2019m telling them is if they get to an impasse, come talk to me because I am more than willing to vote for a partial repeal if I can\u2019t get complete repeal, but I\u2019m not willing to vote for new Republican entitlement programs,\u201d Paul said. Lee, has advocated, that more \u2013 not fewer \u2013 Obamacare regulations should be repealed but so far it looks like the Senate is leaning toward repealing fewer of the regulations than the House bill.",

            "article_content": "Special election in Georgia's 6th House district is June 20 House seat was previously held by HHS Secretary Tom Price Nationally, Georgia\u2019s closely watched special election for a seat in Congress \u2013 already the most expensive House race in history \u2013 is all about President Donald Trump. But you wouldn\u2019t know it watching Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel debate for the first time Tuesday night ahead of the June 20 contest. In fact, the most important moment of the debate came in Handel\u2019s answer \u2013 sure to be played on repeat in Democratic television ads \u2013 to a question about the minimum wage. \u201cThis is an example of a fundamental difference between a liberal and a conservative,\u201d Handel said. \u201cI do not support a livable wage.\u201d She added that she instead wants \u201can economy that is robust with low taxes and regulation.\u201d False claim removed from NRA attack ad on Georgia congressional candidate Jon Ossoff The dynamics of the race \u2013 Handel\u2019s desire to avoid the most controversial planks of Trump\u2019s agenda, and Ossoff\u2019s need to project a moderate voice in a traditionally Republican district \u2013 were evident from the very first question, which asked about Trump\u2019s executive order banning travel to the United States from several majority Muslim countries. Handel \u2013 seeking to avoid Trump\u2019s terminology while defending the policy \u2013 referred to a \u201ctravel, ah, proposal.\u201d Ossoff didn\u2019t answer directly at all until a moderator followed up, asking for a yes or no. Only then did Ossoff say he wants such decisions to be based on intelligence, rather than a blanket policy on certain countries of origin. The two were pressed on where they would break from their parties\u2019 most recent presidents. GOP candidate's husband shares image urging voters to 'free the black slaves from the Democratic plantation' Ossoff criticized former President Barack Obama for failing to enforce the \u201cred line\u201d of using chemical weapons in Syria. Handel needled Trump\u2019s budget proposal for cutting funding for science and cancer research. \u201cAdditionally, I would really like to recommend some Twitter policy changes,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you should just put down the computer, the phone, and walk away.\u201d Progressives for months have seen the Georgia race as their best opportunity to rebuke Trump. The liberal blog Daily Kos helped turn Ossoff into an online fundraising phenomenon, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2013 criticized for downplaying other House special elections in even redder districts \u2013 has been on the ground in the northern Atlanta suburbs for months. But Ossoff rarely invoked Trump\u2019s name, and did so only in shots at Handel. Instead, he cast himself as an economics-driven voice who would work across the aisle. Now Kathy Griffin is an issue in the Georgia special election Handel, meanwhile, repeatedly attempted to latch Ossoff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. Prodding Ossoff\u2019s residence \u2013 he and his fianc\u00e9e live just outside the district while she attends medical school \u2013 Handel said: \u201cI\u2019ve been in Georgia almost as long as you\u2019ve been alive. You might live just outside of the district, but your values are 3,000 miles away in San Francisco.\u201d The debate showed the danger that the House Republican health care bill poses, as well. Though she backed the bill, Handel told a personal story \u2013 citing a sister born with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to underscore her argument that she\u2019d never back a bill that undercut coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. \u201cI will not, not be lectured by you or anyone else,\u201d she said. Ossoff, though, repeatedly pointed out what independent fact-checkers have found: The GOP bill would weaken protections for those with pre-existing conditions by allowing states to opt out of rules that prohibit insurers from charging those with pre-existing conditions more. The secret to Democrats winning again Ossoff also hit Handel for the Susan G. Komen Foundation\u2019s decision during her tenure as vice president for policy to halt its partnership with Planned Parenthood. The charity eventually reversed that decision and resumed funding breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood, leading to Handel\u2019s ouster and her rise to prominence through a book called \u201cPlanned Bullyhood.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House leaders got to 217 votes by relying on one very motivating factor: fundraising For some members, it's all about helping their re-election chances -- and that takes cash How did House GOP leaders win the final votes to pass their health care legislation? Will President Trump make a big decision on climate change before he meets with the Pope? And what do Palm Beach and New Jersey have in common? These questions and more are answered in this week\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d forecast, where you get tomorrow\u2019s headlines today. Promises of what political consultants call \u201cair cover\u201d helped House GOP leaders get to the finish line in last week\u2019s Obamacare repeal-and-replace vote. House members worried that a \u201cyes\u201d vote would be unpopular in their districts were told by Speaker Paul Ryan that they would get help with TV ads and other re-election support, CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly reports. \u201cThey know that they will need [help] \u2013 especially for the 14 Republicans who voted yes and come from Hillary Clinton districts,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cWhere is that money going to come from? \u201cYou have outside groups \u2013 American Action Network has launched a $2 million ad buy in 21 districts. I\u2019m told they promised President Trump would be available to campaign and raise (money).\u201d It\u2019s been awhile since a major piece of legislation cleared the House, and because of that it has been awhile since we\u2019ve been reminded of how differently things work in the Senate. The rules are different, and so are the margins: Republicans have just a 52-48 edge, so one or two senators can have oversized influence. Also important: Senators run statewide, not in the carefully drawn districts that protect most House members. Already, some of these differences are evident. How strong the Trump economy really is GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, for example, don\u2019t like that the House bill cuts funding for Planned Parenthood. Look for that to change in the Senate version. And several GOP lawmakers from states hard hit by the opioid crisis don\u2019t like that the House bill allows states to drop a requirement that drug treatment be covered under health care plans. So look for that, too,  to be among the many changes coming as the debate shifts to the Senate. There is a robust debate in the Trump White House about whether to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change accord that the Obama administration helped negotiate. Conservatives say it is a campaign promise the President must keep. Environmentalists are hoping Ivanka Trump sways her father to take a different course on climate change than he did as a candidate. A decision on the Paris deal is due soon, and Julie Pace of the Associated Press says it could make the President\u2019s first overseas trip even more interesting. On his itinerary is a face-to-face with one of the world\u2019s most prominent climate change activists: Pope Francis. Fareed: Trump is turning allies against US \u201cThere is an interest in trying to get a decision done before he heads to Europe later this month,\u201d Pace reports. \u201cHe will be meeting with some leaders of countries who are part of it (the Paris agreement). One of the big advocates that he would be meeting with is, of course, Pope Francis. So this will be just one really fascinating element of what will be an incredibly interesting meeting between the Pope and the president.\u201d There are still dozens and dozens of high-level vacancies throughout the Trump administration, and the White House is getting some interesting advice from Republican friends: Hire some Democrats. House Democrats to be exact. Jonathan Martin of The New York Times reports that GOP strategists think the party could improve its odds of holding the House in next year\u2019s midterm elections if the President offered jobs to a few Democrats who serve in districts where Trump won. The strategy: Those are districts the GOP would have good odds of winning if longtime Democratic incumbents were not on the ballot. This isn\u2019t the first time the White House floated this idea. \u201cBack during December, there was an effort to get Democratic senators into the cabinet. That fizzled,\u201d Martin says.  \u201cI\u2019ve learned this week, actually, that the House GOP sought to get Reince Priebus, the chief of staff at the white house,  to appoint house Democrats, too \u2026 there is one job that is still open, as we know: Army Secretary.\u201d President Trump is spending the weekend at his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and that could be a sign of things to come. His Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida has been Trump\u2019s weekend White House for much of his young presidency. But Margaret Talev of Bloomberg Politics notes that the property is seasonal \u2013 and due to close for the year next Sunday \u2013 Mother\u2019s Day. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard yet officially from the White House whether President Trump will be marking that, but he does most years and we\u2019ll now see the action and guest list shift up to Bedminister,\u201d explains Talev. It remains to be seen how that move would affect Trump\u2019s weekend activities \u2013 or his guest lists.",

            "article_content": "Clinton has two events in New York Tuesday One is a Planned Parenthood dinner Hillary Clinton delivered her most forceful critique of President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory on Tuesday, taking personal responsibility for her failed campaign but also pointed to the timing of a letter from FBI Director James Comey and Russian interference as factors. \u201cIf the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour at a Women for Women International event in New York. \u201cI take absolute personal responsibility. I was the candidate, I was the person who was on the ballot. I am very aware of the challenges, the problems, the shortfalls that we had,\u201d Clinton said, before adding that she was \u201con the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey\u2019s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.\u201d Clinton, who is currently writing a book that partly reflects on her 2016 loss, added, \u201cThe reason I believe we lost were the intervening events in the last 10 days.\u201d The event marks the latest where Clinton, in a stinging rebuke to Trump, both blames herself for the 2016 loss but also casts the current President as someone aided by outside factors, including the Russian government. After Clinton noted the 3 million more votes she won than Trump, Amanpour joked that the President would soon tweet about the comment. \u201cFine. Better than the interfering in foreign affairs,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIf he wants to tweet about me than I am happy to be the diversion because we have lot of things to worry about. He should worry less about the election and my winning the popular vote than doing some other things that would be important for the country.\u201d Clinton, aides and friends say, has grown more at peace with her loss in recent months, but is still focused on the interference by the Russian government, especially the fact that WikiLeaks began releasing John Podesta\u2019s hacked emails hours after the damaging \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d Trump tape was released. Clinton, as she has done in the past, also hung part of her 2016 loss on misogyny. \u201cYes, I do think it played a role. I think other things did as well,\u201d Clinton said. But repeatedly, Clinton came back to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s role in the 2016 election and how he was able to tilt the scale in favor of Trump and against her. Clinton, aides say, sees her role during the Trump years as a political activist who speaks out when issue she cares about are threatened. And on Tuesday, it was clear Clinton was ready to settle into that role. \u201cI am now back to being an activist citizen and part of the resistance,\u201d Clinton said, drawing cheers from the crowd that included former aides, donors and celebrities like actress Meryl Streep. What's next for women spurred to activism by Trump's election? The former secretary of state also pledged to \u201cpublicly request\u201d that the Trump administration \u201cnot end our efforts making women\u2019s rights and opportunities\u201d central to US policy. Clinton praised Defense Secretary James Mattis for making the case for maintaining US foreign aid funding, despite a budget request by Trump that would cut it. \u201cI am hoping that because of voices like Jim Mattis and others that that will begin to influence the administration,\u201d she said. And on North Korea, Clinton cautioned Trump against giving too much away by saying he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jung Un under the right circumstances. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that we alone are able to really put the pressure on this North Korean regime that needs to be placed,\u201d she said. \u201cNow the North Koreans are always interested \u2026 in trying to get Americans to try to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position and we should be very careful about giving that way.\u201d Clinton said such negotiations could make it harder to work out a solution with countries in the region. The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee will also speak at a Planned Parenthood 100-year anniversary gala later Tuesday, where she is expected to slam Trump\u2019s handling of women health issues during his first months in office, including attempts to defund the women\u2019s health organization. Planned Parenthood has been vocal in their opposition to Trump, slamming many of his appointees and the Republican plan to defund the organization.

Jason Chaffetz said that he has no \"ulterior motives\" in his decision not to run The Utah Republican had previously said he was considering a run for governor Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican and chairman of the House\u2019s powerful oversight committee, will not seek re-election to Congress, he announced Wednesday. In a message on his Facebook page, Chaffetz thanked supporters and announced he will \u201cnot be a candidate for any office in 2018.\u201d \u201cAfter long consultation with my family and prayerful consideration, I have decided I will not be a candidate for any office in 2018,\u201d Chaffetz wrote. Chaffetz said that he has no \u201culterior motives,\u201d but instead said he is ready to return to the private sector. In Congress, Chaffetz was known as a hard-charging oversight chairman, taking on an investigation into Planned Parenthood and Former Democratic Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State. RELATED: Hillary Clinton\u2019s email controversy, explained According to two senior House GOP aides, top Republican leaders were told that the House Oversight Chairman was considering not running for re-election in 2018, and thinking about returning home to Utah. \u201cAfter more than 1,500 nights away from my home, it is time. I may run again for public office, but not in 2018,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cFor those that would speculate otherwise, let me be clear that I have no ulterior motives. I am healthy. I am confident I would continue to be re-elected by large margins. I have the full support of Speaker (Paul) Ryan to continue as Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. That said, I have made a personal decision to return to the private sector.\u201d The top Democrat on the committee \u2013 Rep. Elijah Cummings \u2013 said it was an \u201chonor to serve\u201d with Chaffetz. \u201cChairman Chaffetz is a tenacious and dedicated public servant, and I thank him for showing sincere interest in issues that matter to me and many others on the Committee,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said in a statement. \u201cHe has fundamentally changed the culture on our Committee so Members, as he says, can disagree without being disagreeable.\u201d Jason Chaffetz suggests Trump's Washington is no home for ambitious politicians But other Democrats celebrated Chaffetz announcement, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which said, \u201cChaffetz\u2019 behavior has long been beneath the dignity of the office he holds.\u201d \u201cChairman Chaffetz\u2019 behavior has long been beneath the dignity of the office he holds and he should step down as Chairman of the Oversight Committee immediately,\u201d said DCCC spokesman Tyler Law. \u201cClearly, Chaffetz crumbled under the weight of the widespread backlash that he\u2019s been facing for refusing to do his job, which is a victory for all Americans and will serve as a motivating force for the grassroots.\u201d Rep. Steve Stivers, chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee, called Chaffetz \u201ca valuable member of the Republican team\u201d and wished him well. \u201cI\u2019m proud to call him a friend,\u201d the Ohio Republican said in a statement. He added, \u201cRepublicans have a deep bench of talented candidates in Utah who are more than up to this challenge. The NRCC is very confident in our ability to keep this seat red in November 2018.\u201d Chaffetz has said in past interviews including one with the Deseret News in January 2016 that he was interested in leaving Capitol Hill to pursue the Utah Governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be here forever. I would take a serious, serious look at running for governor,\u201d Chaffetz told the Deseret News in 2016.  \u201cI want to go as hard and fast as I can in the House and then go home.\u201d Chaffetz\u2019 statement says he isn\u2019t ruling out running for elective office in the future, and Republicans believe that this move may be designed to help him lay the groundwork for a statewide run soon. After House Speaker John Boehner abruptly resigned in the fall of 2015, Chaffetz mounted a bid for speaker of the House against Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, but his effort failed to gain major traction.  Both he and McCarthy withdrew from that race and Paul Ryan replaced Boehner in October 2015.",

            "article_content": "It was a fierce race to replace HHS Secretary Tom Price in Georgia's 6th District The district has been reliably Republican, though the vote margin was slim in November Democrat Jon Ossoff fell just short Tuesday of capturing a House seat in a longtime conservative stronghold in Georgia, serving a reminder to Republicans of President Donald Trump\u2019s unpopularity. Ossoff received 48.1% of the vote, shy of the 50% he needed to win outright. He and the other top vote-getter \u2013 Republican candidate Karen Handel, who received 19.8% \u2013 will now face off in a runoff election in June, a likely uphill climb for Democrats now that the Republican vote in a reliably GOP district will be consolidated behind one candidate. The hotly contested race carried major implications as a gauge of the President\u2019s popularity \u2013 and Trump himself seemed to grasp the high stakes, playing a direct role in its closing days. Democrats saw it as an opportunity to drive a wedge between Trump and congressional Republicans fearful that he could drag down the party in the 2018 midterms \u2013 while also delivering a psychic boost to an energized progressive base. RELATED: How a Georgia House race could rock the national political landscape They nearly pulled it off. It was a strong showing for the Democrats in an unusual \u201cjungle primary\u201d in a district that Mitt Romney won by 23 points in 2012, and where Republican Rep. Tom Price was re-elected with nearly 62% of the vote in 2016 before being named Trump\u2019s health and human services secretary. Trump releases robocall in GA special election \u201cThere is no doubt that this is already a victory for the ages,\u201d Ossoff told supporters late Tuesday night. \u201cThat no matter what the outcome is tonight \u2013 whether we take it all or whether we fight on \u2013 we have survived the odds. We have shattered expectations. We are changing the world. And your voices are going to ring out across this state and across this country.\u201d Even after Ossoff left the stage, many supporters stuck around, chanting, \u201cFlip the Sixth!\u201d A little-known 30-year-old former congressional staffer, Ossoff quickly emerged as an online fundraising superstar. Progressive activists led by the liberal blog Daily Kos pumped $8.3 million into Ossoff\u2019s campaign largely because it represented their best odds out of four special elections for previously Republican-held House seats of flipping one and sending a message. Trump erased any doubt the contest was all about him when he waded into the race at the last minute. Trump recorded a robocall to Republicans in the district and attacked Ossoff on Twitter repeatedly on Monday and Tuesday. The President tweeted after midnight that he was \u201cGlad to be of help!\u201d \u2013 even though the district was competitive largely because of Trump\u2019s unpopularity with the white-collar white voters who make up much of its voting base. Handel said on Twitter Wednesday morning that Trump had called her. Dems look south to test anti-Trump strategy Handel told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d that despite preventing a Ossoff from an out right when, the situation in the district is \u201call hands on deck\u201d for Republicans. \u201cWe know what is at stake here and I don\u2019t think that this is about any one person,\u201d Handel told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. \u201cWe all have to rise above it \u2013 that it is about the district that has a long legacy of Republican leadership.\u201d The near-death experience for Republicans \u2013 on the heels of one a week earlier in Kansas, where Democrats nearly flipped a deep-red district \u2013 could still have the effect of leading GOP lawmakers in competitive states and districts to seek distance from the President, making it even more difficult for Trump to advance his agenda on Capitol Hill. In Tuesday\u2019s results, Democrats saw more evidence of a playing field for the 2018 midterm elections that has drastically expanded \u2013 and given the party\u2019s 10 senators up for re-election in states that Trump won some breathing room. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s amazing is that we continue to see this level shift across the country, a 20-point swing, that puts about 123 Republican seats potentially in play,\u201d said Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas. \u201cAt that point, very little is off the map, and getting the 24 seats we need to take back the House is suddenly a real possibility, GOP gerrymander or not,\u201d Moulitsas said. \u201cIt also potentially puts the Senate in play, while certainly protecting our endangered red-state incumbents. All of this, and we\u2019re still in Trump\u2019s supposed \u2018honeymoon\u2019 period.\u201d Republicans have long believed that \u2013 particularly with such high turnout in Tuesday\u2019s contest \u2013 Ossoff would near his high-water mark in the jungle primary and have little room to grow his support in the runoff. There are few parallels to draw because the race is a special election with unique dynamics, and because of the unusual primary in which the top two finishers would advance, regardless of party. One that would trouble Democrats and reassure Republicans came in a 2006 special election for California\u2019s 50th District House seat. There, Democrat Francine Busby won 44% of the vote in the jungle primary \u2013 well ahead of Republican Brian Bilbray\u2019s 15%. But in the one-on-one runoff, Busby was stagnant, earning 45%, while Bilbray surged to 49% support in the conservative district. Democrats, meanwhile, saw Handel \u2013 whose 55th birthday was Tuesday \u2013 as the Republican against whom they would fare the best, in part because of her conservative stances on social issues and attacks on Planned Parenthood. Handel lost a 2010 race for governor and a 2014 Republican Senate primary and was accused of overspending as a county commissioner in a 2017 jungle primary attack ad from the conservative Club for Growth. She was hammered by Republican foes in the runoff who aligned themselves with Trump \u2013 raising the prospect that those Trump voters could skip the runoff entirely. Handel\u2019s efforts as secretary of state to purge Georgia\u2019s voter rolls by requiring voters to prove their citizenship led to fights with the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. In an interview last month, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez \u2013 who led the Civil Rights Division during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term \u2013 said voters would hear \u201ca lot\u201d about Handel\u2019s efforts to require voters to prove their citizenship if she advanced to the runoff. \u201cSecretaries of state matter, and when they\u2019re good, then people can actually vote who are eligible to vote. And when they\u2019re following the ALEC playbook of the far right, they make it harder for people to vote,\u201d Perez said, referring to the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council. RELATED - DNC chair on Georgia race: \u2018We have a lot of wind at our back\u2019 Perez told \u201cNew Day\u201d on Wednesday said Trump was too celebratory too early. \u201cHe spiked the football quite early, Chris,\u201d Perez told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. \u201c(I\u2019d) rather be Jon Ossoff than (Republican candidate) Karen Handel right now.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta and Josiah Ryan contributed to this report.",

Dean Heller got the yelling he\u2019d expected Monday morning. In a two-hour town hall, the Nevada Republican was pressed to defend his positions on Planned Parenthood, his hesitancy to reject the GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and even his Easter Sunday post on Facebook in which Heller quoted Ronald Reagan Heller was drowned out by chants of \u201cyes or no!\u201d and \u201canswer the question!\u201d when hundreds of crowd members saw his answers as evasive. Vivian Leal, a 51-year-old Reno mother who said she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1999, pressed Heller the hardest \u2013 interrupting and demanding specifics when he talked around her question about whether he will oppose any legislation that revokes Obamacare\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions and that directs those people into high-risk insurance pools. \u201cYou give fuzzy answers,\u201d Leal told Heller. \u201cThey ask you direct questions and you evade them by saying, \u2018we can have a dialogue,\u2019 \u2018we can talk about that,\u2019 \u2018we can take a look into that.\u2019 Those are not answers. They don\u2019t tell us where you stand or how you\u2019ll vote or not vote.\u201d She complained that she wrote a \u201cthoughtful letter\u201d detailing her experiences with the American health care system \u2013 but received a form letter back. When Heller touted he had \u201crejected the Republican plan\u201d to repeal Obamacare, Leak pressed Heller again. \u201cYes or no? High-risk pools, that\u2019s my question,\u201d she demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t give me a fuzzy answer. High-risk pools \u2013 that\u2019s my question. Please answer it.\u201d The crowd loudly chanted \u201cyes or no!\u201d at Heller. \u201cI will support high-risk pools, because there are some people who want them,\u201d the senator said, drawing boos. He added that he wants to make sure everyone has \u201caccess to the health care that you want.\u201d A must-see scene from the @SenDeanHeller town hall: He's pressed -- hard -- on pre-existing conditions by a woman with MS. #NVSen pic.twitter.com/TW9109UuFt Heller is the Senate Republican facing what\u2019s likely to be the most difficult re-election race in the 2018 midterms. Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump in the state in 2016, and Democrats \u2013 who have to defend 10 Senate seats in states Trump won \u2013 see him as the ripest GOP target. In a joint town hall with Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, Heller faced a rowdy crowd that Reno police pegged at 600 \u2013 with hundreds more outside, unable to get into the filled-to-capacity room at a local convention center. He also faced terse questions \u2013 and accusations that he was dodging them \u2013 on GOP efforts to block federal dollars from flowing to Planned Parenthood because some of the organization\u2019s clinics provide abortions as well as women\u2019s reproductive care. Planned Parenthood: Fast facts and revealing numbers Heller invoked community health clinics as part of his answer to a question about whether he would protect federal funding for its services through programs like Medicaid. \u201cAt the federal level? Yeah, we\u2019ll continue \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to look at this issue,\u201d Heller said, drawing more jeers. \u201cI will protect Planned Parenthood,\u201d he said. He then qualified his answer by saying he\u2019d support funding for the organization for specific health care services. Heller said he supports leaving decisions about whether to allow the organization to receive tax dollars to the states. \u201cWhen the federal funding does come to the states, that the states (should) have the right to make the determination\u201d of how it\u2019s used,\u201d he said. Here's the angry reaction @SenDeanHeller got today as he tried to talk around a question about Planned Parenthood (@PPact) funding. #NVSen pic.twitter.com/YOsbXqrKa1 RELATED - Price on Planned Parenthood question: GOP bill increases funding for women\u2019s health services For the two-hour and 20-minute town hall\u2019s second half, Heller largely did what he\u2019d told donors at a luncheon last week he planned to do: Let Amodei, the co-host of the town hall, do most of the speaking. Amodei fielded questions on land rights, single-payer health care, Trump\u2019s spending on Mar-a-Lago trips and more without Heller weighing in. (Heller did, though, stick around for 25 minutes afterward, greeting everyone who approached him one-on-one.) The two faced exclusively critical questions from the overwhelmingly progressive crowd \u2013 though one man who wasn\u2019t called on stood in line and shouted \u201cmurder!\u201d each time Planned Parenthood was brought up. At one point, after Heller recited his office number to the crowd and told questioners to call him, audience members responded that his voicemail has been full for weeks. Heller broke with Trump and Republicans on some issues \u2013 saying the deep domestic spending cuts Trump proposed will not end up in Congress\u2019s spending bill, which he said \u201cwill look nothing like the President\u2019s budget.\u201d RELATED: Here\u2019s what Trump\u2019s budget proposes to cut He also said he is \u201cnot a climate denier\u201d \u2013 but was jeered by audience members who pointed to his vote to confirm climate science skeptic Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cWhen Scott Pruitt is right, I\u2019ll support him,\u201d Heller said. \u201cWhen he isn\u2019t right, I\u2019ll change his mind.\u201d One questioner even forced Heller to defend his Facebook account. Heller\u2019s Facebook page included an Easter Sunday post quoting former President Ronald Reagan as saying: \u201cRepublicans believe every day is the 4th of July, but the Democrats believe every day is April 15th\u201d \u2013 a reference to tax day. A questioner asked Heller how he could possibly help solve problems in a bipartisan manner with that attitude. \u201cI am a conservative,\u201d Heller said. \u201cI do quote Ronald Reagan.\u201d The woman shot back: \u201cDo you read the quotes before you post them?\u201d She asked if the post \u201csupported an indivisible country or made it a bit more divided?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think Ronald Reagan was divisive,\u201d Heller said. Heller declined to answer CNN\u2019s questions after the event. His staff said he was short on time, but Heller said it was because \u201cwe don\u2019t want to step on our message.\u201d .@SenDeanHeller defends his Easter Sunday Facebook post quoting Reagan accusing Democrats of seeing every day as tax day. #NVSen pic.twitter.com/SzJLginhNQ",

Dean Heller is set to attend a town hall Monday in Reno \u2013 but he\u2019s not thrilled about it. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a long day, to say the least,\u201d Heller \u2013 perhaps the Senate\u2019s most endangered Republican in the 2018 midterms \u2013 said at a fundraising lunch Wednesday. Audio and video recordings of his comments are being circulated by Democrats. \u201cTwo hours of town hall meeting \u2013 two hours of people yelling at you \u2013 it\u2019s going to be quite the experience,\u201d Heller said. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of those boxes you gotta check.\u201d Many other Republicans in competitive seats, though, aren\u2019t checking that box. With members of Congress at home for a two-week spring break, many Republicans \u2013 especially those in competitive states and districts \u2013 are once again encountering backlash over President Donald Trump and House leadership\u2019s push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Two top Democratic targets in the 2018 midterms \u2013 Reps. Leonard Lance of New Jersey and Mike Coffman of Colorado \u2013 faced rowdy crowds Wednesday night. Lance was loudly booed for suggesting that Planned Parenthood divide itself into separate organizations \u2013 one that performs abortions and one that offers other health services. Some lawmakers, though, are opting not to hold town halls at all. Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock skipped two \u201cmobile office hours\u201d sessions she had scheduled in late January, as backlash against Trump and the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare began to build. Hundreds showed up at a February \u201cempty chair\u201d town hall \u2013 one organized by constituents to which the lawmaker was invited, but not confirmed to attend \u2013 for Rep. Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, whose district Hillary Clinton won by nearly 10 points in the fall. Aides for Comstock and Paulsen didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s questions about why they haven\u2019t held town halls. But other GOP lawmakers have been blunt in arguing that the events attended by hundreds of constituents hold little value. Rep. Mimi Walters of California \u2013 whose Orange County district is similar to many Democrats hope will become hyper-competitive in 2018 \u2013 said she sees town halls as political ambushes. RELATED: Here are the town halls scheduled for Thursday \u201cThe whole goal is to try to get as much press as they can, and then try to get me to say something that they could use against me in the campaign,\u201d Walters said in a recent interview on AM 870\u2019s \u201cThe Answer.\u201d Some Republicans who aren\u2019t hosting town hall meetings say they prefer alternatives like \u201ctelephone town halls\u201d where constituents call in, or in-person one-on-one or small-group meetings scheduled with constituents in their district offices. Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois, whose district Clinton carried by seven points, has opted for telephone town halls, small district offices and stops at local businesses and schools. His spokesman, David Pasch, explained Roskam\u2019s reluctance to hold town halls in an email, saying that \u201clarge, unstructured events tend to devolve into shouting matches. Both sides compete with each over who can scream the loudest, while the people who are interested in an actual, productive dialogue are denied the opportunity to hear and be heard.\u201d Rep. David Valadao of California, whose district Clinton carried by 15 points, is also opting for smaller-group events. \u201cBy utilizing a variety of methods such as community coffees, workshops, and telephone town halls, I am able to communicate with my constituents in ways that work for them,\u201d he said in a statement. Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Washington, prefers one-on-one and small-group meetings, and has scheduled nearly 50 with more than 200 constituents, his spokeswoman Breanna Deutsch said. She said Reichert \u201cbelieves this is the best way to maintain open communication with his constituents and have productive conversations.\u201d RELATED: GOP lawmakers brace for new round of town hall backlash But progressive groups argue lawmakers like Roskam, Valadao and Reichert are ducking accountability. Indivisible, the group with more than 6,000 affiliates nationwide, recently published a new guide to \u201csham town halls.\u201d \u201cTelephone town halls are very controlled in that questions are screened, people are very easily cut off from asking any follow-up questions and it really gives the member of Congress too much control over the situation,\u201d said Sarah Dohl, Indivisible\u2019s chief communications officer. Other forms of \u201csham town halls,\u201d she said, include events with narrow focuses \u2013 such as \u201cveterans\u2019 town halls\u201d \u2013 that are designed to discourage non-veterans from attending, and events where questions are sought in writing and then sorted and chosen by lawmakers\u2019 staffers. Participants should keep their questions vague when speaking to a screener on telephone town halls, she said. And in-person, Dohl said, \u201cwe\u2019re telling people that if they\u2019re in a situation where a member of Congress is reading questions from cards, they should feel empowered to stand up in the crowd and say, \u2018that one was mine\u2019 \u2013 to say it out loud, to ask follow-up questions, and if the member of Congress is going on and on, to demand a yes or no.\u201d To be sure, some Republicans in competitive seats are holding town halls. In addition to the Coffman and Lance events Wednesday night, Rep. Jeff Denham of California has one scheduled for Monday. Rep. Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania held one Saturday. Rep. David Young of Iowa has scheduled several across his district south of Des Moines. Another Republican senator facing a potentially tough re-election contest, Arizona\u2019s Jeff Flake, is set to hold a town hall Thursday night. On Monday, Heller, at least, will have backup: His town hall is a joint event with Republican Rep. Mark Amodei. Heller said at the Wednesday lunch that \u201cI chose to do it with Amodei \u2018cause he\u2019ll do all the talking.\u201d Other Republicans are ducking the topic of town halls altogether. Aides for several GOP lawmakers in districts Clinton won in 2016 \u2013 including Reps. Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Ed Royce and Dana Rohrabacher of California and Kevin Yoder of Kansas \u2013 did not return CNN\u2019s requests for comment on whether they intend to hold town halls. An aide to Rep. Robert Pittenger, R-North Carolina, took a more confrontational approach. Asked whether he plans to do so, Pittenger\u2019s communications director Jamie Bowers wouldn\u2019t answer. Since CNN hasn\u2019t covered Pittenger\u2019s town halls in previous years, he said, \u201cwhy should we be interested in this question?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Chelsea Clinton said her mom is \"doing great\" Will she run herself? \"Right now, the answer is no\" Though she\u2019s repeatedly attempted to quash rumors of a future run for public office, Chelsea Clinton again left the door open to a run on Tuesday. \u201cNo. No, no, no,\u201d Clinton emphatically told CBS in a rare and extensive interview when asked whether she\u2019d be the next member of her family to seek an elected position. But she still qualified that answer, saying any engaged citizen with a clear vision and a clear sense that he or she is the best person for the job should consider it. \u201cI clearly don\u2019t agree with our president, but I\u2019m definitely not the right person to run to defeat him in 2020,\u201d Clinton said. No, Chelsea Clinton is not running for office ... 'right now' \u201cRight now, the answer is no, but I think we all need to be asking ourselves that question periodically,\u201d she said, adding that she hopes young people will see the 2016 election as a call to action. The former first daughter has answered the question many times in many ways \u2013 last week in a video interview with Variety, she also sought to end the public speculation. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Chelsea Clinton, and one thing you may not know about me is I am not running for public office. I mean, I just \u2013 no,\u201d she said in the interview, exasperatedly clapping her hands together. Months after Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, her daughter is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the extra time with her mother, whom she says is \u201cdoing great.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s focused on her book, she\u2019s focused, thankfully, on her grandchildren, she\u2019s focused on what she can do to help support work she\u2019s been engaged in longer than I\u2019ve been alive around children, around women, around families, and I just am really grateful to have more time with her now than I\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d Clinton told CBS. She relayed a personal moment from weekend time together at her parents\u2019 home in Chappaqua, New York, in which daughter Charlotte, 2, declared she wanted to be a mermaid or a zookeeper when she grows up. \u201cMy mom talked to Charlotte a lot about what it would mean to be a mermaid or a zookeeper,\u201d she said. Clinton dismissed the idea that the former 2016 Democratic nominee has plans to seek public office again. \u201cI have no idea. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said. In a St. Patrick\u2019s Day appearance in Scranton, Pennsylvania, last week, Hillary Clinton told the Society of Irish Women that she\u2019s \u201cready to come out of the woods.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing what that means right now,\u201d Chelsea Clinton said Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019s clearly looking to encourage many, particularly the young people, who are thinking about running for office, that they should keep thinking about that and throw their hats into the ring,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cShe is trying to figure out what she can do to help support so many of the organizations you know, like Planned Parenthood, who are standing on the front lines to defend our fundamental rights, and I just am really grateful that she\u2019s out there doing that work.\u201d Clinton, 37, has recently become a more active presence on Twitter, frequently posting commentary on social issues, news of the day and the Trump administration with a distinctive voice. She\u2019s currently on a book tour for the paperback edition of her young adult book, \u201cIt\u2019s Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired & Get Going!\u201d She also has an Elizabeth Warren-inspired childrens book coming out next month titled, \u201cShe Persisted.\u201d Asked if she had a message for her friend, first daughter and White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, who will also speak to CBS today, Clinton deflected. \u201cI hope her kids are doing well. I hope they\u2019re enjoying their new home in Washington,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "April brings a host of political storms The ongoing Russia investigation also hangs over the White House As the White House scans Washington for a bounce-back win after the Obamacare imbroglio, the political forecast is promising only heavy weather. An unappetizing list of looming congressional showdowns, complex, months-long legislative challenges and intractable threats to President Donald Trump\u2019s standing threaten to make the failed health care push look like a small setback. Approaching sagas of a potential government shutdown, raising the debt ceiling and a moment of truth in the Senate over the potential \u201cnuclear option\u201d confirmation of Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch will severely test the political alacrity of a White House already exposed by the busted bid to repeal Obamacare. The administration is promising aggressive efforts to pass a generational tax reform bill and a bipartisan infrastructure package, though the current Washington environment suggests neither effort will be simple. Timeline: What we know about the Trump campaign, his administration and Russia Throw in the corrosive impact that the thickening cloud of intrigue over Russia\u2019s alleged election meddling is exerting on the White House, and add the challenges posed by the President\u2019s own habit of detonating political explosions that damage his own standing, and it\u2019s tough to predict the administration\u2019s first big political win \u2013 or how much that victory will cost. \u201cNobody ever told me that politics was going to be so much fun,\u201d Trump declared, perhaps ironically, at a White House reception for senators on Tuesday night. The challenges facing the new administration are testing enough. But they appear to be compounded by the unorthodox and inexperienced West Wing staff and organizational chaos. Putin calls claims of US election meddling 'fictional' Almost daily, stories seep out of the administration about feuding between top officials and rival centers of power around Trump, including the camp led by political adviser Stephen Bannon and the family inner circle comprising his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump, who announced Wednesday she would take an unpaid staff position. Still, Washington has a habit of writing off presidencies early on if administrations fail to get a fast start. A genuine effort by the Trump team to learn the lessons of its missteps \u2013 and to follow through with the reboot that its public statements suggest is being contemplated \u2013 could improve the odds of getting big things done. \u201cIt is a very challenging environment but I think these guys have been in office for 60 days or whatever, they have never done it before,\u201d said Howard Schweitzer, a former Bush administration Treasury official now with Cozen O\u2019Connor Public Strategies. \u201cIf they get smarter, they can turn it around.\u201d Opinion: Ivanka\u2019s role raises red flags At the top of the list of political messes for the Republican majority and the White House is the possibility of a government shutdown that could occur on an inauspicious date, April 29, Trump\u2019s 100th day in office. Congress must pass and the President must sign a spending bill that authorizes federal funding to succeed a current temporary spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, the current version of which expires on April 28. McCain threatens shut down if continuing resolution is on the table The process of framing a bill to do so threatens to expose exactly the same Republican Party fissures between ultra-conservative members and more moderate GOP lawmakers ripped open by the Obamacare duel. It will also be an immediate test of House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s diminished authority after he failed to unite his caucus behind an effort to fulfill the one promise \u2013 repealing Obamacare \u2013 that has united his party this entire decade. Ryan admitted himself in the wreckage of the health care battle that the GOP House caucus had proven itself so far unsuited to government and retained many of the characteristics of an opposition party. The key to putting off a government shutdown, and to making progress on other key agenda items relies on Ryan convincing his troops to evolve. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to become a factionalized majority. I want us to become a unified majority, and that means we\u2019re going to sit down and talk things out until we get there and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Ryan said Tuesday. To that end, Ryan made clear that the only appropriate way to defund Planned Parenthood \u2013 a key issue of principle for conservatives \u2013 is on a future bill like health care, rather than on federal funding legislation. Such an approach is designed to ensure that the funding bill does not get weighed down with controversial measures that could delay or kill it. Meanwhile, Arizona Sen. John McCain vowed Tuesday to do everything he could to force lawmakers to increase military spending in the bill, setting up another fault line. Keeping the government running is an obligation \u2013 but Republicans, especially the President, are eager to dispel the unflattering reviews of their performance on Obamacare by moving onto another goal, tax reform. After health care failure, plan B suddenly more appealing for Republicans The effort is likely to be even more complicated than health care, given the complexity of the tax code and the vested interests it touches that are vitally important to the outside lobby groups that turn the screws on lawmakers. \u201cIf you think this is complicated and controversial, wait until we get into tax reform,\u201d Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Florida, said of the health care process. Tax reform is also going to take time \u2013 and is not therefore the kind of issue that is likely to produce a quick win to turn around a White House rough patch. The complications of tax reform and funding the government are one reason why the White House is looking for a clean win on the confirmation of Gorsuch \u2013 a process that could be completed by the end of next week. Yet even this victory will exert a price. If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is forced by Democratic opposition to invoke the nuclear option \u2013 changing Senate rules to get around a Senate filibuster for Supreme Court nominees \u2013 poisoned feelings could linger in the chamber for years. Such a step would inflame passions even more in polarized Washington and likely leave Democrats even more resistant to crossing the aisle and working with Trump. Already, there was little incentive to support a struggling GOP President, given his zeal in repealing the Democratic legacy item, Obamacare. Many Democrats are still fuming over what they consider the \u201cstolen\u201d nomination of President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland last year. And Trump\u2019s low approval rating \u2013 36% in the latest Gallup tracking poll and rock bottom reputation among Democratic voters, means Democrats have little political room to work with Trump even if they wanted to. Trump, however, has reacted to the defeat of health care by predicting that Democrats will be willing to work with him down the road, especially if Obamacare spirals into decline. Ryan, in turn, is using that prospect to warn his own party about the risk of remaining divided. \u201cWhat I am worried about is \u2026 that if we don\u2019t do this then he will just go work with Democrats to try and change Obamacare \u2013 that\u2019s hardly a conservative thing,\u201d Ryan told CBS\u2019s \u201cThis Morning\u201d Thursday. Who's who in Trump-Russia saga From its first hours, the administration has been hounded by the question of whether Trump campaign aides cooperated with an alleged Russian effort to influence the presidential election in favor of Trump. Pressure builds week by week, as revelations emerge over meetings between people in Trump\u2019s orbit and Russian officials \u2013 and as the President\u2019s aides and former aides get drawn deeper into congressional probes into the affair. This week, Kushner said he would appear before the committee, after it was revealed he met the head of a Russian development bank closely linked to President Vladimir Putin. Bank that Kushner met with paid Russian intelligence agent's legal tab While the White House is being accused of trying to knock the House investigation, led by under fire intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes, off-track, it faces a greater challenge with a parallel Senate probe. The Republican and Democratic leaders of that effort, Sens. Richard Burr and Mark Warner, appeared together on Wednesday to pledge a complete and organized investigation \u2013 implicitly drawing a contrast with the chaotic effort that has been rocked by mistrust and partisan wrangling in the House. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us at least, and I think for all of us here to remember to not lose sight about what this investigation is about: an outside, foreign adversary effectively sought to hijack our most critical democratic process, the election of a president,\u201d Warner said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re here to assure you and more importantly, the American people who are watching and listening, that we will get to the bottom of this.\u201d If those lofty goals are realized, the Russia issue could get even more difficult for the White House, as it searches in vain for low-hanging political fruit following a fraught start to the President\u2019s tenure.",

But Trump has previously alleged via Twitter, without providing evidence, that former President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of his phones during the campaign. After Trump asked Congress to investigate his claim, Durbin said Republicans are taking up Trump\u2019s call to investigate to create a distraction from concerns about the Trump campaign. \u201cThe Republicans in Congress still want to take this seriously. Why? So they can avoid a serious investigation, an independent, transparent investigation, of the Russian involvement in the last election,\u201d he said. House Republicans introduced a bill Monday that would scrap Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, a major pillar of the law, replacing it with refundable tax credits for individuals to purchase health insurance.  It would also restructure Medicaid and defund Planned Parenthood. But Durbin said the plan could ultimately hurt Americans. \u201cAs you start looking at it more carefully and closely, we realize that millions of Americans will lose their health insurance, and many who will have health insurance will not have a policy that is as protective today as we have under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. Durban said Republicans have not factored in the financial impact of their new health care plan. \u201cThe Republicans, always the guardians of the national treasury, issued this report without any score and any determination of its impact on our budget deficit by the Congressional Budget Office,\u201d he said.",

It\u2019s just one example of how the fashion industry \u2013 never one known for shying away from political or cultural expression \u2013 has taken to the runway to voice opinions amidst the glamour of New York Fashion Week. Celebrity-magnet Prabal Gurung opened his show with his usual sophisticated fare: feminine silk skirts flowed underneath deliciously oversized cable knit sweaters so big they could be blankets. But for his closing walk of the show, Gurung had model-of-the-moment \u2013 Bella Hadid \u2013 lead a charge of mannequins in shirts that read: \u201cThe Future is Female\u201d and \u201cI am an immigrant.\u201d Every woman wore a different shirt, and the messages (\u201cNevertheless, she persisted\u201d) were full-frontal. Gone are the days of fashion and politics being mutually exclusive, Gurung told CNN in a recent phone interview. \u201cWe\u2019re living in this day and age and time when we are questioning, and should be questioning, what is our responsibility, our part, our action,\u201d the designer said, when asked why he designed the politically charged shirts. Gurung said he was inspired by the women\u2019s march in New York City last month, which he and models in his fashion show participated in. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do. That\u2019s how we all feel. It is basic human decency. There is nothing political about it,\u201d he said. By and large, the fashion industry backed Democrat Hillary Clinton as candidate. There was even a fashion-show sponsored fundraiser in September featuring Tory Burch, Marc Jacobs and Dian von Furstenburg (among others) designed \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d T-shirts sold on the campaign website. Steven Kolb, the president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, said fashion has always been politically vocal. For example, he offered, designers were outspoken advocates in the 80s for HIV/AIDS awareness. He does admit, however, the mood may be heightened now. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a part of our industry, but maybe it\u2019s more amplified now because of this election we just came out of,\u201d he told CNN in a recent phone interview. Fashion week represents the industry\u2019s most high-profile event; a biannual Super Bowl featuring an international jet set of editors, buyers, stylists and even celebrities who descend on the Big Apple for a highly publicized array of fashion shows. Every sashay is snapped, tweeted, filtered and posted within milliseconds. This year, the fashion designer council harnessed the power of social media to raise money for Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit women\u2019s health organization providing an array of reproductive health services. About 3% of those services are abortions, according to the group, making it a favorite target of conservative politicians. Easily the most organized and influential fashion organization in the country, the Council of Fashion Designers of America designed a bright pink pin that says: \u201cFashion stands with Planned Parenthood.\u201d For every social media post with the pin and hashtag #IStandwithPP, a donation will be made to the organization, said Kolb. Even Vogue editor extraordinaire Anna Wintour was spotted wearing one pinned conspicuously to her scarf at a show. But it was the duo designers behind Public School that reimagined Trump\u2019s iconic red campaign hat with white lettering. A brand with major street cred, there was a lopped-off printed hoodie with Michael Jordan\u2019s visage on the front and the words \u201cWe Need Leaders\u201d printed on the back. \u201cThis Land is Our Land,\u201d a Bernie Sanders favorite song used during his rallies on the campaign trail, provided the musical backdrop for the strutting. There is always the consideration that such a strong message could be bad for business, but Gurung says that so far, he has experienced no commercial backlash. \u201cOn the contrary, I\u2019ve gotten the best reaction from my retail partners like Bergdorfs, Saks, Neiman, Nordstrom, stores and clients. Everyone was excited. It was truly about calling the world together,\u201d he said. Kolb similarly said he didn\u2019t think his political expression would be bad for business. \u201cMostly what I see is not an anti-Trump sentiment, but more of an alignment or show of support for communities that might be disenfranchised or women\u2019s organizations like Planned Parenthood that provide health care for those in need. You think about the customer, and the industry, who works in the industry. It\u2019s part of who we are,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "More than seven years after angry anti-Obamacare town halls erupted across the country, raw emotions are boiling over again \u2013 this time, as the Republican Party under President Donald Trump gears up to dismantle Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. And the fury is flaring up in some of most conservative corners of the country. On Thursday night, two Republican members of Congress \u2013 Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Diane Black of Tennessee \u2013 were each confronted with impassioned constituents during simultaneous events. The shouted questions, emotional pleas and raucous protesters of the evening crystalized the GOP\u2019s tough political road ahead as it forges ahead with rolling back Obama\u2019s accomplishments, including the Affordable Care Act. In suburban Salt Lake City, local police estimated that some 1,000 people packed into a high school auditorium to see Chaffetz as hundreds more waited outside. For 75 minutes, the congressman confronted a crowd that fumed with resentment of Trump and accused Chaffetz of coddling the President. Newest Republican Obamacare plan: 'Reconciliation Plus' \u201cFolks \u2013 I get one sentence into it, you say I\u2019m not answering the question,\u201d an exasperated Chaffetz complained as the crowd repeatedly jeered him. \u201cI am answering the question, OK?\u201d And some 1,700 miles away in the town of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Black was met with roughly 100 protesters at a \u201cAsk Your Reps\u201d event hosted by the Middle Tennessee State University\u2019s College Republicans. Mike Carlson, a 32-year-old student from Antioch, Tennessee, said that as an overweight man, he depended on Obamacare to stay alive. \u201cI have to have coverage to make sure I don\u2019t die. There are people now who have cancer that have that coverage, that have to have that coverage to make sure they don\u2019t die,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cAnd you want to take away this coverage \u2014 and have nothing to replace it with! How can I trust you to do anything that\u2019s in our interest at all?\u201d Seriously urge everyone to watch this entire question from a woman at GOP #Obamacare townhall in Tennessee: pic.twitter.com/8mBGE1z6Rj Jessi Bohon, a 35-year-old high school teacher who lives in Cookeville, Tennessee, was visibly emotional as she stood up and posed her question. \u201cAs a Christian, my whole philosophy in life is pull up the unfortunate,\u201d Bohon said, a comment that drew verbal affirmation from others in the room. \u201cThe individual mandate: that\u2019s what it does. The healthy people pull up the sick.\u201d Bohon went on to ask how Congress could be OK with \u201cpunishing our sickest people\u201d rather than trying to \u201cfix what\u2019s wrong with Obamacare,\u201d the sweeping healthcare law that covers 20 million Americans. \"I HAVE to have coverage in order to make sure that I don't die... and you want to take away this coverage?\" #ObamacareTownhall pic.twitter.com/C2JtPcOuGA Black responded that Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate \u2013 which requires everyone to have health insurance or pay a penalty \u2013 still allowed millions, including many young and healthy people, to be without coverage. \u201cAbout 20 million people did actually come into the program who were uninsured,\u201d Black said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hurt one group of people to help the another. We can help both groups at the same time.\u201d Bohon shot back: \u201cHow many of those people were in states where they played a political game with people\u2019s lives?\u201d Black appeared flustered, and declined to continue. \u201cI\u2019m going to pass this one,\u201d she said. Bohon told CNN afterward that as a state employee, she receives health insurance through the state. Her question to Black, she said, was motivated in part by her Christian beliefs, as well as her upbringing in the coal-mining town of Grundy, Virginia. \u201cGrowing up in the community that I grew up, in Appalachia, because we were so poor there that we had to take care of each other,\u201d Bohon said. House GOP leaders want more security at town halls amid Obamacare protests Both Carlson and Bohon told CNN that they voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election. The same event hosted by MTSU\u2019s College Republican last year was attended by around 30 to 40 people, according to organizers. On Thursday night, the room was quickly filled to capacity while dozens outside chanted: \u201cLet us in! Let us in!\u201d Black, along with two other GOP local officials, were at first asked questions that had been pre-submitted on the topics of healthcare and tax reform \u2013 a format that clearly frustrated audience members and prompted some to interrupt. At one point in the discussion, GOP State Rep. Mike Sparks told the room: \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you.  As a state representative, I got health insurance. I feel a little guilty.\u201d Multiple audience members could be heard responding: \u201cYou should.\u201d In both Utah and Tennessee, many attendees and protesters told CNN on Thursday that they were first-time participants in politics. Carol McCracken, a 65-year-old Salt Lake City paralegal, said she is \u201ca child of the \u201970s \u2013 this is not my first rodeo\u201d in Democratic activism. But she said she hasn\u2019t seen the party\u2019s base as engaged as it is now since then and that she has never seen such high attendance at a congressional town hall. #Chaffetz town hall post-game: Protesters who couldn't get in are still outside chanting \"we'll be back!\" and \"investigate Trump!\" pic.twitter.com/tnkPa2Wput If the explosion of progressives attending GOP town halls in recent days has in large part been fueled by nationwide opposition to repealing Obamacare, the topic didn\u2019t come up once at the Chaffetz\u2019s event. Instead, it was a scattershot series of criticisms of Trump \u2013 and of Chaffetz for aligning with the President. When a man asked Chaffetz why he disavowed Trump over the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape \u2013 and then backtracked before the election \u2013 Chaffetz defended the President, saying he believes \u201cin my heart of hearts\u201d that Trump was the right choice. \u201cThere was no possible way I was ever going to vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cNo way. Never.\u201d The crowd erupted in chants of \u201cDo your job!\u201d when Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, was pressed on why his panel spent months investigating Clinton\u2019s emails but has not yet launched inquiries into Trump\u2019s taxes (Trump has declined to release his tax returns). \u201cYou\u2019re really not going to like this part: The President, under the law, is exempt from the conflict of interest laws,\u201d he said. Cruz, Sanders face off on Obamacare Chaffetz received some positive reaction when he called top White House counselor Kellyanne Conway \u201cwrong, wrong, wrong\u201d for promoting Ivanka Trump\u2019s business interests in a TV interview Thursday. But for the most part, he confronted an angry Democratic base even in deep-red Utah and in a district where he was just re-elected with a margin of victory of 47 percentage points. HUGE cheers -- then a \"do your job!\" chant -- when #Chaffetz is asked why he's not conducting oversight on Trump to match Clinton's. pic.twitter.com/CfzUgKbJeH Chaffetz nodded several times to the political makeup of his crowd. \u201cYou\u2019re going to disagree with this,\u201d he said as he began a defense of the GOP pushing to block Planned Parenthood from receiving federal health care dollars. The congresman at times seemed to relish the boisterous crowd. He cited Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 and then scoffed when the crowd booed, saying that Pence \u201cis, like, the nicest human being.\u201d It only earned more boos. At one point, he cast new Education Secretary Betsy DeVos \u2013 confirmed this week on a 51-50 vote \u2013 as a common enemy, touting a bill to abolish the Department of Education and hand all control over schools and their funding to states. #Chaffetz says he wants to eliminate Edu Dept. \"I want to get rid of Betsy DeVos!\"Man: \"We want to get rid of you!\"Right vid this time: pic.twitter.com/VItRuX9d8A \u201cI want to get rid of Betsy DeVos!\u201d Chaffetz said. A man in the crowd shot back: \u201cWe want to get rid of you!\u201d CNN\u2019s MJ Lee reported from Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Eric Bradner reported from Cottonwood Heights, Utah.

            "article_content": "Large crowd fill downtown Washington Marches also unfold in cities across the country and the world Marches for women\u2019s rights in the United States and around the world amounted to a remarkable protest against Donald Trump on his first full day in office. The question going forward is whether the marches are simply a cathartic moment for people upset over Trump\u2019s election victory or a more enduring opposition movement. While the mood at the main march in Washington was mostly jovial, the day underscored some of the challenges facing the left in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s victory. It was not immediately clear what political impact the marches would have on the Trump administration or Republicans in Congress. Trump didn\u2019t address the march during remarks he delivered Saturday afternoon at CIA headquarters in Virginia. One central hurdle for protesters: their effort to draw attention to so many different political priorities. Even the signs they carried reflected the diversity of their agendas. Some were there advocating for Black Lives Matter movement while others aimed to bring attention to reproductive rights. Some focused on the fight for equal pay and their opposition to the rollback of former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. They also differed in their approach to influencing the new administration. Some women wore blue and white sashes that said \u201cdissent is patriotic.\u201d Homemade signs and rainbow flags bore symbols of peace and love \u2013 others emblazoned with the printed message \u201cWomen Won\u2019t Back Down.\u201d Many women in attendance also wore the now-famous T-shirts with hearts embracing Trump\u2019s phrase about Hillary Clinton: \u201cNasty Woman.\u201d Meanwhile, the Democratic mantra so prevalent in the final weeks of the campaign \u2013 \u201cwhen they go low, we go high\u201d \u2013 was largely absent. Actress Ashley Judd, for instance, read a poem that said Trump bathes in \u201cCheeto dust.\u201d Madonna delivered remarks laden with expletives. Dozens of older women held signs that said \u201cI can\u2019t believe I still have to protest this s\u2014.\u201d Protesters rally worldwide in solidarity with Washington march Many signs referenced to Trump\u2019s vulgar comments that emerged weeks before the election that reveal him bragging on a decade old tape about his ability to grab women by the genitals because of his fame. One protester held a sign that said \u201cIf you\u2019re going to grab my pussy, keep your hands off my healthcare.\u201d In interviews, marchers said they were hoping to maintain a positive vibe \u2013 a respectful demonstration of democracy and expression of free speech. Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said that some 7,500 people were coming from her home state of Michigan on 100 buses. Since the election, she said \u201cPeople are showing up at any kind of activist meeting because they want to do something and they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Comparing Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd to the Women\u2019s March \u201cNone of us are single issue voters,\u201d Dingell said. \u201cWe want to make sure Americans have quality, affordable health care, funding for Planned Parenthood and that women are treated fairly in the work place.\u201d She said she believes Trump is \u201ca man who listens to how people feel.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s a smart man, and I think he will see a movement. He will see women scared about what\u2019s going to happen to the country,\u201d Dingell said. The march has evolved organically from a post-election call to action on Facebook to an organized effort that included a roster of high-wattage activists and attendees including feminist Gloria Steinem, singer Katy Perry, actors America Ferrera, Ashley Judd and Scarlett Johansson. The world reacts as Donald Trump takes power Leaders and activists from hundreds of left-leaning groups are joining the march, including the NAACP, Planned Parenthood, the American Federation of Teachers, as well as pro-immigrant and pro-environment groups. Margaret Huang, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, which is co-sponsoring the march, said the group\u2019s members were concerned about talk of a Muslim registry and Trump\u2019s \u201cwillingness to use policies to exclude particular communities.\u201d \u201cThese sorts of rhetorical commitments that (Trump) made on the campaign trail cannot become policy,\u201d she said. Mother and daughter Deborah and Maeve Kelly of New Jersey decided to attend the march after being deeply frustrated by the results of the November election. They left the Alice Paul Institute in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, at 6 a.m. ET on Saturday, and their group plans to return to New Jersey later in the  evening. Deborah Kelly, 61 of Chesterfield Township, New Jersey, said she was inspired to march after being stunned by the number of women who voted for Trump in November. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like women were voting in their own interests,\u201d she said in a telephone interview before Saturday\u2019s event. \u201cThis march was a way to demonstrate to the public that there is a large group of women out there who feel that the rights and progress made over the last decade are really threatened and could be eroded.\u201d 25 years later, 3 women reunite for Washington march She encouraged her daughter to attend with her as part of the show of force by all generations: \u201cWe have to be very vigilant,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThis is almost a symbolic passing of the torch to the younger generation, who have to be active to protect the rights that we have fought for.\u201d Maeve Kelly, 25 of Lambertville, New Jersey, said she didn\u2019t want American voters to forget about the comments Trump has made over the years judging women by their looks and their weight. \u201cThat\u2019s just something that really angers me, and I don\u2019t think it has any place in my world,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt feels like everything we have worked toward, and all that suffragettes worked toward \u2013 so we could vote and be successful \u2013 is threatened now.\u201d The march, she said, is \u201cmostly just a message of solidarity.\u201d \u201cThere are so many people traveling from all over the country to show that we are going to stand together and not let the President of our country bully us or make us feel like we don\u2019t belong,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just taking a stand for women\u2019s rights.\u201d CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter, Miguel Marquez and Sara Sidner contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He was a consultant to Priorities USA Action, the pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Paul Begala: Dems who want to \"Dump Pelosi\"  show self-loathing, scapegoating and a desire for quick fixes, rather than hard work He says she is doing a great job, having shepherded Obamacare, among other things, which is why the GOP is demonizing her Democrats lost a special election for a congressional seat they have not held in decades, so some are calling for the head of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. Huh? Dumping Pelosi, who has devoted her professional life to Democratic values, would be like throwing the captain of your ship overboard when the sharks are circling. It only draws more sharks, but leaves you leaderless. The \u201cDump Pelosi\u201d movement shines a light on some of the unloveliest instincts of some Democrats: self-loathing, scapegoating and a desire for quick fixes, rather than hard work. Sure, Pelosi is unpopular, but compared to what? After tens of millions of dollars of negative ads over many years, her unfavorable rating in the most recent Quinnipiac poll is 50%. Contrast that with Speaker Paul Ryan, who is rarely the focus of Democratic ads, but whose unfavorable rating is 54%. But I don\u2019t hear Republicans clamoring to dump Ryan. Pelosi: GOP health bill is mean and heartless In this year\u2019s special elections for open House seats, Democrats ran an average of 8% better than they usually do in those deep-red districts. That should embolden Democrats and intimidate Republicans. That\u2019s how pros read those results. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report analyzed the results and reported, \u201cIf Democrats were to outperform their \u2018generic\u2019 share by eight points across the board in November 2018, they would pick up 80 seats.\u201d That, of course, is not going to happen, as Cook quickly notes, given the advantages GOP incumbents enjoy. But the point is, the results in Georgia, while a gut punch for Democrats, may actually be a canary in the coal mine for Republicans. The practical point is Pelosi is doing a great job, which is why the GOP is demonizing her. Without Pelosi, there would be no Affordable Care Act, and tens of millions of Americans would not have health care. Without her fundraising, countless Democrats would not be able to mount effective campaigns. If there were a Mount Rushmore for speakers, Nancy Pelosi would be on it. No wonder the GOP wants to take her out. Democrats should not help them. Nancy Pelosi: We are all team Scalise The right always savages successful Democrats: Back in 1960, a rising conservative star named Ronald Reagan said of John F. Kennedy, \u201cUnder the tousled boyish haircut is still old Karl Marx\u2026\u201d President Bill Clinton was accused of murder by right-wing conspiracy buffs. And I don\u2019t need to remind you who pushed the baloney that President Barack Obama was not born in America, do I? Should Democrats have dumped JFK? Abandoned Bill Clinton? Disavowed Barack Obama? Of course not. If they dump Pelosi, Democrats will reward GOP attacks, and encourage them to repeat the process on Democrats\u2019 next leader. Appeasement never works. Standing strong does. To take the lead against the reactionary right is to become a spear catcher, and Nancy Pelosi should wear her war wounds as a badge of honor. As another great Democrat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in 1936 of the far-right forces arrayed against him, \u201cNever before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me \u2013 and I welcome their hatred.\u201d Dem congresswoman: Time for Pelosi to go I\u2019m sure Pelosi welcomes their hatred, too. But no one welcomes friendly fire. Instead of betraying Pelosi, Democrats should spend their energy shining a light on the shameful GOP health bill. The fate of millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions is at risk. Millions of nursing home residents and special needs children who rely on Medicaid need a champion. So do millions of women who count on Planned Parenthood for cancer screening, birth control and health-and-wellness checkups. Pelosi is their champion. Democrats ought to have her back, not stab it.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Alice Stewart is a CNN political commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Alice Stewart: Handel's narrow GOP victory may be a subtle rebuke of Trump, but a win is a win Stewart: Ossoff's defeat is a major blow to well-funded liberal momentum and activism The Georgia special election was the Democrats\u2019 best chance so far this year to flip a House seat and score a victory for the anti-Trump resistance. Jon Ossoff\u2019s defeat is a major blow to well-funded liberal momentum and activism, to which GOP voters in the South responded, \u201cFrankly my dear, I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d While the narrow GOP victory in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District \u2013 a historically solid red district, and my home district \u2013 can be viewed as a subtle rebuke of President Donald Trump, a win is a win. Karen Handel proved that hard work pays off and voters can\u2019t be bought. More than $50 million was spent in the special election to replace Republican Tom Price, who resigned earlier this year to become Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the race had become a proxy for the national political climate and a test of GOP might in the early months of the Trump presidency.   Voters were inundated with phone calls and television ads like never before. CNN projects: Karen Handel wins Growing up in suburban Atlanta as a sports/political-news junkie, I remember \u201cHammerin\u2019\u201d Hank Aaron hitting number 715 in 1974, Newt Gingrich being sworn in as Congressman in 1979, and CNN launching the first 24-hour news channel in 1980. All three events were historical home runs.  But politically speaking, Gingrich blazed a GOP trail in the 6th district that will take a lot more than the Democrat resistance to extinguish. At the presidential level, 6th district voters in Georgia have voted solidly Republican for years.  George W. Bush won the district by more than 40 points, McCain by 25, Romney by 23. The drop came last year; President Trump barely won, beating Hillary Clinton by just one point. This is when the Democrats began to see their opening to capture a GOP House seat.  They were hoping  Ossoff would be their equivalent of Scott Brown of Massachusetts (Brown, a Republican, was a relative unknown who captured the seat of the late Ted Kennedy in 2009).  Georgia\u2019s 6th district is the most solid GOP area of the state.  On average, voters have a higher education and income level.  They are high-information voters who were turned off by Trump\u2019s tone, and therefore tuned in to the message of candidates seeking to represent them in Washington. But in the GOP primary, Handel made it clear that she is a conservative leader who will be a check and balance, not a rubber stamp, on the Trump administration.  Given Trump\u2019s narrow victory, Handel\u2019s gambit was wise. She campaigned on lowering taxes, repealing and replacing Obamacare and strengthening national security. Ossoff ran a smart campaign and understood the need to appear as a moderate.  The reality is he is a stock-in-trade liberal.  He supported mandatory minimum wage, funding for Planned Parenthood and believes climate change will lead to a worldwide catastrophe. These policies don\u2019t resonate with many 6th district voters. In addition to that, Ossoff did not live in the district and received 95% of his campaign money from outside the district. Handel lives in the district and in the end, voters likely respected her service as Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State and her term on the Fulton County Board of Commissioners.",

            "article_content": "The effort could be bolstered with the passage of the Republican health care plan If Republican efforts fail, progressives could find new and strange bedfellows With the future of Obamacare in doubt, leading progressive grassroots groups are turning their eyes west, where California Democrats are pushing a new bill that would create a statewide single-payer health care system. The shifting focus is at once a concession to Republican dominance on Capitol Hill and a mark of frustration, as activists continue to clash with establishment Democrats they view as unwilling or unable to craft a compelling alternative to President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. In California, progressives face a much more welcoming political environment. Trump is deeply unpopular there, and state Democrats are on the front foot, controlling both chambers of the state legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cThere\u2019s not many places where you can say to people, \u2018If we do this work, change can occur,\u2019 rather than, \u2018If we do this work, it will lead to change one day,\u2019\u201d Our Revolution board chair Larry Cohen told CNN, explaining why the organization, spun off from Sen. Bernie Sanders primary campaign, chose the Golden State for its most robust outlay since Election Day. California legislators passed a single-payer bill in 2006, but Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it. Similar efforts to create a single-payer system, in which the state, rather than private insurers, pays for health care, have stalled out at earlier stages. Those efforts, however, did not have the emerging Sanders operation \u2013 with an estimated 300,000 supporters in California alone \u2013 working as an engine room dedicated to driving popular support. The current political leadership is expected to be more welcoming this time around. Gov. Jerry Brown is a Democrat and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the leading candidates to succeed Brown after he is termed out next year, recently said he planned to introduce his own universal health care program. Organizers also point to the fight over Obamacare, and the specter of an overhaul authored by Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, as a potentially powerful motivator. Never lose sight of the fact that our ultimate goal is not just playing defense. Our goal is a Medicare-for-all, single payer system. Our Revolution, still better known as the storehouse for Sanders\u2019s coveted email list, sees the California fight as a chance to lay down a historical marker. \u201cIt\u2019s a real test of whether we can be more than an email machine,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cNot just people signing up for things online, but instead actually building a political organization. That\u2019s what it\u2019s always been about. I don\u2019t spend this kind of time as a volunteer and board chair to generate more emails.\u201d Those efforts could be bolstered with the passage in Washington of the Republicans\u2019 American Health Care Act. The bill as currently composed would limit federal support for Medicaid by placing a cap on funding per enrollee. That would contribute to what the Congressional Budget Office predicts will be a surge in the ranks of the uninsured and, in an ironic turn, potentially provide new political momentum for single-payer advocates. \u201cThe Republican proposal has put oxygen in the room for progressives to go on offense with real solutions that provide health care to everyone, increase quality, and reduce costs \u2013 like Medicare for all or a public option offered to every American,\u201d Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in an email. \u201cIf Democrats learned the right lesson from 2016, they won\u2019t just depend on a negative message but instead pivot to bold inspiring ideas like Medicare for all,\u201d she added. State Sen. Ricardo Lara, who co-authored and introduced the California bill in February, described it as a local necessity with the potential for creating a road map for other states. Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat last year has accelerated the process, he added. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Trump\u2019s election and what Republicans are doing to dismantle health care has really given us an opportunity to have an honest dialogue about how we get to health for all,\u201d Lara said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would have had the same opportunity if Clinton would have won. Then again, we also wouldn\u2019t be in a place where we\u2019re going to lose billions of (Medicaid) dollars for California.\u201d Lara views the health care fight as one piece of a broader play to turn back the Trump agenda \u2013 first with grassroots resistance, then by actively shaping more attractive and inclusive policy. \u201cPeople in my district are genuinely scared \u2013 scared that they are going to lose their health care, scared that their mom or dad might be deported,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have transgender children who are scared now about who they are and questioning that. Democrats in general, now, it\u2019s time for us not only to present alternatives, but be unequivocal and unapologetic about who we are. If we don\u2019t do that now, when? This is a moment that will define us as a party and we need to fight.\u201d Proponents of single payer also make a pragmatic argument that the combination of Trump\u2019s unfavorable ratings and polling that shows growing support for federally guaranteed coverage has opened a window for immediate action. A recently published Pew report combining Gallup data going back to 2000 with a new survey found that 60% of Americans \u201csay the government should be responsible for ensuring health care coverage for all.\u201d Elected officials, though, are understandably wary of those numbers. Issue polling is a notoriously dubious indicator of how flesh-and-blood candidates will fare at the ballot box. Still, the upward trajectory is encouraging to activists and growing political organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America. \u201cOur longstanding positions on health care issues, such as supporting single payer and reproductive rights, are extremely important to new DSA members, including many young people that Bernie Sanders presidential campaign inspired to embrace democratic socialism,\u201d the group\u2019s deputy director, David Duhalde, said in an email. Turning to California, Duhalde touted his group\u2019s work canvassing in support of Lara\u2019s legislation, saying more than 200 people had volunteered to help push the bill. RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, an early union backer of the Sanders campaign and growing power base in progressive politics, said DSA\u2019s recent spike in membership underlined growing dissatisfaction with the Democratic establishment. \u201cIt\u2019s a new day in politics,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a dynamic base of people who are demanding health care. Demanding. It\u2019s not discretionary \u2013 they want it, they need it, they are fighting for it. We\u2019ve always got an extremely mobilized base from the Sanders movement. And they are determined to take legislators out who don\u2019t support basic issues.\u201d BREAKING: Healthcare-for-all legislation introduced in CA! #MedicareForAll happens 1 state at a time: https://t.co/XanYerPmxl #FridayFeeling pic.twitter.com/6iWYDRbfhu National Nurses United, which plans to take a lead role in shaping the California bill and mobilizing supporters, is deeply entrenched in the state and expects Lt. Gov. Newsom, the 2018 gubernatorial candidate with his own single-payer plans, to be an ally going forward. The national health debate remains mostly focused on repealing Obamacare, but there are signs that if Republican efforts fail, progressives could find new and strange bedfellows. In the aftermath of a CBO report showing the Republican bill would, in comparison to Obamacare, nearly double the number of uninsured Americans, Newsmax Media CEO Chris Ruddy, a friend and supporter of Trump, published an essay calling for the White House to scrap the current plan and set a path toward \u201cuniversal coverage.\u201d The details of Ruddy\u2019s ad-libbed argument were perhaps less important than his willingness to write it. For progressives, the absence of a consensus on the right has breathed new life into long-stewing plans to pursue their own overhaul plans. It was only in the mid 20th century, Our Revolution\u2019s Larry Cohen noted, that Canada began on a path he hopes Americans will follow. \u201cObviously, the US is 10 times bigger,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cBut I think that we need to model this to take away the fear. And there\u2019s no place better than California to do it.\u201d Correction: This story was updated to reflect the number of volunteers recruited by the Democratic Socialists of America to push for the California bill.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Austin Sarat is associate dean of the faculty at Amherst College, William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Jurisprudence & Political Science at Amherst College and author of \u201cGruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America\u2019s Death Penalty\u201d. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Austin Sarat: Originalism is a political symbol of the belief that it is time to take back rights Gorsuch's critics should treat originalism as a potent statement about who rightly owns rights, Sarat writes Monday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the United States Supreme Court followed a familiar script. The judge\u2019s critics painted him as a tool of the powerful, while his supporters emphasized Gorsuch\u2019s stellar credentials and his judicial philosophy. Though they mostly did not call it by its name \u2013 originalism, or the theory that the Court should interpret the Constitution using the meaning its words and phrases held when they were originally written \u2013 Republicans praised that philosophy for helping Gorsuch rise above politics. As Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa put it, this philosophy insures that judges don\u2019t try to \u201cupdate the Constitution and, in so doing, don\u2019t take from the American people the right to govern themselves.\u201d Today Gorsuch said little about his judicial philosophy, other than to quote Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s statement that judges should be bound by \u201cwords that are in the law, not replace them with words that are not.\u201d Previously, however, he offered ample evidence of his commitment to this theory, praising originalism for helping courts \u201capply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward.\u201d As a result, it is not surprising that, in the run-up to the Senate proceedings, the judge\u2019s critics mounted a campaign to discredit what they have labeled a \u201csham\u201d theory of constitutional interpretation or to fault what they see as Gorsuch\u2019s hypocritical or merely instrumental use of it. Yet such criticism of Gorsuch\u2019s originalism misses the mark by treating it as simply a theory of constitutional interpretation. It is much more than that. Originalism is a powerful political symbol of the judge\u2019s belief, as well as the belief of the President who nominated him, that it is time to take back rights, to return them to their original \u201cowners.\u201d If, as his confirmation hearings progress, Gorsuch\u2019s critics and his Senate questioners treat originalism as an obscure theory of constitutional interpretation \u2013 and not as a potent statement about who rightly owns rights \u2013 they will be making a very big mistake. The curveball in the Gorsuch nomination Throughout American history, the answer to the question of who owned rights seemed clear. They existed to protect the privileged from an angry populace. That is why, in \u201cThe Federalist Papers,\u201d James Madison warned about the evils of what he called \u201cfactions,\u201d groups of citizens \u201cunited and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\u201d As Madison saw it, inequality itself \u2013 \u201cthe various and unequal distribution of property\u201d \u2013 was the \u201cmost common and durable source of factions.\u201d Twentieth-century progressives and liberals took Madison\u2019s message to heart. They understood that rights generally were aligned with the interests of dominant groups and warned marginalized groups not to rely on the courts to vindicate any rights claims that they might make. And so it was (with some exceptions) until the heyday of the Warren Court, when ownership of rights seemed to slip away from the privileged and be seized by marginalized groups aided by \u201cactivist\u201d judges. Neil Gorsuch: Scalia's true heir? Every Republican President since Richard Nixon has set out to tame the courts, take back rights too eagerly bestowed (they believed) upon minority groups and return them to those they claimed were their rightful owners. While they have had some success in getting like-minded conservatives on the bench, they have also felt betrayed by justices like Harry Blackmun, David Souter, Anthony Kennedy, and even John Roberts who, in cases like Roe v. Wade or Obergefell v. Hodges, the gay marriage case, each failed to carry out this mission. Donald Trump understands this betrayal and tapped into the resentments it generated among many Americans. He tried  to turn the last Presidential election into a referendum on the Supreme Court. As he put it at a rally in Virginia last year, \u201cEven if people don\u2019t like me, they have to vote for me. You know why? Justices of the Supreme Court.\u201d Trump\u2019s effort to signal his understanding of the resentment and irritation of those who wanted to take back the ownership of rights worked well. An ABC exit poll revealed that 21% of voters claimed that the Supreme Court was \u201cthe most important factor\u201d in their decision. Of that group, 57% supported Trump, while 40% supported Hillary Clinton. Those voters cared little about the intricacies of constitutional interpretation. But they got the message that Trump would return rights to those who once were able to control women\u2019s reproductive decisions, have an exclusive right to marry, and whose economic interests were protected against threats from \u201cforeigners.\u201d Neil Gorsuch and his originalism are their reward for turning out and saying yes to Trump.  Those who attack Gorsuch\u2019s judicial philosophy should understand what it means for the real world outside the Senate\u2019s hearing room. They need to see the political work originalism does for those who are attached to it, to him, and to the President who promised to appoint a Justice who will help return rights to their proper owners, and, as Trump put it, \u201cpreserve the very core of our country.\u201d",
