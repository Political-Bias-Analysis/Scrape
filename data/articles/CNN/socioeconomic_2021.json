            "article_content": "Covid-19 ruined Br\u00e9cha Byrd\u2019s inaugural season as a basketball player at Saint Augustine\u2019s University, a historically Black school in North Carolina. The 19-year-old had been excited to play since her high school season months earlier was cut short in 2020. She lost her chance to play when the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) canceled the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball season between December 2020 and January, putting the once excited freshman\u2019s athletic scholarship at risk. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen,\u201d Byrd told CNN. Florida A&M becomes the latest HBCU to forgive student debt, totaling over $16M, for the 2020-21 graduating class By June, Byrd was back home in Surry County, Virginia, still concerned about her future as a student at SAU. Then she received an email saying her balance was wiped out. Byrd did not say what it had been, but now it was $0. Saint Augustine\u2019s announced it used $9 million it received in federal funds to clear the debt of 800 students \u2013 including Byrd \u2013 who attended the school in the spring, summer and fall semesters in 2021. \u201cThroughout this whole journey this past year, getting that email meant a lot to me,\u201d she said. Saint Augustine\u2019s is not the only school to do this in the past three months. More than 20 historically Black colleges and universities have made headlines for clearing student debt using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, illustrating the integral and life-changing role these institutions play in the lives of not only the Black students who attend these schools, but also their families. To date, the schools have cleared out a combined total of more than $25 million in student debt. There are more than 100 HBCUs across the United States. Officials from the United Negro College Fund and Thurgood Marshall College Fund \u2013 non-profit organizations that look to serve HBCUs and their students \u2013 told CNN these recent initiatives aren\u2019t new to the schools, which pride themselves on helping students thrive during their college careers and after they walk the stage at graduation, generating generational wealth for Black families. \u201cThese institutions \u2013 though underfunded \u2013 punch above their weight in terms of outcome, production and impact,\u201d said Lodriguez Murray, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the United Negro College Fund. For the students, this means they can now focus on new opportunities, jobs or even furthering their education without having to worry about mounting debt from their undergrad years. CNN spoke to four students from three colleges and universities about their debts being cleared. Here\u2019s what they had to say: Byrd was a senior in high school when Covid-19 hit. She told CNN her team\u2019s state basketball championship was canceled. The remainder of her high school career also came to a screeching halt, as classes quickly went virtual. \u201cYou imagine your senior year before it happens \u2026 and then it turns out completely different,\u201d Byrd said, adding her high school coach died a month after she left for Saint Augustine\u2019s. When she found out her season was canceled, it put everything in limbo. Would she be able to keep her athletic scholarship? If not, how would she pay for school? How would she keep her grades up to also keep her academic scholarships? About 78% of bachelor\u2019s degree recipients have a debt less than $30,000, according to a 2015-16 study by the Association of Public and Land Grant Universities. A Georgia university is clearing account balances to help students during the pandemic \u201cMy parents are still paying off student debt to this day,\u201d Byrd said. Murray, with the UNCF, said students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds need every opportunity to climb the socioeconomic and professional latter, and any financial impediment removed \u2013 big or small \u2013 is significant. HBCUs clearing student debt \u201chelps break the cycle of debt and a lack of individual and generational wealth that exists in the African American community today,\u201d said David Sheppard, chief legal officer and chief of staff at the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. Students will now \u201chave the ability to not only select a career in their chosen field of study, but be more selective in the job they can choose. They don\u2019t have to jump at the first job that will help them clear debt,\u201d Sheppard said. Byrd said having her debt cleared \u201cfeels like a burden lifted off of my shoulders\u201d and it shows HBCUs \u201cwant to see us succeed as both students and as people.\u201d She said she aspires to be a corporate attorney and that this motivated her to continue on that path. Marquita Canady had everything under control when she decided, as a 37-year-old, to enroll in an online program at Norfolk State University in southeastern Virginia. She told CNN she\u2019d been doing a great job of balancing studies, her job as a phlebotomist along with being a mother and wife. Then Covid-19 hit, she was deemed an essential worker and her son got sick. \u201cIt was very mind-boggling. I couldn\u2019t focus between that and my son and by me working at a health care facility. It was just a lot mentally,\u201d Canady said. \u201cThat was one of the reasons \u2013 along with my son \u2013 that I had to withdraw.\u201d Her decision to withdraw came with a $1,700 leftover balance that she owed NSU. That was until July 27, when she received notification the school had paid off her balance. NSU used $2.5 million to cancel the account balances of 1,255 students who attended the university between Spring 2020 and 2021. About 75% of the student body at HBCUs are Pell Grant eligible, meaning they come from low- to moderate-income households, according to Murray with the UNCF. Wilberforce University cancels student debt for 2020 and 2021 graduates. That's more than $375,000 \u201cHBCUs often lead in higher education, and they have this tradition of wraparound services that takes students from fragile backgrounds and give them the strength to move forward into the world,\u201d Murray said. The schools also have a mix of students who are legacies \u2013 meaning their parents or other relatives are alumni \u2013 and first-generation college students like Canady, who said she\u2019d be the first in her family to receive a degree. HBCUs also have a culture of caring for students outside the classroom, understanding who they are culturally and socially, according to Sheppard with the Thurgood Marshall Fund. Canady remembered telling a dean at NSU she needed to take a break, and instead of just accepting it, the administrator tried to persuade her not to leave. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are a lot of students with stories like mine,\u201d she said. She said the clearing of her debt just emphasized how HBCUs \u201care really looking out for students.\u201d Most importantly, Canady does plan on returning to school for fall 2021. \u201cI set that goal for myself to get my bachelor\u2019s and so I can fulfill my dream,\u201d she said, adding she also wants to set a good example for her son. \u201cI feel like he sees me pushing myself to do that at 37. It\u2019s never too late and I want him to know that.\u201d Christopher Ingram is the first in his family to attend an HBCU, and he\u2019s a rising senior at St. Augustine\u2019s University. \u201cIt was the best decision I ever made,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI wanted to be around my people, experience my culture and learn more about Black history on a collegiate level.\u201d Ingram is heavily involved on campus, serving as the Student Government Association president. When the 2019-20 school year began, he also made it his mission to ensure students were registered to vote in the 2020 election. But when he traveled to Myrtle Beach for some much-needed vacation time in South Carolina, the pandemic was underway. \u201cI started to realize this is no joke, people are literally dying left and right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe school was shutting down and next thing you know my trip to Myrtle Beach was cut short.\u201d Ingram headed back home to Freeport, New York, where he remained for the rest of the school year. The heavily involved and personable student found switching to a virtual learning environment to be a struggle. HBCU graduates continue to write the story of America HBCUs are known for their smaller class sizes and close student-professor relationships, something the pandemic robbed students of when mask mandates, stay-at-home orders and social distancing became the norm. \u201cThat\u2019s where a lot of students struggled. We didn\u2019t have that one-on-one connection and we missed having them around \u2013 our professors, teachers and leaders,\u201d Ingram said. He still kept in touch with students, encouraging his classmates to not give up despite the difficulty of the virtual environment. Ingram learned in May his and other students\u2019 balances were cleared. He did not say how much he owed SAU. \u201cOnce that email hit, the SAU community on Instagram just lit up,\u201d he said, adding that without debt he won\u2019t have to worry about \u201cthe tremendous bills as soon as I walk off the stage.\u201d \u201cKnowing I have to go into grad school and the fees I have to pay, that\u2019s where my finances will go toward rather than looking at the debt I have to pay from undergrad,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why I decide to come to an HBCU, knowing that I\u2019d be taken care of.\u201d Alynnda Williams realized how crucial HBCUs were when she landed on campus at Delaware State University. The 22-year-old Philadelphia native told CNN she had been scared to leave home, admitting she cried a lot when she first left. But after her freshman year at DSU, she realized she now had a \u201cfamily outside of my family.\u201d As the first in her family to both attend and ultimately graduate from a university, she had a lot of people counting on her to succeed. Her grades weren\u2019t the issue, though. Her entire tenure at DSU, Williams always had a fear of outstanding debt, or not being able to return to school because she owed the school money. At DSU, students must clear their balance before registering for classes, according to DSU\u2019s academic regulations. \u201cMy biggest fear was would I not be able to graduate and get my diploma,\u201d she said, adding that at one point she owed more than $12,000. The university relaxed its rules when the pandemic hit, Williams said, but some of her friends didn\u2019t return in fall 2020 because classes went completely virtual. The remaining debt lingered on Williams\u2019 mind, especially since she had plans for a master\u2019s degree. \u201cI really did not know how that bill was going to be paid, and I knew it had to be paid before grad school,\u201d she said. Raphael Warnock is the latest HBCU grad to make history in US politics Then on Mother\u2019s Day \u2013 24 hours after she graduated with her bachelor\u2019s degree \u2013 she got an email from DSU. \u201cThat\u2019s when I saw it said $0. I logged out and I logged back in, and I was confused as to what was going on,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI called my mom, and told her it was her Mother\u2019s Day gift. I was in shock.\u201d With her debt cleared, Williams said she plans to get her master\u2019s in social work so she can start an organization to assist foster children \u2013 like herself \u2013 in applying for jobs, college and transitioning out of the system to have a successful life. Williams did tell CNN she wishes more students could have the blessings she received, and that it was \u201cridiculous the cost of school is stopping people from accomplishing their goals.\u201d \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to settle for less because we can\u2019t afford it,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. American politics is in a state of high flux and both parties are searching, painfully, for balance. Democrats are holding on to threadbare majorities in the House and Senate and desperate to reach a major accomplishment before midterm politics take over the calendar. But rather than speak as one, the party\u2019s progressives from blue states are in a public and damaging spat with its few majority-making moderates: Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. What should be sending alarm bells through the White House and Democratic circles is that independents are turning on President Joe Biden in recent polls. An all-or-nothing approach that could leave Democrats with nothing. The disagreement could sabotage both a bipartisan infrastructure proposal and a much larger bill that would seek to address climate change as well as grant new social safety net programs to educate US kids, provide day care like other industrialized nations and more. Liberals in the party have organized to tie the two proposals together. The problem is they don\u2019t have enough votes for anything in the Senate without the party\u2019s moderates. CNN\u2019s Harry Enten writes that success on these measures, particularly the bipartisan infrastructure bill, could improve Biden\u2019s standing, especially among independents. Are Democrats more Manchin or Sanders? CNN\u2019s Manu Raju boils the current rift in the Democratic Party down to a feud between Manchin and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent whose mission in life is to push the party to the left. Which path will Republicans take? The GOP is eyeing the very likely possibility, no matter what it does, of controlling the House after the next election \u2013 history is very much on its side. But the Republicans are also choosing their identity as they eye winning the tightly contested governor\u2019s race in Virginia. Will they be the party of conspiracy theories or fiscal restraint? Will they turn out Trump\u2019s base or win the independent voters he lost in 2020? The Trump path vs. the Youngkin path. As CNN\u2019s Dan Merica writes Friday, the GOP candidate Glenn Youngkin is walking a tightrope, acknowledging Biden\u2019s 2020 victory but also buying into election skepticism fueled by Trump and calling for an audit of Virginia voting systems. Youngkin is far more interested in talking about whether Virginia parents should get more say in their kids\u2019 mask or vaccine status than he is in false talking points from Trump about rigged elections. In order to win, Youngkin will need both voters appalled by the idea that Trump attempted a coup, as alleged in a new report from a Senate committee on the January 6 insurrection, and those who genuinely buy into the former President\u2019s misinformation. Note: Congressional inquiries into the insurrection will largely cease if Republicans take control of Capitol Hill. Moving past the insurrection would be bad for accountability. It would also be bad for Democrats politically. \u201cNational politics especially can\u2019t just be a battle for the middle,\u201d CNN Political Director David Chalian said during an appearance on \u201cInside Politics\u201d about independent voters. \u201cBecause of how polarized we are, it\u2019s a both-ends proposition. You\u2019ve got to rev up that base and you\u2019ve got to try to win the middle.\u201d Electing a Republican governor in Virginia would be a huge upset for the GOP. The state went to Biden by 10 points in 2020. A Republican hasn\u2019t won a governor\u2019s race since 2009. Then again, that was the year after President Barack Obama was first elected to the White House, and it was a first indicator that Democrats were about to lose the House a year later. Independents win elections. Trump won independents in 2016, and he won the White House. He lost them in 2020, and he lost the election. Yes, Trump received fewer votes both times. But the current GOP has a systemic advantage. Republicans have routinely taken the White House with fewer votes (2000 and 2016). Their 50 senators represent far fewer voters than Democrats\u2019 50 senators. RELATED: Independents aren\u2019t a unified political bloc. Here\u2019s what they really think More independents than Republicans or Democrats. In fact, as \u201cInside Politics\u201d outlined this week, the largest chunk of Americans is in neither party. The most recent CNN polling suggests this national breakdown: That does not mean that more than a third of the public is up for grabs, according to CNN\u2019s John King, who noted that independents lean one way or another: That\u2019s a relatively even split among independents. But they mostly agree that they\u2019re not well represented in Washington and that the country is on the wrong track. King asked the Democratic pollster Margie Omero why people might prefer to view themselves as independent. \u201cWe aspire to be independent,\u201d she said. \u201cThink of the word \u2018independent\u2019 outside of the political context. We want our kids to be independent and want to live independently. There\u2019s something about being independent that seems very American before you even get to the party.\u201d Ideology and party are not the same thing. There was a fascinating, lengthy New York Times Opinion profile of the Democratic pollster David Shor, who argues that liberals have an outsize voice in the party. They are pushing for more extreme social justice policies \u2013 \u201cdefund police\u201d is the example cited in the story \u2013 that might turn off many other Democrats. Here\u2019s a passage from the Times piece: \u201cShor believes the party has become too unrepresentative at its elite levels to continue being representative at the mass level. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that the people we\u2019ve lost are likely to be low-socioeconomic-status people,\u2019 he said. \u2018If you look inside the Democratic Party, there are three times more moderate or conservative nonwhite people than very liberal white people, but very liberal white people are infinitely more represented.\u2019\u201d Ideological divides also exist on the right. But they are overshadowed by Trump\u2019s hold on the Republican Party. Evan McMullin, a conservative who ran for president as an independent in 2016, is challenging Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, a onetime Trump critic who is now on board with Trump. Politics are cyclical. Back in 2009, it was Lee who ousted a sitting Republican senator. Democrat and liberal, Republican and conservative \u2013 these are not interchangeable terms. I asked CNN\u2019s polling director, Jennifer Agiesta, what points are important when it comes to independents, and she noted the longer-term shift in self-identified ideologies within the parties. Gallup tracks this and it\u2019s very interesting. Not all Democrats are liberal. Recall that CNN\u2019s polling data shows 35% of Americans say they are Democrats. In Gallup\u2019s data on ideology, however, just 25% of Americans said they were liberal in 2020. And that\u2019s near a record high for liberals. It was 17% back when Bill Clinton was elected president, and 21% when Obama was elected. There are far more conservatives \u2013 36% \u2013 than liberals in the US, the same percentage as in 1992. There are fewer moderates in the long run. It was 43% back in 1992, and it was 35% in 2020. Still, the portion of Democrats who say they\u2019re liberal has soared from 25% in 1994 to 51% today. So has the portion of Republicans who say they\u2019re conservative, from 58% in 1994 to 75% today. This helps explain why neither party is looking at a large governing majority anytime soon. In an increasingly polarized country, Democrats would need to find a way to appeal to conservatives. Republicans would need to find a way to appeal to liberals.",

            "article_content": "Poll of the week: A new Kaiser Family Foundation poll finds that 42% of parents say their 12- to 17-year-old child has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine (24%) or will get one right away (18%). An Axios/Ipsos poll of all parents with a child under 18 showed that 46% have either had their child vaccinated or that their child has already received one dose. What\u2019s the point: The vast majority of those receiving a Covid-19 vaccination so far have been adults, as 12- to 15-year-olds were only recently allowed to get vaccinated. While older people are most susceptible to the coronavirus, children (especially older children) can get it and pass it on to others. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that everybody get vaccinated. Unfortunately, the trendline of where children are getting vaccinated so far shows an expected but still disappointing development. The same places where adults aren\u2019t getting vaccinated are not seeing children getting vaccinated either, which will only exacerbate the growing discrepancies in the places where the most people are protected from the virus. An examination of the CDC data shows that we\u2019ve vaccinated a little more than one-fifth of all children aged 12 to 17. That matches what the Kaiser polling found. Drilling in by state, the correlation between the vaccination rates of adults (age 18 and older) and those of children (age 12 to 17) is quite strong. It stands at +0.94 (on a scale of -1 to +1) when looking at those who have received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, as of Thursday\u2019s CDC report. By my calculation, all but two of the states in the top 25 for adult vaccinations are in the top 25 for child vaccinations. The inverse is true for the bottom half. If you were to rank the states from best vaccination rate to worst, the median difference between each state\u2019s spot on the adult list and children\u2019s list is just 3 spots. (To determine the 12- to 17-year-old vaccination rate by state, I took the number of age 18+ vaccinated with at least one dose and subtracted it from the age 12+ vaccinated with at least one dose by state. I then divided by the 12- to 17-year-old population in each state, according to the 2019 Census population estimates.) The fact that the same states that have done well in vaccination among children and adults shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Last month\u2019s Kaiser poll suggested that this would occur. Among parents who had either been vaccinated or wanted to be immediately, 48% said they would get their children vaccinated right away. Among those who said they wouldn\u2019t get vaccinated or would only do so if forced, just 2% said they would get their children vaccinated right away. But even if the data isn\u2019t shocking, it\u2019s only helping to solidify worrisome trends. One of the biggest divides in the adult vaccination map has been the blue/red state divide I spoke about last week. Concentrating on the top 25 states for vaccinations of children, President Joe Biden won 22 of them in last year\u2019s election. This includes him winning all the top 19. This is similar to him winning 21 of the top 25 states for vaccinations of adults. Likewise, there is a large socioeconomic divide. When it comes to the educational divide, 20 of the top 25 states for child vaccinations are where the number of adults with college degrees is above the average for all states. For adults, it\u2019s 21 of the top 25 states. The top 25 states for child vaccinations are also where poverty rates are lowest. In total, 22 of the top 25 states have child vaccination rates below the national average for poverty rates. For adults, it\u2019s a similar 23 of 25. Finally, the urban/rural divide is basically the same among both groups too. For child vaccination rates, 18 of the top 25 states are places where a larger percentage of the population lives in urban areas than the average state. Among adults, it\u2019s 17 of the top 25 states. The bottom line is that there are going to be places and social circles where getting the virus in the months to come is going to be a lot more difficult than in others. Some social circles (better educated, wealthier and urban) are going to be more immune from the virus because the vast majority of people in them (children and adults) will be vaccinated. Hopefully, we, as a country, are able to come up with some strategy to fight this vaccine discrepancy. Otherwise, a lot more people than necessary will be in harm\u2019s way.",

            "article_content": "It took one text from a friend to convince Graco Hernandez to drive thousands of miles to help in Georgia\u2019s election. The recent political science graduate watched the general election results roll in from Los Angeles in November, captivated by how close the Georgia senatorial race turned out. The next day he got a text from Ricardo Mireles, the executive director of the charter school he attended as a teenager, asking if he wanted to come to Georgia to help turn out the vote. A few days later, they were in the car driving to Georgia. Georgia runoff poll worker recruitment faces holiday and Covid challenges Some days they are handing out thousands of masks and information at poultry plants on how to vote and others they have spent from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at a local church asking people to register to vote. Georgia is currently at the center of political focus with two US Senate seats going to a runoff election on Tuesday that will determine which party controls the chamber. And as many around the US turn their attention toward Georgia voters, Hernandez and Mireles are among the wave of volunteers coming from all over the country to encourage voter turnout. Many say they are coming not to promote a candidate, but to take the enthusiasm that was ignited by the general election and build sustainable political power for people from different age groups, ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds. The inclusion of more groups is something that has risen with a new generation turning 18 this year, but has been in progress for years, said Gilda Pedraza, executive director of the Latino Community Fund, a nonprofit that funds Latino organizations that promote political engagement, scholarships and economic opportunities. \u201cIf you have been doing this work in Georgia for years you knew how the state was slowly changing,\u201d Pedraza said. After making the drive to the other side of the US, Mireles and Valenzuela found their own places to stay on couches or in hotels as they made their way through areas such as Dalton, Cedartown, Savannah and Atlanta. They were joined later by another alumnus of Mireles\u2019 school, Brian Hernandez. Spending weeks traveling around to tell Georgians when, where and how to vote, the men had to adapt their lives to fit into a new state. Hernandez spent part of his time continuing to work his job remotely, newly graduated  Graco Hernandez continued his job hunt from thousands of miles away and Mireles took a leave of absence. Their focus was on encouraging Georgian Latinos to vote, feeling that as Latinos themselves they could best connect with that community, and because in many places, politicians aren\u2019t using their resources to connect with those voters in meaningful ways, leaving a large gap in engagement, they said. \u201cLatino votes are taken for granted: \u2018Oh, we know a majority vote this way, so we don\u2019t need to canvas to them,\u2019\u201d  Graco Hernandez said. \u201cI think a lot of people feel hurt that their issues aren\u2019t being taken into consideration.\u201d Early voting in crucial Georgia runoff surpasses 2.5 million On top of that hurt, many voters \u2013 especially those newly registered \u2013 are fatigued from the November election or haven\u2019t had the importance of the runoff election explained to them. \u201c\u2018We already voted on November 3, why do we have to vote again?\u2019\u201d Mireles remembers many saying. \u201cIt is a complex understanding of civics that can easily get lost especially when Covid is what really we should all be focusing on.\u201d The Latino population accounts for about 9.9% of Georgia\u2019s population of nearly 11 million, according to the US Census. But with the race so tight, a few thousand votes could make a big difference, volunteers said. \u201cThis is what happens we have a more inclusive democracy, a democracy that is more reflective of the tapestry of our community,\u201d said H\u00e9ctor S\u00e1nchez Barba, CEO of the nonprofit organization Mi Familia Vota. \u201cWe know that when we do the work the community turns out in historical numbers.\u201d Mi Familia had previously campaigned against President Donald Trump\u2019s policies. But the groups and volunteers in Georgia for the runoffs said they were putting aside their own political ideologies for the goal of advancing Latino political power. \u201cWe\u2019re just there to register voters and get them out and make sure Latinos get to the polls and know how important this election is,\u201d Brian Hernandez said. It\u2019s a priority that many people share, said Pedraza, who added that the LCF gets about 20 people a day contacting the organization asking to come to Georgia from another state and volunteer to help drive turnout in the runoff election. LCF is not encouraging their travel out of concern for Covid-19 safety but is asking those volunteers to call and text information to Georgians, Pedraza said. She recognized that this election is important to Americans everywhere, not just the Georgians at the polls. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about party ideology, this is about governability and specifically laws that are going to affect day to day life,\u201d said Pedraza. \u201cThis is how we protect our homes, this is how we protect our families.\u201d Eighteen-year-old Chloe Armstrong worried coming from New Hampshire that she would be an interloper in the efforts to encourage voting in the Georgia runoff. \u201cInitially coming in, I thought is this my place to be here? Am I taking up too much space and too much air? I wanted to make sure I was doing something that my experience could supplement rather than take over,\u201d she said. But after subletting an apartment with other roommates traveling for the election, she found herself well received from the local activists and organizations, said Armstrong, who has previously been active in Democratic Party campaigning in Nevada. \u201cThere is a sense of, \u2018Thank God people are finally paying attention because we have been working so hard,\u2019\u201d she said. Armstrong is a youth organizer for 18by.vote, a nonpartisan organization that creates campaigns to support teenage voting. She is traveling to young Georgians\u2019 doors to help them register to vote and learn how to get to the polls for the runoff election,  and she is one of many young organizers working for the organization. They text and call potential voters, share social media campaigns and travel around to encourage young voters to show up on Election Day. About half are local organizers, while the rest are coming from other states, Armstrong said. Young people are getting out the vote in Georgia -- from thousands of miles away Emily Guo, 19, has lived in Georgia her whole life and says she\u2019s excited to see all the help come in from across the country as her state challenges political stereotypes and engages wider demographics of Americans. \u201cI think a lot of that is because of the groundwork young people and people of color have been laying for years and we are really starting to see the fruit of it,\u201d she said. Nurturing the growth of representation for people of diverse ages, races and backgrounds is what is pushing them to volunteer their time, said Nikhita Ragam, a Georgia Tech student who texted voters from her home in Texas over the school break. \u201cEven though I do hold my own political belief, the point is to have peoples\u2019 voices represented. We want the people\u2019s voice to be reflected in electoral politics,\u201d she said. And young voters everywhere have a stake in young voters showing up in the Georgia runoff, both in the policies that will come out of the Senate and in the reputation younger people have for not being very civically engaged, said Jazmin Kay, executive director of 18by.vote. \u201cYoung people are frequently told they are the future, but the current decisions being made impact young people dramatically,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe if young people were voting and putting pressure on elected officials they would (be) included.\u201d In just eight days, the 18by.vote organization has reached more than 276,000 people face to face and over text, Guo said. And the enthusiasm the organizers are feeling can be seen in the early voting. As of Tuesday, with a week left until the runoff election, 2.9 million Georgians had already cast their vote.

In just a few weeks, New York City\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary will offer the nation its first major opportunity to gauge how Democratic voters are thinking about their party and its policies \u2013 six months into the Biden administration. The city, an ethnic, religious and socioeconomic m\u00e9lange, where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 7-to-1, is the perfect place to take the temperature of a large swath of Democratic voters in the lead up to the 2022 midterms. Because, though they lean left, New York City voters are best known for their practicality \u2013 particularly in times of crisis. When the city was engulfed by a crime epidemic in the 1990s, New Yorkers put aside party allegiances and voted in Republican Rudy Giuliani, a former prosecutor who had taken on the mob and promised to clean up the city. After September 11, with lower Manhattan still smoldering, New Yorkers chose our former boss, Michael Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat who ran as a Republican, in the hopes that a business executive could rebuild Lower Manhattan and get the city back to work. Now, with Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s second and final term coming to an end \u2013 and the city just beginning to reemerge from a global pandemic that claimed the lives of some 30,000 New Yorkers \u2013 voters will be once again casting their ballots during a time of crisis, where the twin vectors of economic recovery and the social justice issues surrounding race and policing will be front and center. Violent crime \u2013 and the fear of it \u2013 has indeed increased in the city, and many primary voters appear to be open to candidates who firmly reject a \u201cdefund the police\u201d platform. One of the frontrunners in this year\u2019s 13-person Democratic race is Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president and a former police officer, who has made clear that economic recovery begins with public safety. He appears to be running neck and neck with former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who has also blasted calls to defund the police. The cringeworthy attack on Andrew Yang Their approach could serve as a reminder to Democrats nationally that they must publicly promote policies that keep neighborhoods safe, even as they press ahead with much-needed police and criminal justice reform. They simply cannot cede the issue of fighting crime to the GOP. What is notable about both Adams and Yang, beyond their public safety policies, is they are moderate Democrats. In fact, Adams even briefly left the Democratic Party in the mid-1990s because he viewed it as too far left on the issue of crime. And how are the more progressive candidates doing in the NYC race?  Two of three leading ones are facing scandals. Progressive stalwart Scott Stringer, the city\u2019s comptroller, has been accused of sexual misconduct, which he firmly denies, and Dianne Morales, the most progressive candidate in the race, is managing a staff exodus. If either Adams or Yang becomes the Democratic nominee for mayor, then it\u2019s fair to wager that the progressive wing of the party will have lost some of its mojo. As is the case on the national stage, the Latino vote \u2013 perhaps as many as one in five New York City voters \u2013 will likely prove decisive in the city\u2019s elections this year. With Morales\u2019 campaign struggling and no other major Latino candidate in the race, this all important and nuanced voting bloc could emerge as the decisive swing vote. In fact, Democratic strategists have posited that whoever carries the Hispanic vote will ultimately win the Democratic primary. This policy proposal fueled Andrew Yang's presidential run Yet Democrats cannot take the Latino vote for granted. Former President Donald Trump and the GOP made strides in drawing Latinos in recent elections, and Democrats will have to work hard to win some of their support back. Democrats need to package their policies in terms that matter to this constituency. Economic growth, opportunity and entrepreneurship are all key messaging points that resonate well with Latinos both in New York City and across the nation. After four years of taunting by Trump, Democrats must also make Latinos feel \u2013 both literally and figuratively \u2013 respected and valued in America, and emphasize that they are an important part of the fabric of the country. Finally, how many Democratic voters ultimately turn out to vote in New York City\u2019s June primary will give us a read of whether the party is feeling energized or complacent now that Trump has returned to his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, for the summer. Strong turnout and high engagement from the Democratic base will serve as an auspicious sign to Democratic operatives who know that a good showing in many of the northeastern congressional districts in the 2022 midterms is the key to maintaining a Democratic majority in the US House of Representatives. It is equally true that lackluster performance at the polls could signal an enthusiasm gap \u2013 a weakness that GOP operatives would use to their advantage.  The lessons learned from the upcoming June 22 primary \u2013 and the fall general election \u2013 will be a bellwether for the future of Democratic Party politics nationwide. Biden, who has surprised many for his embrace of progressive policies, should pay close attention to these races. Should New York Democrats opt to elect Adams or Yang as their nominee, it could signal broader national appetite for moderate, middle-of-the-road policies at the federal level. If that happens, it may send a message to Biden \u2013 and Democrats running across the country \u2013 that a more balanced approach to matters of policing reform, investment and other hot-button topics is what is needed to maintain their majorities next year. After June 22, the political stakes for 2022 will be set. Correction: This piece originally misstated the number of Democrats running for mayor.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: James E. Wright, President Emeritus of Dartmouth College, enlisted in the Marines in 1957 at 17. A historian, he is the author most recently of \u201cEnduring Vietnam: An American Generation and Its War.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Over the last year, the pandemic \u2013 with all its human tragedies and socioeconomic consequences, as well as the November election and its contested and violent aftermath \u2013 has dominated the nation\u2019s attention. But there were two events in 2020 that deserved more discussion. First, the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service, established by Congress in 2016, issued a significant report on March 25 urging a renewed emphasis on a culture of service. And 2020 marked the year when men born in 1955 became eligible for Social Security. Those men were the last Americans eligible to be drafted into military service. Now, no American under 65 has faced a draft notice. The All-Volunteer Force was implemented in 1973. During the 20 years of war in the Middle East, few of us have known those who have served there. Moreover, these have been the first extended wars in our history without a dedicated tax to pay for them. Most citizens have only a passing understanding of, or interest in, these military operations. The All-Volunteer Force was recommended in 1970 by a commission chaired by former Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates, and members included economist Milton Friedman, Notre Dame President Father Theodore Hesburgh, and NAACP Director Roy Wilkins. Their recommendations had broad support by groups ranging from anti-war and anti-draft demonstrators to libertarians to senior military leaders, and they were approved by liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans alike \u2013 as well as by President Richard Nixon. All were seeking to distance themselves from the draft controversies of the Vietnam War. In this century, these volunteers have served in the most professional, highly educated, and diverse military this country has known. They have conducted themselves well \u2013 with multiple deployments under trying circumstances in wars without end. They deserve the thanks of the nation. A smaller volunteer force has consequences. In the over-75 age group, 44% of the men and 1% of the women are veterans. In the under-34 age group, among men it is 3% and women less than 1%. The military today is represented by enlistees from rural areas more than urban, and the South and the West more than the rest of the country. Over 40% of enlistees are Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Sixteen percent are women. Many enlistees come from a military family. What Biden and Blinken don't want to tell Americans about Afghanistan A disproportionate number of those arrested following the January 6 attack on the Capitol were veterans. This should be troubling. There are a few factors that might partially explain this: The 21st Century military has been more successfully recruited from rural areas, as well as in the South and Southwest \u2013 notably \u201cred state\u201d areas. Politically, veterans have tended to be more Conservative, and they were more supportive of President Donald Trump \u2013 although that support has declined in the last four years. Enlistment processes have not screened for racists; and military commands often have ignored white supremacist and neo-Nazi views among those in their ranks. Extremist groups, especially the para-military organizations. have explicitly sought to recruit military veterans. The consequences of these circumstances were visible on January 6. A CNN analysis shortly after the riot found that 14% of those charged with criminal conduct were veterans. What needs to be equally apparent is that many of the voices who have spoken out against the January 6 assault on democracy were also veterans. A study in 2012 indicated that the Capitol Police Force had over 20% veterans. Brian Sicknick, the police officer killed in the attack, was a veteran. The problem with the Republic today is not a problem with military veterans. To be sure, some veterans, along with many non-veterans, joined in actions contrary to our democratic values. They must be held accountable. But there has been something more fundamental at work in this country in the last 50 years: a decline in civic culture, an erosion of trust in government, in its representatives, its democratic processes, and a contagion of conspiracy theories. Those born in 1955 heard it later when President John F. Kennedy insisted, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you \u2013 ask what you can do for your country.\u201d They watched siblings and friends enlist in the military or the Peace Corps. Despite the controversy over the draft, nearly 80% of those who served in the military during the Vietnam era were enlistees. Children of the WW II generation, they grew up in a culture that emphasized service. This culture was not sustained. In the last half century, this nation has watched the release of the Pentagon Papers and the revelations of Watergate, detailing deceit at the highest levels of government. President Ronald Reagan argued that government is not the solution but the problem. This attitude has evolved from a campaign slogan to a conviction that the government cannot be trusted \u2013 that career public servants are deep-state swamp dwellers. Many politicians and political commentators today reject bipartisan statesmanship. They shout that politics is about tribal loyalty and call opponents untrustworthy and disloyal. Expressions of racism and intolerance of \u201cothers\u201d have become too common. Political leaders have refused to accept the results of a democratic election.  Fringe views have become mainstream, and cynicism, hatred, and fear are stoked on cable television and social media. Schools are far less likely to require basic civics courses. If veterans were represented disproportionately among those arrested for invading the Capitol on January 6, I would observe they were far from proportionately represented among those Republican leaders and media personalities who lied to them and encouraged them. Although it is the case that of the 53 veterans serving as Republican members of Congress, 35 of them voted to reject the certified Arizona electoral votes.  The importance of dedicated service and sacrifice has been celebrated during the Covid-19 crisis. We need to build on the example of those who cared for us. The National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service urged an effort to build upon this, to affirm a \u201cwidespread culture of service\u2026.\u201d Starting with our leaders and representatives, all Americans need to acknowledge that our republic depends upon mutual trust, volunteerism and civic values. People who insist they are \u201cpatriots\u201d should start acting like it. The vast majority of our veterans already have.",

            "article_content": "The era of good feelings enjoyed by President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing will face a stern test of its staying power as the administration pushes forward into the next phases of its big-ticket policy agenda. Biden\u2019s first hundred days in office saw the passage of his $1.9 trillion Covid relief and economic stimulus package, along with the escalation of an unprecedented mass vaccination campaign that appears, at last, to be beating back the coronavirus pandemic. The success of those high-stakes government interventions has, in the eyes of many on the left, laid the groundwork for broader enhancements to the social safety net on a scale to match the ambitions of Democratic Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, author of the New Deal, and Lyndon B. Johnson, who enshrined Medicare and Medicaid as part of his Great Society. But the heady comparisons are, at most, premature, and more likely wishful thinking. Even if Biden\u2019s aspirations have been severely underestimated, the governing environment today \u2013 even with Democrats in control of Congress \u2013 is less conducive to the kind of enduring rewrites to the American social compact composed by his predecessors. Still, it is undeniable that Biden has so far succeeded at a practice that either eluded or had been largely dismissed as a useful practice by more recent Democratic administrations. The most unexpected political success of Biden\u2019s first three months in office is not a healthy approval rating or even the broad popularity of the \u201cAmerican Rescue Plan.\u201d It is, instead, the strategic work that seeded those outcomes \u2013 the building and prodding along of a fragile but effective coalition within his own party. Now, though, comes a more intricate, complicated political challenge. The green shoots of economic recovery, juiced by March\u2019s relief package, has created a welcome problem for Democrats. Absent the consuming impetus for action, both party centrists and progressives figure to be emboldened to drive tougher bargains on new legislation. With Republicans electing to effectively sit out talks with Democrats in Washington, Biden has pressed forward, refusing to be drawn into protracted, dead-end negotiations. His deeply rooted, near ideological devotion to finding bipartisan consensus has, for the moment, been pacified by the realities of the day (and lessons from the past). Instead, Biden has focused his deal-making efforts on lawmakers from within own party, whose slim congressional majorities mean that a single Senate defection or the loss of even a minor bloc of House members would be enough to grind his presidency to a halt. As the first 100 days spill out into what leading progressives worry could become a lost summer, there is a growing sense that the window for generational action on issues like climate change is closing. Biden is loath to squander the opportunities presented by what his chief of staff, Ron Klain, has described as a series of overlapping crises, but his willingness to take on more ambitious projects \u2013 the kind that fit under Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s heading of \u201cbig, structural change\u201d \u2013 is less plain to see. What\u2019s clearer is how he\u2019ll go about his business. Biden is a politician in the purest sense and his ability to position himself, through a combination of aggressive outreach and intuition, within touching distance of both poles of his party is a unique talent. He did not ride into the White House on the shoulders of a movement, but he clearly understands their power, just as his decades of experience counting votes in the Senate made clear their limitations. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez nodded to both realities in a recent virtual town hall, when she said the administration has \u201cdefinitely exceeded expectations that progressives had,\u201d before pointing to the crossroads ahead. \u201cI do think that the infrastructure plan is too small, but I think that (Biden\u2019s) vision was right \u2013 I think that what he advanced as some of these key goals were the right ones and they were admirable ones,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cBut I have real concerns that the actual dollars and cents and programmatic allocations in the bill don\u2019t meet the ambition of that vision of what\u2019s being sold.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the increasingly effective Congressional Progressive Caucus, led by Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, have been measured in their public remarks. In a way, their positioning reflects Biden\u2019s own calculus \u2013 that there is little margin for error and fights will need to be chosen with care, or else they\u2019ll consume and undermine the coalition. After Biden secured the Democratic presidential nomination early last April, when Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race and quickly endorsed him, the Biden team and leading progressives carved out a strategic partnership rooted in a shared desire to unseat Trump and launch a coherent, effective and equitable pandemic response. But baked into their election-winning alliance was another understanding: that relationships mattered and, down the line, confrontation was inevitable. So, they set about to create some padding. First came the \u201cunity task forces,\u201d working groups with members appointed by Sanders and Biden, charged with hashing out policy differences and establishing some kind of framework for future action. The meetings produced some meaningful consensus, mostly on climate change policy, but were more valuable to both sides as social exercises or dry-runs for the intra-party debates to come. Then, after the election, another hurdle: staffing the White House and administration. Despite installing many of the usual suspects \u2013 a handful of them distrusted or even loathed on the left \u2013 in the highest ranking jobs, Biden\u2019s team also embedded a new generation of progressive policy thinkers into less flashy but influential roles, setting them up well not only for the coming months and years, but to begin a slow transition toward a more progressive-minded Democratic policy establishment. Those early moves are inextricable from the confrontations on the table now, creating a more hospitable environment for constructive debate and a base of goodwill \u2013 and good faith \u2013 that could spare the party a return to its recent history of more corrosive clashes. For example: Though the parameters of Biden\u2019s infrastructure package, the \u201cAmerican Jobs Plan,\u201d are still being drawn and the sticking points only vaguely in focus, the size and scope of its climate investments are already picking at doubters on the left. Biden has said he wants to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% from their 2005 levels by 2030, but his proposed spending \u2013 $2 trillion over eight years \u2013 is a retreat from his campaign pitch, which called for the same amount over just four years. There is no Republican support for anything close to either outlay, which means Democrats will \u2013 again \u2013 ultimately be negotiating with themselves in an effort to get to the 50 votes (plus Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s tie-breaker) to pass the final bill through budget reconciliation rules in the Senate. Anything less than unanimity in the upper chamber and something close to it in the House would kibosh the plan, whatever it looks like. A group of progressive organizations, including Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement, highlighted the pressure points in a memo published this week that graded Biden\u2019s first 100 days and spelled out the left\u2019s agenda going forward. The authors described the American Rescue Plan as \u201can important step toward stabilizing the country\u201d and cheered the administration for acting decisively when it became clear Republicans weren\u2019t coming onboard. They also highlighted Biden\u2019s rapid Covid response, his early rhetoric on climate change and the creation of a White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, choosing progressive Deb Haaland to run the Interior Department and his recent commitment to fully withdraw US troops from Afghanistan. But its kicker, after listing the issues where Biden had yet to move, was stark. \u201cThe honeymoon,\u201d they wrote, \u201cis over.\u201d The left\u2019s agenda is indeed broad, ambitious and, to date, largely unfulfilled. There is also an emerging gap between Biden\u2019s spoken words and those that appear, on paper, in his legislative agenda. In his address to a joint session of Congress this week, Biden made the public case for boosting the minimum wage and passing the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, a top priority for labor and the left. He also touted what could be his signature achievement: an expansion of the poverty-busting child tax credit, written into his Covid relief bill, that he wants to extend another four years. (Its supporters, a broad-based group in the Senate, want to make the benefit permanent.) Biden also discussed lowering prescription drug prices by giving Medicare the ability to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, a curious inclusion given the longtime progressive priority was left out of his first draft of the \u201cAmerican Families Plan,\u201d the legislation Democrats have teed up to follow their infrastructure bill. Whether his remarks were, as STAT News described them, \u201can empty call to action,\u201d or a signal that he was giving way and inviting pressure to change course is one in a growing collection of open questions facing progressives, who have been welcomed \u2013 literally \u2013 into the Biden White House. But no amount of high-level meetings and robust, all-hours communication with progressive leaders can paper over the fact that the federal minimum wage remains unchanged, there has been no talk of expanding Obamacare to include a public option, as Biden proposed on the stump, or that a federal voting rights reform bill is stuck in the congressional muck. The Senate\u2019s 60-vote filibuster remains in place and Biden doesn\u2019t appear to have the appetite to pressure the moderate Democratic holdouts in the chamber, like Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema, to climb down from their positions in support of it. And without cracking that lock, the \u201cgo big\u201d mantra embraced by the White House will remain just that: sloganeering. Biden, of course, can only do so much. There are 50 Democratic senators, not 60 \u2013 like President Barack Obama had for a brief period after taking office \u2013 or closer to 70, which helped FDR and LBJ get their signature programs over the line. But the new left is different from the last generation of liberals. They are younger, generally, and cut their political chops in the unrelenting cauldron of movement politics. That movement has matured over the past few years, and now has, in Sanders, the Budget Committee chair, one of its leaders in a seat of remarkable influence. None of this is news to the White House, which navigated those tensions in the run-up to the passage of the American Rescue Plan and avoided any headline-grabbing brinksmanship over issues like stimulus checks early on in the process. When the Senate parliamentarian ruled out a minimum wage hike to $15 an hour, effectively striking it from the legislation, progressives fulminated but never threatened to pull their support. That understanding of Biden\u2019s domestic constraints and the left\u2019s selective engagement on contentious foreign policy issues, like continued US support for Saudi Arabia as it carries out a deadly war in Yemen, has been critical to the President\u2019s early success. But there is a line between cooperation and capitulation \u2013 and as the next 100 days of the Biden presidency unfurl, progressives will need convincing that the President isn\u2019t daring them to cross it.",

            "article_content": "Justice Democrats, the progressive group that launched Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s historic 2018 campaign, made its first splash of the 2022 midterms on Monday by endorsing Nashville activist Odessa Kelly as she kicked off her Democratic primary challenge to longtime Tennessee Rep. Jim Cooper. Kelly is the co-founder and executive director of Stand Up Nashville, a labor-aligned coalition of community groups. If she were to defeat Cooper \u2013 a centrist first elected in 1982 and now in his 10th term since returning to the House in 2003 \u2013 and win his seat, Kelly would become the first gay, Black woman to serve in Congress. \u201cI\u2019ve watched kids grow up in this city and felt their fear when we didn\u2019t know what would come next,\u201d Kelly said in a statement. \u201cWe need more pathways out of poverty, and the status quo is no longer good enough. I know how to build coalitions that get results, and I\u2019m running for Congress so that we can make bold, ambitious change at the national level.\u201d After Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, Justice Democrats helped elect freshman Reps. Jamaal Bowman of New York, Cori Bush of Missouri and Marie Newman of Illinois in 2020. All three first-term lawmakers ousted a moderate or conservative incumbent Democratic House member on their way to victory in November. Tennessee\u2019s 5th Congressional District, with its hub in Nashville, is one of the few Democratic strongholds in a state that backed former President Donald Trump with more than 60% of the vote last year \u2013 making it a prime target for Justice Democrats, who have mostly focused their resources on boosting progressive insurgent campaigns in safe blue districts. \u201cAs someone who has spent her life as a public servant and a community organizer, Odessa Kelly is exactly the kind of Democrat we need in Congress,\u201d Justice Democrats executive director Alexandra Rojas said in a statement. \u201cOur grassroots movement has shocked the nation in two cycles and we are prepared to do it again. It\u2019s time to usher in a new generation of progressive leadership into the Democratic Party.\u201d Cooper, whose political career stretches back nearly four decades, is the brother of Nashville Mayor John Cooper and son of former Tennessee Gov. Prentice Cooper. He also served in the House from 1983-1995. Cooper ran unopposed in the 2020 general election. In her campaign kick-off video, Kelly spoke about her own father\u2019s work at a community center in East Nashville. \u201cThe pride my daddy had for his work in this city and the joy I felt growing up in this community \u2013 that made me who I am,\u201d Kelly says, pledging to reject corporate PAC money and back \u201cMedicare for All, housing justice and Green New Deal union jobs.\u201d In her announcement, Kelly criticized Cooper \u2013 who had an estimated personal net worth of more than $16 million in 2018, according to the Center for Responsive Politics \u2013 for taking donations from \u201ccorporate PACs representing weapons manufacturers and real estate developers.\u201d During her time as the leader of Stand Up Nashville, Kelly has been on the front line of a series of campaigns to push for more equitable representation in city government. The group formed its Boards and Commissions Leadership Institute in order to help create a pipeline for a new, more diverse class of candidates. Kelly\u2019s organization also brokered a \u201ccommunity benefits agreement\u201d in 2018 as part of the deal to build a new stadium for Nashville SC, a Major League Soccer club now entering its second season. The agreement provided for affordable housing on the development site, a starting wage for stadium workers above $15 an hour, and the formation of a committee to assure the agreement\u2019s various provisions are met.",

            "article_content": "Several civil rights groups announced on Tuesday that they have filed a joint federal lawsuit over the Georgia election overhaul bill, the third federal lawsuit challenging the legislation since it was signed into law last week. Here's why voting rights activists say Georgia's new election law targets Black voters The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Georgia, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., Southern Poverty Law Center, and law firms WilmerHale, and Davis Wright Tremaine brought the case on behalf of the Sixth District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Georgia Muslim Voter Project, Women Watch Afrika, Latino Community Fund Georgia, and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. The lawsuit alleges the new law makes it harder for Georgians to vote, \u201cparticularly voters of color, new citizens, and religious communities,\u201d according to an announcement of the suit released Tuesday. The suit also challenges several provisions in the new law, including the ban on mobile voting, new I.D. requirements for requesting an absentee ballot, and the ban on \u201cline warming\u201d \u2013 which would make it a crime for volunteers to provide food and water to voters waiting in line. The law also empowers state officials to take over local elections boards and limits the use of ballot drop boxes. Republicans have cast the measure, dubbed the Election Integrity Act of 2021, as necessary to boost confidence in voting procedures in the wake of former President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated, unsubstantiated claims of fraud.   The Georgia law is part of a larger effort by GOP legislators across the country \u2013 including in the battleground states of Michigan and Arizona \u2013 to roll back voting access in the wake of the 2020 election. Across the country, bills have been moved in at least 45 states. At least 253 bills have moved this year with provisions that would restrict voting access, according to a February analysis by the liberal leaning Brennan Center for Justice \u2013 more than six times the number of bills for the same time last year. Sherrilyn Ifill, the NAACP LDF\u2019s president and director-counsel, said Tuesday the law is \u201cperhaps the most bold and shameful voter suppression legislation enacted in the modern era.\u201d \u201cIts purpose and target are clear: to create barriers to voting for Black voters who turned out in record numbers for the November 2020 presidential election and the January 2021 special election,\u201d Ifill said in a statement. \u201cThe provisions of the new law and the manner in which it was enacted reflect a thorough disregard for the sanctity of protecting the right to vote and a headlong and determined zeal to diminish Black political power in Georgia.\u201d The Georgia NAACP, Georgia Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, League of Women Voters of Georgia, GALEO Latino Community Development Fund, Common Cause and the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe filed a federal lawsuit late Sunday, claiming \u201cSB 202 is the culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color by the Republican State Senate, State House, and Governor.\u201d It also alleges Republican officials included specific changes that target voters of color after the record turnout and Democratic victories in the November 2020 presidential election and two Senate runoffs in January 2021. Marc Elias, an election attorney, filed a lawsuit last week on behalf of the New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter and Rise Inc. on similar grounds. CNN\u2019s Dianne Gallagher, Paul LeBlanc and Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Julia Letlow, who is projected to make history Saturday as the first Republican woman elected to Congress from Louisiana, didn\u2019t expect to be on a ballot this weekend. Three and half months ago, her husband had won the election for Louisiana\u2019s 5th District in an early December runoff. But he never made it to Congress, dying from complications of Covid-19 before he was sworn in. Letlow, a university administrator who wrote a doctoral dissertation on grief, had to make a quick decision. She jumped into the race in mid-January after the governor called a special election to replace her husband, the late Rep.-elect Luke Letlow. The first-time candidate had the advantage of a campaign team already in place, and she avoided a runoff by securing a majority of the vote among the 12-person field on Saturday, which means she\u2019ll soon bolster the already record-breaking 30 Republican women in the House this year. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely different being the candidate than it is the spouse, but nothing that I wasn\u2019t used to already,\u201d Letlow said in an interview with CNN before her victory. She campaigned alongside her husband \u2013 a former Hill staffer \u2013 across the rural district\u2019s 24 parishes when he ran for the safe Republican seat last year. Under Louisiana\u2019s jungle primary system, candidates of all parties run together on one ballot. If no one received a majority of the vote \u2013 which wasn\u2019t an easy feat in such a crowded race \u2013 the top two vote-getters would have advanced to an April runoff. Letlow raised $683,000 by the end of February, with Democrat Sandra Christophe raising the next highest amount of money, about $75,000. Running in this deeply conservative district, which covers northeastern Louisiana and extends to the tip of the boot, Letlow had racked up widespread support from prominent Republicans \u2013 and not just from her home state. Former President Donald Trump endorsed her earlier this month, and she\u2019s also received donations from some members who voted to impeach the former President, including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican. Letlow told CNN she would have joined the majority of the House Republican Conference in objecting to the certification of the presidential election on January 6, and she supports her state party\u2019s decision to censure GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy for his vote to convict Trump in his impeachment trial earlier this year. In the wake of her husband\u2019s death, Letlow received calls from both Trump and President Joe Biden. \u201cIt was special because he lost his wife and daughter in a car accident,\u201d she said of her conversation with Biden. \u201cHe said, \u2018You know, where you sit today, I\u2019ve sat and I know that pain\u2019 \u2013 and there\u2019s nothing like speaking to someone who has been where you\u2019ve been and understands that pain that you\u2019re in,\u201d Letlow said. \u201cAnd so his words resonated with me on a very deep level.\u201d She said Trump was also \u201cthoughtful with his words,\u201d expressing his condolences. While running for Congress hadn\u2019t been in her immediate plans, Letlow had given some thought to seeking public office, and her husband had asked her to promise him that she\u2019d consider it someday if the opportunity arose. \u201cI probably was going to start a little bit smaller scale,\u201d Letlow said. But she quickly stood out. \u201cFrom my first conversation with Julia, I knew she was exceptionally special,\u201d said Julie Conway, the executive director of VIEW PAC, which recruits and helps elect Republican women, pointing to her \u201cstrength, true faith, raw honesty and a genuine desire to not only fulfill Luke\u2019s legacy, but to create her own.\u201d While Luke Letlow won the 5th District as a congressional chief of staff running to replace his retiring boss, former Rep. Ralph Abraham, Julia Letlow doesn\u2019t come from a traditional political background. When she was in 5th grade, she told her parents she wanted to be a college professor. Her academic interests and personal life soon collided. During her junior year at the University of Louisiana Monroe, her 17-year-old brother was killed in a car accident. She started doing what she\u2019s always done in the face of adversity \u2013 look to books for answers \u2013 but she wasn\u2019t finding what she needed. \u201cWhen I go through tragedy, I tend to just dive into research and literature and try to read about my experience and learn from others who walked through it, and there just wasn\u2019t much out there on sibling grief,\u201d she said. Her professors encouraged her to try to fill that hole, and she turned her research into a master\u2019s thesis and eventually wrote a dissertation about losing family members and giving meaning to grief. Her academic work has been all too relevant this year. \u201cOne major thing that I\u2019m drawing on now is how important it is to get outside of yourself when you\u2019re grieving,\u201d she said, pointing to her run for public office. Before her most recent loss, much of her professional work has been rooted in how to communicate grief and loss. She worked with residents and medical students at the Tulane University School of Medicine on how to build relations with patients and develop a good bedside manner, and sees that ability to humanize and empathize as part of what she would bring to Congress. \u201cWhen I was working with doctors, I would encourage them to, you know, get down on eye level with someone, with their patient, especially when delivering bad news,\u201d Letlow said, explaining how that translates into legislating. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have conversations with people where you don\u2019t always agree. But if you can get down on eye level with someone, you know, over a cup of coffee or whatever it may be, and speak to each other with respect and dignity as human beings first, then that goes a lot farther.\u201d Education is a top priority for Letlow, who was recently a semi-finalist candidate for the presidency of her alma mater, where she\u2019s climbed the ranks in higher education administration. \u201cI was able to talk about education and how it can be used as a catalyst to lift a region out of poverty,\u201d she said, noting that hers is among the poorest congressional districts in the country. Nearly 30% of families with children are under the poverty line in the 5th District, according to the Census Bureau. She\u2019s an advocate for extending rural broadband, noting that residents of her districts have struggled with remote learning and telehealth during the pandemic, and she praised her husband for introducing her to the district\u2019s agrarian roots. \u201cI\u2019m a city girl \u2013 if you want to call me that \u2013 I was born and raised in Monroe,\u201d she said, adding that she married \u201ca good ole country boy,\u201d which took her to Start, Louisiana \u2013 \u201cwhere Tim McGraw is from.\u201d \u201cI might have gone my whole life thinking that produce just comes from the grocery store,\u201d Letlow joked. She\u2019s done a mix of virtual and in-person campaign events this year, adding that she\u2019s careful to always wear a mask around others \u2013 a practice that some GOP members of Congress have resisted. \u201cI want to wear that mask and make sure that I\u2019m protecting them,\u201d she said of the people in her district, noting that she and her husband always followed guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the trail. Asked whom she looks up to in Congress, she pointed to Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, praising his communication style. And, she noted, many of the Republican women in Congress reached out too, with freshman Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa being especially helpful. Because even though she\u2019s seen a campaign up close before, Letlow \u2013 like other female candidates \u2013 gets different questions than her husband did. \u201cNobody really was asking Luke who\u2019s gonna take care of his children whenever he won,\u201d Letlow said. \u201cYou know, I probably had to answer that question 95% of the time.\u201d She\u2019s not the only woman who has been running for the seat of a spouse who died from Covid-19. In Texas\u2019 6th District, Susan Wright is running for the open seat of her husband, the late GOP Rep. Ron Wright, who died in February. Republicans elected a record number of non-incumbent women to the House in 2020 \u2013 and Letlow will now be another. But whereas many of those new GOP women are in competitive seats, Letlow\u2019s victory in a safe red seat will help grow the number of women in the conference for the longer term. \u201cThat means she can spend a lot more time on legislating and constituent service than on campaigning,\u201d Conway said. This story has been updated Saturday with Letlow\u2019s victory.",

            "article_content": "At the helm of the most significant criminal investigation facing Donald Trump, his family and his business, Manhattan\u2019s top prosecutor faces a daunting task heading into his final months in office while sifting through millions of newly obtained pages of financial records related to the former President. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is not expected to run for reelection, and with 10 months left in his third term, all eyes are on the New York Democrat and who will be elected to succeed him \u2013 adding another wrench in an unprecedented investigation. One question that is being openly discussed among lawyers is whether Vance will move quickly and decide to charge a crime or close the investigation before he leaves office \u2013 or if he will leave those decisions to his successor. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that the case, if it is charged, would be charged before Vance leaves office,\u201d says Anne Milgram, a former attorney general for New Jersey and former federal prosecutor. \u201cThat\u2019s because that\u2019s 10 months away \u2013 which is a long time in a criminal investigation \u2013 and because the DA\u2019s office had previously noted that there were statute of limitations timing issues,\u201d she said. Vance\u2019s team of prosecutors has been investigating the Trump Organization for more than two years and on Monday received a significant boost to the inquiry after the Supreme Court paved the way for investigators to receive tax returns, financial statements and other records from Trump\u2019s long-time accountant, Mazars. The DA received the records on Monday, the office confirmed, and sources say there are millions of pages of documents to analyze. \u201cI think Cy is a serious person who cares about getting this right \u2013 this is going to be an important part of his legacy at the office,\u201d said Eric Soufer, a former senior counsel at the New York Attorney General\u2019s office who is now at Tusk Strategies. There are eight Democratic candidates competing in a June primary to succeed Vance \u2013 and the winner in Democratic-heavy Manhattan would likely win the race in the November general election. The field of contenders is diverse and includes former prosecutors, a public defender who competed on the reality TV series Survivor, a civil rights attorney and a New York State Assemblyman. They have been outspoken about criminal justice reform, overhauling the sex crimes unit and holding powerful people accountable, but the Trump investigation could hijack the race in a city that is decidedly against him. \u201cA race that can \u2013 on the one hand can be very focused, justly so, on criminal justice reform \u2013 all of a sudden begins to become a little bit more a more a referendum on how qualified are you to prosecute Donald Trump,\u201d said Soufer. If the decision to charge the case falls to his successor, it will be a potentially thorny issue that he or she will have to tackle out of the gate. Alvin Bragg, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan US Attorney\u2019s Office public corruption unit and chief deputy attorney general at the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office, has wrangled with Trump world before. At the AG\u2019s office, he oversaw more than 100 suits against Trump administration policies from the travel ban to DACA, as well as the office\u2019s suit against the Trump Foundation, which alleged that Trump, his children Eric, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, violated state charity and campaign finance rules and \u201cwas little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump\u2019s business and political interests,\u201d according to the suit. Trump was ordered to pay $2 million and the foundation agreed to dissolve as part of a settlement, which Trump reacted to by saying, \u201cThe New York Attorney General is deliberately mischaracterizing this settlement for political purposes.\u201d On the Manhattan DA\u2019s criminal probe, Bragg said he could not comment specifically on what he\u2019d do with the investigation, but said he\u2019s \u201cgone where the facts were taking me for 20 plus years.\u201d \u201cWe know what\u2019s been reported,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know the steps the office has taken in any complete measure so I wouldn\u2019t want to make any assumptions.\u201d Others have been more vocal. Lucy Lang, who was a prosecutor at the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office for 12 years and left in 2018, called for Vance\u2019s investigation into Trump to continue in December, saying \u201cimmunity is not a consolation prize to losing an election.\u201d \u201cThere have been a number of high-profile instances that give the appearance that there was some kind of special access. The next DA has to ensure that New Yorkers know that the powerful and well-connected are held to the same standards of justice,\u201d Lang told CNN. One of Lang\u2019s advisers is Peirce Moser, a former prosecutor who led the office\u2019s investigation into Trump Soho before it was dropped. Lang, who was not involved in the Trump SoHo investigation, would not comment on whether she would re-open it, if she won. On the criticism, Vance has said, \u201cAt the end of the day, we operate in the courtroom of the law, not the courtroom of public opinion.\u201d One thing several candidates can agree on is whoever takes over for Vance should have a strong understanding of complex investigations. Diana Florence, who was at the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office for 25 years, says she wants to prioritize going after \u201ccrimes of power, not crimes of poverty\u201d but wouldn\u2019t go into detail about the Trump investigation. \u201cThese cases never start the way they end, you always have to follow the evidence,\u201d Florence told CNN. Tali Farhadian Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor and more recently general counsel at the Brooklyn District Attorney\u2019s Office, says she\u2019ll commit to holding anyone who violated laws accountable, even Trump, but she would approach those investigations with \u201can open mind.\u201d \u201cJust to absolutely be clear, prosecuting Trump in the Manhattan DA office is not about politics. It\u2019s not about holding him to account for what kind of president he was. Or what kind of policies he tried to put into the world,\u201d Weinstein told CNN. \u201cThe question there is, did he violate the laws, or his associates \u2026 did they violate the laws of the state of New York and harm New Yorkers?\u201d Manhattan public defender Eliza Orlins \u2013 who was also on the Survivor series \u2013 has been tweeting about Trump since the election, including in December saying, \u201cPresidents can\u2019t pardon ANYONE for New York State crimes.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that I won\u2019t look into, because I think that holding people who are rich and powerful and just think they can exert that power and wealth, to not be held accountable is, you know, simply unacceptable,\u201d Orlins told CNN. Civil rights attorney Tahani Aboushi rushed to JFK Airport in the wake of Trump\u2019s travel ban where she spent days helping travelers, many of them detained, who were unaware of the new policy. \u201cIt was chaos,\u201d Aboushi told CNN. \u201cPeople were petrified.\u201d Yet, Aboushi says she wants to remain neutral when it comes to discussing the ongoing Trump probe, emphasizing that she would address investigations that have gone through the office. \u201cI think what people are hoping for with the response to Trump is, will the powerful and privileged be subject to the very same system that the rest of us are processed through?\u201d Aboushi said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I commit to is not putting any badge or bank account above the law.\u201d Another candidate is Dan Quart, a tenants\u2019 rights attorney and New York State assemblyman. Before he announced he was running for district attorney, he voted in favor of two bills in the state legislature that aimed to limit Trump\u2019s authority while president: one was meant to weaken a president\u2019s pardon power by closing a double jeopardy loophole in the state, and the other would allow the state to give Congress Trump\u2019s tax returns. He was also critical of Trump taking aim of whether he paid enough in taxes, after a 2018 New York Times report alleged Trump took part in \u201cdubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including outright fraud.\u201d \u201cFor years, while millions of working people paid their fair share in taxes, Donald Trump was cheating the system, enriching himself and his family,\u201d Quart told City and State in 2019. \u201cThe facts point to a consistent pattern of fraud and deception that warrants an investigation by the Manhattan DA.\u201d Now as a candidate in the race, Quart is more reserved about how he feels about the investigation. \u201cIf there\u2019s evidence of serious crime has been committed, I will prosecute, and that is true for former president as much as it\u2019s true for anyone, for anyone else,\u201d Quart told CNN. For Liz Crotty, who spent six years at the Manhattan DA\u2019s office, staying mum on the investigation into Trump Organization\u2019s business dealings is what any candidate who is serious about taking over the office should do. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna go with the party line (which) is that until I know the facts, I can\u2019t commit to anything,\u201d Crotty told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s the only responsible answer.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Liz Crotty\u2019s professional experience. She never worked for Vance.",

            "article_content": "On January 5, as results came in from the Senate runoff election in Georgia, the texts between President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s senior staff went late into the night and into the next morning. With the Senate majority on the line, and full control of Washington in their grasp, the outcome of the two Georgia races would determine the fate of what they all agreed was their top priority for the new administration \u2014 passing a massive Covid relief package in the opening weeks. They\u2019d been working on it for nearly two months, identifying needs and, at Biden\u2019s direction, crafting the plan around them, regardless of cost. But if the Democrats won in Georgia, the plan would suddenly go from an aspiration they would have to bargain with Republicans over, to a reality as long as they kept their party unified. With no war room to report to that night, no headquarters or even a transition office to gather in, the Biden staffers were all glued to the TVs in their homes around Washington, or, in the case of incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain, in Delaware with Biden, firing off texts to one another as each Georgia county reported results. \u201cEverybody understood for weeks what the impact of winning the two Georgia races might be,\u201d Steve Ricchetti, the long-time Biden adviser who would become counselor to the president, told CNN in an interview. \u201cWe invested a lot of time and effort in it in the weeks leading up to it because we obviously understood what it could mean for our agenda.\u201d By late morning the next day, it was clear that Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock had done the improbable, sweeping both races in Georgia and delivering the Senate back to the Democrats less than a month before Biden took office. The twin victories marked a political earthquake for the incoming president and opened the door to one of the largest public health and economic relief proposals in US history. For all of Biden\u2019s talk of bipartisanship, Democrats now had the power to move their top priority without a single Republican vote. It was the same situation as 2009, when the Obama administration rushed to pass a relief package during his first month in office. Back then Democrats lowered the size of the plan to garner some Republican support, a decision many of them came to regret during the slow recovery that followed. This time would be different. From the outset, the common goal among Biden\u2019s team was to go big \u2013 even if that meant going it alone. At $1.9 trillion, the American Rescue Plan is second only in size to last year\u2019s $2.2 trillion CARES Act. When it was first unveiled to the public on January 14, the assumption among Republicans and even some Democrats was that Biden\u2019s nearly $2 trillion moonshot was an opening offer, a place to start negotiations that would inevitably lead to a smaller price tag. But there would be no negotiating from Biden\u2019s team. That was the number, and while there was room to bargain over marginal side items, the topline wasn\u2019t moving. This story is based on interviews with more than two dozen officials from the White House, Capitol Hill and outside interest groups who worked directly with the campaign and transition on Biden\u2019s cornerstone legislative proposal. CNN also spoke to Republican lawmakers and aides who remain agog at the size of the package and the speed with which Biden has pushed it along. Last week, as Democrats on Capitol Hill began the legislative maneuvering to prepare the bill for reconciliation, a few key Republican senators remained convinced that Biden is in a different place than his more progressive \u2013 and aggressive \u2013 staff. Other Republican senators have expressed borderline shock at their former colleague\u2019s firm line. Even Larry Summers, long considered one of the pre-eminent economists in the Democratic Party \u2013 though he is loathed by many on the left \u2013 warned the plan would spend too much money too fast and crowd out future funds for other progressive priorities like infrastructure, education and climate. Yet the Biden team has remained unfazed, and congressional and White House officials are targeting early March for the bill to land on Biden\u2019s desk, which would mark it as the largest piece of spending any president has enacted in his first 100 days. Bipartisan Senate talks are still ongoing, aides say. But with Democratic leaders in both chambers aligned with the White House, there\u2019s little sense at this point they will change the direction of things. There are certainly risks involved. Republicans have lashed out at Biden, claiming his calls for unity and bipartisanship must not be genuine. The economic concerns raised by Summers and Republicans will trail the proposal through every turn of the months and years ahead. The huge bill also threatens to put moderate Democrats in a difficult spot, and Biden can\u2019t afford to lose a single one. With the Senate deadlocked 50-50, the bill passed its first test last week thanks only to the tie-breaker vote of Vice President Kamala Harris, when Democrats muscled through their budget resolution. Though the party has stayed unified in the opening weeks, a single senator can slow or halt the process altogether. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, kept the process on track \u2013 and elicited sighs of relief among Democrats \u2013 when he said he\u2019d vote to move forward in a statement shortly before the vote. But it included a warning for the sweeping package. \u201cLet me be clear \u2013 and these are words I shared with President Biden \u2013 our focus must be targeted on the COVID-19 crisis and Americans who have been most impacted by this pandemic,\u201d Manchin said. But that high wire act has done nothing to convince Biden and his team to scale back. \u201cThe way I see it, the biggest risk is not going too big,\u201d Biden said in a sweeping economic speech February 5 outlining his hardline on the proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s if we go too small.\u201d The meetings began in November, not long after the election was called for Biden. Even before the President-elect\u2019s transition officially kicked into gear, Biden\u2019s top advisers, many of whom would get jobs in the White House, gathered daily \u2013 and always virtually \u2013 to hash out what they knew would become the single most prominent marker of their accomplishments in their first 100 days in office. From the start, they took a unique approach. Often, when spending bills are crafted, the topline number is settled on first as lawmakers and officials figure out what is possible and work down from there. But Biden\u2019s team says it started at the bottom and built up. The $1.9 trillion figure wasn\u2019t nailed down until the days before its public release, advisers say. As they went, the goal was two-fold \u2013 fund everything needed to end the pandemic, while also doling out enough money to float struggling Americans until things got back to normal. The proposal includes $160 billion for vaccine distribution and testing, $130 billion for K-12 schools, and $350 billion for state and local governments. It also contains hundreds of billions more in aid to families, including $1,400 in direct monthly payments, expanded nutrition assistance programs, extensions of emergency unemployment programs, and big expansions of the Child Tax and Earned income Tax Credits, boosting the benefits to a level some economists project could cut child poverty in half. As the plan came together, administration officials said one priority remained clear: Biden didn\u2019t want just a short-term infusion of stimulus, with patches and temporary extensions to various aid provisions to keep the economy afloat for a few months \u2013 he wanted to lock in long-term aid and investment. Enough money not just to pull the US out of the pandemic, but to give it the fuel for a massive future expansion. It marked a fundamentally different approach from congressional Republicans \u2013 one that would define negotiations destined for failure. Senate Republicans viewed tens of billions in unspent funds from past relief packages and an economic picture that showed signs of recovery once vaccines were deployed as a reason to carefully target any new aid. Republicans would offer shorter-term extensions of individual benefits, smaller direct payments, no money for state and local governments, all with a significant influx of funds for vaccine distribution and testing. It would be rejected out of hand. To build the proposal and help shepherd it through, Biden fielded a familiar group of advisers, the most senior of whom had all served in key roles in the Obama White House. The group eventually included more than a dozen officials. Jeff Zients became Biden\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, Cecilia Rouse was nominated to chair the Council of Economic Advisers, and Susan Rice was appointed to lead the Domestic Policy Council. Brian Deese, the incoming director of Biden\u2019s National Economic Council, became Biden\u2019s point person on selling the package. Deese, who was running the automotive industry rescue for Obama in 2009 even as he was finishing his Yale law degree, held meetings and calls with dozens of lawmakers from both parties. Deese kept outside supporters looped in, and served, in large part, as the face of the proposal in the media. He also became a point of frustration for Republican lawmakers, who quickly came to view him as unbending in any talks over the plan, GOP aides told CNN. That is less a reflection of Deese, administration officials say, and more a reflection of how the package was constructed from the start. Shortly before Christmas, Biden\u2019s team got an unexpected assist when President Donald Trump began threatening to sink a bipartisan relief package if its direct payments to Americans weren\u2019t increased to $2,000, from $600. Up until then, direct payments weren\u2019t a focus of what Biden\u2019s team was putting together. But congressional Democrats seized on the moment and passed the increase in a House bill that surprisingly secured 44 Republican votes. Though the increase was halted by the Republican-led Senate, the House vote proved there was bi-partisan support for giving significantly more money to families. Biden quickly went on the record in support of the idea, and it soon became a focal point of the two Georgia Senate runoffs, with Warnock and Ossoff pledging to get the increase passed if elected. \u201cIf you send Jon and the Reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door,\u201d Biden said during a campaign stop in Atlanta the day before the runoff election. After Warnock and Ossoff both won, Biden\u2019s team made those checks \u2013 an additional $1,400 to the $600 already disbursed \u2013 a central selling-point for the proposal. Biden, as the proposal started to move through Congress, repeatedly told lawmakers backing off the size of the checks was a promise he simply wouldn\u2019t break. It also meant the size of the package would get even bigger. As meetings stretched past the holidays and into the new year, a troubling picture began to emerge within Biden\u2019s team over the state of vaccine distribution they\u2019d be inheriting. Data coming in from transition landing teams at agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Health and Human Services, as well as intelligence from companies contracted to create and distribute the vaccine, suggested something worse than they had expected. Not only was the economy in a deep hole, the thing that would help the most, a robust plan to get vaccines into the arms of millions of Americans, was almost non-existent, advisers say. While the Trump administration\u2019s work to produce a vaccine was unprecedented in its speed and success, its plan for how to distribute the shots themselves \u2013 heavily reliant on states, limited in centralized data and lacking a fulsome infrastructure \u2013 was anything but. Vaccine distribution \u201cwas much more troubled than we thought it was,\u201d a senior administration official said. The more they learned, the more Biden\u2019s team came to the view that vaccine distribution under the Trump administration \u201cwasn\u2019t even at the starting line,\u201d one person in close contact with Biden\u2019s team said. The view was \u201cwe have to rebuild just to get to that starting line,\u201d the person recounted. As they calculated what would eventually be the $160 billion vaccine and testing piece of the proposal, Biden\u2019s team built itself a cushion as they modeled out various scenarios of how the months ahead would play out, deciding to overshoot projected needs rather than risk coming up short. \u201cThey were walking a pretty fine line between being able to outright justify it while also making sure it was going to be enough regardless of what came next\u201d in the crisis, another person involved said. As the administration pushed toward Biden\u2019s stated goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days, the vaccine and testing elements of the proposal became the least controversial. On January 27, nearly two weeks after the Biden team first unveiled the $1.9 trillion price tag, Senate Republicans held an internal conference call to talk strategy. By then, it was apparent they wouldn\u2019t be playing much of a role in crafting the bill. According to two people on the call, several moderate senators teed off on what they viewed as clear signals that Biden\u2019s team had no intention of negotiating. Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, pointed out that none of the Republicans were consulted as the administration crafted its $1.9 trillion plan. Portman, who would later speak with Biden by phone, told his colleagues the entire process up to that point painted Biden\u2019s message of bipartisanship as a fa\u00e7ade. Sen. Susan Collins, who would serve as the leader of the 10 Republicans seeking talks with Biden told her colleagues she felt the same way. Collins and Biden had a close working relationship, one that played a role in her vote in favor of Obama\u2019s stimulus when Biden was vice president. But Collins, the people said, told her colleagues that interactions with White House staff up to that point led her to believe the White House was in a \u201ctake it or leave\u201d situation. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, echoed similar sentiments. While nobody took direct umbrage with Biden himself, frustration with his team was pervasive. A group of 10 Republican senators led by Collins, Murkowski and Portman grappled with how to proceed. In a deliberate effort to signal that they were serious about dealing with the pandemic, the group released a $618 billion counter proposal that made a point of matching to the dollar the White House\u2019s funding request for vaccine distribution and testing, $160 billion. The hope was to show good faith and open negotiations on other items. Instead, Republicans ran into what one senator told CNN was \u201ca total wall.\u201d \u201cWe went in thinking these were negotiations,\u201d a senior GOP aide told CNN. \u201cThey went in saying this is our proposal if you\u2019d like to join us.\u201d It\u2019s a reality Republicans say runs completely contrary to Biden\u2019s stated goal of bipartisanship. More than one GOP lawmaker has said publicly they believe the unwillingness to negotiate came more from Biden\u2019s advisers than Biden himself. To many Republican senators, that sentiment was bolstered by what happened on February 1 after a nearly two-hour Oval Office meeting with Biden and his top advisers. According to participants on both sides, the sit-down was overwhelmingly positive. After four years of dealing with President Donald Trump, to Republicans in the room, the meeting was a refreshing change. Even if he was a Democrat, Biden engaged on legislative details in a way that Trump rarely had. Collins and her Republican colleagues left optimistic they had created an opening to negotiate on a few items. \u201cI think it was an excellent meeting and we\u2019re very appreciative that as his first official meeting in the Oval Office, the President chose to spend so much time with us in a frank and very useful discussion,\u201d Collins told reporters just outside the West Wing. But a little more than an hour later, the White House released a statement sinking any hopes of significant Republican deal-making. The tone \u2013 firm, and line after line underscoring the view the White House wasn\u2019t budging \u2013 blindsided the Republicans who participated, multiple sources said. Republicans told their colleagues after the meeting the interactions with Biden made them believe he was open to tangible negotiations, with a willingness to listen, take notes, consult his own briefing book, and engage on each topic, sources told CNN. He didn\u2019t offer any concrete concessions, but he had made clear talks should continue \u2013 and that his staff would follow up with more detailed justifications for his plan. By 11 a.m. the next morning, White House officials sent memos to the GOP senators laying out some key justifications for their plan, most notably on direct payments and school funding. The memos, obtained by CNN, demonstrate no hint of malleability. Instead, they underscore just how far about apart both sides were. While Republicans were proposing $20 billion in K-12 school funding, the White House wasn\u2019t budging off its desire to spend more than six times that. In justifying its $130 billion request for schools, which includes money not just for the current school year, but the next one as well, the White House said it intended to give school districts \u201cfinancial certainty that they will not have to lay off teachers next fall in order to implement consistent COVID-19 safety protocols.\u201d Republican critics remain stunned by the amount of money the White House wants for schools, especially since so much of what\u2019s already been passed from earlier coronavirus relief packages remains unspent. Of the $67.5 billion in school funds that Congress has appropriated since last year, only $4.4 billion had been spent as of January 22, according to spending reports shared with lawmakers. White House officials say they believe that money, which has already been obligated, will be spent in the weeks ahead. \u201cThis isn\u2019t finished,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week of the pandemic. \u201cBut experts agree that remaining damage to our economy does not require another multi-trillion dollar non-targeted band-aid.\u201d Republicans didn\u2019t respond to the White House memo for more than two days \u2013 something Biden aides viewed caustically \u2013 and when they did, their letter outlined the same concerns about key elements of the proposal, and the data used to justify the White House numbers, raised in the Oval Office. It provided yet another window into talks that appeared to be going nowhere fast. By Thursday, February 4, Democrats in both chambers were on track to have the first key legislative step \u2013 passing budget resolutions \u2013 done before the weekend. That afternoon, the Washington Post published a column from Summers warning that the Biden plan was, in fact, too large for the moment and risked overheating the economy. White House aides were furious at Summers, particularly over his timing. The next day, Biden would give a major economic speech designed to lay out his rationale for the size, scale and speed of the package. The column created one of the first messaging headaches for the new administration. It also outraged the economic team because they viewed it, in the words of Biden CEA member Jared Bernstein as \u201cjust wrong.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t stimulus and for some reason Larry thinks it\u2019s stimulus,\u201d one source involved in the process, who pointedly noted Biden\u2019s teams had \u201cobviously\u201d considered the concerns outlined by Summers, told CNN. \u201cThis is a bridge and this is investment, one that will disburse in various stages over several quarters.\u201d Emboldened, that afternoon the Senate began a 15-hour marathon voting session, with all 50 Senate Democrats signing onto a budget resolution that would lay the groundwork for the eventual package. The final vote came before dawn the next morning, when Harris served as the tie breaker. A few moments later, at 5:35 am on February 5, newly-minted Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, standing on the Senate floor, affixed a microphone to his jacket lapel. It had been one month since Ossoff and Warnock, now US Senators, had made possible what they\u2019d just done. Schumer noted the anniversary. Then he underscored the moment. \u201cJust a month from that day, we have taken a giant step to begin to fulfill our promise.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Johnny Thornton stood on his sprawling catfish farm, once a symbol of empowerment in this majority Black county, and explained how the local election board once tried to strip him of his right to vote. In 2015, after a failed attempt to shutter almost every polling location in a county three times the area of Atlanta, the Hancock County Board of Elections and Registration tried to remove 174 voters, almost all of them African American, ahead of a Sparta city election. The board even sent deputies to homes, summonsing voters to prove eligibility. The city\u2019s roll at the time included only 988 voters, so it meant about one in five potential ballots. The majority-White board ultimately clipped 53 residents from the rolls. Had Thornton and others not fought back, suing the BOER in federal court \u2013 which in 2016 restored most voters to the rolls \u2013 many county residents could have been disenfranchised, he said last month. \u201cA lot of the individuals that they were targeting, they either worked out of town or did not have the means or resources to push back,\u201d said Thornton, a retired special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration. \u201cVoter suppression through administrative chaos is my term for it.\u201d With Georgia voters set to decide control of the US Senate in Tuesday\u2019s runoffs, the challenges to the voting rolls in Hancock County, whose residents have long fought for their right to vote, remain under the supervision of a court-appointed examiner. Legal experts say the US Supreme Court pulling teeth from the Voting Rights Act is to blame. The high court\u2019s 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder effectively ended a provision that, in jurisdictions such as Hancock County, would have required preclearance for any voting changes. Since the ruling, lawyers have filed lawsuits alleging voter suppression from Alabama to Alaska. Georgia has been a particularly active battleground, but some experts say Hancock County, a reliably Democratic enclave of about 8,500 people situated between Atlanta and Augusta, is one of the most troubling examples they\u2019ve seen. Thornton has means \u2013 a rarity in a county where per capita income is $16,704, less than half the national average. He could afford a lawyer and federal court fees, whereas many other Black residents could not. With 71% of its residents African American, Hancock is one of the Blackest counties not just in Georgia but in the nation. The percentage is even higher in Sparta, its county seat and only incorporated area. The lawsuit highlighted disparities among the Black and White populations in 2015: Black households had a median income of $22,056 ($37,083 for White); almost 34% of Black residents lived in poverty (22% for White); and 26% of Black households received food benefits (6% for White). Ahead of the 2015 Sparta elections, the lawsuit said, BOER Vice Chairwoman Nancy Stephens, who is White, began filing voter challenges as a citizen, then voting on them as a board member. When concerns were raised, a local resident began filing challenges \u201cin a format that closely resembled the format of those filed by the Vice Chair,\u201d the lawsuit said. The challengers \u201cconsistently failed to provide credible evidence based upon personal knowledge that the challenged voters were not qualified to vote,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cThe BOER frequently accepted hearsay, speculation, and unsubstantiated rumors provided by unnamed witnesses and anonymous individuals as sufficient evidence to remove registered Black voters.\u201d Stephens, who is no longer vice chair but remains a BOER member, referred questions to county attorney Andrea Grant, who did not return a phone call to discuss past and present concerns residents expressed. The BOER, responding to the lawsuit, \u201cvigorously\u201d and \u201cstrenuously\u201d denied illegally targeting Black voters or violating state laws. Thornton can\u2019t understand why the BOER would claim he didn\u2019t live in the county, or why the board would try to remove him from the rolls. His catfish farm is in unincorporated Mayfield, 20 minutes outside Sparta, and he wasn\u2019t eligible to vote in the city elections. What\u2019s more, he receives bills at his catfish farm, which is the address on his driver\u2019s license. He also served as county NAACP treasurer and on the Sparta Housing Authority. He owns property outside the county but spends most of his time at the catfish farm, hunting and doing maintenance. His attorney informed the elections supervisor that he could not appear before the board and would be out of town for several weeks, he said. The board removed him anyway, according to the lawsuit. Word moves quickly in Hancock County, especially when deputies are delivering summonses. Larry Webb heard the BOER was removing Black voters from the rolls and began attending meetings. \u201cSitting after two of the meetings, I thought, \u2018What would they do if someone challenged some White voters?\u2019\u201d recalled Webb, who is Black. He went through the 2014 voting roll and pulled voters he knew were dead or had moved and submitted 14 challenges. Emails included in the lawsuit revealed BOER members didn\u2019t take Webb\u2019s challenges seriously and defended White voters. According to the lawsuit, Chairwoman Kathy Ransom wrote of Webb\u2019s challenges, \u201cJust a guess\u2026he\u2019s targeting folks that are \u2018white\u2019 :)\u201d Webb asked for deputies to serve summonses to the residents he challenged, but he was told the sheriff\u2019s department was now charging $50 each, he said. When Webb\u2019s 14 challenges finally went before the board, Ransom told the White resident who had been challenging Black voters that deputies would no longer serve his summonses as a \u201ccourtesy,\u201d as they had in the past, the lawsuit said. The BOER determined before the hearing that four of Webb\u2019s challenged voters were dead and removed them from the rolls. Of the remaining challenges, the board nixed one voter from the rolls and moved another to inactive status. Both were Asian American, the lawsuit said. \u201cWhat they did was beyond voter suppression. If something is wrong with your voter registration, they should call you and tell you what\u2019s wrong. What they were doing is taking you off the rolls, and you wouldn\u2019t find out until the election,\u201d Webb told CNN. \u201cThey were making Black votes disappear.\u201d In Shelby County v. Holder, the US Supreme Court ruled that the \u201ccoverage formula\u201d dictating which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was unconstitutional. The formula, the court said in its 5-4 ruling, was \u201cbased on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day.\u201d Since the death of the Georgia civil rights icon US Rep. John Lewis, politicians and activists have called for Congress to honor Lewis by crafting an updated coverage formula, as permitted by the high court, but it hasn\u2019t come to pass. Without the formula, which forced jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, most of them Southern, to prove proposed changes to voting laws did not discriminate against minorities, many jurisdictions undertook changes to their elections procedures that voting rights experts say have a disproportionate impact on minorities. Julie Houk with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who worked on the Hancock County case, disagrees with the Supreme Court\u2019s finding \u201cthat the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.\u201d Why then did jurisdictions across the South and beyond immediately take actions that would have otherwise required preclearance under the previous iteration of the Voting Rights Act? Texas and North Carolina moved to stiffen voter ID laws, which already hampered Black and Latino voters, Houk said. The Lawyers\u2019 Committee has also challenged restrictive absentee ballot rules and fought voter purges, redistricting decisions and efforts to limit ballot drop boxes \u2013 which tend to burden minorities the most. In Macon-Bibb County, Georgia, Houk said, elections officials moved a Black voting precinct \u2013 in a community that had rocky relations with law enforcement \u2013 to the sheriff\u2019s office, which she called \u201cvery problematic\u201d as it threatened to dissuade African Americans from voting. The Lawyer\u2019s Committee got the precinct moved, she said. Georgia has been especially problematic, said Helen Butler, executive director of the Atlanta-based Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, whose team worked on the Hancock County case, as well as a handful in other Georgia counties. In 2015, Georgia\u2019s then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp cited Shelby in informing counties they were \u201cno longer required to submit polling place changes to the Department of Justice.\u201d Numerous groups have reported added hardships on Georgia\u2019s minority voters since the US Supreme Court decision. American Public Media reporters found in 2019 that tens of thousands of voters state officials said had likely died or moved away had, in fact, not. The ACLU of Georgia reported in September that of 313,243 voters removed from the state rolls in 2019, almost 200,000 were likely erroneously purged. While the secretary of state said it was routine maintenance, removing voters it had classified as inactive, Andrea Young, state ACLU executive director, countered that the state\u2019s method of maintenance was \u201cprone to tremendous error.\u201d Two weeks before the November general election, ProPublica, in collaboration with public broadcasters, reported, \u201cThe state\u2019s voter rolls have grown by nearly 2 million since the US Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, but polling locations have been cut by almost 10%, with Metro Atlanta hit particularly hard.\u201d The outlets published their report under the point-blank headline, \u201cWhy do nonwhite Georgia voters have to wait in line for hours? Their numbers have soared, and their polling places have dwindled.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying they intentionally discriminated,\u201d Butler told CNN, \u201cbut it had a discriminatory effect.\u201d Even with all the battles unfolding in Georgia and across the nation, Hancock County stands out, experts say. Houk\u2019s colleague at the Lawyers\u2019 Committee, John Powers, who previously reviewed preclearance submissions for the US Justice Department, told a webzine in 2016 the Hancock County case was \u201cthe worst case of voter suppression that I have ever seen.\u201d \u201cHancock County is just one example and probably one of the worst examples of how Shelby County is impacting individual voters,\u201d Houk said. \u201cThis type of change in process would\u2019ve been governed by preclearance. It would\u2019ve stopped this whole process. \u2026 This is why preclearance was so important: Discriminating against Black voters would\u2019ve been rejected.\u201d While the county voluntarily entered into a consent decree, agreeing to the appointment of an examiner to oversee any changes to its voting rolls, Sparta Mayor Allen Haywood insists the agreement was unnecessary. There was no racist intent in the board\u2019s work, he said. The truth about 2015 \u201cdepends on what side you talk to,\u201d he said. No candidate could win in the city, now estimated at 89% African American, without securing a swath of the Black vote, said Haywood, who is White and is certain he was elected on his promise of reform, he said. \u201cThe board of elections was just trying to clean the rolls,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a racial problem except for those who want to keep it that way. People just want to see a change here. They knew that if I got in, I was going to make things transparent.\u201d He won the 2015 Sparta mayoral election but stepped down after news surfaced he had a 1982 felony gambling conviction in Alabama. He was betting on football games across state lines, he told CNN, and wasn\u2019t aware the conviction rendered him ineligible to seek office. He had his record expunged and two years later won a City Council seat, serving as mayor pro tempore before ascending to the mayor\u2019s office in 2019 \u201cwith less than 80 White votes cast,\u201d he said. Haywood inherited numerous problems, including a seven-figure tax-and-utility bill, the paying down of which has been a priority of his administration. He also hopes to lure investment back to the county and is considering a historic tourism initiative, but myriad problems persist, as evidenced by the dilapidated downtown. Largely built before 1930, many stores lay not just empty but in disarray. A colorful butterfly mural on one corner proclaims, \u201cThis is Sparta,\u201d while another mural honors Methodist bishops Lucius Holsey, an emancipated slave, and George Pierce, who owned Holsey\u2019s would-be wife before mentoring Holsey and assigning him to his first church. Cast-iron storefronts and other architectural relics reminisce the charm Sparta exuded in its heyday, as local businesses post signs encouraging residents to spend money locally and embrace the historic preservation of downtown, an entry on the National Register of Historic Places. \u201cWe are way past problems with Black and White here,\u201d Haywood said. \u201cNow, people are excited things are getting fixed.\u201d Once fat on cotton and timber, Hancock was one of the richest counties in the state. It had a progressive reputation. Black residents, who have long been the majority, could own land and aspire, according to the book, \u201cBlack Boss: Political Revolution in a Georgia County.\u201d After cotton crumbled, Hancock was destitute, the book explains. Before the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it had no Black elected officials until John McCown \u2013 an activist more in the mold of Stokely Carmichael than Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 came to town, luring investment and ushering Black residents to power. By 1968, Hancock was the first US county since Reconstruction \u201cto come under Black political control, in large part because of the charismatic leadership of McCown,\u201d who became county commissioner, the book says. By the mid-1970s, African Americans held almost every elected office. McCown remains revered among many Black residents, despite investigations into his alleged misspending of grant money and other improprieties. They consider his achievements landmarks, including an affordable housing project and job creators like a cinder block factory and Thornton\u2019s now-defunct catfish farm. McCown\u2019s antebellum home still stands, abandoned and in need of upkeep. McCown\u2019s efforts weren\u2019t always well received by White folks, many residents also recall, and when tensions flared over desegregation in 1971, the city and McCown\u2019s \u201chunting club\u201d went on machine gun-buying sprees that required the intervention of Gov. Jimmy Carter and the US Justice Department, UPI reported. A 1976 plane crash killed McCown, and a federal investigation into his fundraising killed the county\u2019s resurrected prosperity, but his legacy survived in the Black leaders succeeding him. \u201cHe created a political strategy, and African Americans voted themselves into power,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cIt has come to a point where (Hancock County) is one of the most impoverished in America. There is a wives\u2019 tale \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not \u2013 that some political leaders in Georgia have always said that if we can\u2019t vote the people of Hancock County out, we\u2019ll starve them out \u2013 and there\u2019s been a disproportionate lack of growth to this particular community.\u201d The BOER \u201cstrenuously denied\u201d that it was illegally targeting Black voters with its challenges but agreed to enter the consent decree and abide by the standards and procedures the decree lays out. The court also ordered the defendants to pay more than $500,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses, court documents show. As part of the consent decree, the BOER agreed to \u201cnot engage in discriminatory challenges to voters\u2019 eligibility,\u201d and to adhere to certain procedures in such challenges, according to court documents. It also restored certain voters to its rolls and agreed not to take action on other voters restored to the rolls for at least two federal election cycles. The decree also outlined the appointment of an examiner, \u201cwho will review the BOER\u2019s actions regarding list maintenance and voter challenges based on residency\u201d and make recommendations on how to comply with state law and the consent decree, a court order says. \u201cIf the BOER disagrees with or does not follow the recommendations any party may bring that issue to the Court\u2019s attention,\u201d the decree says. Atlanta attorney R. Gary Spencer was named examiner in June 2018. His term will run to December 2021. The consent decree will not expire until early 2023. Butler considers the consent decree a victory preserving the legacy of Black empowerment in Hancock County, but it did not come without some casualties, she said. \u201cIt had a chilling effect on voters,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of folks decided voting wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d Despite the voting rolls growing by a few dozen electors since 2012, she laments that many voters were intimidated by the deputies and the summonses. They still haven\u2019t returned to the polls. Several residents \u2013 including Thornton, Webb and former Sparta registrar Marion Warren \u2013 each know multiple voters who never voted again after the deputies came to their homes, they say. \u201cIt will affect several elections down the road because people will say that I\u2019m not going to be bothered by this ever again. I\u2019m not going to vote,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou have virtually destroyed their whole trust in the system altogether.\u201d Aside from Stephens, Robert Ingram, who is Black and now chairs the board, is the only remaining member of the 2015 BOER. He did not return a message from a CNN reporter seeking to discuss present-day ramifications to the 2015 challenges. The federal lawsuit cites a half dozen Black voters he defended during the challenges. Hancock County has been \u201csort of noneventful\u201d since Spencer was appointed examiner, he said. The county has submitted voters it wants removed, as instructed, and during the November election, the NAACP \u201cseemed to think everything went OK,\u201d he said. Spencer\u2019s team is \u201calways concerned,\u201d he said, and events happening at the state and national level, including Georgia\u2019s secretary of state calling to end no-excuse absentee voting and President Donald Trump challenging elections results, only exacerbate his worry. At this point, however, he has seen nothing in Hancock County that would spur him to request an extension to his term or the consent decree, but before making any final decision, \u201cI would certainly check on it just to do some due diligence.\u201d Thornton and others remain worried. The county is \u201cplaying with house money,\u201d he said. Where Thornton shelled out his own earnings to defend his right to vote, the county used his tax dollars to fight him. Again, he emphasized, most Hancock County residents don\u2019t have his resources. \u201cI am definitely worried that once the consent decree ends that the BOER will start its same antics again,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ll get everybody except Johnny Thornton, and the other people that we go for might not have the legal means or expertise to push back or to fight against the system.\u2019\u201d Warren, in addition to previously serving as Sparta\u2019s registrar, is a Black county resident who began filming BOER meetings in 2015 when he learned of the challenges. He had trouble last year, he said, when applying for a mail-in ballot. A county elections official told him his home wasn\u2019t his registered address, he said. He isn\u2019t alleging any misbehavior \u2013 he was able to sort it out before the general election \u2013 but such a county notice might have been enough to deter a less-resolute voter from casting her or his ballot. In poor, rural areas like Hancock County, minor hiccups such as a rainy day or a washed-out road can have major effects on voting. Because there is so little work in the county, people work multiple jobs or leave the county for employment, making it difficult to find time to vote, he said. Residents can struggle with transportation in a county it takes almost an hour to traverse end to end. There are literacy and education issues at play as well, he said. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is find an obstacle that you can put between them and the polling place. It don\u2019t matter what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we are as a race, we are very critical of the voting process in the first place.\u201d",

The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. In a devastating development in Haiti\u2019s constitutional standoff, a group of gunmen allegedly posing as agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency forcibly entered President Jovenel Mo\u00efse\u2019s private residence and assassinated him in the early hours of Wednesday. The macabre act will prolong the uncertainty as Haiti tries to avert pandemonium. A history of political upheaval, dictatorship and weak institutions, as well as endemic corruption have wracked Haiti for decades and stymied the consolidation of democratic rule and good governance. The country was already on edge following a protracted political crisis centered around the constitutionality of Mo\u00efse\u2019s presidential term and a controversial proposal to overhaul the country\u2019s constitution. While Mo\u00efse won the first round of Haiti\u2019s presidential election in November 2015, the runoff was postponed in the wake of fraud allegations. The country eventually scrapped the results and scheduled new elections for November 2016; Moise won outright with a clear majority of 56%. Meanwhile, an interim president, Jocelerme Privert, served from February 2016 to February 2017. In Haiti\u2019s polarized political climate, the political opposition has claimed that Mo\u00efse\u2019s presidential term started in February 2016, rather than February 2017 \u2013 when he actually took the oath of office following do-over elections \u2013 and that his five-year mandate thus ended in February of this year. The United States, the United Nations and the Organization of American States supported Mo\u00efse\u2019s interpretation, but public anger and social unrest continued to destabilize the country. Mo\u00efse did not do much to appease the population, ruling by decree since January 2020 after the mandate of the old parliament expired without an election to replace its members. Now, the dispute over the constitutionality of Mo\u00efse\u2019s term has taken a criminal turn and the question of succession could engender another constitutional crisis. Prime Minister Claude Joseph is currently exercising executive power until new presidential elections can be organized. However, last week Mo\u00efse appointed a new prime minister, Ariel Henry, who has yet to be sworn in. Another potential contender for the job, according to the Haitian constitution, would be the head of the Supreme Court of Justice, but that person, Ren\u00e9 Sylvestre, died of Covid-19 last month and has yet to be replaced. Haiti President Jovenel Moise assassinated in attack on his residence The lack of a functional parliament makes it unclear who has the authority to approve replacements and confirm officials in the line of succession. For now, the Haitian Armed Forces and National Police have deployed to the streets to maintain control after declaring a state of siege. Meanwhile, grinding poverty characterizes quotidian life in Haiti. In essence, the country is still recovering from a spate of natural disasters, including the scars of a catastrophic 7.0 magnitude earthquake in 2010 estimated to have killed between 220,000-300,000 people. With more than 60% of the population living on less than $2 per day, Haiti often ranks as the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. According to the World Health Organization, Haiti \u2013 which has experienced difficulties getting vaccine supplies \u2013 is one of a handful of nations that has not begun vaccination yet even as Covid-19 cases increase. Recent years have also witnessed an epidemic of kidnappings and the explosion of gang violence, with many neighborhoods in the capital, Port-au-Prince, controlled by criminal organizations. Thousands of displaced people have sought refuge from the growing insecurity in a stadium on the southern edge of the capital. The Haiti assassination is yet another incident in a series of political, social and economic crises that have festered throughout the Western Hemisphere. The situation is emblematic of a larger democratic regression afflicting many countries \u2013 including Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela \u2013 where, in lieu of negotiations and political compromise, taking political prisoners and even conducting political assassinations have become worryingly commonplace. Joe Biden faces a key decision on Venezuela Haiti\u2019s constitutional crisis has failed to register with many Washington policymakers as well as those in the international community for far too long \u2013 in part, thanks to the plethora of challenges already present in the Western Hemisphere. Notwithstanding the Biden administration\u2019s claims to the contrary, the inattention of US policymakers in recent years has contributed to the country\u2019s rapid unraveling. While four people suspected of assassinating Mo\u00efse were shot dead by police and two others arrested Wednesday night, this may well be only the first phase in another one of Haiti\u2019s seemingly interminable crises. The short-term emphasis for the US and the rest of the world should be on supporting Haiti\u2019s political leadership, untangling the constitutional questions likely to arise and maintaining order while ensuring that the Haitian armed forces remain confined to their proper constitutional role. The international community, and in particular the US, should push for an investigation into the assassination and make resources available for bringing the perpetrators to justice \u2013 lest they benefit from the impunity that is all too common in Haiti. In the long-term, the international community has a key role to play in encouraging political and institutional reforms that will advance a national dialogue, generate economic opportunities for all and bring greater stability to Haiti\u2019s turbulent domestic politics.  Mo\u00efse\u2019s assassination is a tragic reminder of the country\u2019s unraveling democracy and the need to forge a solution to the escalating turmoil that puts Haiti\u2019s constitutional order and the well-being of its people at its center.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. More than half of the adults in the United States have been at least partially vaccinated against Covid-19, a remarkable accomplishment. As it has matured, the US vaccine program has revealed geographic and demographic groups that show either high or low acceptance of the vaccine, leading to a small avalanche of speculation regarding the divergent trends. Much of the difference is being explained (complete with strong correlation coefficients) by the apparent concordance across the existing Democrat and Republican fault-line, with the ardently Republican Deep South having some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country: Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana are at the bottom of the 50 states with rates around 35-37% (compared to US rate of 54%) with Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas joining them in the bottom 10. Further supporting this idea is the US map, which shows higher vaccination rates in states that supported President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. In addition, many surveys show Democrats have been vaccinated at significantly higher rates than Republicans. But is being a vaccine refusenik really a symbolic act, a new way of pledging allegiance to extremely conservative principles or even fealty to former President Donald J. Trump \u2013 who has claimed himself to be the father of the vaccine and, as a vaccine recipient himself, has endorsed its use, however tepidly. If only it were so simple. Though the Covid-19 vaccine is indeed a central player in our ongoing turbocharged political proxy war, many other factors are at play. Political orientation is a symptom, not the cause of the problem. The voting blocs just don\u2019t align that well with the vaccine refusers. Deeper in the demographics of vaccine accepters or decliners are many facts that fly in the face of the Blue-Red supposition. Our social lives also need a shot in the arm Take the elderly, the 65 and up crowd: 87% are at least partially vaccinated, even though they more evenly split during the 2020 election. Conversely, the younger voters went heavily for Biden but a significant percentage of adults 49 and younger are vaccine averse, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation. And Black and Hispanic voters also tended to support Biden yet are less eager to be vaccinated than Whites, albeit by just a few percentage points. Besides, if refusing were simply a political statement, the efforts of True Trumpers, such as Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, to strongly encourage vaccination would have had a larger impact. Even his ad with Alabama sports legends Coach Nick Saban and basketballer Charles Barkley to further encourage vaccination have thus far failed to move Alabama from the bottom of the heap. The converse \u2013 leaders who sing the \u201cNo vaccine? No problem!\u201d refrain, such as Governors Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas \u2013 surely provide assurance to decliners but also may act to move the \u201cstill thinking about it\u201d crowd toward flat-out avoidance. Covid-19 vaccine ennui is part of a much larger pattern that was evident long before 2015, when Trump descended the escalator in Trump Tower to announce his candidacy for president. But if not politics, what is driving the North-South split? Opinion: The Olympics can be held safely even amid the pandemic It\u2019s complicated \u2013 perhaps impossibly complicated. But an explanation may well have started many decades ago in Appalachia, which stretches across 13 states down to Alabama and Mississippi. People living there, along with the remainder of the Deep South, have had the worst rates of almost every health indicator for decades: low rates of influenza vaccination, high rates of obesity and diabetes, high rates of cigarette smoking and shorter lifespans. Grinding poverty also is at very high rates in the area and with it, poor schools, understaffed hospitals, distant medical care \u2013 and often an extremely pessimistic view of whatever the government is \u201cselling\u201d this week. Trust in others is lowest among persons earning less than $30,000 a year \u2013 a group seen in highest proportion in these same states. And this personal distrust could extend to elected officials and the government. The remedy therefore isn\u2019t a public service announcement by Tuberville or even Trump himself. These will surely change a few minds or move a few from the wait-and-see crowd to the vaccinated crowd. But TV ads and celebrities simply cannot overcome decades of deeply rooted distrust. To some, the Covid-19 vaccines are the greatest invention by mankind of this century \u2013 but to others, it\u2019s just more government hype, another promise certain to go nowhere, nothing but \u201cgovernment manipulation.\u201d The explanation for the chronic poor health of people in these states \u2013 shorter lifespan, high rates of smoking and obesity etc. \u2013 is not that they voted for Trump. The handy trope that politics is the answer to anything and everything makes a great story but misses the point entirely. Politics simply cannot explain the facts about health outcomes in these states. No one wants to die, not even ardent Trump lovers or equally ardent Trump haters. Unfortunately, rebuilding public trust in any institution is a very slow, arduous proposition. But continuing to show the safety and the benefit of the Covid-19 vaccines \u2013 using real facts \u2013 might prove to be a productive first step.  The Covid-19 pandemic dramatically revealed the inequitable delivery of American health care. Now, the Covid-19 vaccine rollout is demonstrating another open secret: public distrust in all institutions, including health care. Without sincere and sustained attention to the chronic poverty, lousy education and spotty health care in these areas, we will only see this story play again and again. OK, maybe Tommy Tuberville can help with Covid-19, but the next crisis, whatever it is, that relies on mutual trust to overcome will find itself recapitulating the same split between the haves and the have-nots \u2013 regardless of who people voted for.",

He delivered words of comfort at Andrew Brown, Jr.\u2019s funeral. Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove directs the School for Conversion, an education center in Durham, North Carolina. The opinions expressed here are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN. The morning after Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder for choking the life out of George Floyd, a SWAT-like unit of sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived in full tactical gear to serve a warrant for Andrew Brown Jr. at his home in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, Within seconds, Brown was shot in the back of the head while apparently trying to flee in his car. A week and a half ago, a North Carolina judge issued an order to allow Brown\u2019s immediate family to see about 20 minutes out of two hours of body camera videos of his fatal encounter. After watching a dash cam video and five body camera angles with audio Tuesday, Chance Lynch, an attorney representing the family, said that the killing was \u201cabsolutely, unequivocally unjustified.\u201d (CNN reported that Pasquotank County Chief Deputy Daniel Fogg said the video showed officers trying to serve the arrest warrant, as well as officers\u2019 attempts to provide Brown medical care after the shooting. The district attorney said officers fired when the car Brown was driving moved toward them.) While Floyd\u2019s murder forced Americans to ask whether an officer of the law can be held accountable for abusing his power, Andrew Brown\u2019s blood cries out from the ground of Eastern North Carolina with a deeper question. What potential threat necessitated this military-style assault on Mr. Brown and his community? When advocates of \u201claw and order\u201d encourage their fellow citizens to \u201cback the blue\u201d without question, what order are they asking us to defend by any means necessary? Elizabeth City sits on the northern shore of the Albemarle Sound, just south of the James River, where the first recorded enslaved Africans arrived in 1619. The rich soil, which stretches between these two bodies of water, is the delta where America\u2019s plantation economy was first established. Here Black bodies were claimed as human property by people of European descent who imagined that their Whiteness conferred a divine right to own other people and the land beneath their feet. The unequal order of this system could not be maintained by the power of plantation owners alone. Establishing slave patrols in the 18th century, the founding fathers of the plantation order invited local Whites to take a personal oath \u201cas Searcher for Guns, Swords, and other Weapons among the Slaves in my District. More than three centuries after slave patrols began in colonial North Carolina, law enforcement has evolved into professional and integrated county sheriff and city police departments. The women and men who serve their communities in local law enforcement today do not pledge to uphold the plantation system. But the inequalities that were established by the plantation system persist as the normal order of life. Twenty percent or more of the population in many counties in Eastern North Carolina are poor, despite North Carolina having, in 2018, the 11th largest economy by GDP in the US. While poverty disproportionally affects African Americans nationally, the majority of poor people in North Carolina are White. Delaying the release of police bodycam footage of Andrew Brown Jr.'s death sounds like an excuse Though they are no longer asked to serve on slave patrols, their political representatives, who are also overwhelmingly White, do ask them to support \u201claw and order;\u201d too often this effectively pits poor White people against poor Black people by suggesting that Black criminality is the problem in their communities. Where local White people once flew the Confederate flag to demonstrate their allegiance to an unequal order, today they also often fly the banner of the \u201cthin blue line.\u201d Black people in Eastern North Carolina understand that any disruption of the local social order renders them suspect in the eyes of many White authorities. Since 2014, five Black men from Eastern North Carolina have been exonerated of murder charges falsely pinned on them by local law enforcement.  The men \u2013 Dontae Sharpe, Charles Ray Finch, Henry McCollum, Leon Brown and Joseph Sledge \u2013 know too well how Black men become scapegoats when tragedy disrupts the order of communities in Eastern North Carolina. But Black people have not only been falsely accused in cases of violent disruption. As Zoe Chace documents in her recent podcast \u201cThe Improvement Association,\u201d the 2010 election of the first Black sheriff in Bladen County, North Carolina, elicited from White Republicans immediate charges of \u201celection fraud\u201d against a local Black political action committee.  Though no evidence of these charges was ever produced, the accusations fueled a Republican-backed voter suppression bill in the North Carolina\u2019s statehouse. Because the bill was passed after the Supreme Court\u2019s Shelby County v. Holder decision, which invalidated the Voting Rights Act\u2019s pre-clearance requirements for voting law changes, the impact of the law on Eastern North Carolina counties like Elizabeth City\u2019s Pasquotank was not subject to review by the Justice Department. After four years, the Supreme Court let stand a lower court\u2019s ruling, which noted that the law had targeted African Americans with \u201calmost surgical precision.\u201d False accusations of Black voter fraud in Eastern North Carolina were used to justify the disenfranchisement of Black people across the state for two election cycles. Witness describes scene of fatal shooting of Andrew Brown Jr. This is the state of order that Black and White people are challenging in Elizabeth City when we demand the public release of body camera footage that shows what happened when local law enforcement stormed a Black neighborhood to execute an arrest warrant while wielding assault rifles. We do not know all of the details of how Mr. Brown responded in the moment when officers confronted him outside his home. But we do know that this law enforcement action and the district attorney\u2019s subsequent unwillingness to \u2013 publicly and with dispatch \u2013 show what happened fits within a long history of White authorities in Eastern North Carolina treating Black people and the Black community as a threat. We must see all the video and hold any officers who may have abused their power accountable. But justice demands more than that. The Justice Department must also conduct a pattern-and-practice review of law enforcement in Pasquotank County. Congress must pass legislation to ensure prosecution, imprisonment and financial responsibility for law enforcement when they kill Black people while using the law to prop up an unequal social order in which too many people do not have what they need to survive. As Black and White sons of North Carolina, we join the community in Elizabeth City that is challenging this unequal system because we know it does not benefit most of us. We are not anti-law enforcement, but we refuse to allow the mantra of \u201claw and order\u201d to obscure the way Black people and communities have been scapegoated by those who want to hold onto power in an economic and political system where many are struggling to survive.  Our demand for transparency is a statement of faith that a new order is possible where each person is equal under the law and the benefits of our common life are accessible to every citizen. As we work for justice in this case, we also pledge to organize every community to elect representatives who will pass policies that lift poor and low-income people out of the inequality that the plantation system established. If George Floyd\u2019s murder helped Americans see that some officers who abuse their power can be held accountable, then Andrew Brown Jr.\u2019s death must reveal how the plantation system that denigrated Black lives set up systems that harm us all. Until we work together to change those systems, none of us can call ourselves free.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of the book, \u201cBurning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. There is something about Andrew Yang that makes him the candidate to beat in New York City\u2019s mayoral race. With less than two months to go before the Democratic primary on June 22, Yang continues to outpace his many rivals in a notoriously tough city. What is it about Yang that has made him such a powerful candidate in 2021? His frontrunner status was not a foregone conclusion. Yang entered this race with no experience in politics, other than his 2020 presidential bid. While his presidential campaign lasted longer than expected, having attracted a loyal group of supporters dubbed the \u201cYang Gang,\u201d he exited the race after the New Hampshire primary without winning any delegates. Yang, who had a brief stint in corporate law, has more substantial experience in business. He worked for a number of start-ups, headed an education company and in 2011, founded the non-profit organization Venture for America in an attempt to create jobs and bring high-tech work to cities that were suffering from the Great Recession. While the Obama administration listed him as one of the 500 \u201cChampions of Change\u201d and a \u201cPresidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship,\u201d Venture for America so far has failed to meet its own goal of creating 100,000 jobs by 2025. But this resume doesn\u2019t compare to the kind of experience in politics and public service most of the other Democratic candidates bring to the table. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams is a former captain in the New York Police Department. He served in the New York State Senate for almost seven years and has been in his current position since he was elected in 2013. Sean Donovan was the former commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and served under three presidents. Maya Wiley, a professor and former legal analyst for NBC and MSNBC, served as the chair of the city\u2019s Civilian Complaint Review Board. She was also counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio and worked in the civil division of the US Attorney Office for the Southern District of New York. The fight over history isn't really about the 1619 Project City Comptroller Scott Stringer, a former New York State assemblyman and Manhattan borough president, is now struggling to stay in the race after a woman who worked on his 2001 race for public advocate accused him of sexual assault (Stringer has denied the allegations, saying they had a consensual relationship). Kathryn Garcia, the former commissioner of the New York City Sanitation Department, has long been in the trenches of city politics. Diane Morales opened the Office of Youth Development and School-Community Services in the city\u2019s Department of Education and was the director of the Teaching Commission. Morales also brings impressive non-profit bona fides, having started and headed various organizations that have focused on children and young people through education, development services and initiatives to tackle poverty. Even the other outsider, Ray McGuire, can claim a much more successful record in the private sector as a top executive at Citigroup. But Yang has gained traction by pushing unconventional ideas like a universal basic income. His presidential bid centered around his proposal to offer $1,000 a month to everyone over 18 \u2014 a policy he has reworked and narrowed significantly to try to tackle extreme poverty in New York. He has also proposed the Big Apple Corps, an initiative in New York that would hire 10,000 aspiring college graduates to tutor 100,000 public school students. But the key to his appeal has to do with his being a charismatic outsider in a moment of genuine crisis for the city. Capitalizing on the name recognition he enjoys from his presidential bid, Yang is selling his personal story through Instagram and other social media platforms to connect with voters. From his upbringing as an Asian American in the suburbs of New York, where he was bullied as a child, to his passion for what the city can be even after being ravaged by Covid-19, his biographical-centered approach is working, at least for now. His social media posts are filled with him enjoying the life of the city, drinking boba tea, strolling through Coney Island and elbow bumping supporters. Don\u2019t tell Yang that this city has no heart, to paraphrase the Grateful Dead, because \u2014 he appears to be conveying \u2014 he can hear it beat out loud. Living in the world of pants-on-fire lies Some critics compare him to Donald Trump in 2016, given his outsider status and lack of experience. They see a candidate who thrives on incessant media coverage rather than substance. One can imagine a future debate in which an opponent might turn to him, borrow a line from Walter Mondale in the 1984 Democratic debates, and ask: \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d A better comparison might be the 1976 Democratic primaries when former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter defeated many formidable and experienced Democrats despite the common refrain, \u201cJimmy Who?\u201d Carter then beat President Gerald Ford in the general election. Historians agree that the heart of Carter\u2019s appeal was his outsider status. His campaign hammered away at the fact that Carter was a peanut farmer who worked far outside a Washington that seemed to have become corrupted after Vietnam and Watergate. In a nation that had become deeply distrustful of elected officials and desperate for a leader who could bring the nation into a better place, Carter was the perfect candidate for the times. He turned the experience of his opponents against them. They were part of the broken system; he could do better. Voters, Carter said, could trust him. His campaign spots revolved around his life and family, as he offered himself up as a fresh voice in a broken nation. \u201c1976. Across the land, a new beginning is underway, led by a man whose roots are founded in the American tradition,\u201d the narrator says in one campaign ad over photos of Carter and his family. To be sure, Yang is no Carter. The Georgian had a significant political record as governor and state senator plus his time as campaign chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Joe Biden is old. Here's why that's a good thing But his outsider status and biographical campaign resonate in a similar way to Yang\u2019s. Yang is a fresh voice in the world of politics. While Trump offered rage, Yang offers optimism and enthusiasm. He is part of a new generation of people who are working to break through in the world of elected politics \u2014 at every level \u2014 and he comes from a sector of the economy that many young New Yorkers see as the heart of our future growth. For many of his supporters, his relative youth and fresh perspective is an asset, not a liability.  His unyielding belief that this city can be even better than before is alluring to many residents. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. New York is a city still reeling from Covid-19. The streets are lined with boarded-up storefronts and empty office buildings. Public school children have barely been in the classroom in the last year and families are still trying to recover from severe illnesses and the deaths of their loved ones. Hospital workers have been through many traumatic months. The budget is in bad shape, the future is uncertain, and all the other chronic problems \u2014 including police brutality, unaffordable housing, budget shortfalls, economic inequality and more \u2014 loom large. It is also, however, a city filled with optimism, ready to live again. It remains unclear whether Yang has the legs or substance to make it to the finish line. It would be big mistake to underestimate the ability of his opponents to thrive in the final months of the campaign. New Yorkers will also be using rank choice voting \u2014 which only makes the race all the more unpredictable. Meanwhile, Yang\u2019s opponents like Eric Adams and Maya Wiley have received endorsements from major unions \u2014 like the Transport Workers Union Local 100, or Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union \u2014 that can deliver the vote in city elections.  But his opponents should be clear that Yang can win the Democratic nomination. A campaign that revolves around his regularly avowed passion and vision to make New York a center of the world again, a cool and exciting hub of culture and innovation, is what many residents are desperate for. And at a moment when so much of the political system seems to have failed us, there might be a sizable number of voters willing to take risk on someone who has a different point of view. Despite all the skeptics on the campaign trail in 1976, it was ultimately Jimmy Carter \u2014 not Frank Church or Birch Bayh or Gerald Ford \u2014 who was sworn into office. An earlier version of this article incorrectly mentioned Evan Bayh. His father Birch Bayh was a 1976 presidential candidate.",

            "article_content": "CNN Opinion contributors grade President Joe Biden\u2019s first speech before a joint session of Congress. Joe Biden took a pitch-perfect victory lap for reaching 200 million Covid vaccine doses administered in less than 100 days in office \u2013 more than twice the number he\u2019d originally promised \u2013 and going back to his campaign slogan of \u201cchoosing hope over fear, truth over lies, light over darkness.\u201d His sales job for the infrastructure plan was politically sharp, focused on items with broad support, like creating clean water systems, building a power grid and new roads and bridges \u2013 and aimed directly at independent and working-class votes that strayed from the Democratic Party in recent years. By emphasizing that 90% of the estimated jobs to be created won\u2019t require a college degree and rolling out the benefits of the American Family Plan, Biden was talking to voters who were part of Donald Trump\u2019s base. \u201cThese are good-paying jobs that can\u2019t be outsourced,\u201d he said, calling it a \u201cblue collar blueprint to build America\u201d and signaling that he aims to slow and reverse the flow of working-class voters out of the Democratic Party. Substantively strong, politically brilliant. Grade: A- Errol Louis is the host of \u201cInside City Hall,\u201d a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. It was a night of powerful visuals: Two women \u2014 the first and second in the line of succession \u2014 sat behind President Joe Biden, the first time in American history women have held both of those positions. Wide shots of the House chamber showed a thinly populated room because of the ongoing pandemic. And those same wide shots also served as a reminder of the armed standoff that took place there almost four months ago during the insurrection at the Capitol. But it wasn\u2019t just images that defined the night. Biden delivered a powerful argument: the era of big government is back. But big government with a Biden spin \u2014 he called the American Jobs Plan \u201ca blue-collar blueprint to build America,\u201d and called on Congress to raise taxes on corporations and top earners, in order to \u201creward work, not wealth.\u201d It was a far cry from the days when former President Bill Clinton stood in the same chamber contrasting work with welfare. These policy-heavy speeches are never particularly stirring, and Biden does better in more intimate settings. But in laying out a bold, progressive vision in clear terms, he set the tone, and the goalposts, for the next stage of his presidency.

Biden has been notably dishonest in his first 100 days, including in tonight\u2019s at times hyperbolic address. Biden did not inherit \u201cthe worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\u201d The unemployment rate was 6.3% in January, and the US had experienced growth for two straight quarters. In six of Barack Obama\u2019s eight years, the average unemployment rate was over 6%, and was about or over 9% in three of them! The truth is that vaccines are reviving the economy\u2014vaccines that Biden inherited from the Trump administration (Biden has made a number of wildly misleading vaccine claims). Biden gave away the progressive game when he said he would \u201cturn crisis into opportunity.\u201d His $1.9 trillion Covid bill spent excessively on liberal social programs, and Biden is doing it again in an infrastructure bill that spends just 5% of its $2.25 trillion on roads, bridges, waterways, ports, and airports. Name your crisis (Covid, climate, etc.) and Biden is prepared to ride it like a Kentucky Derby jockey towards a liberal finish line of exploding debt and higher taxes. I give Biden a D because \u201cthe words of a president matter,\u201d and he should be held to his own standard. His remarks on cancer research, which was heartfelt and means a great deal to so many Americans, saved him from an F tonight. Grade: D South Carolina Senator Tim Scott\u2019s rebuttal was magnificent. He\u2019s not the GOP flavor of the month for 2024, but he should be. Scott is one of the most compelling and unifying voices in the Republican Party today. Grade:  A+ for a speech in a historically tough slot.

He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY. It wasn\u2019t just the words. The images were just as powerful. Before President Joe Biden rose to the podium Wednesday night, we saw the striking presence of two women at the pinnacle of political power, preparing to welcome him; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the first woman speaker, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman vice president in the history of the United States. Then there was the pandemic strangeness of it all, empty seats, few guests, and protective masks obscuring the bottom half of every face. It was a presidential address to Congress like no other for so many reasons. Then came the words. And, once again, the striking contrast to the Former Guy. Unlike former President Donald Trump, Biden\u2019s speech was focused on the country, on achievements, on aspirations, not on an individual. There was no poison in Biden\u2019s words, no self-aggrandizement, no insults. The praise was for America and for Americans. And yet, when Biden listed the accomplishments of his first 99 days, the list was solid, impressive, proof that the country is in the hands of someone who \u2013 regardless of whether you agree with his goals \u2013 knows what he\u2019s doing. Biden\u2019s achievements, like reaching 200 million Covid vaccines administered before 100 days in office, expanding access to health care, making progress toward slashing child poverty, are already significant. His goals moving forward \u2014 including modernizing America\u2019s infrastructure, tackling climate change, promoting education, technology, and job creation, to name only a few \u2013   are enormous. His ambition is extraordinary. His laundry list of initiatives and plans is enough to fill many presidencies. Biden is right when he views this presidency not only as a vehicle for improving the lives of Americans, but for showing the world the superiority of democracy over autocracy. The images and the words were a reminder of how far we\u2019ve come, how awful things were, and how far we still have to go. Grade: B Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. President Joe Biden is at his best when he speaks directly to the American people, in plain language, from his heart. That\u2019s exactly what he did tonight. From the outset, he never made the moment about him. When Biden uttered the words \u201cMadam Vice President and Madam Speaker,\u201d he proudly acknowledged that history had been made and it was long overdue. Representation matters. It\u2019s refreshing to have a President who is not only competent but traffics in optimism, humility and resolve. These are qualities desperately needs at a time when Americans are clawing their way back from immense loss, despair and economic hardship brought on by a global pandemic and exacerbated by the incompetence and intransigence of the last administration. Biden ticked off his accomplishments on the vaccine rollout and Covid relief, laid out his policy vision on a wide range of issues and passionately reminded the American people why we cannot ignore the significance of the Capitol attack \u2013an assault on the democracywe must fight to preserve in the 21st century. Our enemies may be betting against us, but Biden made it clear he believes that\u2019s a bad bet. Consistent with his campaign theme of working across the aisle, the President rightfully challenged Republicans to join him in a meaningful bipartisan effort to engage on major policy issues facing American families. Though Biden extended the political olive branch, it remains to be seen if enough Republicans have the political will to accept it. Biden\u2019s speech may not have had the lofty, eloquent prose of notable presidential speeches of the past, but he certainly provided the right dose of hope to the American people, who can now feel the country is heading in the right direction. Grade: A- Tara Setmayer is a former GOP communications director and host of the \u201cHonestly Speaking with Tara\u201d podcast. Only twice before in history has an American president done what Joe Biden did tonight: issue a clarion call for a transformation of the nation\u2019s social safety net. Franklin Roosevelt was the first to envision a strong, impenetrable safety net that would protect citizens from cradle to grave. That was the essence of his first 100 days after his election in 1932. Inspired by Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson chose his first congressional speech as the forum for laying the groundwork for his Great Society programs after his 1964 election. But can Biden be as successful? He certainly gave one of his most effective speeches tonight.  For the first 40 minutes of his address, he laid out a menu of delights for the middle class that will surely be popular. His arguments for his plans were well crafted and deftly delivered. But there is one crucial difference between Biden and his predecessors, Roosevelt and Johnson: those two men began the fight with far more political strength in Congress. Roosevelt\u2019s Democrats held 59 of 96 Senate seats and 313 House of 432 House seats when he was first elected. And coming off a landslide election, Johnson commanded 68 Senate seats and 295 House seats. Biden, by contrast, holds congressional power by a thread. It is also a fair question whether the price tag for the President\u2019s plans \u2013 about $6 trillion in total \u2013 is so towering that public support will wane over time. For now, Biden holds the upper hand with the American people. Whether he can keep it may well determine whether he will join Roosevelt and Johnson in the Democratic pantheon. Grade: A David Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents of both parties and is a senior political analyst at CNN. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service at the Harvard Kennedy School and co-founded its Center for Public Leadership. Behold a thoughtful, calming President. Although President Joe Biden\u2019s Wednesday night speech was officially an address to a joint session of Congress, in reality it was his chance to pitch his agenda directly to the American people. And he did so with a measured tone befitting these challenging times. Biden laid out plans that may well reshape the federal government. Taxing corporations to pay for infrastructure upgrades and taxing the very wealthy to pay for expanded social programs? This is true populism. His proposals will likely resonate with Latinos, 74% of whom approve of his job performance, according to an April Pew Center survey. It was refreshing to hear a president speak about immigration in common-sense terms. \u201cLet\u2019s end our exhausting war on immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigrants have done so much for this country during the pandemic, as they have throughout our history.\u201d Biden expressed his confidence in Vice President Kamala Harris as she works with Central American governments to address the root causes of migration. And, as an example of bipartisan leadership, he invited those lawmakers who did not agree with his immigration proposals to at least pass legislation to help those young migrants brought here illegally as children stay in the United States \u2013 an idea with broad public support. The President kept his hyperbole to a minimum and focused on the positive. In substance, style and tone, Biden\u2019s speech was successful. Grade: A- In his rebuttal, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina attempted to defend the indefensible by praising the GOP\u2019s assault on voting rights in Georgia. \u201cAmerica is not a racist nation,\u201d he said, which was incredibly tone-deaf. He had to reach back to pre-pandemic times to cite positive economic statistics of Biden\u2019s predecessor. Sorry, Senator, painting Biden as divisive is a hard sell. In the end, Scott came across as inauthentic and deeply misguided. Grade: D Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes. It was no surprise to hear President Joe Biden talk about bipartisanship more than once in his first Presidential address to Congress, in the very place that saw a violent insurrection \u2013 a literal attempt to break us apart \u2013 just four months ago. Unlike other presidential candidates over the years, from both parties, Biden\u2019s focus on unity wasn\u2019t just a campaign gimmick or cheap talking point. In fact, it was something many in his own party took some umbrage with. Why would he want to reach across the aisle to a party that had shown so little interest in doing the same over the past four years? And could he unite a country that might prefer more tribalism? Even now, as Republicans have defended the attack on the Capitol, an attack designed to prevent him from taking office, and as they plot to impede his agenda and make him a one-term president, Biden is unwilling to give up on the idea that bipartisanship is possible. Politics is both prose and poetry. And while many moderates and conservatives like me will disagree with his policies, his commitment to unifying the country is a big reason why we gave him our vote. Grade: B+ SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator. President Joe Biden\u2019s first speech to Congress on Wednesday night was a big deal. When Biden was elected, a lot of people \u2013 particularly progressives \u2013 underestimated him. After Wednesday night, it became clear Biden isn\u2019t holding anything back. He recognizes this is a once-in-a-century opportunity to reset the American system, and he\u2019s not going to let this chance go to waste. The President is developing a positive kind of populism. He\u2019s trying to give us something we can come together for, and he\u2019s framing it in a way that\u2019s accessible for any American with a heartbeat. When Biden talked about vaccines, he didn\u2019t just talk about vaccines \u2013 he talked about how, because of the vaccine, cafeteria workers, bus drivers, teachers and kids can go back to school. He talked about how \u2013 because of the rescue checks \u2013 a single mother and her son dodged eviction. His argument about making America competitive is also powerful. Right now, China is building cities, while we struggle to build bridges. We need to upgrade our operating system, and Biden has a plan to get the job done. The President was selling big policy, but he delivered it in a way that felt personal. His grandfatherly, whispery voice made it feel like he was letting us all in on a secret plan. The fact that it wasn\u2019t a big, raucous crowd allowed the intimacy to really land. I\u2019m on board. Let\u2019s get to work. Grade: A Van Jones is a CNN host and founder of Dream Corps. The most unremarkable elements of President Joe Biden\u2019s address to Congress were paradoxically also among the most remarkable. After four years of political chaos, it was easy to forget how utterly normal an evening could be. And yet standing in front of a sparsely populated pop House chamber \u2013 a result of Covid restrictions \u2013 the President\u2019s speech seemed like many others that we have heard before, combining an invocation for the nation to live up to this historic moment and an outline of a policy agenda for the next year. To be sure, Biden\u2019s bold vision for government is quite a departure from the philosophy of former President Ronald Reagan, who stated in 1981, \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.\u201d His plan for expanding government spending on issues like childcare and education breaks from some of the political fears of being outflanked by conservatism that constrained former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama during their time in the White House. And, of course, the presence of two women \u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 sitting behind Biden was a historic breakthrough. But much of the process was the same. Biden\u2019s team released excerpts from the speech before the event. And when the President began his speech, he spoke in a steady and contained voice until the event came to an end. Indeed, Biden was just a president being a president. Although it will be impossible for Biden to cure the multiple problems that have rendered our politics so dysfunctional\u2014 polarized media, hyper partisanship, influence of big money in campaigns\u2014thus far he has been remarkably effective, as he promised in the campaign, at simply stabilizing the presidency as an institution. It is easy to discount the importance of this achievement. But after the January 6 insurrection, which Biden called the worst attack on democracy \u201csince the Civil War,\u201d some stability in the Oval Office is essential to moving forward. The parties will disagree over the substance of the message, but, nearly 100 days into his term, Biden has achieved a level of calm that seemed almost impossible just a few months ago.

As always, President Biden\u2019s delivery was the model of empathy and compassion. Talk of \u201chope over fear, light over darkness\u201d and \u201cno quit in America\u201d can certainly soften even the most hardened of hearts. The problem is that optimistic tone is overshadowed by the expensive policy price tag. The idea of offering a lot of things that most Americans won\u2019t have to pay for will no doubt be popular, yet this big, bold agenda \u2013 paid for by wealthy Americans \u2013 is a bridge too far. On substance, I agree with the President\u2019s call for protections for Dreamers, being tough on China and criminal justice reform. Yet the American Jobs Plan and American Rescue plan \u2013 together multi-trillion dollar plans \u2013 is nothing more than a progressive wish list on steroids.  The massive tax and spend agenda is big government run amok. Five words stood out: \u201cI will work with Congress.\u201d Well, he hasn\u2019t.  President Biden entered the White House on the promise of bipartisanship and unity, that has not happened.   It\u2019s time for President Biden to build bridges \u2013 literally and figuratively. Grade: A on style, D on substance In the GOP response, Sen. Tim Scott called Biden out for going it alone on major initiatives.   Scott made a compelling case for \u201ccommon sense and common ground.\u201d Grade: A Alice Stewart is a CNN political commentator, a resident fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Institute of Politics and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President. When President Joe Biden was born, in 1942 , Franklin Delano Roosevelt was President. America was just 77 years past our Civil War, and FDR\u2019s Sisyphean task was to pull the country together to overcome Depression and defeat fascism. Now, 76 years after FDR\u2019s death, President Biden seemed to be channeling the president of his birth.  Biden set out an ambitious agenda, from combating the pandemic, to creating American jobs, to equal pay for women, pledging to \u201cend cancer as we know it,\u201d and combating climate change. It was a symphony with a myriad of notes, yet it also had a strong theme: Optimism. \u201cAmerica is on the move again,\u201d he said in the speech\u2019s beginning.  The first Democratic president to attend a state university since LBJ, Biden spoke with us, not at us. He was specific but not wonky, and never condescending.  He stood at the most powerful podium on earth, and remained firmly grounded as Middle Class Joe. \u201cMeeting Franklin Roosevelt,\u201d Winston Churchill said, \u201cwas like opening your first bottle of champagne; knowing him was like drinking it.\u201d President Biden is a 1942 vintage Champagne, and yet he spoke with an effervescence and an exuberance that was truly intoxicating. Grade: A \u2014\u2013 Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) was a strong choice for the GOP response.  At a time when the GOP seems to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the white grievance-media-political complex, Scott set a different tone. He spoke poignantly of being the son of a single mom, connecting well with his audience. But while the tone was mode moderate, the content was the same old stuff we have heard from the GOP for generations: Democrats want to tax and spend.  The problem with that is Biden\u2019s actual plan taxes only the rich, and spends it on the middle class and the poor. Scott\u2019s argument is getting very little traction against Biden, as polls show a solid majority of Americans support Biden\u2019s agenda. Grade: A on style; D on substance. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. Joe Biden wants to be a normal president. His campaign was the most explicit call for a \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d since President Warren G. Harding coined the phrase after the 1918 flu pandemic. These are not normal times in America. Biden made his first address to a joint session of Congress three months and three weeks after a deadly insurrection at the US Capitol building aimed at stopping the certification of Biden\u2019s election victory in November. On Wednesday Biden spoke from the chamber where members of Congress had donned gas masks and prayed together on that tumultuous January day, cowering from a violent mob. He spoke to an audience that included Republicans who supported the attempt to overturn his own legitimate victory \u2014 and to a country rocked by a pandemic, hate crimes, police violence and multiple mass shootings. Biden does not really have the luxury of normalcy. His first address to Congress showed a clear understanding of the magnitude of the moment. He celebrated 220 million Covid vaccine shots in arms, and the fastest pace of economic growth in more than four decades. It\u2019s possible the enormous success of Biden\u2019s first 100 days will result in more lives and livelihoods saved than any previous administration. Within the first minute of his speech, Biden answered whether he would address the seditious elephant in the room: he called the insurrection \u201cthe worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\u201d Later, citing racial injustice, he said \u201cwhite supremacy is terrorism.\u201d The President said he welcomed conversations with anyone who thought their ideas were better. But in one of his most pointed and surprising moments, he told Republicans that the world was watching and doing nothing was not an option. Biden is an optimist, and we need that right now. But it\u2019s possible he has more of the cynicism this moment requires than he lets on. Grade: A You can do a lot in 100 days \u2013 learn how to cook a new dish; take a spin class; train a puppy. What you can\u2019t do is transform the country. And yet listening to President Joe Biden\u2019s speech tonight, that\u2019s exactly what he has set out  to do. Timing and tone: A. Biden struck just the right tone between hard realities and hope. Despite tough times, be made clear \u201cAmerica is on the move again.\u201d No less than four critical challenges \u2013 race, the economy, pandemic and political polarization \u2013  have left the door open to the possibility of real change. And Biden\u2019s initial success during his first 100 days has left him well-positioned to go big. His multi-trillion American Jobs Act and American Families Act promise a degree of social and economic transformation not seen since the 1960s. Historic: A. Not since Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s gave his \u201cLet Us Continue\u201d speech after John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination has the country seemed on the verge of such a major inflection point. With two female leaders seated behind him, addressing a Covid restricted chamber with no congressional guests and only one Supreme Court Justice, the speech was unprecedented. Impact: Incomplete. Biden is clearly risk-ready. But a president\u2019s words alone rarely persuade. The key to any success is whether Biden has the votes to keep moderates in his own party on board and perhaps gain some Republican support for a few more targeted packages on infrastructure and immigration. If not, hopes for transformation will remain just that.

This was a very Joe Biden speech. The President looked at home in the chamber, and I enjoyed watching him talk comfortably with Republicans on his way to and from the podium. Congress may be more polarized than ever before, but Joe is a good guy who can work across the aisle. He covered the key elements of his rescue, jobs, and families he is \u2013 someone who understands what the country needs. In fact, the best parts of Biden\u2019s speech were the lines meant for the audience at home, particularly working-class Americans families dealing with crumbling roads, rising health insurance premiums, aging grandparents, underfunded schools and college debt. Biden had two tasks tonight: (1) explain how all his proposals fit together and (2) demonstrate how they benefit the working class. As Biden said, he\u2019s pushing a \u201cblue-collar blueprint to build America.\u201d Grade: A- Patti Solis Doyle, a CNN commentator, was an assistant to the President and senior adviser to then-first lady Hillary Clinton, was chief of staff on Clinton\u2019s 2000 and 2006 Senate campaigns, and Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign manager in 2007 and early 2008.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael D\u2019Antonio is the author of the book \u201cNever Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\u201d and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the book \u201cHigh Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Remember all those scenes of the Capitol rioters giving police officers group hugs? How about those photos of the insurrectionists planting big kisses on their cheeks? No? Oh. Maybe that\u2019s because they are a figment of Donald Trump\u2019s imagination. When Trump called into Fox News on Thursday night and tried to rewrite history, he proved himself to be the same old liar we knew as president. Describing the events of January 6, which led to the deaths of five people, Trump said, \u201cIt was zero threat, right from the start, it was zero threat. Look, they went in, they shouldn\u2019t have done it. Some of them went in, and they are hugging and kissing the police and the guards, you know, they had great relationships.\u201d While one officer appeared to pose for a selfie with a rioter and others opened the barricades to allow the mob to enter the grounds of the US Capitol, many Capitol and DC Metro police officers also risked their lives and engaged in hand-to-hand combat trying to protect the lawmakers who were certifying the results of the 2020 election inside. During the melee, some officers were beaten and sprayed with chemicals. At least 138 sustained injuries including burns, concussions and rib fractures. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died from injuries sustained during the attack, and two others later died by suicide. The horrendous attacks were not about \u201cgreat relationships.\u201d But after years of deception, it\u2019s no big surprise that Trump is at it again. What\u2019s remarkable is just how effective his lies have been, especially when it comes to his insistence that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d due to widespread fraud. This is the very lie that prompted Trump supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6. And this lie is what Republicans in Georgia used to justify sweeping new voting restrictions signed into law on Thursday. Opinion: Trump's major problem in Georgia election probe Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who is up for reelection in 2022, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt there were many alarming issues with how the [2020] election was handled, and those problems, understandably, led to a crisis of confidence here in Georgia.\u201d But that statement is no more true than Trump\u2019s report of rioters kissing cops at the Capitol. The 2020 election ran smoothly in Georgia but for Donald Trump\u2019s repeated falsehoods about being cheated. He then proceeded to phone state officials, imploring them to \u201cfind 11,780\u201d votes so he could overcome Biden\u2019s margin of victory. Trump also used his bully pulpit to sow doubts about the election in many states by spreading falsehoods and baseless claims about voting machines made by a firm called Dominion Voting Systems. (The company has since filed defamation lawsuits against Fox News and a number of other Trump allies.) It was, to borrow Kemp\u2019s word, \u201calarming\u201d that Trump repeated lies to contest the election, especially when officials in his own administration said it was the most secure in US history. The trick of creating a problem or magnifying a minor issue into some major concern in order to stoke fear and accumulate power is an old political ploy. It was used in the 1950s by Sen. Joe McCarthy to scare Americans about \u201csubversives,\u201d and more recently by former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, who warned that marriage would \u201cdisintegrate\u201d if same-sex marriage became legal. What Jim Crow looks like in 2021 Although few admit to playing this game, occasionally someone lets the cat out of the bag.  Decades ago, in an interview with American journalist Peter Eisner, former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega put it this way: \u201cIn order to solve a problem, you first have to create the problem.\u201d Trump did it in 2016 by sowing a fear of immigrants \u2013 and planning to build a wall. He highlighted crime, poverty and a broken government before claiming, \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d In 2020, Trump created the problem of voter fraud. When he failed to implement his desired solution \u2013 serving a second term as President \u2013 Republicans in Georgia swooped in to devise their own: restrictions on voting. The state\u2019s new law imposes new voter ID requirements for absentee ballots, limits the use of ballot drop boxes, and makes it a crime to give food and water to voters in line. It\u2019s not a great look for Republicans in the state to take such swift action after the special election in Georgia, which delivered a narrow majority for Democrats in the Senate, was largely credited to Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate who spent a decade building the political infrastructure there to increase turnout among Black, Latino and Asian voters. It must be said that the GOP has only won the popular vote once in the last eight presidential elections. The Republican Party also faces a serious problem with suburban women and younger voters who represent the future of politics. By trying to suppress the vote, it seems Republicans are more interested in creating obstacles for Democrats than they are in worthwhile ideas or policies that will win over undecided voters. This is shortsighted and self-defeating.  It\u2019s possible that GOP leaders are so focused on the short term that they believe voter restrictions will tip the scales in their favor during the 2022 midterm elections. Here they might consider the possibility that enacting a new law isn\u2019t always the end of things. In 2015, political hell broke loose after Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s future vice president, signed a law infringing on the rights of gay, lesbian, and transgender Americans. Citizens protested and boycotts caused business leaders to demand revisions. The normally staid Indianapolis Star published a huge frontpage headline that read \u201cFix This Now.\u201d The Star, which endorsed Pence for governor in 2012, was adamant that changes be made and revisions to the law were completed post haste.  Voters in Georgia and other states that are slated to adopt voter restriction laws might consider that episode as members of the Republican Party continue to push Trump\u2019s \u201cbig lie.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It felt like Covid-19 was closing in around us during the five days in August this CNN crew spent in Carter County, Missouri. In Van Buren, the county\u2019s biggest town, we were sitting next to a 16-year-old when she got a text that masks would be mandated at school because about 20 kids had tested positive after just two days of class. One person we\u2019d wanted to interview had to go to the hospital with a breakthrough infection. Another person found out the night before our interview she\u2019d been exposed to coronavirus by a sick kid at church. People were gossiping about who had it and where they got it and whether there was someone in town who knew they had it but refused to isolate. \u201cEverybody\u2019s scared. Everybody\u2019s coming down with it. And it\u2019s almost like a plague,\u201d Brandon Helvey said. Helvey had had Covid-19 three weeks earlier, but he didn\u2019t want to get the vaccine yet, he said. He thought it was still unproven. CNN had come to Carter County, in the Ozark Mountains, in October 2020, when coronavirus was starting to hit rural America. At the time, the debate was over masks, and it was very political. \u201cWe sit in the coffee shop and we see someone wearing a mask and we think: Democrat,\u201d Brian Keathley said last fall, weeks before he got the virus. Carter County has just 6,000 people. Van Buren has about 820 residents. It\u2019s the kind of place where everyone knows everyone \u2013 and everyone knows everyone who has Covid-19. We came back in August to see what had changed since last fall and what hadn\u2019t \u2013 and why, if people here personally knew so many people who got sick, just 27% of the county is fully vaccinated. Covid-19 vaccine myths: These reasons for not getting a shot don't hold up. In fact, they'll set the US back \u201cI had both shots of the vaccine, and people just acted like, \u2018Oh, it doesn\u2019t help,\u2019\u201d Cheryl Wetton said. \u201cIt bothers me sometimes that people act like Covid is a big joke. I always want to say, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you just come right up here to the cemetery, and I\u2019ll show you my husband\u2019s grave? And I can show you it\u2019s no joke.\u2019\u201d Wetton actually did say that to a guy in town, she later confirmed. \u201cHe just got real quiet.\u201d \u201cIf you have it, everybody knows it. And they\u2019re talking about you,\u201d Tara Chitwood said. She was working behind the register at a souvenir shop, subbing in for her mom, who\u2019d gotten sick a few days earlier. It was \u201cmore than likely\u201d Covid-19, Chitwood said, because one of her mom\u2019s friends tested positive. But her mom probably wouldn\u2019t get tested, she said. It was scary, Chitwood said. Her own little girl had to quarantine. But there was \u201cno way\u201d she\u2019d get the vaccine. Her mom had gotten vaccinated, she said, and got sick anyway. \u201cI\u2019ve survived this long,\u201d Chitwood said, and then expressed a fatalism we heard a lot: She was going to die of something, eventually. This Covid-19 wave in Carter County is much worse than last year, its public health center said. August was the county\u2019s worst month ever. The health center announced new cases on Facebook, in between pleas for patience because it was dealing with so many calls. August 20: 4 new cases. August 21: 4 new cases. August 22: 3 new cases. August 23: 17 new cases, 1 death. August 24: 16 new cases. August 25: 18 new cases. August 26: 16 new cases. August 30: 30 new cases. August 31: 22 new cases. September 1: 18 new cases, 1 death. A Missouri hospital just hit its all-time high for Covid cases. But the county fair that attracts thousands won't be canceled The case counts were split between confirmed and probable because the health center didn\u2019t have enough PCR tests, the most sensitive available. On August 31, the health center announced the state health department would send a team to do free PCR tests weekly. When we called Cricket Kester, the phone had a bad connection, and she couldn\u2019t hear us: \u201cIf this is family, call back. Otherwise we\u2019re too sick to talk to anybody.\u201d We did call back, and Kester said she was glad. She and her husband were both vaccinated this spring and got breakthrough infections. She thought they\u2019d be dead without the vaccine, and told us to put the word out that everyone should get it. The coffee shop we\u2019d filmed at in 2020 had just closed for two weeks, and everyone we talked to in town had heard people who worked there had gotten sick. The health center said the rumor had pushed a wave of people to get tested for Covid-19. Some in town knew the owners personally and were worried about them, but the owners did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Most people we spoke to knew exactly the last time they\u2019d eaten there. The Current River runs through Van Buren. It\u2019s swift and clear, and every summer, thousands of tourists come to boat or float down it on inner tubes. It\u2019s three miles of a joyful, often-drunken party drifting past picnics on gravel bars and kids jumping off cliffs. That means a lot of jobs are in the service industry, and few people can work from home. \u201cThey want to hide the fact that they\u2019re sick so they can work,\u201d Debbie Turley said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get vaccinated. You don\u2019t get tested. You hide your symptoms if you\u2019re able to. And you just go out in the community and spread the virus.\u201d Sometimes a rumor would spread that Covid-19 was running through a restaurant, Turley said. The locals would stay away, but the tourists wouldn\u2019t know. Turley already had Covid-19, and she was vaccinated, and she wore masks, too. \u201cI was actually exposed this week by someone who didn\u2019t know they had it, but they did have a cough, and they didn\u2019t stay home,\u201d she said. She\u2019d also been in the coffee shop a few times not long before it closed. \u201cNobody died for a long time, so it\u2019s taken a while for people to get serious,\u201d Jim Rodebush said. The Delta variant is what made it more serious. \u201cIt spread so fast. We\u2019ve had, I guess, 15 people die here.\u201d (It is now 16 in Carter County.) Rodebush\u2019s wife Ruth fought cancer for 12 years, he said. Covid-19 killed her in eight days. She died July 20, 2021. \u201cI talked to her up until the Sunday before she died,\u201d Rodebush said. \u201cShe said, \u2018This is bad, I think you all need to get the shot.\u2019 And I think she\u2019s right.\u201d Neither had been vaccinated. Ruth had said her doctor had told her not to get the vaccine because of her chemo, Rodebush said. \u201cI was pretty skeptical of it until I watched all this happen,\u201d he said. Now, he plans to get the shot. When Ruth was dying, the hospital called at about 2:30 a.m., so Rodebush and his son went to see her. The Covid-19 ward was eerie \u2013 dark, everyone in protective gear, the patients on ventilators, which he knew was the end of the line. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing good about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to go back in one.\u201d They\u2019d watched our 2020 story for CNN, and he thought it was \u201cbullsh*t.\u201d He knew everyone in the video \u2013 every single one of them. At the time, he thought they were wrong about masks, but now it was more visceral. \u201cThose boys sitting in the coffee shop don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about when they\u2019re talking about Covid. They need to walk through the Covid ward. That\u2019ll change your mind. Just stay a day there. See how you like it. It\u2019s a different story then.\u201d This is not a place that gets a lot of national news coverage. And it\u2019s hard to break into socially. People take care of each other in times of joy and crisis, but newcomers could be there 10 years without really fitting in, Rodebush said. This meant just about everyone had seen our last story. Rodebush wanted us to talk about it with his buddy, Wayland Bland. He called him, and after a little convincing, Bland zoomed into the driveway in his pickup and called out to us to film the blue bandana on his face. He wanted us to film him saying, \u201cI\u2019m a Republican, and I\u2019m wearing this mask.\u201d Last fall, Bland spent seven days in the hospital with Covid-19. He\u2019d had a kidney transplant, and knew he was high-risk. Last year, Rodebush said, \u201cMe and him and Ruth sat here and talked about it, and they both said, \u2018If we get it, we\u2019ll die from it.\u2019\u201d But Bland lived. \u201cWhat\u2019d you tell \u2018em, that I\u2019m the toughest bastard there ever was?\u201d Bland said. It was exactly what his friend had said. \u201cI was on everything they had \u2013 steroids, full drip, plasma from people that\u2019d had Covid, drugs that they gave my President, (Donald) Trump. And they finally burned it out of me,\u201d Bland said. But he would not get the vaccine. \u201cI ain\u2019t taking that sh*t. I ain\u2019t taking it!\u201d Bland said. He didn\u2019t want to detail why until he was pushed to explain why he\u2019d trust drugs like Regeneron\u2019s antibody cocktail but not the vaccine. He turned to Rodebush and asked, \u201cAm I going to have to tell her?\u201d Rodebush laughed and shrugged. Trump urges Americans to get Covid-19 vaccine: 'I would recommend it' \u201cThey shafted my President,\u201d Bland said. He thought the vaccine was delayed intentionally to hurt Trump, a baseless claim. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t give it to him because they know damn good and well he\u2019d be reelected, and there\u2019d be nothing nobody could do. So, they had to swindle around and scheme around and keep it from him, and just as soon as the election was over, Bam! There we got it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so bullheaded. You shafted me out of my President. I ain\u2019t taking your medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take what they gave him, but I\u2019m not taking yours.\u201d When reminded Trump had actually urged people to get the vaccine, Bland said he hadn\u2019t seen that. Indeed, Trump himself got the vaccine, and while he had teased there could be a shot by the 2020 election, vaccine developers and federal officials were always clear that the timeline depended on when the data came in. \u201cI don\u2019t watch the news because you\u2019uns have all pissed me off so bad,\u201d Bland said. Still, he was down to hang out with our CNN crew over a few beers on Rodebush\u2019s front porch. Public health officials need to understand the culture here, said Dr. Chris Cochran, an internist at a hospital just over an hour away in West Plains. There are no hospitals in Carter County, and West Plains is one of the places people drive to for health care. Cochran was raised in Mammoth Spring, Arkansas, with a population of about 1,000, and he doesn\u2019t really have a first name there anymore, he said. People just call him \u201cDoc.\u201d What evangelicals are hearing from some pastors about Covid-19 \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever give anybody an excuse for doing something like not getting vaccinated. But the reasons do harken to someone who has been told that they\u2019re a dumb hillbilly all their life by the rest of the country,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we are oppressed or disenfranchised. And I don\u2019t know if we deserve to even feel that way here. But we are a flyover state. \u2026 We are a people who consider ourselves lost to the rest of the world.\u201d We heard that a lot \u2013 that the news media called people dumb hillbillies. But we didn\u2019t say that, and our bosses at CNN didn\u2019t either, or our friends back in New York. Even so, people here still feel singled out, treated like a population separate from the rest of the country, Cochran said. In Missouri, as well as in Arkansas and Tennessee, many people have said they\u2019re at peace with the possibility they could die from Covid-19 because they know they\u2019re right with God. \u201cIf I lose the battle to it, I know where I\u2019m going. I get to go the heavens,\u201d Helvey said. And Tom Wilder said, \u201cI believe if the good Lord wants me right now, it doesn\u2019t matter if I take a vaccine or I don\u2019t. If he wants me to go, he\u2019s going to take me.\u201d This kind of \u201cfatalism\u201d usually melts away, Cochran said, with the intimacy of a one-on-one visit to his office, Cochran said. But what remains is peer pressure to not get vaccinated. \u201cPeople have banded together for security, like people do in any crisis,\u201d he said. But bad information had been introduced to those circles, and attempts to correct it had made them close tighter. \u201cIt\u2019s a real, severe, heavy peer pressure in their church, in their family, in their friend group, in their Facebook friend group, whatever,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cPeople are so pressured not to get vaccinated by their by their group that it is, to them, somewhat of a treasonous act.\u201d Some people in Missouri are getting vaccinated in secret to avoid backlash from loved ones, doctor says Patients have asked if they can get vaccinated in secret. \u201cWe can sneak one in your arm wherever you need to do it,\u201d Cochran said. The hospital has them drive over to its pharmacy parking lot, as if for something else, and staff \u201cjab them in the arm while they\u2019re sitting in their car.\u201d \u201cWhen I tell people that are having trouble admitting that they were wrong about the vaccine and the disease, I preface it with, \u2018I was wrong, too,\u2019\u201d Cochran said. At the beginning of the pandemic, he knew Covid-19 was serious, but he underestimated its power to spread. In spring of 2020, a woman stopped him in the grocery store parking lot. \u201cShe said, \u2018Doc, what do you think about this Covid thing? Do you think it\u2019s going to make it to us?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Ma\u2019am, I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make it here, just like a lot of things, it burns out before it ever makes it to the middle of nowhere like us.\u2019\u201d She said she was glad to hear that. \u201cWell, about six months later, her mother died of Covid,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault that she died of Covid, but I can\u2019t forgive myself for what I said to that woman. And so it\u2019s my job now to move on and make sure that I help as many people as I can that are having trouble coping with and coming to grips with the fact that we\u2019ve all got this wrong to some degree.\u201d And it\u2019s hard for people to change their minds in a place with no anonymity. It had been a little bit weird for Keathley after our October 2020 interview. People stopped him as far away as Branson and asked if he was the guy in the CNN video. Some said it was awesome, he said. One lady yelled at him because her friends had died of Covid-19. And people watched him closely. Chitwood said Keathley came into the souvenir shop all the time. She quoted his line about Democrats being the only ones who wore masks. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him at a game with one on,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, hahaha.\u201d Word spread quickly when he got Covid-19. On our second night in town in August, we joined Keathley at the Mexican restaurant and heard later that after we left, he\u2019d told the whole restaurant we were journalists with CNN and he wasn\u2019t going to talk to us on camera this time. When we ran into him a second time at a diner, it seemed like fate. US sends Covid-19 surge team to southwest Missouri after Delta variant fuels rise in cases and hospitalizations He was getting breakfast with Aly Morris, his 16-year-old niece. Morris said random people would shout from across the room that they recognized Keathley from TV. She thought it was cool. Aly didn\u2019t like wearing a mask, and she thought her teachers had been harsh about it. But she got the vaccine, she said. Aly wants to be a doctor, and she couldn\u2019t imagine telling patients to get a vaccine when she hadn\u2019t herself. Keathley watched as Aly talked. He said he didn\u2019t want to talk on camera. But he relented. He\u2019d been pretty cavalier in 2020. \u201cI guess if I get it and it kills me, then it\u2019s slow walking and sad singing for the family,\u201d Keathley said then. What would he want on his tombstone? \u201cDidn\u2019t wear a mask.\u201d A Missouri couple says they dragged their feet on getting the Covid-19 vaccine. Then they got sick Now, Covid-19 isn\u2019t as political as it was in the fall of 2020, but it\u2019s \u201cstill a bit political,\u201d he said. \u201cThe No. 1 reason nobody wants to take this vaccine is because the government lies absolutely, constantly. And no one feels like they can trust our government. It\u2019s not my fault no one\u2019s wearing a mask. And it\u2019s not my fault no one\u2019s taking the vaccine. It\u2019s the government\u2019s fault.\u201d But did he get the vaccine? Keathley sat with his arms crossed and made a face. Our CNN crew was not above pleading. \u201cPlease, Brian, did you get the vaccine?\u201d \u201cWhether or not I got the vaccine should not dissuade someone else from getting it. If they feel they need it, then they need to get it.\u201d People feel like they have to get the vaccine in secret, we told Keathley. He\u2019s a big, tough guy, works on the railroad, has big mouth \u2013 and everyone knows it. Maybe it would mean something, even to one person, coming from him. \u201cCorona doesn\u2019t care who you are,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you think you\u2019re a big, tough guy or whether you\u2019re \u2013 anything \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. If you get it, it can kill you.\u201d People have to decide whether they wanted to be in a hospital bed and be told they\u2019re going to be put on a ventilator and might never wake up, he said. And hear that their family could never say goodbye. He\u2019d thought about it: \u201cI don\u2019t want my wife to have to wonder \u2026 is he going to come back out?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I got a vaccine,\u201d Keathley said.",

            "article_content": "Programming note: Watch CNN\u2019s Special Report \u201cBack to School: Kids, Covid and the Fight to Reopen\u201d with Jake Tapper on Friday, March 12, at 9 p.m. ET. It\u2019s been one year since millions of students last stepped inside a classroom. One year since schools started shuttering to help get Covid-19 under control. But just as the pandemic has fluctuated across the United States, so have the debates about when and how to bring students back into schools. With vague national guidelines about reopening classrooms, decisions have largely fallen on states and local school districts \u2013 leading to a hodgepodge of strategies and widespread discord about what\u2019s best. Here\u2019s a look at why some parents, students, officials and teachers are so passionate about their stances \u2013 and what they want the other sides to know: When Olga Reyes\u2019 twins started remote learning a year ago, she was forced to quit her job as a nanny to stay with her own children at home. Since then, the 10-year-olds have suffered academically and emotionally \u2013 despite Reyes\u2019 attempts to serve as a part-time teacher and amateur IT technician when the Wi-Fi or Zoom connections go down. \u201cMy kids are not doing well with distance learning,\u201d the San Francisco mother said. \u201cThey did have good grades in the past. But right now, they are not doing well. \u2026 They lack the motivation to learn.\u201d But beyond the academic stress is the family\u2019s dire financial situation. Nine months after Reyes quit her job to stay home with her kids, her husband was laid off from his construction job. Thousands of students have dropped out of school. These educators try to track them down \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t have an income.\u201d Reyes said. \u201cWe are getting food from the food bank that is being distributed weekly. And we are surviving with the last savings that we had from last year.\u201d Reyes estimates she and her husband have one month\u2019s worth of savings left. If schools don\u2019t open soon, \u201cwe are at the risk of losing our housing.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen after. That\u2019s why we are asking to the district to open the schools, because we need to work,\u201d she said. The San Francisco Unified School District said it\u2019s on track to offer in-person learning on April 12 \u201cat a select number of schools for our youngest students.\u201d Open a window to reduce virus spread, CDC tells schools Reyes said she\u2019s sympathetic to those who to want to stay with remote learning, such as families that have someone with a pre-existing medical condition at home. \u201cThe board of education and the district should give the option to the families, so the ones that want to go back to school, they can go back. And the ones that don\u2019t want to go back to school, they can just stay at home.\u201d A hybrid model \u2013 in which students return to classrooms only a few days a week \u2013 is not a good option, she added. \u201cAt this point, after a year of having the schools closed, a hybrid model could not work for my family. My kids need five days of school so they can somehow recover and catch up the academic learning that they have lost.\u201d For five months, Kathleen Roberts has entered her workplace with trepidation. In her rural community, many residents are Covid-19 deniers or \u201cnonmask wearers.\u201d \u201cThis is a heavily Trump community,\u201d said Roberts, a high school history teacher in Shenandoah County, Virginia. \u201cUp until the election, I can tell you that there were people saying to us when the election is over, so will be Covid. I had students, I had a janitor say it to me.\u201d But Roberts knows too well Covid-19 is not a hoax. \u201cMy sister-in-law, my mother-in-law and my husband all had Covid at the same time. And we lost my sister-in-law,\u201d she said. They all went to a church where worshipers often don\u2019t wear masks, and they all got sick, she said. Should our children go back to school? Dr. Wen helps you decide \u201cWhen you\u2019re still combating the thought process here, it\u2019s frightening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. It\u2019s frustrating. And it takes the fun out of teaching. It really does.\u201d Her school district moved to online teaching last March and added optional hybrid learning in the fall. That means while Roberts is educating students online, she\u2019s also teaching students in person and struggling to get some to wear their masks correctly, as required by the school district. \u201cIt is a constant battle keeping kids in masks \u2026 I would say a good 30% of students we have to stay on top of to fix their masks,\u201d she said. Mask enforcement is especially difficult during passing periods between classes. \u201cFor the most part, when they\u2019re right in front of you, they\u2019ll fix it. And then as soon as they walk by you, they\u2019ll push it down again.\u201d Despite her frustration and fear of getting sick, Roberts said she understands why the decision was made to bring some students back in classrooms. \u201cA lot of students are better served in the classroom,\u201d she said. \u201cChild care is a huge issue in our area, and we have a lot of single-parent homes.\u201d In new Covid-19 guidance, CDC recommends 5 key strategies to reopen schools There are benefits and costs to online learning, too. \u201cSome students have soared online \u2013 motivated, responsible, own their education. Others struggle and have floundered. Teachers are struggling. It is difficult teaching in multiple models, online while engaging kids in class,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI think some of the pros for distance learning would be a lot more technology.\u201d For example, students who previously lacked good Wi-Fi or online communications skills are now more tech-savvy. \u201cWe actually had to work with the local cable company, and they created some towers in different places,\u201d she said. And the school district created two hot spots in some of the most remote or mountainous parts of the county. \u201cSo they\u2019ve been very proactive about that and trying to have \u2026 equality for all students to get good technology. And every kid in the county has a Chromebook. It\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d In Fairfax County, Virginia, students were recently allowed to return to school two days a week in a hybrid model. Some students, like sixth-grader Katharine Porter, chose to stick with 100% remote learning. Her mother Jennifer said she\u2019s worried about possible exposure to coronavirus. But Katharine\u2019s twin sister Elizabeth decided to go back to school. \u201cI want to socialize with more people, and I made some friends on online school, and I want to meet them,\u201d Elizabeth said. Biden wants to reopen schools. Here's why that's so hard to do The Biden administration has announced a goal of getting kindergarten through eighth-grade students back in classrooms five days a week by the end of the first 100 days in office. But that\u2019s \u201cnot realistic if we\u2019re going to stay with 6-foot social distancing,\u201d Fairfax County Public Schools Superintendent Scott Brabrand said. \u201cPractically, that means the difference between two days a week and five days a week.\u201d He has said it would take \u201cfive Pentagons of additional space if 6 feet is the standard\u201d for students to be in school safely five days a week. \u201cAnd so we need clearer national discussion \u2026 can we come in less than 6 feet?\u201d Pam Gaddy feels the strain of this debate as both a teacher and a parent. \u201cI\u2019ve never taught in my basement,\u201d said the 24-year veteran, who teaches social studies online to students enrolled at a Baltimore high school. \u201cThis is absolutely new to us. It\u2019s ever-evolving. Baltimore County has been full virtual since the start of school.\u201d She knows many parents are eager to have their children return to classrooms. But Gaddy said parents need to realize that\u2019s not as easy as they might think. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because people forget that teachers are parents. They have families. We\u2019re expected to negate that,\u201d she said. Why some Black families are hesitant to send their kids back to school While Gaddy teaches from home, she shares a workspace with her eighth-grade daughter because \u201cshe needs a little more encouragement.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not far from me. So I\u2019m listening to her classes, and I\u2019m teaching my classes. So she\u2019s listening to my classes. And I\u2019ll say to my students, \u2018Give me five seconds.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s when Gaddy pivots her attention to her daughter, encouraging her to respond to her teacher \u201cbecause I know what it feels like when no one is talking to the teacher.\u201d \u201cI do want my child back in school because I know the power of the classroom,\u201d Gaddy said. \u201cMy children actually want to go back into the building. Their dad and I are not so happy about that. But now as a parent, I have the fear of what the science says. I have the fear of what the numbers read every day. But then I also know that my children are literally suffering \u2013 emotionally and socially \u2013 not being in a classroom.\u201d As a teacher, Gaddy said she would be nervous returning to a classroom if she had to do so in the near future because \u201cnot everyone is vaccinated who can be vaccinated.\u201d Some children's hospitals see a surge in rare Covid-19 complication MIS-C \u201cIf you\u2019re really thinking about it, how are you going to bring students back into the classroom, have them move from classroom to classroom?\u201d Gaddy wondered aloud. \u201cIf a teacher\u2019s doing hall duty like we should be doing, you now put us less than 6 feet distance. There\u2019s no social distancing in class exchange.\u201d Even before the pandemic, many classrooms were already full. Gaddy said one of her classes has 31 students. She said it would not be feasible to bring them all back safely in the near future. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly trying to satisfy public outcry or federal funding, but your logistics are laughable. It\u2019s not realistic.\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many factors that go into it. But all people are saying is just, \u2018Throw them back into the building.\u2019 Well, I would love for your child to come back. I just don\u2019t want to die coming home to do it.\u201d After months of devastation, Los Angeles County celebrated a milestone in mid-February: Covid-19 cases had dropped to a level that would allow elementary students to return to classrooms, health officials said. \u201cThe state permits elementary schools to reopen as soon as we reach an adjusted case rate of 25 per 100,000,\u201d the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said. \u201cWe are informing Los Angeles County schools \u2026 that we expect to announce we have reached this threshold effective Tuesday, February 16.\u201d Educators may be more likely to spread coronavirus in schools than students, CDC study finds But almost a month later, elementary students in the Los Angeles Unified School District still haven\u2019t returned to classrooms. That might not happen until mid-April, Superintendent Austin Beutner said. \u201cIn order to complete the puzzle and bring students and staff back to school in the safest way possible, school staff need to be offered the opportunity to receive the vaccine,\u201d Beutner said on March 1. \u201cThere are more than 86,000 people who work in traditional and charter schools in Los Angeles Unified. Our initial focus will be to vaccinate school staff who are currently working at school sites and all who are involved in preschool and elementary school. This vaccination effort will allow us to reopen these schools by the middle of April.\u201d Some teachers\u2019 unions, including United Teachers Los Angeles, have balked at resuming classes until teachers can be vaccinated. California\u2019s governor has announced 10% of Covid-19 vaccine doses would be set aside for teachers and childcare workers in an effort to resume in-person learning. Hannah Blackbourn had just started a new job as vice president of advertising sales when Seattle Public Schools moved to at-home learning last March. She and her husband \u201cfrantically\u201d explored the idea of hiring someone to stay with their children, now 7 and 3. \u201cBut at the time \u2026 that freaked us out, thinking about inviting somebody into our home. We couldn\u2019t control where they were when they weren\u2019t in our home,\u201d Blackbourn said. Survey: Americans support teachers getting vaccinated before schools reopen \u201cIt was a very tough decision, but I made the decision to leave that job. We didn\u2019t really have a way for family to help, because our older family members that are nearby \u2013 we\u2019ve been very scared over the past year of accidentally somehow passing them coronavirus because our son has continued to be in preschool.\u201d Blackbourn decided to quit her new job because it seemed less stable than her husband\u2019s job, she said. And even though Seattle parents have been asked whether they would prefer a hybrid model, \u201cI wanted to stick with remaining remote for safety and consistency,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I would also say we\u2019ve been super privileged to be in this situation, where I was able to step back from work for a while.\u201d She said not all families have been so lucky. Blackbourn also discovered an unexpected benefit with remote learning: Young children are no longer distracted by bullying at school. She said her daughter experienced bullying last year, and now \u201call of that stress is gone.\u201d Meet Gen C, the Covid generation \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean I want her to be totally isolated from other kids forever,\u201d Blackbourn said. \u201cBut she\u2019s also not around anybody saying mean things to her or shoving her or any of those horrible interactions that can happen between kids on the playground.\u201d While Blackbourn worries about how a year off from work might set back her career, she\u2019d still rather stay home with her first-grade daughter than have her participate in hybrid learning just a few days a week. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem good for anybody because No. 1, of course, I don\u2019t want anybody to get sick. And I do think teachers are right to demand things like vaccinations and PPE,\u201d Blackbourn said. On top of that, \u201cthere wouldn\u2019t be the benefit that I would be able to return to the workforce,\u201d she said. \u201cI would still be stuck in this spot where I\u2019m juggling and facilitating (remote learning).\u201d CNN\u2019s Christina Zdanowicz, Ryan Young, Dana Bash and Bridget Nolan contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Lost amid Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election was this important fact: The then-President did surprisingly well among Hispanic voters in several major states. In Florida, Trump won 46% of the Latino vote, a performance that allowed him to win the state more easily than expected. In Texas, Trump took 41% of the Latino vote, again helping him to a win in the state. Nationally, he won 32% of the Hispanic vote, an improvement from the 28% he had taken in 2016. New polling from The Wall Street Journal suggests those 2020 numbers weren\u2019t an anomaly. Asked whether they would vote for a Democratic or Republican candidate for Congress in 2022, Latinos were split right down the middle, with 37% choosing each side. Asked who they would vote for if the 2024 race was held today, 44% opted for President Joe Biden while 43% went with Trump. And, Biden\u2019s approval ratings among Hispanics in the poll were problematic as well. Just 42% approved of the job he is doing as President while 54% disapproved. Among Hispanic men, that number was even worse \u2013 with 61% disapproving of how Biden is doing. \u201cLatinos are more and more becoming swing voters,\u201d said Democratic pollster John Anzalone, who helped conduct the WSJ poll. \u201cThey\u2019re a swing vote that we\u2019re going to have to fight for.\u201d That marks a seismic shift from thinking around the Hispanic vote over the last decade when the growth of the population coupled with its clear Democratic tilt suggested that Republicans were facing a demographic disaster in coming years. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Now, this is just one poll and other recent polling has shown Democrats holding an edge among Latinos, but nothing remotely close to the 40-point advantage they held\u00a0nationwide\u00a0in the 2018 midterms. So, what changed? Democratic strategist Ruy Teixeira, in an essay titled \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 Hispanic Voter Problem,\u201d suggests the leftward movement of the party nationally has made it less appealing for Latinos. \u201cThis constituency does not harbor particularly radical views on the nature of American society and its supposed intrinsic racism and White supremacy,\u201d Teixeira writes. \u201cThey are instead a patriotic, upwardly mobile, working class group with quite practical and down to earth concerns. Democrats will either learn to focus on that or they will continue to lose ground among this vital group of voters.\u201d The Point: The numbers cited above make it clear: Democrats need to start paying attention to voices like Teixeira\u2019s \u2013 or run the risk of watching what was once considered a dominant demographic advantage slip away.",

            "article_content": "Kristina Karamo \u2013 the candidate Donald Trump is backing to be Michigan\u2019s next secretary of state \u2013 has falsely claimed the former President was the true victor in Michigan in 2020 and has spread the conspiracy theory that left-wing anarchists were behind the January 6 attack on the Capitol. \u201cBased on the series of evidence and knowing how these situations work, how these anarchists operate, I believe this is completely Antifa posing as Trump supporters,\u201d Karamo said on an episode of her podcast the day after the January 6 insurrection. \u201cI mean, anybody can buy a MAGA hat and put on T-shirt and buy a Trump flag.\u201d In fact, hundreds of federal indictments have affirmed since then that Pro-Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win. Karamo has never held elected office or run a statewide race before, but the 36-year-old community college professor has become a leading candidate to be Michigan\u2019s GOP secretary of state nominee after receiving Trump\u2019s endorsement in September. She\u2019s one of several candidates in key battleground states across the country Trump has backed in an effort to elect allies who embrace his 2020 election lies. Offices like Michigan\u2019s secretary of state run the presidential election while Trump is preparing for a potential 2024 comeback bid \u2013 meaning Trump\u2019s preferred candidates could replace the very officials who stopped his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, like Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. In Michigan, Karamo is one of three declared Republican candidates seeking to run against Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in 2022, who is expected to run for reelection. Karamo rose to prominence in Michigan after the 2020 election when she alleged to have witnessed fraud as a poll challenger during the state\u2019s count of absentee ballots. The month after the election, Karamo testified before a state Senate committee, signed onto the unsuccessful Supreme Court challenge to Biden\u2019s win and appeared on Fox News conservative opinion shows to promote her allegations and falsely claim widespread fraud occurred in the state. A CNN review of Karamo\u2019s podcast and writings on her now defunct personal website, which have not been previously reported, offer a window into the worldview of the professor-turned-candidate seeking to be in charge of Michigan\u2019s elections. She declared herself an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d in 2020 even before the Covid-19 vaccine became a political flashpoint. She opposed teaching evolution and called public schools \u201cgovernment indoctrination camps.\u201d And she\u2019s harshly attacked those who don\u2019t share her views, from Democrats and Republicans alike to members of the LGBTQ community and even couples who cohabitate before marriage. Last month, Karamo appeared with other Republican secretary of state candidates who have echoed Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election, including Arizona state Rep. Mark Finchem and Nevada\u2019s Jim Marchant, at an event in Las Vegas featuring prominent people associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory. At the event, she acknowledged in a speech that a statewide race would force her to broaden her constituency \u2013 while at the same time criticizing Republicans who disagreed with her, saying she was \u201cfighting my own people in the state.\u201d \u201cOne of the things that I try to be very cognizant of, you know, I\u2019m running a statewide race,\u201d Karamo said, according to video provided to CNN. \u201cAnd I understand I have to win the hearts and minds of people who may not necessarily think like me.\u201d Karamo and her campaign did not respond to multiple phone calls and emails from CNN requesting an interview, or to a list of questions requesting comment about the positions she\u2019s expressed. Karamo, a single mother of two children from a Detroit suburb, isn\u2019t a total stranger to politics. She became active in her county\u2019s Republican Party several years ago as she voiced concerns with public school curriculum, and she ran unsuccessfully for a county commissioner seat in 2018. Rocky Raczkowski, chairman of the Oakland County Republican Party, said Karamo volunteered as a party spokesperson, and she appeared on local political television talk shows. \u201cShe\u2019s got an incredible way of talking, and a level of compassion and understanding and intellect and ability to speak with people and make them understand specific issues,\u201d Raczkowski told CNN. \u201cWhen you see somebody that can communicate with people and communicate with them on an effective basis, you try to elevate that person \u2013 and we did.\u201d Karamo gained a larger profile after working as a GOP poll challenger during the 2020 election at the TCF Center in Detroit, where the city\u2019s absentee ballots were being processed. She claimed she witnessed fraud firsthand challenging a ballot that she said had filled in the straight-party voting circles for both Democrats and Republicans, but the vote was counted for Democrats. On another ballot, she said votes for both Biden and the Green Party presidential candidate were filled in, but the vote was given to Biden. After the election in December, Karamo testified at a Michigan Senate hearing on the fraud she said she witnessed and signed an affidavit as part of a Supreme Court lawsuit filed seeking to throw out election results in four states. Karamo was invited onto the shows of Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity and then-Fox Business Network\u2019s Lou Dobbs, where she was touted as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d and blasted her state\u2019s Republican legislature for not doing more. \u201cThe fact that our legislature, leadership have sat here and done nothing about it, they\u2019ve become complicit in the fraud,\u201d she said on Dobbs\u2019 Fox Business Network show in December 2020. \u201cAnd they sit here as though we\u2019re going to forget, and I\u2019m here to let them know that we will not forget.\u201d But the claims of fraud she spread in videos on social media and in television interviews went well beyond her own experiences, falsely claiming on social media, \u201cDonald Trump won Michigan.\u201d In a December 2020 appearance on a local Fox television station, Karamo claimed ballots were changed by Dominion voting software in Michigan\u2019s Antrim County, where 6,000 votes were initially given incorrectly to Biden instead of Trump due to a human error, a mistake that was quickly corrected. \u201cThat software is in 47 counties. I\u2019ve done my math, that\u2019s over 200,000 votes that have been potentially compromised,\u201d Karamo said. A Republican-led state Senate investigation in June, however, found there was \u201cno evidence of widespread or systematic fraud\u201d in Michigan\u2019s 2020 election. The report specifically debunked the allegations surrounding Antrim County and Dominion, stating, \u201cThose promoting Antrim County as the prime evidence of a nationwide conspiracy to steal the election place all other statements and actions they make in a position of zero credibility.\u201d As Trump\u2019s continued lies about the 2020 election being stolen convinced more and more Republicans to believe that Biden was illegitimately elected, Karamo announced her candidacy for secretary of state in May. Karamo has continued to push for Michigan to conduct its own \u201cforensic audit\u201d in the model of the Arizona partisan ballot review conducted earlier this year that confirmed Biden won the state. She toured the Arizona site in June while the review led by the Cyber Ninjas was underway, and told right-wing OAN afterward that Michigan should replicate the process. Karamo\u2019s background is in education. She\u2019s worked as a part-time adjunct professor at Wayne County Community College since 2014, according to a college spokesperson. She\u2019s teaching speech, college orientation and career development for the college\u2019s dual-enrollment program for the fall 2021 semester, the spokesperson said. Karamo has a master\u2019s degree in Christian apologetics, the study of the defense of Christianity against objections, from Biola University, an evangelical university in Southern California. Sean McDowell, an associate professor of Christian Apologetics at Biola University, previously taught Karamo and described her as outgoing, engaging and overall \u201ca joy to have in class.\u201d When it comes to apologetics, McDowell said Christians often express their beliefs in different fashions. He said even among apologists, people often hold a variety of views on the intersection of science and faith, issues of sexuality and how to contend with non-believers. \u201cEven within the branch of apologetics, there\u2019s huge differences even within the Christian world about how people approach their task in terms of what positions they might argue for, in terms of the demeanor that people take and their goals in doing it,\u201d McDowell said. In her commentary through her podcasts and writings on her website over the past several years, Kamaro frequently ties her interpretation of Christianity to her staunch conservatism. Karamo\u2019s depiction of politics leaves little room for compromise. She accuses politicians of both parties to be traitors to America and influenced by the devil. \u201cTheir party has totally been taken over by a satanic agenda,\u201d Karamo said of Democrats in a November 2020 podcast episode. After January 6, Karamo called for the ouster of the \u201cconservative imposters\u201d from the Republican Party. \u201cWe need to lawfully remove these traitors,\u201d she said of Republicans. Karamo is one of three Republicans running for secretary of state to date. The nominee will be chosen not through a traditional primary but at a party convention held next year. So far, Karamo has a significant fundraising lead on the other Republicans, state Rep. Beau LaFave and township clerk Cindy Berry, collecting more than $164,000 in contributions this year, according to state campaign finance data. Still, she\u2019s well behind the incumbent, Benson, who raised nearly $450,000 in the last fundraising quarter and has more than $1 million in her campaign account. LaFave has focused his campaign thus far not on the 2020 election like Karamo, but on the secretary of state\u2019s closure of DMV offices in Michigan. \u201cToday, I announce my campaign to open the offices!\u201d he wrote on Facebook when he announced he was running last month. Gustavo Portela, a spokesman for the Michigan state Republican Party, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the GOP field grow even more crowded, adding that Republicans across the country have grown energized since Glenn Youngkin\u2019s victory in the Virginia governor\u2019s race. \u201cNo matter what, our party is prepared and ready to help whichever candidate comes out of the nominating convention,\u201d Portela said. The outcome of Michigan\u2019s Republican campaign for secretary of state \u2013 as well as attorney general, where Trump has also endorsed Republican attorney Matthew DePerno, who filed a lawsuit challenging Michigan\u2019s 2020 election results that relied on the debunked allegations surrounding Antrim County \u2013 could signal the direction the Republican Party is headed into the 2022 midterms and the 2024 presidential contest, where Trump is likely the frontrunner for the GOP nomination if he runs. Karamo\u2019s commentary through her podcast, videos and personal writings frequently focuses on issues related to popular culture, sex and education \u2013 and warnings about what she sees as a dangerous agenda being taught to children in schools. \u201cThat\u2019s what our schools have turned into \u2013 government indoctrination camps,\u201d she said in January. \u201cAnd you\u2019re forced to have your child be exposed to types of unbridled wickedness that these Democrats and liberals want to teach your child.\u201d Karamo objected to teaching that some children have two mothers or fathers, saying it invites conversations with children about how gay people have sex. \u201cThere is no such thing as a person with two mommies and two daddies. That is just factually incorrect,\u201d Karamo said in a January episode. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the parent and their homosexual lover. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said in August 2020. In an August 2019 blog post, she dismissed transgender women trying to play women\u2019s sports as \u201cmentally ill adults playing dress up. That is also part of the horrifically destructive sexual revolution.\u201d She also opposed the teaching of evolution in schools. \u201cEvolution is one of the biggest frauds that have been perpetrated on us,\u201d she said in a July 2019 video. And she has raised concerns claiming that popular culture is pushing toward the \u201cnormalization\u201d of pedophilia, including through legislation in Michigan and premarital sex. \u201cWhen we normalize people fornicating and we normalize people living together with their boyfriends and girlfriends and all that stuff, we open a door for us to get to the point where we have people want to normalize pedophilia,\u201d she said in November. McDowell, the apologetics professor, said, \u201cChristians have largely had concerns about changing marital and sexual norms for decades,\u201d but added that he does not believe the specific concern about premarital cohabitation paving the way for pedophilia is a widespread worry among Christians.",

            "article_content": "Former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s call for \u201cone religion\u201d in the US to win the battle of good versus evil has garnered sharp backlash from a range of critics. Flynn, who was subpoenaed last week by the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack, made the comment during a speech to a conservative Christian audience on the ReAwaken America tour in Texas this weekend. \u201cIf we are going to have one nation under God, which we must, we have to have one religion,\u201d he said. \u201cOne nation under God and one religion under God, right? All of us, working together.\u201d His message \u2013 the latest in a lengthy history of outlandish remarks \u2013 appears to be an inflammatory contradiction of the First Amendment, which protects freedom of religion. Flynn has previously drawn backlash for controversial comments. CNN has reached out to Flynn for comment. \u201cThe Mike Flynn of today is not the Mike Flynn of prior to 2014 that I know,\u201d former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told CNN Sunday. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s two different people. He is clearly unhinged here with this kind of public statement.\u201d Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a national security analyst for CNN, similarly cast Flynn\u2019s remarks as \u201can embarrassment to the US Army & an aberration to those of us who have proudly worn the cloth of our country.\u201d \u201cHis words are disgusting,\u201d Hertling said in a tweet. A number of Democratic lawmakers also took aim at Flynn\u2019s comments. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota tweeted, \u201cThese people hate the US Constitution,\u201d while Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California wrote, \u201cSure glad we live in a Constitutional Republic instead of a theocracy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Catholic and do we really want government to force everyone to go to confession? I got baptized in college and those Church courses were soooo long. Michael Flynn would fall asleep in Church class,\u201d Lieu tweeted. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI over his conversations with Russia\u2019s then-ambassador and for a time cooperated with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But as his case swerved toward a possible brief prison sentence, Flynn fired his lawyers, replacing them with a defense team that worked to unravel his plea in court and publicly campaigned for the pardon, which he ultimately received from former President Donald Trump in November 2020. Journalist and author Carl Bernstein told CNN that Flynn is among the Trump associates \u201csaying out loud things that have never been said by an aide or close associates of a president of the United States.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so stupefying to think that we had a president of the United States that would entertain these knaves, fools, and dangerous authoritarian figures. That\u2019s what we need to look at the big picture,\u201d he added. \u201cDonald Trump looked for people to facilitate his authoritarian impulse.\u201d Asked to react to Flynn\u2019s comments, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta Sunday, \u201cThis country was (founded) on independent and religious freedoms. Folks left to come here in search of these freedoms. Now, he would love to see that taken away.\u201d Clyburn went on to say that it\u2019s another attempt by a former Trump official to undermine democracy.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Eric Adams has been elected the 110th mayor of New York City, CNN projects, defeating Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. Adams, a retired New York Police Department captain who embraced a public safety message, will be the second Black mayor in the city\u2019s history, after the late David Dinkins. \u201cI wanted people to know my story, being a dishwasher, having a learning disability, being arrested as a child, going to school at night, working in a mail room. That was the story I wanted to send New Yorkers, and they felt me. And because of that, I\u2019m now going to be the mayor of one of the greatest cities on the globe,\u201d the mayor-elect told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day\u201d Wednesday. A Brooklyn native who currently serves as its borough president, Adams won a chaotic Democratic primary this summer on a promise to both beef up and reform the NYPD amid worries over a rise in violent crime. His message \u2013 that \u201cpublic safety is the prerequisite to prosperity\u201d \u2013 resonated with working class Democratic voters outside the traditionally liberal enclaves of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, which fueled his nomination. \u201cThe foundation is safety. We can talk about all the other pieces, but we have to be safe. If we\u2019re not safe, tourism is not going to return,\u201d Adams told CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger ahead of the election. \u201cNo business is going to stay if their employees can\u2019t ride our subway systems to get to their office space.\u201d Adams\u2019 general election campaign was much more subdued. He largely ignored Sliwa, a founder of the Guardian Angels and media personality. After Sliwa attacked him during one of their two debates, Adams shrugged and refused to engage. \u201cI\u2019m speaking to New Yorkers,\u201d he said, \u201cnot buffoonery.\u201d A former state lawmaker, Adams rose to the top of the Democratic mayoral field with a clear pitch to voters anxious over a pandemic-year surge in violent crime and persistent concerns over NYPD abuses, arguing that he is uniquely positioned to address both concerns. Adams said he and his brother were arrested for criminal trespass into the home of a go-go dancer in 1975, and the experience stuck with him. \u201cThey took us downstairs to the lower level and they kicked us repeatedly in our groin,\u201d said Adams, who joined the NYPD with a mission to reform the force. \u201cWell, you start to make sure you hit reset with the police department,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go to the precincts, talk to my officers and let them know, \u2018I have your backs. I\u2019m going to be there for you. \u2026 But darn it\u2026if you don\u2019t understand the nobility of public protection, you can\u2019t serve in my department,\u2019\u201d Adams told Borger. That effort required he strike a careful balance in pledging to deal with police misconduct, often noting his past efforts to call out racism within the NYPD, as well as his testimony in the court case that ended the unlawful use of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policies. (Adams says the tactic should be used, but under lawful guidelines.) He has also argued that the current debate over policing has presented a false choice, rejecting both the law-and-order rhetoric favored by many on the right, while denouncing left-wing activists\u2019 calls to \u201cdefund\u201d or more fundamentally reform the police. \u201cI\u2019m evolving as a man. I\u2019m evolving as a dad. I\u2019m going to evolve if I\u2019m the mayor of New York,\u201d he told Borger, noting that he has a personal anthem he always returns to when times get tough. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m feeling as though I hit an obstacle, I throw on \u2018My Way,\u201d he said, referring to the Frank Sinatra song. Besides running on a public safety message, he has also called for making school lunches healthier. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a broccoli mayor,\u201d added Adams, who went vegan after being diagnosed with diabetes. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to like it when you eat it, but long term, you\u2019re going to see the benefits of it.\u201d This story has been updated with comments from Adams. CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "If there was a silver lining for Democrats\u2019 disastrous Tuesday night, it was learning a year ahead of time just how imperiled their hold on power really is. Democrats suffered a demoralizing defeat in Virginia, losing all three top statewide offices in a commonwealth that President Joe Biden won by 10 percentage points a year earlier, and are just narrowly hanging on in reliably blue New Jersey, further highlighting the dour national mood aimed at the party. The issues raised by the dismal night were clear: The party had lost some ground in the suburbs and did nothing to stem Republican gains in rural enclaves; failed to recognize the potency of core Republican arguments or produce arguments to negate them; and misjudged the strength of anti-Donald Trump messaging a year removed from the former President\u2019s time in office. What and who to blame for those mistakes, however, has proven more elusive. Before any major network had even called the race in Virginia, and while Terry McAuliffe\u2019s aides worked to keep the mood up inside the Hilton ballroom that hosted the campaign\u2019s election night party, operatives both inside and outside the room were acknowledging the reality that the cash-bar affair would soon turn into a wake for the Democratic Party\u2019s standing in America. \u201cOfficially, this race is still too close to call,\u201d one campaign official as the campaign continued to monitor votes. \u201cUnofficially, it\u2019s rough.\u201d Even loyal McAuliffe supporters wasted no time searching for answers. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s the wrong track in America,\u201d said Virginia Rep. Don Beyer, pointing to polls that show many Americans see the country going in the wrong direction. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that it\u2019s the wrong track \u2026 but given that\u2019s the way the American people feel right now, they\u2019re going to be changed-oriented.\u201d Democratic camps also quickly formed in the wake of the loss, each pointing blame at each other like a political circular firing squad. To some, the losses and current standing of the party was Biden\u2019s fault \u2013 the McAuliffe campaign saw their standing with swing voters sink quickly after the chaotic withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan over the summer and noted that the President\u2019s underwater approval rating had weighed McAuliffe and others down. To others, it was Congress \u2013 the deeply gridlocked body failed to pass either the trillion-dollar infrastructure bill and even larger social spending bill ahead of the off-year elections, denying McAuliffe any chance to run on the idea that Democrats in power get things done. This was particularly damaging in Virginia, Democrats worried, given the party has been in control of the governor\u2019s mansion for eight years. McAuliffe\u2019s campaign watched as Congress pushed the possible vote on both bills closer and closer to the election throughout October. When it looked like it wasn\u2019t going to happen, an exasperated Virginia Democrat couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cThese f****** people,\u201d they said. And to even more, the blame landed squarely on McAuliffe \u2013 he ran an uninspired campaign, underestimated both Republican Glenn Youngkin and the issues that animated his base, and spent too much time and money tying his opponent to Trump, a strategy that did boost Democratic turnout but gave independents and Republicans few reasons to back the former governor. At the core of these concerns is the idea that McAuliffe did not effectively respond to attacks from Youngkin, offering only sheepish explanations and a claim that he was taken out of context when the Republican campaign seized on his McAuliffe saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that McAuliffe relied too much on Trump in absence of anything else and that was a mistake,\u201d said a senior Democratic operative whose organization spent money in Virginia. But that wasn\u2019t the only issue. It was also \u201cmaking a terrible mistake when talking about parents and education and then being too stubborn to address it for days. Overconfidence and stubbornness are a bad combination.\u201d The reality for Democrats, who woke up on Wednesday staring down the painful possibility that the 2022 midterms could be even more disastrous if nothing changes, is that a host of factors \u2013 from rage at Democratic control in Washington to Covid-19 fatigue to inflation \u2013 played a role in the bloodbath that was Tuesday night. \u201cThe truth is we just did slightly worse across all demographics and regions,\u201d said David Turner, a top operative at the Democratic Governors Association. \u201cSo, it is hard to point to one thing that would make the difference. It\u2019s everything that was put together made the difference.\u201d The worst outcome, said Turner and others, would be not learning lessons from the losses. \u201cIf it was an easy answer, we would have it. Truly, if it was an easy answer and it was a binary, yes or no question, we would have figured it out,\u201d said Geoff Burgan, communications director for the Democratic Attorneys General Association. \u201cAt the end of the day, you have to have a message that resonates with working class folks across the spectrum and pretty clearly puts your candidate on the people\u2019s side and makes clear that your opponent is not for them.\u201d Democratic voters need a jolt. As McAuliffe\u2019s campaign entered the final months, his top aides and advisers began to see troubling signs: Voters were tired, unmotivated and largely uninterested in politics. After four years of being told every election with Trump either in office or on the ballot was the \u201cmost important of your lifetime,\u201d Democratic voters were eager for a break and began tuning out politics to get one. \u201cI think there was so much passion for the presidential race, we just felt so invigorated. \u2026 And I just don\u2019t feel like that right now,\u201d Janis Gillespie, a 68-year-old retired teacher, told CNN as she waited to hear first lady Jill Biden speak outside Richmond in October. \u201cI am worried about it.\u201d The McAuliffe campaign was feeling it, too. \u201cIf people don\u2019t wake up,\u201d said one Virginia Democrat at the start of October, \u201cwe are in trouble.\u201d To stir that wake up call, McAuliffe\u2019s campaign doubled down on their strategy of linking anything and everything that Youngkin did to Trump, hoping raising the specter of the former President would remind voters of why elections mattered. It wasn\u2019t only McAuliffe making this case, too. Biden traveled to the commonwealth \u2013 twice \u2013 and unequivocally carried the McAuliffe messaging on Youngkin and Trump. So, too, did former President Barack Obama, questioning the Republican\u2019s character and telling voters, \u201cYou can\u2019t run ads telling me you are a regular old hoops-playing, dish-washing, fleece-wearing guy, but quietly cultivate support from those who seek to tear down our democracy.\u201d The strategy wasn\u2019t a complete failure. Turnout in the race was enormous \u2013 well over 3 million people voted, including more than 1.6 million for McAuliffe. But, Democrats argued after the fact, the strategy only served to harden McAuliffe\u2019s base, failing to broaden his appeal to people who may have voted against Trump but knew Youngkin wasn\u2019t him. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on Democrats to be loud and clear about what we\u2019re for and not just running against Donald Trump,\u201d said a Biden adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s also clear that voters are unhappy about inaction and this drives home the point that Democrats in Congress should move quickly on our agenda.\u201d Even McAuliffe knew near the close of his campaign that the Democratic exhaustion was real and his Trump strategy may have been flawed. \u201cIt is fair to say,\u201d McAuliffe told reporters on the final day of the campaign, \u201cpeople have been exhausted from the last four years of Donald Trump.\u201d A few days earlier, the same candidate who spent months tying his opponent to Trump claimed to CNN that the race wasn\u2019t about the former President. When voters elected Democrats in 2020, they expected action, top Democrats in Washington and Virginia said. With Congress stalled, the party in power is now paying the price. \u201cPeople voted for us last year,\u201d said a Democrat close to the McAuliffe campaign who was frustrated with Congress. \u201cWe have to give them something.\u201d McAuliffe and his top advisers had hoped they could at least close the campaign by listing all the Virginia-specific benefits in the two spending bills currently stuck in Congress. With no Republican support and Democratic disagreement, that messaging strategy wasn\u2019t viable and many of McAuliffe\u2019s biggest boosters, like Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, became so concerned that they warned their colleagues of what could happen. Once the results were in on Wednesday, Kaine and others felt validated. \u201cLook, congressional Dems hurt Terry McAuliffe,\u201d Kaine said on Wednesday. \u201cOur inability to come together and get a result hurt him.\u201d Not everyone agreed with this view. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you run for governor on what\u2019s happening in the US Congress,\u201d said Beyer. \u201cI think having a president with 42% popularity and a Congress that seems to have a hard time governing in the short run is not helpful, but I don\u2019t think that determined the outcome of the election.\u201d The lessons Democrats have taken from this, however, is that getting things done in the coming months is critical. \u201cIf voters are frustrated with inaction, the obvious response is to be more decisive and pass bills based on an agenda for the middle class that received a record-breaking 81 million votes last year,\u201d a source close to the White House said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a strong consensus about that across the party. Doing less is plainly the opposite of what people want.\u201d Democrats have long had a rural voter problem and the Virginia results prove it is just getting worse. The party was able to largely paper over the issue in 2020 with a strong surge in the nation\u2019s suburbs, helping Democrats win the White House. But Tuesday night highlighted the issue is not close to being addressed and McAuliffe aides admit they underestimated the level of intensity and strength for Youngkin in rural counties across the commonwealth, where the Republican won around 80% of the vote. While their populations may be small, the overwhelming victories ate into McAuliffe\u2019s advantage in population centers and proved calamitous. \u201cTerry got a record number of votes and was still losing rural areas 85-15. We can\u2019t win elections that way,\u201d said Josh Schwerin, a Democratic consultant who previously worked for McAuliffe. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough to counter how excited Republicans were in other parts and how low our ceiling is in rural communities right now. \u2026 It\u2019s getting worse.\u201d This problem was exacerbated by Youngkin\u2019s ability to cut into Democratic margins in the suburbs, breaking through a wall the party built during the Trump years and cutting into their margins just enough to sink McAuliffe. For Republicans, it\u2019s an encouraging sign \u2013 one could portend greater success in the 2022 midterms, much of which will be fought in suburban and exurban counties. \u201cThe Democratic Party was a temporary home for many suburban voters the past few years and they\u2019re breaking back toward Republicans,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, spokesman for the Republican Governors Association. And for Democrats, it\u2019s a structural concern that could spell doom in the midterms. \u201cThe House majority was built in the suburbs, with voters who had never voted for a Democrat before Hillary Clinton, and it\u2019s critical to remember that,\u201d said Meredith Kelly, a Democratic consultant who helped lead the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee when the party won the majority in 2018. \u201cThese were, and still are, tax-conscious voters focused on keeping their families healthy and their paychecks secure, and that\u2019s all the more reason to stop quibbling about price tags, get these job-creating bills passed, and start selling them.\u201d One reason for this success is Youngkin\u2019s ability to tap into broader Republican issues that have been elevated by conservative media \u2013 from parental grievances around education and the perceived teaching of critical race theory to rising gas and commodity prices \u2013 and present them in a more palatable, less abrasive way. Youngkin closed his campaign by making an emotional argument to parents, pledging to make them central in their children\u2019s education while McAuliffe would remove so-called parental control. For Democrats going forward, finding an answer to cultural issues like these will be critical. Every Republican midterm campaign watched the results on Tuesday with eager eyes, hoping to use a similar strategy to defeat their Democratic opponent. But for Virginia Democrats who woke up to see their commonwealth in dramatically different hands on Wednesday morning, the totality of issues they faced in this race \u2013 and the possibility of the party not learning its lesson \u2013 is what worries them about Democrats\u2019 prospects going forward. \u201c(Youngkin\u2019s campaign) was having an emotional argument. And we were trying to have a rational one without an emotional response,\u201d said a senior Democratic operative working in Virginia. But, they added, \u201cBiden dragged us down. Democrats dragged us down. \u2026 We have a party in power that is just not doing anything.\u201d As for whether the party will learn its lessons from Virginia, the operative said it was too soon to tell. \u201cBut,\u201d they said, \u201ca place to start is getting some legislation done when Democrats are in power across the board.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, Arlette Saenz and Manu Raju contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "A number of trailblazing candidates made history this week, as CNN projected that people of color across the country were elected to top positions at both the state and city level. Here\u2019s a look at some of the historic firsts from Election Night 2021. Winsome Sears, a conservative Republican, will be Virginia\u2019s next lieutenant governor, breaking barriers as the first female and the first woman of color in the office in the commonwealth\u2019s 400-year legislative history. Sears defeated Democrat Del. Hala Ayala, also a woman of color. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic night \u2013 yes, it is \u2013 but I didn\u2019t run to make history. I just wanted to leave it better than I found it,\u201d Sears said before a crowd of supporters early Wednesday morning. Sears, who was born in Jamaica, was the first Black Republican woman to be elected to the Virginia General Assembly, representing the 90th district for one term. City Councilor Michelle Wu will become Boston\u2019s next mayor, making her the first woman and person of color elected to the top post in the city\u2019s history. Wu, a 36-year-old progressive Democrat who touted policies like a Green New Deal for Boston and a fare-free transit system, will now serve as mayor in a city which has long been led by White men. \u201cFrom every corner of our city, Boston has spoken. We are ready to meet this moment. We are ready to become a Boston for everyone,\u201d Wu said to a crowd of supporters Tuesday night. Wu clinched the title over City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George, who is also a woman of color. Previously, Wu was the first Asian American woman elected to the Boston City Council. While Wu is the first woman of color to be elected mayor in Boston, she is not the first woman of color to hold the seat. Wu will succeed acting mayor Kim Janey, Boston\u2019s first Black and female mayor. Janey, then-City Council President, was next in line to lead the city when Boston Mayor Marty Walsh was named President Joe Biden\u2019s Labor secretary in January. Pennsylvania State Rep. Ed Gainey was elected the first Black mayor of Pittsburgh on Tuesday. The Democratic politician bested Republican Tony Moreno, a retired Pittsburgh police officer, after running on a campaign to make Pittsburgh the country\u2019s most \u201csafe, affordable and diverse\u201d city and touting police reform and affordable housing. He has represented Pittsburgh in the state legislature since 2013 and previously worked for Pittsburgh Mayors Luke Ravenstahl and Tom Murphy. \u201cThis victory isn\u2019t just my victory, it\u2019s a Pittsburgh victory,\u201d Gainey said on Twitter Tuesday night. Aftab Pureval, a Democrat, was elected mayor of Cincinnati on Tuesday, becoming the first ever Asian American to hold the position. Pureval, a 39-year-old attorney, defeated city councilor David Mann, also a Democrat who previously served as mayor of Cincinnati and represented Ohio in the US House of Representatives, to clinch the city\u2019s top post. \u201cWords can\u2019t express how honored and excited I am to be the next Mayor of Cincinnati. Tonight, we made history! Let\u2019s get to work,\u201d Pureval said on Twitter Tuesday. Bruce Harrell, a Democrat, will become Seattle\u2019s first Asian American mayor. The moderate former city council president defeated progressive City Council President Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez, clinching the seat. Harrell, who is Japanese American and Black, is also Seattle\u2019s second Black mayor. Elaine O\u2019Neal will be first Black woman mayor of Durham, North Carolina. O\u2019Neal, a former judge and former interim dean of North Carolina Central University Law School, ran on boosting public safety, access to housing and jobs. Her opponent, City Council member Javiera Caballero, suspended her campaign after the primary but stayed on the ballot In addition to a number of historic firsts, New York City saw a historic second, as Eric Adams became the second Black mayor in the city\u2019s history. Adams, a Democrat, is a retired New York Police Department captain who embraced a public safety message. A Brooklyn native who currently serves as its borough president, Adams won a chaotic Democratic primary this summer on a promise to both beef up and reform the NYPD amid worries over a rise in violent crime. His message \u2013 that \u201cpublic safety is the prerequisite to prosperity\u201d \u2013 resonated with working class Democratic voters outside the traditionally liberal enclaves of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, which fueled his nomination.

            "article_content": "Tuesday\u2019s elections in states and cities across the country are set to serve as an early gauge of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency and the political environment headed into next year\u2019s midterm elections. The marquee contest is in Virginia, where Republican Glenn Youngkin aims to halt Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s bid to win back his old job. The race will reverberate across the country, as both parties seek to navigate a post-President Donald Trump landscape with control of Congress on the line. Meanwhile, in major cities across the country, Democrats will be making decisions about the direction of the party in intra-party mayoral contests that pit progressives against establishment figures. And in Minneapolis, the \u201cdefund the police\u201d progressive movement faces a major test. Here\u2019s what to watch Tuesday: The Virginia governor\u2019s race will be the most closely watched contest of the night, with both Republicans and Democrats viewing the neck-and-neck contest as a key bellwether for national sentiment headed into the 2022 midterms and beyond. McAuliffe, who served as governor from 2014 to 2018, is seeking a historic second stint in a commonwealth that bars governors from serving successive terms. McAuliffe has leaned heavily on the state\u2019s leftward tilt during his campaign, hoping to energize the same voters who helped Biden win Virginia by 10 percentage points in 2020. And he has done so by spending millions on television ads that link his opponent, businessman-turned-politician Youngkin, to former President Donald Trump, a political figure who remains deeply unpopular in some of Virginia\u2019s most vote-rich areas. Youngkin has tried to walk a fine line with Trump: Although he has kept him at arm\u2019s length in the close of the campaign, he has focused on many of the same issues that animated his base in 2020. Youngkin\u2019s campaign has sought to localize the race, hoping to animate a series of grievances aimed at Democratic leadership in Richmond and Washington, from what is taught in Virginia schools to how strict the commonwealth should be in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Every four years, the Virginia and New Jersey governor\u2019s races \u2013 one year after the presidential election and one year before the midterms \u2013 are seen as a test of the national political environment. New Jersey is favorable enough ground for Democrats that it isn\u2019t seen as competitive this year. But Virginia could be the most important contest of 2021. Usually, but not always, the pendulum swings against the president in the commonwealth. In fact, the only recent governor\u2019s race to buck that trend came in 2013, when McAuliffe claimed victory the year after then-President Barack Obama was reelected. Would a Youngkin win simply reflect the typical ebb and flow of American politics \u2013 or would it indicate Democrats\u2019 narrow congressional majorities are in grave danger in next year\u2019s midterms? It\u2019s impossible to know, and the electoral landscape could look very different by the fall of 2022. But a strong performance by Youngkin would send a clear message that with Trump out of office, the dynamics have shifted, and Democrats cannot rely on their Trump-era gains in the suburbs \u2013 which turned Virginia increasingly blue \u2013 to be permanent in a post-Trump environment. Gov. Phil Murphy appears to have a comfortable lead in his bid to become the first Democratic governor of New Jersey to be reelected since 1977. Barring a remarkable upset \u2013 GOP challenger Jack Ciattarelli, a businessman and former state lawmaker, trails Murphy by around 10 percentage points in recent polls \u2013 the streak will be broken and Democrats will have some evidence that an executive who has championed mask and vaccine mandates will be rewarded for it by voters. Victory for Murphy will also underscore the difficulty even moderate Republicans have distancing themselves from Trump, especially in blue states, and could represent a counter to Virginia, where the GOP gubernatorial nominee could be on course to outperform the former president. Trump has steered clear of Ciattarelli and Ciattarelli has kept his distance from Trump. But Murphy has hammered Ciattarelli, whose main message is on taxes, which voters have called the state\u2019s most pressing issue, on his appearance at a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally last year. (Ciattarelli said he was not fully aware of the event\u2019s theme.) Voters in Minneapolis, almost 18 months after the murder of George Floyd, will have the most significant chance to overhaul the city\u2019s police department by casting a vote in a local referendum that is being watched nationally as a test of the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement. Should the measure pass, the city\u2019s policing would be entirely remade: A Department of Public Safety would be created and if the city continued to employ officers, they would be organized by that department. The city would also dispatch a requirement to employ a minimum number of officers and control of the department would be split between the city council and the mayor. Nationally, the referendum is being viewed as a test of the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement, a slogan that gained traction in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing. Republicans have used the movement to attack Democrats, casting them as out of touch and weak on crime. Some Democrats have argued a rethinking of policing is needed in the wake of incidents like Floyd\u2019s murder. Locally, people on both sides of the issue have tried to downplay the national implications, with opponents arguing passage would not lead to the end of policing in the city and rejection at the ballot box would not mean a blanket statement on the defunding the police. Eric Adams won the narrowest of contests to become the New York City Democrats\u2019 mayoral nominee. His race on Tuesday will be less dramatic \u2013 the Brooklyn borough president is a lock to be elected the next Big Apple mayor. His ascent, though, is about more than the city, as Adams and his campaign have been touted by top Democrats as a case-study in how the party should go forward \u2013 in New York and around the country. Adams, a former police captain, has sought to portray himself as a working class candidate. And on primary day, working class parts of the city \u2013 mostly outside Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn \u2013 delivered for him. While he has been dismissive, and sometimes confrontational, with the party\u2019s left wing activists, Adams has also \u2013 on issues like public safety, the centerpiece of his campaign \u2013 adopted some progressives ideas about prevention and early intervention. Beyond New York, here are several other mayoral contests to watch Tuesday: Boston: Boston is set to make history by electing a woman of color for the first time in a city long dominated by White men. Polls have shown Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu, a champion of progressive policies, opening a commanding lead over her more moderate rival Annissa Essaibi George, who also serves as a Boston city councilor-at-large. Buffalo: Democratic Socialist India Walton defeated four-term Mayor Byron Brown in Buffalo\u2019s Democratic primary in June, notching a stunning victory for the progressive left as she charted a course to become the first socialist mayor of a major American city in more than 60 years. But to win the mayor\u2019s office, she\u2019ll have to defeat Brown again. The incumbent mayor is mounting an aggressive write-in campaign. Atlanta: Fourteen candidates are vying to replace Democratic Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who\u2019s not running for reelection. The contest is happening amid alarm about the spike in violent crime, as well as controversy over an effort by the residents of the wealthy community of Buckhead to break off from the capital and create their own city. Polls suggest that a large swath of the electorate is still undecided, but the leading candidates \u2013 including former Mayor Kasim Reed, City Council President Felicia Moore and Councilman Andre Dickens \u2013 have put Atlanta\u2019s crime rate at the forefront of their campaigns. If no candidate receives at least 50% plus one, Atlanta will hold a run-off election on November 30 to decide the winner.",

            "article_content": "Voters across the country head to the polls Tuesday to decide a series of races that will test the national political landscape and the direction of the Democratic Party a year into Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. In Virginia, Democrats hope to prevent the pendulum of American politics from swinging back in Republicans\u2019 favor in a governor\u2019s race that will serve as a gauge of the national environment \u2013 both as a referendum on the early stages of Biden\u2019s presidency and as a test of whether Democrats\u2019 efforts to keep their opposition to former President Donald Trump at the forefront of their campaigns will continue to motivate voters a year after Trump left office.

Here\u2019s a list of the major contests to watch Tuesday: Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial contest between Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin will be the most closely watched race of the night, serving as a key bellwether for national sentiment headed into the 2022 midterms and beyond. Virginia has tilted toward Democrats over the last decade, but McAuliffe and Youngkin are locked in what polls show to be a neck-and-neck race with more than 1.1 million ballots already cast during early voting. A win for McAuliffe would be a validation for President Joe Biden and his agenda, while a win for Youngkin, who has tried to walk a fine line on handling support from former President Donald Trump, would provide a jolt of momentum for Republicans and could provide Republicans running in competitive states with a roadmap for handling Trump. Six states will vote on 24 statewide ballot measures in Tuesday's elections Voters in Minneapolis, nearly a year-and-a-half after the murder of George Floyd, will go to the ballot box with a chance to either approve or reject a referendum that would significantly overhaul policing in the city. The referendum is being watched nationally as a test of the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement, a controversial slogan that gained traction among progressives in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing and has since been used against Democrats across the country.

But in reality, Walton, a 39-year-old Democratic Socialist and first-time candidate, is locked in a tough race with Brown, who after losing the nomination and failing in the courts to create a new party line ahead of the November 2 vote, launched a write-in campaign. The showdown between Walton and Brown, who is seeking a fifth term, escalated over the summer and into the fall as a proxy fight between the city and state\u2019s growing progressive movement and more business-friendly, establishment Democrats determined to block Walton\u2019s ascent \u2013 and prevent her from becoming the first socialist mayor of a major American city in more than 60 years. As early voting begins 10 days out from the election, both candidates are running fiery campaigns that have drawn attention from well outside Buffalo, as the Democratic Party\u2019s ideological split comes under the spotlight in New York\u2019s second largest city. If she can defeat Brown a second time, Walton would become the first woman, and first Black woman, to serve as mayor of Buffalo. Brown, who is also Black, first won the office in 2005. In 2008, he was among the rumored replacements for Hillary Clinton, who was leaving the Senate to become then President-elect Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state. The appointment ultimately went to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Brown stayed put, winning re-election three times. But a backlash to his handling of the protests against police violence following the murder of George Floyd in Minnesota last year, the city\u2019s uneven economic revival, and an increasing level of organization among progressives helped set the stage for his shocking primary loss. Brown, by his own admission, hurt his own cause by largely refusing to engage with Walton early on. He did not debate her during the primary campaign and was seen by many as missing in action on the trail. Then, in late June, Walton won the nomination in a low-turnout election \u2013 with fewer than 25,000 Democrats voting \u2013 that sent reverberations across the country and immediately made Walton a new champion of the working class left. Democrats in New York and around the country took note \u2013 and sides \u2013 as it became clear that Brown would not quietly concede and get behind his challenger. Erie County Democratic leadership quickly backed Walton and has stuck by her as Brown, after his efforts to get his name printed on the November ballot under a newly-created Buffalo Party were rejected, ramped up his general election campaign \u2013 and his slogan, \u201cWrite Down Byron Brown,\u201d took flight. But Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state party chairman, Jay Jacobs, have remained neutral. State Attorney General Letitia James, a potential gubernatorial candidate next year whose investigation into allegations of sexual harassment against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo led to his resignation, has not yet issued an endorsement. Other have been less coy. On Thursday night, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2013 who has held progressives close ahead of his own re-election campaign in 2022 \u2013 announced his support for Walton, calling the nurse and activist an \u201cinspiring community leader\u201d with a \u201cclear progressive vision for her hometown.\u201d And on Saturday, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be in to Buffalo for an event with Walton, who has already been joined by Jumaane Williams, the New York City Public Advocate and another potential candidate for governor in 2022. The most prominent out-of-towner to campaign in Buffalo for Brown is New York Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat, who is also rumored to be considering a challenge to Hochul next year. Though Jacobs, the state party leader and a close ally of Cuomo during his decade in office, has not officially chosen a side, he set off a firestorm this week when, in an interview with Spectrum News, he defended party leaders\u2019 decisions not to back the nominee. \u201cLet\u2019s take a scenario, very different, where David Duke, you remember him? The grand wizard of the KKK? He moves to New York, he becomes a Democrat, and he runs for mayor in the city of Rochester, which has a low primary turnout, and he wins the Democratic line. I have to endorse David Duke? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Jacobs said. The parallel provoked outrage across the state and Jacobs quickly issued an apology. But his comment underscored the tensions animating the business end of the campaign. Walton, speaking to CNN shortly after the initial remarks began to go viral, said she was disappointed but \u201cnot surprised.\u201d \u201cI won the Democratic primary. I won because I worked hard. I won because people are ready for change. I won because Democrats turned out and voted for me,\u201d Walton said. \u201cBut we have corporate Democrats who are so desperate to cling to what little power they have left and stave off the progressive wing of our party.\u201d (She later publicly accepted Jacobs\u2019 apology.) Brown also denounced Jacobs\u2019 comment, saying \u201cthere was no place\u201d for the analogy and that it was \u201cwrong.\u201d But the mayor\u2019s scorched-earth general election campaign has also drawn condemnation from Walton and her allies. Brown has repeatedly questioned Walton\u2019s qualifications, her record as a nurse and nonprofit leader, and accused her of wanting to defund the police \u2013 the latter charge clashing with Walton\u2019s campaign proposal, which offers a more moderate path that does not include lay-offs, but would redirect more than $7 million from the force. Brown stood by his attacks, citing documentation in local news outlets. And in an interview with CNN this week, he doubled down. \u201cThe stakes are dire and extreme if she was to get elected,\u201d Brown said. \u201cShe would take our city horribly back. She would compromise our public safety. She would raise our taxes. She would attack other elected officials up and down the ballot. It would be a nightmare for every person in our community.\u201d Brown also accused Walton of hubris, touted the city\u2019s economic gains during his tenure \u2013 the so-called \u201cBuffalo Renaissance\u201d \u2013 and confidently declared that his rival\u2019s narrow advantage in the primary would dissolve when a larger share of the more than 150,000 registered voters across the city have their say. \u201cAfter the primary, she already began calling herself the mayor-elect, just another example of her inexperience or lack of understanding of this process,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd what we\u2019ve seen from public polls, our internal polls and all the data that has come into us, there are many more people in the city of Buffalo that want to vote for me than want to vote for Ms. Walton.\u201d Walton, though, has not stood still since prevailing in June. She received early support from the Working Families Party, a New York-based progressive organization that has continued to spend on her behalf, including with a more than $100,000 ad buy announced last week. She also hired a new communications director, Jesse Myerson, and campaign manager, Drisana Hughes, who previously worked as the deputy campaign manager for Alvin Bragg\u2019s successful bid for the Democratic nomination to be Manhattan\u2019s next district attorney. Brown\u2019s increasingly hardline rhetoric, Walton said, was misleading and an attempt to demonize her in front of the broader electorate \u2013 with Democratic turnout expected to rise and independents and Republicans now going to the polls \u2013 that will decide the race. The \u201chonorable\u201d route, she added, would have been for Brown to concede after he lost the primary and not, as he did afterward, accept help and support from Republicans. \u201cEvery ad that he comes out with is an attack on me and making people feel afraid of me or attempting to do so,\u201d Walton told CNN. \u201cAn honorable campaign would be him sharing the plans that he has for the future of Buffalo. An honorable plan would be him owning up to the fact that he disrespected Buffalo voters by not running a primary contest.\u201d Brown\u2019s performance, or lack thereof, in the primary puzzled some local political experts. Jacob Neiheisel, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo, said it had become clear that the incumbent could be vulnerable after last summer and, as Walton has hammered away at on the trail, \u201cthat for a number of years there have been sort of two recoveries in Buffalo. There are certain zip codes where things are on track. They\u2019re doing well by a lot of different metrics. And then there are others that are not.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t campaign, he didn\u2019t debate. The rationale that was articulated was that he didn\u2019t to give free coverage to his opponent. I think he, or someone in his camp, should\u2019ve seen this coming. If you look at the FCC filings, India Walton has a real media team working for her,\u201d Neiheisel said. \u201cAnd all of that was public well in advance of when (Brown) decided that he should be worried.\u201d In addition to the growing ranks of high-profile support from outside of Buffalo, including an endorsement from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Walton also asked for and secured the support of the Erie County Democratic Party. Its chairman, Jeremy Zellner, has stuck by Walton despite split loyalties within his own committee and the party\u2019s desire to focus on boosting Democrats in local races against Republicans. \u201cThe rhetoric has gone through the roof,\u201d Zellner told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a lot of Republicans in our county who are throwing bombs about policing and so forth. The fact is, India Walton wants a safe community. She\u2019s lived here her whole life. She\u2019s raised her family here her whole life. She wants to have a safe city of Buffalo and anything contrary that\u2019s being said about that is just not true.\u201d Zellner said he hopes that voters, in the final stretch of a race that has reached \u201ca fever pitch here with the negativity,\u201d would focus on the facts and the candidates\u2019 plans for the city. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s going to matter now is, in the next two weeks, who can get their people to the polls?\u201d Zellner said. \u201cBoth candidates are well-funded, both candidates are strong and I\u2019m really looking forward to hopefully staying positive and seeing what happens over the next two weeks.\u201d His wishes seem unlikely to be granted as outside interest in the campaign grows and Democratic officials from around the state seek to set the stakes and make their mark on the race. Suozzi, the congressman from Long Island who endorsed Brown at a rally earlier this month, said victory for Walton would be a stain on the Democratic brand and invite new and more damaging attacks from Republicans. \u201cIf the Democrats keep on allowing the socialist message to infiltrate the Democratic platform, we will lose. We\u2019ll lose in Buffalo, we\u2019ll lose in New York state, we\u2019ll lose in the country,\u201d Suozzi told CNN. \u201cIf you want to be a Democratic Socialist, then start your own party.\u201d Walton, who chalked up Suozzi\u2019s interest in the race to his own political aspirations, dismissed those claims and took aim at the moderate and centrist factions of the Democratic Party. \u201cThe brand of the Suozzi-type Democrats is one of the disappointment,\u201d Walton said. \u201cWe are not seeing the policies that Americans, in general, want being most forward. And that is the reason for the rise of the India Waltons of the world.\u201d Progressive leaders are indeed hoping to see more candidates like Walton. Many view the coming election as an opportunity to entice more working class candidates with backgrounds in community organizing into the electoral ring. Walton\u2019s success, said Sochie Nnaemeka, the New York Working Families Party state director, could mirror the knock-on effects that followed the victories of other previously unknown, upstart candidates who knocked off entrenched figures who had lost touch with their constituents. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see the pipeline grow,\u201d Nnaemeka told CNN. \u201cWe saw a whole wave of new and diverse class of hungry, clear leaders running for office either pulled in by the excitement of candidates like AOC, (State Sen.) Alessandra Biaggi, or pushed in because of disgust at the Trump moment.\u201d That wave, she added, has not only changed the dynamics of state politics, but been crucial to influencing the parameters of the debate in Washington, where leading Democrats have embraced many of the progressive movement\u2019s top priorities. \u201cThe shift away from the cynical, small incrementalism of the Democratic Party toward big programs, big universalist ideas, and how it\u2019s actually being espoused by the sitting president is because progressives are leading,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s because the progressive way of governance is actually leading that we have a moderate president like Joe Biden leaning toward that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden was waiting on a desolate, darkened Afghan tarmac in 2002 when bad news arrived from Washington: He and his entourage were being blocked by the Pentagon from taking a spare seat on a departing military cargo plane. Standing in the cold, the hulking planes rumbling in the background, Biden knew who to call. \u201cMr. Secretary,\u201d he told Colin Powell over a satellite phone, \u201cthey said you kicked me off this plane.\u201d Powell had not, in fact, kicked Biden or anyone off the plane. Then serving as President George W. Bush\u2019s secretary of state, Powell had an idea who might have. \u201cRumsfeld!\u201d he declared, uttering the name of President George W. Bush\u2019s first defense secretary. \u201cGoddammit!\u201d After a fiery call to US Central Command, Powell had secured seats for Biden and his team to leave. The scene from Bagram Air Base, which Biden recounted in his memoir \u201cPromises To Keep,\u201d came months after the American invasion of Afghanistan. Then serving as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden was on a fact-finding mission for a conflict he\u2019d begun to question. Powell, who died Monday at 84, had already found himself enmeshed in a foreign policy battle with fellow Cabinet members for Bush\u2019s ear. The disputes would intensify over the coming years as colleagues like Vice President Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld agitated for invading Iraq \u2013 a decision Powell later said he had reservations about, even as he made the case for it in public. Colin Powell, first Black US secretary of state, dies of Covid-19 complications amid cancer battle Biden often found himself on Powell\u2019s side. Stalking the hallways of power together for decades, the two men represented an era of bipartisan policy agreement that now seems antiquated and even, in the case of the Iraq War, ill-advised. In his final year, Powell seemed as horrified as Biden at the state of the Republican Party, which he said had allowed conditions to foment that led to the violence of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. \u201cI became friends with Colin Powell, who we just lost,\u201d Biden said Monday afternoon on the White House South Lawn, where he was speaking at at event honoring teachers. \u201cHe\u2019s not only a dear friend and a patriot, one of our great military leaders and a man of overwhelming decency. But this is a guy born the son of immigrants in New York City, raised in Harlem in the South Bronx. A graduate from the City College of New York, and he rose to the highest ranks not only in the military, but also in areas of foreign policy and statecraft.\u201d Earlier in the day, Biden had ordered flags flown at half-staff to honor the life of his friend. \u201cOver our many years working together \u2013 even in disagreement \u2013 Colin was always someone who gave you his best and treated you with respect,\u201d Biden wrote in a statement. \u201cFrom his front-seat view of history, advising presidents and shaping our nation\u2019s policies, Colin led with his personal commitment to the democratic values that make our country strong,\u201d Biden added. \u201cTime and again, he put country before self, before party, before all else \u2013 in uniform and out \u2013 and it earned him the universal respect of the American people.\u201d Biden mourns loss of Colin Powell: 'He will be remembered as one of our great Americans' Bound by concepts of civility, experience and working-class values \u2013 and a love of vintage muscle cars \u2013 Biden and Powell experienced alongside one another some of the last century\u2019s final foreign policy moments, and this century\u2019s first ones. For most of those decades they were in opposing camps, Biden a Democrat and Powell a Republican. They met in the middle \u2013 and, in 2016, on a racetrack with Jay Leno, where they revved their Corvettes and exchanged some light trash talk. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d Powell called out to Biden. \u201cI kept looking in the mirror and I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d Biden viewed Powell through the lens of his decades-long military career, during which he claimed political independence. He regarded him as a steadying influence on a string of US presidents and saw in his worldview a foreign policy doctrine that, at times, matched his own \u2014 rooted in clear objectives and support from the American people. \u201cAbove all, Colin was my friend,\u201d Biden wrote in his statement. \u201cEasy to share a laugh with. A trusted confidant in good and hard times. He could drive his Corvette Stingray like nobody\u2019s business\u2014something I learned firsthand on the race track when I was Vice President. And I am forever grateful for his support of my candidacy for president and for our shared battle for the soul of the nation. I will miss being able to call on his wisdom in the future.\u201d Biden came to view Powell as a steadying \u2013 if often crowded-out \u2013 voice in Bush\u2019s administration. He repeatedly appeared before Biden\u2019s foreign relations panel, including during Powell\u2019s confirmation hearings when Biden voiced his wonder at Powell\u2019s performance. \u201cI have not seen any notes slipped to you and there has not been a binder in front of you, and this has been a tour de force on your part, and you should be complimented publicly for that,\u201d Biden said before the committee voted unanimously to advance his nomination. Colin Powell's life in pictures In Powell\u2019s early days serving as Bush\u2019s secretary of state \u2013 a return to public life after a decades-long military career that gained him widespread trust among the American people, according to polls \u2013 Biden often encountered him in the Senate or at the White House. When Biden was summoned to the White House to consult with Bush ahead of his first trip to Europe, he arrived to the Oval Office just as Powell was leaving. Bush called out to his top diplomat so Biden could hear. \u201cColin!\u201d Bush said, cackling. \u201cRemember to pack clean underwear.\u201d \u201cSee what I have to put up with, Mr. Chairman?\u201d Powell joked as he passed Biden on his way out. The ensuing years would test Powell\u2019s influence in the administration, a dynamic Biden watched closely from his perch on Capitol Hill. As hawks like Cheney and Rumsfeld advocated for war in Iraq, Biden was confident in Powell\u2019s ability to offer a dissenting voice \u2013 even as he questioned whether the secretary of state was being kept in the loop. \u201cPowell and the State Department were as much in the dark as I had been on that sightless night on the tarmac in Bagram,\u201d Biden wrote in his book. \u201cAs I look back on it, I have come to believe that no matter how close Powell was to the president, it seemed George W. Bush had a way of keeping his foreign policy hidden from his own secretary of state.\u201d When Biden expressed reservations about invading Iraq directly to Powell, he often received an auspicious response: \u201cCall the president,\u201d Powell would tell Biden. \u201cTell him what you just told me.\u201d In the end, both Powell and Biden took steps they later regretted in the lead-up to the Iraq War. Powell\u2019s lengthy speech at the United Nations laying out the case for a US-led war to disarm Saddam Hussein helped persuade many Americans \u2013 including Biden \u2013 to get behind the effort; later, Powell said the address would forever be a \u201cblot\u201d on his record.   Biden voted to authorize the use of military force in Iraq in 2003 but had come to view the vote as a mistake by 2005. Fifteen years after, he was still forced to answer for it \u2013 sometimes in misleading ways \u2013 during his run for president last year. Catching up years after the invasion of Iraq at a birthday party, Powell and Biden began to reminisce about his time in the Bush White House. Standing on a back porch as other partygoers went inside, Powell sounded flummoxed by the experience. \u201cI think I have him. I think he agrees. And then he goes the opposite way,\u201d Powell told Biden. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d Biden took a more jaundiced view. \u201cI remember that night thinking how Powell was kidding himself about Bush, like he still had to rationalize to himself that he\u2019d been outmaneuvered in a political game by these two shrewd old hands; he still wouldn\u2019t recognize that President Bush had simply made the wrong decisions,\u201d he wrote in his book. Still, the mutual respect between the two men persisted. By the time Biden was making his third run for president, Powell had completed a break with the GOP that began in 2008, when he endorsed Barack Obama \u2013 and by extension Biden, his running mate \u2013 in the final weeks of a heated presidential election. Powell\u2019s decision to endorse Obama over his friend and fellow Vietnam War veteran Sen. John McCain was a turning point; his backing eased concerns among some moderate voters that Obama lacked sufficient foreign policy experience, the same concerns Biden\u2019s selection as a running mate were meant to alleviate. Colin Powell was a longtime Republican. But he often criticized the party's race problem The endorsement launched a private relationship between Obama and Powell \u2013 the first Black president and the first Black secretary of state \u2013 that lasted Obama\u2019s presidency. Obama, along with other top administration officials, consulted Powell on the war in Afghanistan and other foreign policy matters. Powell, still a moderate Republican, offered light criticism of how the young administration was focusing its energies. \u201cHe should have focused on the economy \u2026 to the exclusion of most everything else domestically,\u201d Powell told CNN\u2019s Larry King in 2010. \u201cWhen you\u2019re starting out as a president, you have to figure out (what) is most important.\u201d Yet in 2012, Powell endorsed Obama again, this time over Mitt Romney. He said at the time that he believed it continuity \u2013 and he wasn\u2019t sure where Romney stood on foreign policy. \u201cI signed on for a long patrol with President Obama, and I don\u2019t think this is the time to make such a sudden change,\u201d he said. He would never again endorse a Republican presidential candidate, backing Hillary Clinton in 2016 and finally Biden last year. The prospect of another four years of Trump \u2013 the same motivation that drove Biden into the race \u2013 had brought the men together again. \u201cI certainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year,\u201d Powell told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, adding he is \u201cvery close to Joe Biden on a social matter and on a political matter.\u201d \u201cI worked with him for 35, 40 years,\u201d he said, \u201cand he is now the candidate, and I will be voting for him.\u201d Speaking at Biden\u2019s own virtual nominating convention, Powell argued his longtime Washington colleague was the best candidate to win over moderate Republicans. \u201cJoe Biden will be a president we will all be proud to salute,\u201d Powell added. \u201cWith Joe Biden in the White House, you will never doubt that he will stand with our friends and stand up to our adversaries \u2013 never the other way around,\u201d Powell said in a video released by the Democratic National Convention Committee ahead of the second night of convention programming. Five months later, after would-be insurrectionists stormed the US Capitol where Biden\u2019s election victory was being certified, Powell had made his final break with the Republican Party. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not a fellow of anything right now,\u201d Powell said on CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just a citizen who has voted Republican, voted Democrat, throughout my entire career, and right now I\u2019m just watching my country and not concerned with parties.\u201d \u201cWe need people that will speak the truth,\u201d Powell added.",

            "article_content": "Jill Biden on Friday afternoon will flex her considerable campaigning muscle for the first time as first lady of the United States when she travels to New Jersey and Virginia. The first lady will be appearing alongside two Democratic gubernatorial candidates who are both locked in contentious battles with their Republican opponents. For Biden \u2013 who was asked by both of the candidates to travel to their states for the events, according to an official familiar with the requests \u2013 the stump is a familiar arena and persuasive campaigning is one of Biden\u2019s sweet spots. Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign knew it had a secret weapon in Jill Biden during the 2020 race. In Iowa alone, Jill Biden went to more than 70 counties in the early days of the former vice president\u2019s candidacy, singing the praises of her husband and his policies. She would campaign there for days on end, then wake in the wee hours of a Thursday or Friday morning, catch a flight from Des Moines back to Washington, hop in an Uber and be in her classroom at Northern Virginia Community College by 10 a.m. In the eyes of the people who were trying to get her husband elected, that\u2019s how important Jill Biden was to the campaign. Now, New Jersey\u2019s first-term incumbent governor, Phil Murphy, will attempt to capitalize on her persuasive powers as well. Murphy is up against Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli, and the main sticking point is the state\u2019s response to Covid-19. Murphy supporters feel he handled it well; Ciattarelli\u2019s camp think New Jersey\u2019s lockdowns and mask mandates are overly restrictive. And on Friday evening, Biden will head from Murphy\u2019s event to Terry McAuliffe\u2019s in Richmond, Virginia, where McAuliffe \u2013 a longtime friend of Biden world \u2013 is in a close race for governor with Republican Glenn Youngkin, and the issues regarding Covid are much the same. Both races are the only two gubernatorial elections before next years\u2019 midterms, and both could be harbingers of what Democrats might face come 2022. As such, Jill Biden, the campaign surrogate, is entering one of the most contentious political landscapes in recent American history. Part of Biden\u2019s appeal, says one person who worked with her on the presidential campaign, is her relatability, a boon to undecided voters, particularly women. \u201cJill was the most effective messenger for Joe Biden and his campaign knew that,\u201d says the former Biden campaign official. \u201cThere was a reason why she did three to four solo events a day in those early contests, on Zoom throughout the pandemic and in the general election.\u201d \u201cI think she appeals to working- and middle-class voters,\u201d says Kate Andersen Brower, an expert on first ladies and the author of \u201cFirst Women: The Grace and Power of America\u2019s Modern First Ladies.\u201d \u201cThere was never a sense that Melania Trump could tell you how much a gallon of milk costs at the grocery store, whereas I think Jill Biden absolutely knows the answer.\u201d Jill Biden\u2019s casual familiarity with voters has been her most valuable commodity. Unlike Michelle Obama, a gifted public speaker whose effectiveness at campaign events led Obama\u2019s staff to nickname her \u201cthe closer\u201d \u2013 and was best-known for on-stage speeches to larger audiences \u2013 Jill Biden\u2019s campaign skills were more about the more intimate venues. During the presidential campaign, she found she was most effective at coffee shops, libraries or union halls \u2013 again unlike Michelle Obama in that she would make herself available to local media at the same time. Jill Biden recognized, says another former Biden campaign official, she could earn free press just by being approachable instead of using fundraising dollars for on-air ads. \u201cThe first lady is the best surrogate you can get, especially when they can connect, like Dr. Biden can, to bread and butter issues like education and child care,\u201d said Brower, who notes that as first lady, Laura Bush was a prolific fundraiser for Republicans in tight races, often hosting small, private, high-dollar events. \u201cUsually, first ladies have much higher approval ratings, so they can appeal to a broader audience than their husbands. They tend to be less polarizing because they usually do not weigh in on hot-button political issues,\u201d added Brower. Biden is expected to give remarks for approximately ten minutes at both the Murphy and McAuliffe events on Friday, a person familiar with the planning tells CNN. It\u2019s an important, but light, lift for a first lady who as a political spouse of four-plus decades has had to at times get creative for votes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing she won\u2019t do for her husband, to get him elected,\u201d says a second person who worked on Biden campaigns for several years. \u201cYou name it, Jill will get out there \u2013 she\u2019ll travel, she\u2019ll host a backyard barbeque, she\u2019ll talk to the angry school board member, she\u2019ll sit down with a senator.\u201d The challenges of the pandemic were real for both presidential candidates during the 2020 campaign. Though much attention was given to Joe Biden\u2019s drive-in rallies, it was Jill Biden who did far more of them \u2013 solo \u2013 racking up a dozen drive-in events in parking lots across the country. And in March 2020, it was Jill Biden who made the Super Tuesday headlines, jumping on the stage in California to physically stop a protester from coming toward her husband. \u201cI really do think her fierce physical defense of her husband is the most memorable moment from any of Biden\u2019s campaigns. She didn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d said Brower. \u201cI think that people can relate to that fierce and innate quality of wanting to protect someone you love. In that case it was physical, but there have been times I\u2019m sure when she\u2019s wanted to jump in and publicly defend him over something he\u2019s done or said that he\u2019s been criticized for.\u201d The Friday gubernatorial events are likely just a teaser for a more robust schedule of campaign events to come for her as Democrats stare down midterm elections, said the official who worked with her on the presidential campaign. \u201cShe\u2019s got that down-home Philly girl persona, it\u2019s a charm-offensive she knows how to operate, and it\u2019s not inauthentic,\u201d says the person.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden traveled to mid-Michigan on Tuesday as he looks to regain momentum on his twin economic packages, which remain stalled on Capitol Hill because of sharp divisions within his own party about the size and scope of the plans. During a speech on the trip, Biden argued that both components of his Build Back Better agenda \u2013 a $1.2 trillion infrastructure package and a larger $3.5 trillion bill to expand the social safety net \u2013 are essential to the country\u2019s economic growth, particularly to support middle-class and working families. Biden said he feels the country is at a historic turning point and that the country needs to make the kind of large-scale investments that competitors like China are making in order to kick-start the economy. The President highlighted China\u2019s spending in education \u2013 particularly on early and higher education \u2013 and argued the US needs to make similar investments. \u201cWe risk losing our edge as a nation. Our infrastructure used to be the best in the world, literally not figuratively,\u201d Biden said. \u201cToday, according to the world economic forum, we rank 13th. \u2026 All those investments that fueled a strong economy, we\u2019ve taken our foot off the gas. The world has taken notice, by the way, including our adversaries and now they\u2019re closing the gap in a big way.\u201d In addition to infrastructure, Biden said the country needs to continue to invest in its citizens, pushing measures included in the social safety net proposal being held up by Democratic infighting. He specifically highlighted investments in public education, affordable child care and the child tax credit as well as combating the climate crisis. The President criticized Republicans for their tax cuts for the wealthy as compared with the provisions in his legislative proposals, saying, \u201cMy friends on the other team have no problem giving billionaires and millionaires gigantic tax breaks. This is a tax cut.\u201d But he also argued that his proposals \u201care not about left versus right, or moderate versus progressive, or anything that pits Americans against one another.\u201d \u201cThese bills are about competitiveness versus complacency. They\u2019re about opportunity versus decay. They\u2019re about leading the world or continue to let the world pass us by, which is literally happening,\u201d he continued, later adding, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about two pieces of legislation, it\u2019s about the inflection point I mentioned earlier we are in our history, the world history.\u201d Biden spoke at the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 324 training facility in Howell, and received a tour ahead of his remarks. The trip to Michigan came after the President met virtually with Democratic members of the House to discuss the two economic packages. Senior White House officials were up on Capitol Hill last week trying to broker an agreement but were unsuccessful in hammering out a framework that enough members would sign on to, which forced Democrats to punt on the agenda. In a statement Tuesday afternoon, the White House said the meeting was a \u201cproductive discussion about how each of these economic growth packages, both physical and human infrastructure, are central to how we ensure our economy delivers for the middle class and secure our competitiveness in the world.\u201d Biden told reporters after his speech in Michigan that he hopes West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin \u2013 a moderate in the party who holds a key vote in the evenly split Senate \u2013 would support a spending package with a price tag above the $2.2 trillion currently being floated. Asked if he thinks Manchin would support a social safety net package of more than $2.2 trillion, Biden said, \u201cWell, you heard him on television today, it sure sounds like he\u2019s moving. I hope that\u2019s the case.\u201d On Tuesday, Manchin did not rule out a range between $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion for the package. Biden also made clear that he knows he won\u2019t be able to get all aspects of what he wants to include in his social safety net legislation, but said he thinks a bill will ultimately get done and he plans to build off of that package over time. When asked ahead of his departure from Michigan what he intends to cut from that package to trim the cost by about $1 trillion, Biden said, \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re negotiating now.\u201d \u201cMy objective is to get everything that I campaigned on passed eventually. It won\u2019t all happen at once. \u2026 We\u2019ll get a compromise. But it doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the end of what\u2019s in the rest of the package,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, the deadline to raise the debt ceiling to avoid the US defaulting for the first time ever is less than two weeks away. Congress has until October 18 to increase the country\u2019s borrowing limit, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned lawmakers last week, or there could be catastrophic consequences. Biden said on Monday he couldn\u2019t guarantee the debt ceiling would be raised in time because of \u201chypocritical, dangerous and disgraceful\u201d Republican opposition. Congressional Republicans are refusing to supply any votes to raise the debt limit, and Biden said they should vote on a bipartisan basis to pay for bills for which both parties are responsible. A nonprofit advocacy group trying to build support for Biden\u2019s policy agenda announced it was launching a televised ad campaign in Michigan ahead of the President\u2019s visit. Build Back Together posted on Twitter: \u201cWe are launching a six-figure TV investment in Michigan, ahead of @POTUS trip to Howell, to highlight how the #BuildBackBetter agenda will create jobs and lower costs for everyday families, while making the ultra-wealthy finally pay their fair share!\u201d Howell is located in a key swing district to watch ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. The district, which stretches from the heavily Democratic state capital of Lansing through more Republican rural parts of southeastern Michigan toward the edge of the Detroit suburbs, is the home of moderate Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who was first elected in 2018. Slotkin was on site for Biden\u2019s visit. Former President Donald Trump bested Biden in the 2020 presidential election in Livingston County, which is where Howell is located, by 60.5% to 37.9%. In 2016, Trump led Hillary Clinton 61.7% to 32.2%. Slotkin won Michigan\u2019s 8th Congressional District, which includes Livingston County, 50.9% to 47.3%. This story has been updated with further developments Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "As President Joe Biden makes his presidential debut at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, the question is not whether America wants to lead the world any longer, but whether it can. During his inaugural address, Biden promised that \u201cwe will not lead merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.\u201d But eight months on, that shining example is looking a little tarnished \u2013 even as the US remains the indispensable anchor of Western democracy. Increasing doubts surround Biden\u2019s self-described foreign policy expertise and his capacity to both quell America\u2019s raging domestic political chaos and to put a superpower\u2019s stamp on a world bristling with challenges to US authority. Global uncertainty about Biden\u2019s presidency runs deeper than the debate over whether he is pushing a kinder version of ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d creed, following the chaotic US exit from Afghanistan and a spat with France after the US and United Kingdom subverted their longtime ally\u2019s submarine deal with Australia. Trump used his UN addresses to lay out his vision of a world of individual sovereign powers individually pursuing self-interest. Biden, for all his current domestic focus, has long been an internationalist committed to US alliances. But for 70 years following World War II, the United States for the most part offered strength, predictability and strategic certainty. Its might at home translated to power abroad and it bankrolled and bolstered the West against totalitarian threats to democracy, despite periods of domestic political strife. That ended with Trump\u2019s erratic, temperamental presidency, which put US postwar alliances in Europe and Asia to their greatest test. And while Biden lacks the ex-President\u2019s volcanic character, a new age of friendship with allies did not suddenly dawn with a new leader in the Oval Office. The new President has exacerbated, rather than eradicated, questions about US staying power abroad in defense of its vital national interests. And amid China\u2019s rise, Russia\u2019s power games and emerging threats like cyberwarfare and climate change, America\u2019s reputation as a bulwark against global threats is in doubt. Biden set to address world leaders at the UN General Assembly The United States still has plenty of advantages. Its easy access to capital powers technological innovation. A young, diverse population is a growth engine. Its state-of-the-art military technology has few peers. Millions want a piece of US culture and markets \u2013 the fury of European powers over pandemic travel restrictions for vaccinated citizens, which the administration only announced on Monday it would soon lift, proves that. But America\u2019s fierce political polarization, supercharged by Trump\u2019s presidency, will still undercut Biden\u2019s vows Tuesday that \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d When he warns that democracy is in peril around the world, Biden will do so from the extraordinary position of being falsely accused by his predecessor of stealing the last election. US presidents usually use the UN to blast coup attempts. Biden is the first to appear before the world body in the wake of a homegrown assault on the world\u2019s most important democracy, following the Capitol Insurrection by Trump supporters on January 6. Questions about American resolve abroad are only deepened by national divides that are broader now than since the Civil War. And if Trump does not return for the 2024 campaign, many US allies fear one of his acolytes will still win the White House. An eighth of the way through Biden\u2019s term, the refusal of Trump to accept his defeat and successful attempts by Republican legislatures to suppress voting have only exacerbated concerns that US democracy may be yet to face its greatest threat. Some of the President\u2019s own decisions may also undercut his speech. If he chooses to speak out in favor of human rights, including women\u2019s rights \u2013 another plank of his foreign policy \u2013 his message will be weakened by harsh new Taliban restrictions imposed on women and girls following the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Pledges to pursue relentless \u201cover the horizon\u201d military action against terrorists will recall the tragedy of an Afghan family, including seven children, killed in a mistaken drone strike in Kabul. Biden\u2019s vows to restore American alliances look less convincing amid the worst diplomatic showdown with France in decades and after what appeared to perfunctory consultations with allies over leaving Afghanistan. Joe Biden's challenge at his first UN General Assembly: Convince allies he's not another Trump US economic might is a vital element of Washington\u2019s power. But it could cause chaos within weeks since Republicans are refusing to agree to raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limit, a crisis that could tip the US economy into default and the global economy into crisis. Biden\u2019s attempts to lead the world in the battle against climate change risk being undone not by Republicans but his own Democratic Party. Splits between moderates and progressives are imperiling spending and infrastructure bills containing billions of dollars for a green economy and climate mitigation. If the US can\u2019t set an example, the UN Climate Summit that will take place in Scotland in November could founder and worsen a coming age of extreme weather. Biden will speak at the United Nations amid a glaring lack of global leadership on another threat to humanity: the worst pandemic in 100 years. While the US led the way in developing vaccines in super-quick time and has bought hundreds of millions of doses for developing nations, vast areas of the world remain unvaccinated, meaning the pandemic is nowhere near over. American leadership is undermined by its own struggles with Covid-19. On Monday, it recorded its 675,000th death in the crisis, passing its total in the 1918 flu pandemic, as the virus exposed many of the county\u2019s cultural and political chasms. \u201cWe have lost 100,000 Americans since April or May \u2013 almost all of them unvaccinated, almost all of those deaths preventable,\u201d Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of Baylor College of Medicine\u2019s National School of Tropical Medicine, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Monday. Biden understands that domestic disunity and turmoil weaken the United States abroad. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spelled it out during his first major speech in office in March. \u201cMore than at any other time in my career \u2013 maybe in my lifetime \u2013 distinctions between domestic and foreign policy have simply fallen away,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cOur domestic renewal and our strength in the world are completely entwined.\u201d Both Biden and Blinken believe that for foreign policy to be successful, it must receive buy-in from working- and middle-class Americans. The withdrawal from Afghanistan was a clear case of this approach in action, as Biden promised working Americans they\u2019d no longer have to send their kids off to war. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s huge $3.5 trillion spending plan, currently in limbo on Capitol Hill, is stuffed with health care, education, home care and other social programs meant to restore American strength \u2013 literally, nation building at home. And increasingly, US economic, diplomatic, military and soft power is being trained across multiple sectors on the next great American mission: maintaining an edge over a rising Chinese superpower. To that end, Biden will host the leaders of Japan, India and Australia in Washington this week, in a summit of so-called Quad powers, in a rare show of continuity with the Trump administration, which pushed the grouping in an unmistakable message to Beijing. Joe Biden's self-created image of foreign policy savvy has taken a serious blow One surprise of the Biden era has been the ham-handedness of foreign policy management. The showdown with France was triggered by a US desire to quickly scale up its military posture in Asia in the face of China\u2019s aggressive naval expansion. The deal among the US, UK and Australia \u2013 dubbed \u201cAUKUS\u201d \u2013 will see a fleet of new nuclear-powered submarines head down under and canceled France\u2019s previous agreement to build conventional boats for Australia. But in bolstering one alliance, Washington badly damaged another. France saw the deal as a betrayal by its anglophone partners and recalled its ambassadors to Canberra and Washington. While Biden is expected to try to ease tensions in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron this week, the estrangement is bound to fuel a belief in Europe that \u2013 in its zeal to meet the rising threat from China \u2013 the US is turning away from Europe. It\u2019s hard to believe that there wasn\u2019t a way for the Biden administration to pursue its goals in Asia without insulting a friend in Europe. The chaos of the Afghan withdrawal, which left the US effectively relying on its Taliban enemies of 20 years to secure Kabul\u2019s airport \u2013 a scenario that resulted in the deaths of 13 American service personnel and more than 170 others in a suicide bombing \u2013 was emblematic of a poorly planned operation, even if the military managed to extract more than 120,000 US citizens and allies. After the withdrawal, Biden barely mentioned the sacrifices of US allies in a war they joined to defend the US after the September 11 attacks. Ultimately, however, US allies have little choice but to learn how to deal with the Biden team, accept its missteps and adapt to its new foreign policy goals. Because if the US can\u2019t or won\u2019t lead, who will?",

            "article_content": "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul promised on Tuesday to forge a \u201cnew era of transparency\u201d in the halls of a state government that has for decades been wrought by corruption, ethics scandals and a culture of sexual harassment that came front-and-center as allegations mounted against Andrew Cuomo, her disgraced predecessor. In her first speech to New Yorkers since being sworn in as the state\u2019s 57th governor \u2013 and the first woman to hold its highest office \u2013 Hochul said she would lead a \u201cdramatic change in culture, with accountability and no tolerance for individuals who cross the line.\u201d Though she made no mention of her predecessor \u2013 who resigned following the release of a damning report from state Attorney General Letitia James \u2013 the list of priorities Hochul ticked off in her remarks read as a clear rebuke of his administration\u2019s recent management of the pandemic and caustic relationship with legislators. The new governor also pledged to address a series of issues that seemed to take a backseat to Cuomo\u2019s ultimately losing battle for his political life. Hochul said she was \u201cnot at all satisfied\u201d at the sluggish rate the state has been dispersing its federal Covid-19 relief funds, including aid for renters, and indicated she planned to hire more staff to break the bureaucratic gridlock. Anyone who applies for and qualifies for the aid, Hochul pledged, \u201cwill be protected from eviction for a solid year.\u201d She also said the release of funds set aside in the state budget for \u201cexcluded workers,\u201d or those who were not made eligible for federal relief by Congress, would be expedited \u2013 a pleasing note for progressive lawmakers who fought to include the provision during negotiations earlier this year. Over the past two weeks, after Cuomo announced he would resign, Hochul has begun to build out a governing team. On Monday, hours before her official ascent, she announced that Karen Persichilli Keogh, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, would be named the new secretary to the governor \u2013 one the state\u2019s most powerful appointed positions \u2013 and that Elizabeth Fine, the top legal officer of New York\u2019s top economic development agency, would become her chief counsel. But Hochul\u2019s most pressing political decision remains in front of her. In the coming days, an adviser told CNN, she will tap her replacement as lieutenant governor. That partner, Hochul has indicated, will come from New York City, where she is working overtime to build out a base of support and introduce herself to voters. Hochul said her most immediate policy goal was to return children safely to school and that she would, this week, release a \u201cseries of school-related policies\u201d that will be \u201cconcise and consistent.\u201d Hochul also indicated that a statewide Covid-19 vaccine mandate for educators might come under consideration. \u201cWe need to require vaccinations for all school personnel, with an option to test out weekly \u2013 at least for now,\u201d she said. In the meantime, Hochul announced plans to direct her health department to issue a mandate for universal masking in schools across the state and, citing a recent conversation with Dr. Anthony Fauci, said her administration would also act quickly to ramp up its efforts to provide Covid-19 vaccine boosters. \u201cWe discussed the urgent need to ensure vaccinated individuals receive a booster dose at eight months,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to do whatever is necessary, including reopening mass vax sites so a booster is available to all new Yorkers who meet that timetable.\u201d The 62-year-old, who spent seven years as Cuomo\u2019s deputy, also said that she would pursue more comprehensive standards of behavior for state workers. \u201cToday, I\u2019m directing an overhaul of state government policies on sexual harassment and ethics, starting with requiring that all training be done live, instead of allowing people to click their way through a class,\u201d Hochul said. One of Cuomo\u2019s accusers, former aide Charlotte Bennett, alleged in March that the former governor, in 2019, had another senior aide complete his online training for him. Cuomo denied any suggestion that he did not personally fulfill the process. Hochul, who will be up for election and likely face a primary challenge next year, also offered a more personal message to voters. \u201cTo those new Yorkers who have yet to meet me, I say this: You may not know me, but I know you,\u201d said Hochul, who has traveled the state regularly but is still a mostly unknown quantity in New York City, where she will likely need to outperform her 2018 showing in the lieutenant governor\u2019s primary in order to win a first full term as chief executive in 2022. She also invoked the words of Theodore Roosevelt, who served as governor of New York before becoming vice president and then president of the United States, and his tribute to the \u201cman in the arena\u201d \u2013 though, as Hochul noted, \u201cToday, for the first time in New York history, a woman will enter that arena as governor.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll find me to be direct, straight-talking and decisive,\u201d she said. \u201cI will not be deterred, and I am willing to be bloodied and marred in the pursuit of doing what\u2019s right for the people of this great state.\u201d",

Elder has already faced some backlash for derogatory remarks he made about women in a 2000 column, in which he wrote that \u201cWomen know less than men about political issues, economics, and current events\u201d and claimed that this gave Democrats an edge over Republicans because \u201cthe less one knows, the easier the manipulation.\u201d His disparaging comments have been as recent as January 2017, when he deleted a tweet that implied women taking part in the Women\u2019s March were too unattractive to be sexually assaulted, according to the Los Angeles Times. In another previously unreported comment from a January 2017 radio show, Elder mocked women attending the Women\u2019s March as \u201cobese.\u201d \u201cWhen you look at all these women that have marched \u2013 something like 2 million women \u2013 Donald Trump has probably gotten more obese woman off the couch and in the streets, working out, than Michelle Obama did in eight years,\u201d he said on an episode reviewed by CNN. He even has challenged mainstream orthodoxy on subjects like violence against women. In the early 2000s, Elder maintained a page on his personal website on \u201cwomen and domestic violence statistics,\u201d citing three articles that alleged a narrative that violence against women was exaggerated for political gain of feminists. One of the articles cited by Elder claimed the Violence Against Women Act, which was signed into law in 1994, was passed with the goal of \u201credistributing power from the ruling class (men) to the oppressed class (women).\u201d Another asked, \u201cWhy does our culture refuse to hold women as well as men accountable for their participation in domestic violence?\u201d In his books, Elder endorsed pregnancy discrimination, according to a report from Media Matters, suggesting that working mothers aren\u2019t \u201cdedicated\u201d and available for an \u201call-hands-on-deck commitment\u201d to work. \u201cWhen I saw those comments directed about women, directed about pregnancy discrimination, that\u2019s not right,\u201d former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, one of his Republican opponents, said about Elder following a debate Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not right for anybody of any political party or background. That\u2019s not what you want to have your governor doing or talking about.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Biden administration officials are becoming increasingly pessimistic about reviving the Iran nuclear deal as the country\u2019s new hardline president takes office and its nuclear program continues to accelerate, national security and intelligence officials familiar with the negotiations told CNN. The deal\u2019s original signatories known as the P5+1 \u2013 the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany \u2013 had hoped to begin their seventh round of negotiations by now. Some officials have expressed disappointment that the talks have been so delayed since the last round ended on June 20, especially as Iran\u2019s nuclear advances risk making the current deal irrelevant. Now that President Ebrahim Raisi is officially in power after his inauguration Thursday, officials are hoping meetings will begin again in the next few weeks, but it\u2019s still not clear if and when that will happen. While Raisi is considered a hardliner, he has said that in principle he does not oppose the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, and American officials have said they don\u2019t expect him to walk away from the talks. Still, negotiations stalled at the end of June, and with Iran\u2019s nuclear program accelerating, US officials are privately and publicly signaling they won\u2019t stay at the table forever. The original deal\u2019s terms might no longer cover the program as it continues to advance. \u201cWe are committed to diplomacy, but this process cannot go on indefinitely,\u201d Blinken told reporters in Kuwait on July 29. \u201cAt some point, the gains achieved by the JCPOA cannot be fully recovered by a return to the JCPOA if Iran continues the activities that it\u2019s undertaken with regard to its nuclear program,\u201d he said. Blinken warns talks with Iran can't go on indefinitely When talks paused after a sixth round, among the major outstanding issues still being worked out was how to deal with Iran\u2019s nuclear research and development advances, according to an official familiar with the ongoing talks. The official said Iran was essentially telling the P5 + 1, \u201ctough luck, four years of Trump, we have suffered so much, this was our answer, you can\u2019t take that away from us.\u201d All parties to the talks have a sense of the clock ticking down, this official said. \u201cWe all want to return, and we\u2019re determined to work on it, but it\u2019s stating a matter of fact when Blinken says \u2026 that negotiations can\u2019t go on forever,\u201d the official said. \u201cAs Iran proceeds with enrichment there comes a point when there\u2019s no JCPOA to return to. We\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Failure to return to the deal would be a blow to President Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy agenda. His officials, meanwhile, have fumed privately that they inherited major roadblocks to re-entering the deal from the previous administration and are now thinking through contingency plans. After President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018 and imposed a maximum pressure campaign on Iran with stiff new sanctions, Iran began developing and testing centrifuges that have shortened the time it would take to produce enough material for a bomb. Officials now believe it would take far less than a year \u2013 the \u201cbreakout\u201d standard codified in the JCPOA \u2013 for Iran to produce enough nuclear material for a weapon. Iran has also been restricting UN inspectors\u2019 access to its main uranium enrichment plant at the Natanz nuclear facility. Hope has \u201cslowly been fading,\u201d said another person familiar with the negotiations, since it became clear that a deal would not be struck before Iran\u2019s elections. That timeline was the US\u2019 original goal, but significant sticking points remained like the scope of sanctions relief \u2013 with the US and allies arguing that they can only lift sanctions connected to the nuclear deal, not penalties associated with human rights abuses, conventional weapons violations or other issues. The prospect that the US is also working to \u201clengthen and strengthen\u201d the deal, as US officials have characterized it, hasn\u2019t helped negotiations. Iran has not yet been willing to commit to discussing non-nuclear issues, such as its ballistic missile program, in follow-up talks. Broadening out the deal has been a priority for more hawkish Democrats like Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Bob Menendez, who has urged the Biden administration to enter into an agreement \u201cthat prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons and meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program,\u201d he and 42 other senators wrote in a letter to Biden in the spring. That plea has become more urgent since a new class of Iranian-made drones that can evade US detection began targeting US military assets in Iraq. Still, US officials have been caught off guard that the delay in reconvening talks has lasted so long, people involved in the negotiations said. The official familiar with the talks described the length of the hold-up since the election as a \u201cbad surprise,\u201d particularly because Iranian officials had told their counterparts that Tehran would continue the talks once the election was over. There is speculation among the P5 + 1 partners that the delay could be a tactical move by Iran. Increasingly, however, they also believe there is a real debate going on within the Iranian system on how to proceed with negotiations. \u201cThere seems to be a determination by Raisi about how they want to take hold of the process and leave their mark \u2013 that would be about more than tactics,\u201d said the official. \u201cThe working hypothesis we have \u2026 is that Raisi means what he says and wants to go back into JCPOA,\u201d this official said. One major uncertainty: \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether Raisi will want to appoint his own people, a new team, to come to negotiations,\u201d this official said. A new team could be disruptive as the negotiators now know each other well after months of marathon sessions in hotel conference rooms, spending day after day discussing aspects of the deal, then using midday and evening breaks to report back to their home countries. There is also concern among the negotiators that if Iran\u2019s new hardline president is displeased by the previous administration\u2019s work on the issue, he may have unrealistic expectations about what can be accomplished, pushing their progress back. \u201cWe, as a group, were very clear with the Iranians about what we could give on and where we couldn\u2019t,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe team around Rouhani understood it \u2026 we will see whether the team around Raisi understands it and also whether the team will change.\u201d For the Iranians, however, a major lingering issue is the question of guarantees. Tehran \u201cwants to know there won\u2019t be a Trump 2.0 while they\u2019re in full compliance,\u201d the official said, and face another situation where they are abiding by the terms of a deal, only to have an American leader leave the agreement and reimpose crippling economic sanctions. The Americans, of course, are unable to guarantee what a future administration might do. Some on the National Security Council believe a nuclear crisis is looming if a deal is not reached by the end of the year, according to people familiar with the matter. This opinion is shared by some experts: Dr. Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said the alternative to reaching an agreement is that \u201cwe go back to the running crisis\u201d that plagued successive administrations until a deal was struck in 2015. Lewis does not agree, however, with the idea that returning to the deal should hinge on the one year \u201cbreakout\u201d standard. Officials should be more concerned, he believes, with the time it would take for Iran to \u201csneak out\u201d of the deal, with the goal of making it harder for Tehran to build a secret nuclear facility for the third time. Not everyone believes a nuclear crisis is inevitable if the JCPOA fails, however. Menendez and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham have proposed another idea that staffers say has been well-received by the administration \u2013 namely, pushing Iran to accept the creation of a nuclear fuel bank for the Persian Gulf region. The idea would be that Iran could only access such a bank, and fuel its commercial nuclear reactors, on the condition that it gives up its domestic uranium enrichment and reprocessing \u2013 key components for nuclear weapons. Still, such a solution, even if accepted by Iran, would only address the nuclear issue and not Iran\u2019s broader destabilizing activities throughout the region. Iran\u2019s return to compliance with the JCPOA, even though the deal was limited to Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, was seen by Biden and experts as a crucial jumping off point for further negotiations. Israel, meanwhile, has remained staunchly opposed to re-entering the nuclear deal. The country\u2019s new Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called on the US and its partners to \u201cwake up\u201d to the risks of continuing negotiations, and Israeli officials have indicated that they are willing to take matters into their own hands to stymie Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The former Mossad chief suggested in June that the Israeli intelligence agency played a role in explosions at Namatz in April and last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a race against the clock \u2013 we can only reenter the deal on our terms, and if we cannot reenter the agreement by the end of the year, it\u2019s possible Iran may have reached a nuclear breakout capability,\u201d said Halie Soifer, a former foreign policy adviser to then-Senator Kamala Harris who now serves as CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. \u201cUltimately, the Biden administration is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, which is an objective it shares with our allies, including Israel,\u201d Soifer said. But she noted that the US, Israel and Iran all have new governments, and it will take time to coordinate on addressing the nuclear threat and threats to regional stability. \u201cWhat remains unclear is how much time we have,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "The bipartisan infrastructure bill making its precarious way through the Senate was always a cornerstone of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Now, it\u2019s even more vital for an administration badly needing wins as the White House struggles to navigate multiple crises. The President had hoped by now to be able to tout victory over the pandemic, but the nation is embarking on another grueling battle against the Delta variant. The new reality threatens to exhaust an already dispirited citizenry, slow the economy\u2019s bounce back and exacerbate the chain reaction of problems caused by the pandemic. In turn, it could dampen Biden\u2019s own approval ratings and further damage the chances of Democrats in next year\u2019s midterm elections. With public health officials warning of the possibility of several hundred thousand Covid-19 infections a day, it seems that the pandemic will now stretch at least through the fall and winter and potentially well into next year, further narrowing Biden\u2019s room for political maneuvering and increasing the weight of responsibility on his White House. But after hours of debate, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer moved to cut off debate on the infrastructure package on Thursday night, setting up swift passage of the legislation, although exact timing of a final vote remained unclear. Democrats hoped the fragile and rare bipartisan support for the legislation would hold in order for the measure to be sent on to the House, where there is no guarantee of passage. The $1 trillion dollar package of spending on roads, bridges, rail, electric vehicles, high speed Internet and other priorities is the primary, and possibly only, exhibit of one of the defining principles of Biden\u2019s presidency \u2013 the notion that Republicans and Democrats can work together for national goals. A bipartisan bill signing ceremony at the White House would enable the President to tell voters that he had kept his word when most pundits and Washington politicians doubted he could overcome bitter political divides. That image, likely to feature heavily in Democratic midterm election advertising, would be so powerful that ex-President Donald Trump, whose own failed infrastructure initiatives descended into self-parody, has been trying to browbeat GOP senators into pulling support for Biden\u2019s plan. Biden\u2019s team insists his presidency has reset the nation\u2019s course after what Democrats viewed as the destruction of the Trump years. That has involved saving American democracy, restoring the country\u2019s reputation abroad and presiding over the restarting of the country\u2019s jobs engine. And the West Wing has been pushing ahead and creating momentum in areas where Biden does not need the help of Congress. On Thursday, for instance, the President signed an executive order designed to boost the electric vehicle industry that aims to ensure that 50% of vehicles sold in the US by 2030 are electric. So his aides push back hard against the notion that Biden\u2019s presidency is itself in crisis. But a big win in the Senate on infrastructure would nevertheless come as a moment of relief in an administration also dealing with a flurry of other problems from Afghanistan, to misfiring nuclear diplomacy with Iran and the uncertainty of this week\u2019s stop gap solution that saved millions of renters threatened with eviction from being turned out of their homes. The infrastructure bill has a long way to go before it becomes law \u2014 its fate relies on Democrats muscling through a $3.5 trillion spending plan through the Senate to appease progressives who say the bipartisan bill is too limited. That Democratic measure will need to benefit from reconciliation \u2013 a limited maneuver that can be used to pass bills with budgetary implications in the Senate \u2013 in order to avoid the 60-vote threshold and allow passage on a party-line vote. The passage of the more narrow infrastructure bill with a bipartisan vote would validate other aspects of Biden\u2019s approach \u2014 for instance, allowing the Senate time to work its will in line with the President\u2019s faith in a body in which he once served that few other observers share. Biden could also claim some new momentum in his presidency in its crucial first year when his political capital and authority are at their zenith but with the difficulties of a 50-50 Senate meaning that his legislative record is fairly threadbare other than a huge $1.9 trillion Covid rescue plan passed in March. A successful Senate vote might also ease some of the fears of Democrats who face the prospect of tough questions from constituents this summer about the efficacy of the Biden presidency in its first seven months and with midterms looming next year that are historically difficult for a new commander-in-chief\u2019s party. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Melanie Zanona reported this week that some moderate Democrats in swing districts are becoming increasingly anxious about their ability to hold on to their seats. The lawmakers believe that Biden\u2019s economic message \u2014 even on an issue like the expansion of the child tax credit \u2014 has failed to break through to many voters. The dynamic was on display when these Democrats refused to take a difficult vote on a measure that had little chance of becoming law \u2014 an extension of a moratorium on evictions of Americans behind on their rent because they lost their jobs during the pandemic. That impasse forced the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to order a new moratorium that Biden admitted again on Thursday may not pass muster with the Supreme Court. \u201cI went ahead and did it, but here\u2019s the deal, I can\u2019t guarantee you the court won\u2019t rule that you don\u2019t have that authority. But at least we\u2019ll have the ability, if we have to appeal, to keep this going for a month, at least. I hope longer,\u201d Biden said. The passage of an infrastructure bill could hand ammunition to these Democrats who have been disturbed by early polling ahead of the midterms. But the accompanying $3 trillion dollar spending plan could be a poison chalice for them, since it will play into what appears to be an effective GOP attack that Democrats are the party of massive taxation and spending. Biden has effectively argued that government can be used as a force for good to lift up Americans who have not shared the fruits of years of economic prosperity. A bipartisan deal would deliver on that goal. And the larger spending package would allow him to say that he had made good on what could be a generational achievement \u2014 reshaping the economy to benefit working and middle class Americans. Another reason why the choreography of the infrastructure and spending deals is so important to Biden is that the future prospects for his agenda are so difficult. Democrats countrywide are, for instance, calling for lawmakers in Washington to pass a sweeping voting rights bill to counter efforts by Republican-run states to make it harder to vote and easier to interfere in the outcome of elections. The state measures are being written based on Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud in last year\u2019s presidential vote. There is little chance that the voting measure will pass in the Senate owing to the GOP\u2019s filibuster tactics that require a 60-vote super majority to pass major legislation. Moderate Democrats including West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema oppose any move by their party to overturn the time honored Senate rule, meaning that the GOP has an effective veto on legislation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to seek to bring a scaled-down voting bill to the floor in the coming weeks but the move is likely to be largely symbolic given blanket GOP opposition. So, as far as legislative achievements are concerned in the run-up to the midterm elections, a bipartisan infrastructure bill and an accompanying spending package \u2014 assuming Democrats can succeed in passing both through a restive Congress \u2014 may be as good as it gets for the President.",

            "article_content": "In two Ohio congressional primaries Tuesday, Democratic voters embraced the party\u2019s establishment, delivering President Joe Biden another ally and denying the left-wing \u201cSquad\u201d its latest member. Republicans, meanwhile, stuck with former President Donald Trump. The two themes could preview what\u2019s to come in next year\u2019s midterm elections, with progressives set to square off against veteran Democrats in several primaries and Trump seeking to settle old scores and oust his intra-party critics. In the heavily Democratic 11th District, which stretches from Cleveland to Akron, establishment-backed Cuyahoga County Democratic chairwoman and county council member Shontel Brown \u2013 who was backed by Hillary Clinton, Rep. Jim Clyburn and the Congressional Black Caucus \u2013 defeated former state senator Nina Turner, the long-time ally of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Turner remained critical of Clinton after the primary\u2019s conclusion in 2016 and in 2020 once compared voting for Biden to eating half a bowl of human excrement. Meanwhile, Republican voters in Ohio\u2019s 15th District \u2013 which includes parts of Columbus and rural areas south of the city \u2013 selected Mike Carey, a coal lobbyist endorsed by Trump. Carey\u2019s win staved off a potential embarrassment for Trump a week after a candidate he\u2019d endorsed lost to another Republican in a Texas congressional runoff. The two primaries drew attention because of the nationally known figures who were involved. But neither is expected to be competitive in the special general elections. Brown is now all but certain to win the 11th District seat on November 2, while Carey is the heavy favorite in the 15th District. Here are four takeaways from Ohio\u2019s primaries: Progressives saw Ohio as a chance to steer the House Democratic caucus further left. Turner \u2013 a long-time Sanders ally who became a national figure before any member of the left-wing \u201cSquad\u201d was elected to Congress \u2013 would have joined their ranks. But, in what could be a preview of how establishment forces will mobilize to protect incumbent Democrats facing primary challenges next year, more moderate Democrats fought back. Out of a crowded field, they rallied behind Brown, a candidate more likely to support Biden and his agenda in Washington. And again it was Clyburn \u2013 the kingmaker in the 2020 Democratic primary, when his endorsement propelled Biden to a massive victory in the South Carolina primary and a romp three days later, on Super Tuesday \u2013 playing a central role. Clyburn stepped in when the rapper and activist Killer Mike, appearing at a campaign event with Turner, said the No. 3 House Democrat had been \u201cincredibly stupid\u201d to back Biden without securing more concessions. Clyburn endorsed Brown and warned that the left\u2019s \u201csloganeering\u201d \u2013 such as calls to defund the police \u2013 is politically damaging. The Congressional Black Caucus\u2019 political arm endorsed Brown, and Clyburn and other leading Black Democrats campaigned for her on the race\u2019s closing weekend. The race between Turner and Brown was a glimpse at the ways in which Democrats have never fully moved past the 2016 presidential primary. It even pitted Clinton, who endorsed Brown, against Sanders, who campaigned for Turner \u2013 one of his most loyal allies in his two presidential campaigns. Viewed through that lens, though, it should not be surprising that Turner ran into stiff headwinds. Ohio\u2019s 11th District backed Clinton over Sanders by a 2-to-1 margin in 2016. Turner began the race with a financial edge and the advantage of years of national television appearances as a pundit and pro-Sanders surrogate. But there was always room for Brown\u2019s support to grow. In the race\u2019s closing weeks, Brown and her allies were outspending Turner and her supporters on television ads. Jewish voters and pro-Israel groups played important roles down the stretch. The Democratic Majority for Israel super PAC spent heavily against Turner, who has been critical of Israel at times. And Brown\u2019s support from Jewish Democrats in the district proved pivotal \u2013 a reality that Brown acknowledged in her victory speech, in which she thanked \u201cmy Jewish brothers and sisters\u201d and discussed how a 2018 trip to Israel shaped her view of the US-Israel relationship. It\u2019s hard to distill much about the direction of the Democratic Party on major generational and ideological issues from individual races \u2013 particularly low-turnout primaries in off-year special elections like Ohio\u2019s 11th District contest. Moderate, establishment-aligned figures have now notched a series of important victories over more progressive candidates, dating back to Biden defeating Sanders in the 2020 presidential primary. In Virginia, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe held off challengers to win the primary as he seeks another term. In New York City, centrist Eric Adams won the mayoral primary. But at the same time, progressives have claimed victories of their own. New York City chose a progressive candidate for comptroller at the same time it picked a moderate for mayor. Buffalo voters ousted their incumbent mayor in favor of India Walton, a self-professed socialist and political newcomer. A progressive challenger, state Rep. Ed Gainey, unseated Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto. What seems clear is that progressives have yet to figure out \u2013 especially in high-turnout contests \u2013 how to crack up the Biden coalition of working-class voters, Black voters and suburban moderates who are playing an increasingly large role in Democratic primaries. A week after his Texas misstep, Trump can again credibly claim that his endorsement is a deciding factor in Republican primaries. The Trump-backed candidate in the Ohio 15th District Republican primary, Carey, defeated a host of rivals \u2013 including one backed by former Rep. Steve Stivers, the man they were all running to replace. Trump\u2019s pick in Texas had lost a congressional runoff to another Republican last week, and a second straight loss would have raised serious concern about whether GOP primary voters \u2013 who polls show still overwhelmingly support the former President, even if he is toxic with the broader electorate \u2013 are interested in continuing to follow his lead in down-ballot races. \u201cGreat Republican win for Mike Carey. Big numbers!\u201d Trump, taking a victory lap, said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cCongratulations to Mike and his family. He will never let you down!\u201d The district, which includes part of Columbus and the rural region to its south, is heavily Republican and likely to remain in the party\u2019s hands in this fall\u2019s special general election. Carey will face Democratic state Rep. Allison Russo on November 2.",

Aside from Pennsylvania and Delaware, where he frequently spends weekends, Biden\u2019s top-visited states are Ohio and Michigan, each of which he\u2019s been to three times. Repeat visits to critical electoral battlegrounds aren\u2019t particularly surprising for a first-term president, even though Biden is not himself up for reelection for three years. All are short flights aboard Air Force One from Washington. Pennsylvania and Ohio will be the site of contested Senate races next year. And those states\u2019 working-class towns and industrial heritage make them well-suited to promote infrastructure, Biden\u2019s current chief agenda item. Still, Biden\u2019s habit of returning again and again to Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan has come at the exclusion of other parts of the country. He hasn\u2019t visited the nation\u2019s most populous state, California, or its most populous city, New York. And aside from his foreign trip in June, he hasn\u2019t spent a night away from the White House, Camp David or his homes in Delaware. The White House declined to expand on Biden\u2019s travel strategy. But a pattern has emerged in each of Biden\u2019s trips that underscores his attention toward blue-collar workers. Speaking after visiting a training center for electrical workers in Cincinnati last week, Biden underscored why he has focused in particular on union workers. \u201cIf every IBEW person decided they\u2019re going to quit, this country comes to a screeching halt,\u201d he said in a video posted to Instagram. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of white-collar businesses that could actually quit tomorrow and the nation is still going to move.\u201d On previous visits to Pennsylvania, Biden could be found touring a flooring company in Chester, speaking at a carpenters training facility in Pittsburgh and celebrating Amtrak\u2019s 50th anniversary at Philadelphia\u2019s 30th Street Station. He even briefly dipped into the commonwealth on Saturday when he went for dinner at his sister Val\u2019s home. He has engaged in similar activities in neighboring Ohio, which he visited most recently last week, and Michigan, where he took a joy ride in one of Ford\u2019s new electric pickup trucks in May. \u201cBiden\u2019s frequent trips to Pennsylvania and Michigan follow in the footsteps of George W. Bush, Obama, and Trump, who all dedicated a substantial portion of their early presidential travel to states that they had narrowly won or lost in the previous election,\u201d said Brendan Doherty, a US Naval Academy professor who studies presidential travel. Six months into his presidency, Biden has traveled to 15 states altogether, almost all east of the Mississippi, a strategy emphasizing agenda items benefiting Americans living in middle-class parts of the country. Trips further afield \u2013 including to Houston in February to survey storm damage and to Miami this month after a catastrophic condo building collapse \u2013 have occurred after disasters rather than to promote his agenda. The places he has visited most often \u2013 Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio \u2013 make up a critical voting belt where he hopes to sustain support for Democrats using items like infrastructure investment, expanded support for families and an ongoing vaccination campaign. Democrats are fighting to maintain control of Congress next year in contests that historically go poorly for the sitting president\u2019s party. Recent stops have targeted House battlegrounds, including a district outside Chicago where Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood is a top target for Republicans looking to gain seats in next year\u2019s midterms. \u201cThis woman here, hang on to her,\u201d Biden said as he toured a day care facility alongside the lawmaker. This month Biden has also visited competitive districts in Wisconsin and Michigan, a sign of his early willingness to use his draw to boost Democrats in the coming elections. Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign manager and his deputy chief of staff in the White House, said the President has been a supporter of party building throughout his decades in public life and has told his top aides that he wants to do \u201cwhatever he can\u201d to help the party while he is in the White House. \u201cHe has made it abundantly clear his priorities are that he continues to do what he\u2019s always done, what he did in \u201918, what he did in \u201816, which is go across the country and help wherever possible,\u201d said O\u2019Malley Dillon. \u201cHe wants to make sure that, as the leader of the party, that the DNC, the state parties have the resources they need.\u201d Biden\u2019s desire to actively sell his agenda items in the places that will determine Democrats\u2019 fate in next year\u2019s midterm elections reflects his belief that his policy makes good politics. It also a sign he is hoping to avoid what he\u2019s said was a major mistake during the Obama administration: a failure to sell what the President had accomplished during his first years in office. Visiting swing districts \u2013 and even some areas where he lost in the 2020 election \u2013 marks a departure from former President Donald Trump, who mostly traveled to places where he was popular and could draw large crowds for his rallies. Still, presidential travel isn\u2019t all about politics. Commanders in chief are called upon to visit places struck by disaster, spotlight areas of the country overlooked in the national conversation and engage all Americans. Presidents Barack Obama, Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush each visited all 50 states while in office. Historically, the states that have hosted the most presidential visits over the past three decades are the most populous: California, New York, Florida and Texas. Biden has sought to highlight West Coast issues by convening governors virtually to discuss historic heat and wildfires. The White House said recently the President was \u201cquite focused\u201d on the fire issue. But he hasn\u2019t made a trip to the Pacific or Mountain time zones. \u201cAt this point in their presidencies, Carter, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama all had already traveled to the West Coast.  Trump\u2019s farthest trip west at this point in his term was to Iowa,\u201d Doherty said. The close-to-home itineraries are partly due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which limited travel options in the early months of Biden\u2019s presidency. After new mask guidelines were issued Tuesday for parts of the country with high rates of transmission, Biden\u2019s aides said they would be certain to follow local rules when the President travels. His wife, by contrast, has ventured further afield, promoting vaccinations in California, Arizona and New Mexico. She also visited Alaska and Hawaii on her way to and from the Tokyo Olympics. Vice President Kamala Harris has also traveled to her home state of California at multiple points since being sworn into office. By this point in their presidencies, both Trump and Obama had each traveled to a relatively similar number of states at Biden: Trump had visited 15 at the six-month mark while Obama had been to 17. Like Biden, Trump stuck close to the East Coast but Obama had made stops in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and California. All are eclipsed by former President George W. Bush, who had made stops in 29 states by July 20, 2001 \u2013 including both of the Dakotas.",

            "article_content": "The spending proposals that Senate Democrats plan to begin advancing this week amount to a massive gamble that the party can simultaneously advance two of its longest-standing economic goals without generating a political backlash or overheating the economy. The packages that Democrats are now formulating in a pair of bills \u2013 one they hope to pass with bipartisan support and another they anticipate approving with only Democratic votes \u2013 are so sweeping that passage would mark a historic expansion of government\u2019s role on two distinct fronts. As currently written, the bills would generate the largest increase in federal public investment since the interstate highway system and post-Sputnik subsidies for science and education under President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, and the greatest expansion of the social safety net since President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society in the 1960s.   In some ways, the Democrats\u2019 bet that they can simultaneously turbocharge public investment and strengthen the safety net amounts to a modern equivalent of Johnson\u2019s famous gamble during the 1960s that he could afford both \u201cguns and butter,\u201d funding the Vietnam War even as he substantially increased domestic spending through his \u201cGreat Society\u201d agenda. The new Democratic agenda, with its dual focus on infrastructure and aid to working families, might be called \u201cbricks and butter.\u201d The new public investments \u2013 the bricks \u2013 reflect the widespread Democratic belief that over time the economy will grow more quickly and more equitably with a strategy of greater spending in areas such as infrastructure, education and scientific research than behind the competing Republican approach centered on reducing taxes. \u201cThe investments that we are making \u2026 are ones that the private sector has not done or cannot do,\u201d says Heather Boushey, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cWe have not seen a nationwide investment in affordable, accessible universal pre-K. It is the public sector that has traditionally made it possible for kids to afford community college. We have not seen the private sector solve the climate crisis. It is really important to recognize that growth hinges on \u2026 much-needed public investments that provide the basis for an economy that is inclusive.\u201d In turn, the new safety net proposals \u2013 the butter \u2013 which include an expanded child tax credit, increased health care subsidies and expanded Medicare benefits \u2013 reflect not only a Democratic desire to respond to persistent income inequality but also a political conviction that the party can win back some of the working-class voters drawn to conservative Republican cultural messages by delivering more direct benefits from government. Johnson\u2019s bet that he could balance guns and butter failed both politically and economically: Backlash from the left (over the war) and the right (over his domestic programs) helped elect Republican Richard Nixon in 1968, and the cost of LBJ\u2019s agenda contributed to the inflationary pressures of the late 1960s and early 1970s. But Democrats believe years of widening economic inequality and slowly growing incomes for average families have created an environment more conducive than at any point in decades for a bricks and butter agenda. The cumulative price tag for the new proposal means Democrats are wagering that the promise of faster growth and more financial security can sell Americans on a federal government that both spends and taxes more as a share of the overall economy than it has at almost any point in its peacetime history, according to federal figures. And they are calculating that they can swell spending in both areas without prolonging the spike in inflation that has accompanied the economy\u2019s recovery from the severe Covid-19 downturn. Senate GOP threatens to block vote on bipartisan infrastructure deal if talks aren't concluded Many Democrats also believe that the party suffered its huge losses in 2010 partly because then-President Barack Obama did not propose enough spending in response to the 2008 financial crash. Though much difficult negotiating remains, the party from left to right appears committed, on both economic and political grounds, to passing something approaching the huge program sketched out in the bipartisan and reconciliation proposals. \u201cIf we go into this election cycle and our agenda is delivering tax cuts for middle-class parents, delivering jobs through investment in infrastructure and delivering lower health care costs,\u201d says David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, \u201cwe have a package that appeals both to those swing voters, some voters who have more of a conservative bent and to our base as well.\u201d Republican pollster Gene Ulm argues instead that Democrats are trying to flood the economy with federal spending to improve their prospects in the 2022 election \u2013 but could face a backlash against the taxes included in the plan and inflation that it might fuel. \u201cStructurally they are betting the farm and everything possible to get through these midterms,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they are just opening up the checkbook to do it.\u2019 Whatever the immediate political impact, if President Joe Biden ultimately signs anything like the proposed program, it would mark a new era in Washington\u2019s role in the economy. Over the past 50 years, federal spending, as a share of the nation\u2019s economic output, has averaged about 20.6%, according to calculations by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a centrist group that argues for budgetary restraint. Washington has significantly exceeded that level only in times of crisis: Spending reached 24% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product during Obama\u2019s first term immediately after the 2008 financial crisis and roughly 32% during the Covid pandemic, federal figures show. (Federal spending as a share of the economy reached its modern high of more than 40% at the height of World War II.) Though federal spending over the past half century has remained relatively constant at about one-fifth of the economy, the composition of that spending has shifted dramatically. Over that period, public investment \u2013 defined primarily as federal spending on infrastructure, education and training, and support for research and development \u2013 has declined, while the safety net \u2013 including such payments to individuals as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food assistance and various tax credits for families \u2013 has soared. In 1969, federal figures show, public investment and payments to individuals each consumed nearly one-third of total federal spending, an amount equal to about 6% of the economy. By 2019, the last year before Washington poured huge sums into the Covid crisis, public investment had fallen to just 12.5% of the budget while payments to individuals had grown past 70%. Public investment now equals only about 2.5% of the economy, while payments to individuals consume more than five times as much. It\u2019s totally different from anything put forward by Obama or Clinton. In terms of any kind of coherent strategic focus there\u2019s been nothing like this since the build-out of the suburbs, and the buildup of the educational system. Josh Bivens, research director, Economic Policy Institute The exact distribution between public investment and safety net spending in the Democratic plans isn\u2019t known, because the party hasn\u2019t released details on the funding levels in the $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that Senate Budget Committee Democrats recently agreed on. But it\u2019s clear that the proposal \u2013 coupled with the bipartisan infrastructure agreement advancing on a separate track \u2013 would represent a huge expansion on both fronts. The infusion of new money for public investment might be most striking, given how steadily it has lost ground in federal priorities. Public investment fell from about 30% of federal spending in the late 1960s to about 20% by the late 1970s and 15% by the mid-1990s, a plateau from which it\u2019s since drifted further down except for a brief recovery under Obama\u2019s first-term stimulus plan. The budget plans Democrats are advancing would provide a more lasting turnaround. The bipartisan plan would spend almost $600 billion on \u201chard\u201d infrastructure, including repairing roads and bridges, upgrading water systems, modernizing the electrical grid, expanding access to broadband and funding thousands of charging stations for electric vehicles. The Democratic plan would couple that with substantial new investments in education, including universal prekindergarten, greater access to community college and larger Pell Grants for college; an array of direct expenditures and tax incentives to quicken the development of clean energy; and funding for worker training, scientific research and bolstering America\u2019s manufacturing supply chain. Senator explains why IRS enforcement was pulled from infrastructure proposal Josh Bivens, research director of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal group that has long advocated for larger public investments, says a reasonable estimate might be that such investment programs will constitute about half of the $3.5 trillion Democratic package. At roughly that level, with the added spending on hard infrastructure from the bipartisan plan added in, he projects the Biden proposal would fund a durable increase in public investment equal to about 1 percentage point of the economy, far more than either Bill Clinton or Obama, the last two Democratic presidents, achieved. In fact, Bivens says, the Democratic proposals would represent a net increase in new public investment probably unmatched since the late 1950s, when the nation built the interstate highway system that facilitated a massive move to the suburbs and also poured billions into education and scientific research after Russia took the lead in the space race by launching its Sputnik satellite. \u201cIt\u2019s totally different from anything put forward by Obama or Clinton,\u201d Bivens says. \u201cIn terms of any kind of coherent strategic focus there\u2019s been nothing like this since the build-out of the suburbs, and the buildup of the educational system\u201d during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The safety net has grown more steadily since then, with the creation of Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps (now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) in the 1960s, the broadening of Social Security benefits, the establishment of other help for families such as tax credits for children and child care, and the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Such expenditures on individuals, according to federal figures, crossed 40% of total federal spending in 1972, 50% in 1992, 60% in 1997 and 70% in 2014. The Democratic plan would channel significant new sums into these programs as well. The blueprint released by Senate Budget Committee Democrats would create new hearing, dental and vision benefits under Medicare (which the Congressional Budget Office has previously estimated could cost around $35 billion annually); extend the expanded child tax credit included in Biden\u2019s Covid rescue plan (at a cost that\u2019s been projected to reach at least $100 billion annually); create a new paid family leave program, significantly expand financial help for child care and broaden the Earned Income Tax Credit (programs that have been projected to cost about $65 billion annually as Biden proposed them); increase care options for seniors and children; and pour billions more into health care through increased subsidies for those purchasing insurance through the ACA and a plan to extend coverage to eligible adults in the handful of remaining states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the law. The economy is already massively overstimulated. The more this is front-loaded the more it exacerbates that problem. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president. American Action Forum With the Democratic plans proposing such panoramic increases in both public investment and the safety net, the inevitable result is to substantially increase government spending as a share of the economy. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis concludes that under the plan federal spending over the next decade would average 24.5% of the economy, far above the average for the past 50 years, and even higher than the previous peak single year between World War II and Covid \u2013 the 24.4% in 2009. Former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, now president of the center-right think tank the American Action Forum, says flatly that the plan would raise government spending to \u201cthe highest fraction of GDP for a 10-year period in our history,\u201d including the decade that included World War II. Moreover, Holtz-Eakin argues that the new spending constitutes a more lasting shift in government\u2019s role than then. The huge public expenditure in World War II, he notes, \u201cwas a discretionary program \u2026 and was ramped down really quickly.\u201d (Federal spending plummeted from almost 43% of the economy in 1944 to just 14% by 1947.) By contrast, apart from one-time infrastructure expenditures, he argues, the current Democratic proposals \u201care all mandatory spending programs. So they represent permanent commitments.\u201d Holtz-Eakin generally supports the \u201chard\u201d infrastructure investments in the bipartisan plan, which he says will potentially improve \u201cthe productive capacity of the economy.\u201d But he sees both short- and long-term problems from the twinned proposals in the Democratic-only budget plan. He argues that over the long term, the public investment plans, on balance, will slow the economy\u2019s expansion because the taxes required to pay for them will hurt growth more than the new investments will help it. And in the near term, he maintains, the plan\u2019s expansion of the social safety net through the child tax credit and other payments to individuals risks swelling inflation. \u201cThe economy is already massively overstimulated,\u201d he argues. \u201cThe more this is front-loaded the more it exacerbates that problem.\u201d But more liberal economists and policy analysts argue that the ongoing inflation spike is a temporary problem rooted in the economy\u2019s recovery from the pandemic disruption and will soon recede. And they maintain that public investment not only in infrastructure but also in education, training and green energy will produce a recovery that is more stable and more equitably shared than one centered on tax cuts. Public investments are for the future. We make them now in order to become more productive later on. Safety nets are for us now. We spend on them to give us security against suddenly losing our footing. Logically, the two fit together and a smart and caring society would do both. Robert Reich, University of California at Berkeley \u201cWe have clearly reached the outer bound of how much money you can give back to the those at the top of the income distribution and have it be economically useful,\u201d says Boushey. Even the safety net spending on expanding care options for seniors and children will encourage economic growth by allowing more adults (especially women) who now must provide that care to enter the workforce, Democratic economists maintain. Bivens argues that the investments included in the plan \u201cwill provide a real boost to economywide productivity growth\u201d while expanding opportunities and providing better public services to economically struggling families. From universal pre-K to improved public transit, he argues, under the plan \u201clife gets better along a bunch of dimensions for a lot of low- and median-income families.\u201d So long as Democrats offset most of the new spending with tax revenue, as they\u2019ve proposed, \u201cfrom an economic point of view, I\u2019m very unworried about the guns/butter/overheating-type problem\u201d of fueling inflation, he says. Robert Reich, the former labor secretary for Clinton and now a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, similarly argues that the envisioned expansion of public investment and the safety net offer reinforcing benefits. \u201cThe two initiatives complement each other nicely,\u201d Reich, a leading liberal analyst, told me in an email. \u201cPublic investments are for the future. We make them now in order to become more productive later on. Safety nets are for us now. We spend on them to give us security against suddenly losing our footing. Logically, the two fit together and a smart and caring society would do both.\u201d While such a historic expansion in investment in infrastructure and the safety net will appeal to those who share those goals, a simultaneous expansion in borrowing and debt should not appeal to anyone who cares about our economic health, national security, or the legacy we leave to the next generation. Maya MacGuineas, president, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget But Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, argues that failing to choose more between the two priorities could ultimately backfire by increasing the federal debt too much. \u201cWhile such a historic expansion in investment in infrastructure and the safety net will appeal to those who share those goals, a simultaneous expansion in borrowing and debt should not appeal to anyone who cares about our economic health, national security, or the legacy we leave to the next generation,\u201d she wrote me in an email. These arguments will ring through the upcoming legislative debate, but history suggests they are unlikely to end even when that debate concludes. The last big permanent expansion of government\u2019s role that Democrats passed into law was the ACA in 2010. In the years since, Republicans have unstintingly sought to repeal the law through both legislative and legal challenges. Those efforts have all failed, a dynamic that underscores how difficult it is to withdraw government benefits after the public grows accustomed to them. If Democrats later this year can pass even a fraction of the new investment and safety net programs they are proposing \u2013 from universal preschool and tuition-free community college to the huge expansion in tax credits for raising children and paid family leave \u2013 they are certain to provoke years of similar resistance from Republicans. But once benefits start flowing, the GOP may find these programs are as difficult to dislodge as the health care plan that has frustrated them for more than a decade.",

            "article_content": "Young voters and voting rights activists in Texas are protesting potential restrictive new voting laws in the state. Topping their list of concerns, activists say, is a proposal that would stop expansive practices such as drive-through voting and 24-hour voting, which advocates say made it easier for young voters and voters of color to cast their ballot in 2020. \u201cInnovations from election offices provided new opportunity for young voters in 2020,\u201d said Charlie Bonner, the 25-year-old spokesperson for MOVE Texas, a youth voter engagement organization. \u201cWe see bans on 24-hour and drive-through voting, which we know were disproportionately used by voters of color and young voters, as a direct attack, trying to silence the voices of young voters.\u201d A number of civic engagement organizations \u2013 including MOVE Texas, Common Cause Texas, Texas Rising, Voto Latino, Jolt Action, ACLU of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project \u2013 on Tuesday held a day of action at the Texas Capitol building. One day after Texas House Democrats left the state, flying from Austin to Washington, DC, to break the state House\u2019s quorum and block the bill, the activists aimed to send a message to lawmakers that young people in the state \u2013 who are increasingly more diverse than their older counterparts \u2013 will not back down when it comes to protecting their right to vote and voter accessibility, organizers said. \u201cA lot of my friends and peers are talking about this as an important issue,\u201d said Katya Ehresman, a 22-year-old recent graduate of the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cSome are kind of politically active, but more so, they\u2019re just angry and affected.\u201d Ehresman, who spent 26 hours at the Texas Capitol this weekend and testified against the proposed measures, said her friends \u201cremember struggling finding time to wait in line to vote and now anecdotally are (asking) why (lawmakers) would want to get rid of early voting or drive-in voting.\u201d One of Ehresman\u2019s friends, Sarah Batson, utilized early voting this fall. \u201cWaiting after class for three hours is not an option for me as a busy college student with commitments throughout the day,\u201d Batson \u2013 who is 20 and also a student at University of Texas at Austin \u2013 said, adding that she had an internship after school that took up most of the hours she could have used to vote. Without the ability to early vote, \u201cit would be much harder for me to choose to vote in every election,\u201d Batson said, calling the \u201copportunity\u201d to early vote \u201cessential.\u201d \u201cWe see this legislation as a direct attack on the massive increase in youth turnout we saw last year,\u201d said Bonner, who helped register more than 50,000 voters between the ages of 18 and 30 ahead of the 2020 election with MOVE Texas. In Texas, young people of color composed a clear majority of everyone who has turned 18 \u2013 thus becoming eligible to vote \u2013 since the 2016 election, according to census figures. Bonner emphasized the increased diversity of young people in Texas and stressed the danger in limiting these voters\u2019 access to the ballot box. \u201cUnfortunately we don\u2019t have an electorate that matches the lived experiences of the folks here. We want to build an electorate reflective of the rich diversity of this beautiful state, but instead of we have these measures that seek to restrict access to make the smallest electorate possible to hold onto power,\u201d he said. Also on Tuesday, activists with Jolt Action, a group that looks to increase civic participation of Latinos in Texas, dressed in quincea\u00f1era attire during a news conference in front of the Capitol. Like Bonner, Dr. Gloria Gonzales-Dholakia, the 48-year-old executive director of Jolt Action, said she believes the proposed bills \u2013 especially the elimination of 24 hour voting hours \u2013 are a \u201cdirect response\u201d to the Black and Brown youth voter turnout in Texas in 2020. \u201cThose late night hours are primarily used by not only working class voters, but young voters and students. By restricting those hours, it\u2019s a fundamentally anti-democratic attack on voting,\u201d she said. Gonzales-Dholakia, who was at the state Capitol on Tuesday, emphasized that young activists with Jolt Action protested to let lawmakers know they\u2019re not giving up. \u201cTheir message was that we\u2019re here, our numbers are here, we\u2019re powerful, we\u2019re diverse and we\u2019re not going to back down,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden convened a small summit of local leaders in late June to discuss his plans to combat nationwide surge in violent crime. This week, he did it again \u2013 this time encouraging cities to use resources from his Covid-19 relief package to fund a range of new public safety measures. Among those in attendance on Monday at the White House: Eric Adams, the projected Democratic nominee to become the next mayor of New York City and darling of moderates desperate to divorce the party\u2019s brand from a movement that took flight in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder by a police officer in Minneapolis. Calls to \u201cDefund the Police\u201d have almost entirely subsided since last summer, when the backlash to racist police violence set off protests across the country. In the cauldron of those heated demonstrations, emboldened progressive activists pushed for a dramatic reallocation of public funding away from police departments and toward social services, along with other preventive strategies designed to limit interactions between officers and nonviolent potential offenders. The slogan, grabby but simplistic, briefly enjoyed some public support by mainstream liberal organizations. But it faded from all but the most hardcore activists\u2019 rhetoric as the 2020 election season heated up and public polling suggested it was a loser with most voters. The phrase lives on now mostly as a cudgel: one Republicans attempt to foist on Democrats in general election campaigns, regardless of their actual positions, and moderate Democrats try to hang like a millstone around the necks of their more progressive primary rivals, whether they subscribe to it or not. Adams, a retired captain in the New York Police Department, pinned much of his successful mayoral primary campaign on a pledge to restore public safety in a city that, like so many others around the country, has seen more than a year of rising violent crime and shootings. He was also a willing foil to the \u201cdefund\u201d crowd, which he largely dismissed as disconnected and privileged, promising stepped-up policing and the return of a controversial plainclothes NYPD anti-crime unit. In the end, Adams\u2019 message resonated in many of the hardest hit neighborhoods. Two days after the election, holding a narrow but solid lead, Adams stepped out and declared himself the \u201cface of the new Democratic Party\u201d \u2013 and warned that candidates who ignored his example risked not only their own fates, but the party\u2019s congressional majorities next year. \u201cIf the Democratic Party fails to recognize what we did here in New York, then they\u2019re going to have a problem in the midterm elections, and they\u2019re going to have a problem in the presidential elections,\u201d Adams said. The moderate wing of the party has celebrated the brash Brooklynite\u2019s declarations, though his victory, in a closed primary that attracted fewer than a million voters, is unlikely to settle any long-running ideological debates. That is also a reflection of the reality that Adams\u2019 views on crime and punishment are, by his own description, \u201ccomplicated,\u201d as he told CNN in May. \u201cI support closing Rikers (Island jail), but also support closing the pipeline that feeds Rikers,\u201d he said. In many ways, Adams is an ideal match and ally for Biden. The President\u2019s winning coalition last year largely predicted Adams\u2019 in June, a parallel the Brooklyn borough president enjoys pointing out. Adams applauded Biden\u2019s approach on public safety after Monday\u2019s meeting, which came on the heels of a 72-hour span that saw 125 people killed in more than 360 shootings nationwide, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. \u201c(Biden is) sending a loud message that this country and cities like New York are no longer going to normalize the level of violence that\u2019s taking place in our inner cities, handgun violence, something we have ignored on a federal level,\u201d Adams told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell. Adams\u2019 frustration with the federal government\u2019s inaction in response to gun violence puts him in line with Democrats of all stripes. But he has also offered more pointed criticism of what he describes as years of neglect \u2013 through both Democratic and Republican administrations \u2013 of handgun violence in predominantly minority and working class urban areas. Asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday if he believed national Democrats\u2019 priorities \u2013 specifically, their focus on assault weapons \u2013 have been misplaced, Adams didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s almost insulting what we have witnessed over the last few years. Many of our presidents, they saw these numbers. They knew that the inner cities, particularly where Black, brown and poor people lived, they know \u2013 they knew \u2013 they were dealing with this real crisis.\u201d Adams\u2019 comment risked rankling some leading anti-gun violence activists \u2013 in nonpartisan, moderate and progressive spheres \u2013 who view those priorities as deeply intertwined. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, whose nonprofit group is part of Everytown for Gun Safety, one of the nation\u2019s largest gun control advocate organizations, told CNN in a statement that she believes \u201cthe single most important piece of legislation Congress could send to the President\u2019s desk would be to close loopholes in the background check system.\u201d \u201cThis is a complex, multifaceted issue that requires a holistic approach, including funding for violence intervention programs and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking,\u201d Watts said, \u201cboth of which continue to be a focus for President Biden.\u201d On the left, frustration with Adams\u2019 rhetoric and some of Biden\u2019s initiatives, which include his push for local governments to use money from his American Rescue Plan to hire more police officers, reflects the underlying forces that drove the \u201cdefund\u201d movement. Kina Collins, a longtime anti-gun violence activist leader currently running a progressive primary challenge to incumbent Democratic Rep. Danny Davis in Illinois\u2019 7th district dismissed the debate over defunding \u2013 \u201cI call it funding our communities,\u201d she said \u2013 as overly simplistic, but questioned whether a surge of police would have the desired effect. \u201cHere in the city of Chicago, in my district, the Chicago Police Department was given nearly $300 million from COVID relief, on top of their $1.7 billion that they already had allocated in the city budget. They dispatched a thousand police officers on July 4 weekend and guess what, 100-plus people were shot, 19 fatally,\u201d said Collins, who served as a member of the Biden transition team\u2019s task force on gun violence. \u201cThere were police officers who were shot \u2013 so the people who are supposed to be protecting us in these communities have now become a part of the vicious cycle of being gun violence survivors.\u201d The answer, Collins said, will not come from \u201cpouring more money into an already-bloated police budget that doesn\u2019t make us any safer,\u201d but through investing in \u201cviolence interruption\u201d programs that identify and train people within high-risk communities \u201cwho can identify high potential shooters and those who have the high risk to be shot at and deescalating those situations.\u201d On the campaign trail, Adams discussed preventive measures but never wavered from the argument that more robust policing was the quickest and most effective tool for combating the current rise in violent crime. \u201cDon\u2019t let people fool you,\u201d Adams told CNN in May. \u201cI\u2019ve never went to one meeting, where people sat inside that meeting and said \u2018I don\u2019t want a cop on my block.\u2019 Never. And in fact, I\u2019ve gone to meetings where we said, \u2018We\u2019re going to take the cop off your block\u2019 and they would be ready to fight you because of that.\u201d Biden\u2019s latest initiative, as detailed in a memo from the administration, tries to square both schools of thought \u2013 a familiar exercise for a President who, from the moment he clinched the nomination in 2020, has sought to forge a working consensus within an ideologically divided party. His gathering on Monday included law enforcement, elected officials and a community violence intervention experts. Speaking afterward, Biden ticked off a varied approach to turning back the violent tide, but put particular emphasis on a piece of common ground: preventing guns from entering communities in the first place. \u201cWhile there\u2019s no one-size-fit-all approach, we know there are some things that work,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cAnd the first of those that work is stemming the flow of firearms.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Here I am, a guy in Virginia who has never lived in in New York, and yet I\u2019ve been following the New York mayor\u2019s race. And why not. Rudy Giuliani, Michael Bloomberg and currently Bill de Blasio \u2013 some of the biggest political personalities in the country have run through the office and put their imprint on the national scene, even if policies they enacted have had exactly zero practical bearing on my life or, probably, yours. But the election in America\u2019s biggest city is particularly important this year for two reasons: I went to CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg, who covered the race, for his thoughts about what this race means for: Our conversation, conducted via Slack, is below: What Matters: First, what\u2019s your position on how important the New York mayor\u2019s race is to the rest of the country? Gregory Krieg: This has obviously been a subject of debate \u2013 do we care about who the mayor of NYC is because it matters \u2026 or because so many reporters live here? The answer is: yes. Both! The case for why it matters is, for me, is that the city is the largest and most diverse in the country. Analyst explains how Adams won Democratic primary for NYC mayor Queens, one of the five boroughs, is bigger than most major US cities. And what happens here, for better or worse, is in the bloodstream of the way the media reports and frames issues all around the country. Politicians from both parties, for different reasons, look to the city \u2013 how it votes and the policies it implements \u2013 for evidence for and against their agendas. This time out, the mayoral race turned on two issues: how to recover and rebuild after the worst of Covid and what to do about rising violent crime rates. So the results here are shaping debates that are already happening all over the country. What Matters: After New Yorkers in the Bronx and Queens gave Congress Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive lawmaker who has pushed the party to the left, Democrats there have now selected a law-and-order former police officer to lead the city. Which one is the real Democratic party? Krieg: I\u2019m going to push back a little on the frame of this question \u2013 which is obviously a familiar one \u2013 and say: There is no such thing as the \u201creal\u201d Democratic Party. The citywide races for mayor and comptroller and the down-ballot contest for the city council here are perfect examples. The Democratic Party, unlike the GOP, is very much a coalition party. That\u2019s not an academic matter. The party includes \u2013 to your point \u2013 centrists and liberals and progressives and leftists. (Though not equally distributed; the centrists and moderate liberals still rule the roost.) The party \u2013 and I think AOC said this during the presidential primary \u2013 would not be a party in other countries. It would be 2 or 3 or even 4 parties. In short, the real Democratic Party is what you see now in NYC: One that elects a centrist mayor, a progressive comptroller, and a varied but increasingly left-leaning city council. What Matters: That sounds a lot like White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who said this to The New York Times about Adams\u2019 apparent victory: I think that the coalition that Mr. Adams put together in New York is not dissimilar to the coalition that President Biden put together, a coalition of working-class voters, African-American voters overwhelmingly, and voters who want to see progress on core issues. And I think that is the coalition that got Joe Biden the Democratic nomination in 2020. It got him elected president in November of 2020. So I think it\u2019s a familiar coalition. That\u2019s the coalition we continue to see as kind of the center of American politics. And so that\u2019s not a surprise to me. What do you think Democrats like Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren are taking away from these results? Krieg: Oy. Standby. What Matters: I think I know what you\u2019re going to say and I have an even better one coming. Krieg: There are no dummies in that group, so I would suspect that the results mostly confirmed what they previously knew \u2013 that there is, for now, a ceiling on what the progressive wing of the party can do in big elections. And when I say big, I mean it literally \u2013 elections with large numbers of voters. The NYC left is understandably pointing to downballot successes and noting that they didn\u2019t really get involved in the mayoral campaign \u2013 in part because of resource management and also because none of the candidates really appealed to them. RELATED: Progressive group launches $7 million effort to elect Democratic secretaries of state and attorneys general I think it\u2019s a fair, but narrow, point to make. The reality remains this: progressives need to do better, and more, to win working class and minority voters of all ages. They hate hearing it, but the Biden coalition \u2013 as Klain puts it (analysis with which I agree) \u2013 is still the winning ticket. So I\u2019m sure Warren and Sanders and AOC and many, many more shrewd progressive tacticians are turning this over in their heads. I know for fact that many in NYC are. And the question they\u2019re asking is how to better connect with the people their policies are written to benefit? What Matters: OK, let\u2019s flip the script. I\u2019m old enough to remember New York electing successive Republican governors, and Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg (you don\u2019t have to be THAT old to remember it!). Note: Those two went in very different directions. Giuliani is still in the news because of his connection to former President Donald Trump. He recently lost his New York law license. Bloomberg is now a Democrat and tried to use his billions (unsuccessfully) to run for President. And yet Adams\u2019 victory in the Democratic primary is perceived to put him on a glide path to victory. The law and order space Adams occupies, I think, should actually be the sweet spot for a moderate Republican. His victory in the Democratic primary says as much about where Republicans are as it does about Democrats. Krieg: Good one. What Matters: When you don\u2019t say \u201cgood one,\u201d you start your answer by completely rejecting my question, so I\u2019ll take it. Krieg: Not this time. The GOP in New York is a shambles. And to your point, that\u2019s not because the electorate is so overwhelmingly Democratic. The city and state have elected plenty of Republicans. So yes, large portions of Adams\u2019 message could have easily come from the mouth of a certain kind of GOP candidate. But that candidate does not exist. Why? Because Adams did two things at once in this primary: He talked about stepped-up policing and, though he didn\u2019t use the term, law and order more generally. But that message was always \u2013 always! \u2013 part of a broader pitch that promised justice and fair treatment by the police. Can a Republican candidate these days, in a GOP primary, say the second part and still win? No one knows exactly what Adams will do. He is a bit of a wild card, but the fact is that his message was more nuanced than he got credit for \u2013 and certainly better-rounded than a Republican, these days, could afford to make. What Matters: While Adams\u2019 victory does something to confound the national GOP message about cities and Democratic politicians and crime, the primary itself feeds into another, insidious message, about the security of American elections. Ranked choice voting is supposed to insure the majority of voters are comfortable with the winning candidate, but it was glitchy and confusing to New Yorkers. What\u2019s next for ranked choice voting? RELATED: Ranked choice-voting, explained Krieg: I think ranked-choice voting is here to stay. In part because it would take a lot to undo it and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much appetite or organization behind tossing it. But at least in NYC, there is an understanding that ranked-choice \u2013 however one feels about it \u2013 was not the cause of the fiasco a few weeks ago. That mess was the sole propriety of the city\u2019s bumbling Board of Elections, which included test ballots in their initial tabulation. Ranked-choice might have given the BOE more chances to mess up \u2013 which they seized on \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t the cause. The main point here, as you said, is that NYC\u2019s inept elections bureaucracy is no longer just a local issue. As Republicans try to make it harder to vote, using these bogus threats to \u201celection security\u201d as a pretext, Democrats here are finally feeling at least some pressure to move forward with reform \u2013 to professionalize a board that is basically a jobs program from friends, family and allies of Democratic and Republican local leaders. So to be clear \u2013 there is NO evidence this election was unfair, insecure, etc. But hoo boy, did the BOE here give those acting in bad faith a story to highlight. What Matters: OK, I\u2019ve gotten my New York fix. What should I have asked but didn\u2019t? Krieg: I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t ask me about Eric Adams getting his ears pierced on Wednesday! He apparently told some voters he would do it if he won the primary. So that\u2019s one promise kept. On the campaign trail a group of young people met with my son & me. They asked \u201chow do we know you\u2019re not like other politicians who make promises they don\u2019t keep\u201d. They said we\u2019ll trust you if you promise to pierce your ear when you win the primary. Promise made, promise kept! pic.twitter.com/E0VlfS7ydD The only (serious) point I\u2019ll ask and answer: what does this mean for the relationship between incoming mayor (assuming he wins the general, which he will) and our three-term Gov. Andrew Cuomo. As everyone knows, Cuomo and the term-limited Mayor Bill de Blasio despise each other. That\u2019s not hyperbole, to be clear. So can the new mayor and Cuomo get on in a functional way? My guess is that things will be better, at least at the start. If Cuomo runs again in 2022, he will want Adams on his side and city voters thinking about all the resources he\u2019s delivered for them! But on the other side of that \u2026 who knows? The push-and-pull between the city and Albany predated Cuomo vs. de Blasio and it will outlive them, too. What Matters: Could de Blasio have won a third term? Krieg: Approval ratings suggest no and I think he would have definitely gotten a primary challenge, but my bet is yes \u2013 he certainly COULD have. What Matters: I also didn\u2019t ask about questions that came up during the campaign about whether Adams lives in his office in Brooklyn or with his partner in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa will probably look at that. Thanks, Greg! Krieg: LOL, he surely will. Thanks, Zach!",

            "article_content": "Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams will be the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, CNN projects, following the latest ranked-choice count of primary voters, a tally that for the first time included the lion\u2019s share of nearly 126,000 absentee ballots cast. Former Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia finished a narrow second in the count released Tuesday night by the New York City Board of Elections, with Adams leading her by a single percentage point \u2013 50.5% to 49.5% \u2013 in the final round. Civil rights attorney Maya Wiley made it to the penultimate round, placing third in the still-unofficial results. According to CNN\u2019s projection, the remaining uncounted ballots won\u2019t be enough for any of the other candidates to catch Adams. Garcia made a similar determination ahead of her concession at a news conference on Wednesday morning at the Women\u2019s Rights Pioneers Monument in Central Park. A night earlier, Garcia spokeswoman Lindsey Green said the campaign was \u201cseeking additional clarity on the number of outstanding ballots and (is) committed to supporting the Democratic nominee.\u201d Adams has spoken confidently since Election Night, when he raced out to an early lead \u2013 and declared victory after the new numbers were published by the BOE. If he defeats Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a heavy underdog, in the fall, Adams would become the second Black mayor in the city\u2019s history and the first since the late David Dinkins lost reelection in 1993. A retired captain in the New York Police Department, Adams emerged from a deep field and dizzying campaign that included former 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who briefly seemed to captivate the city before the contest intensified. Yang conceded shortly after the polls closed on June 22 and is on track to finish fourth. \u201cWhile there are still some very small amounts of votes to be counted, the results are clear: an historic, diverse, five-borough coalition led by working-class New Yorkers has led us to victory in the Democratic primary for Mayor of New York City,\u201d Adams said in a statement on Tuesday night. \u201cNow we must focus on winning in November so that we can deliver on the promise of this great city for those who are struggling, who are underserved, and who are committed to a safe, fair, affordable future for all New Yorkers.\u201d Adams on Wednesday morning told CNN\u2019s John Berman that he had not yet been in contact with Garcia but had \u201cheard from a number of the former candidates and they were extremely gracious.\u201d He also said his campaign did not plan to move ahead with a lawsuit against the BOE, which was filed in the aftermath of the board\u2019s release of erroneous preliminary results last week. \u201cThe lawsuit was to really safeguard the paper and the documents, so we won\u2019t have any shenanigans,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that it was my team that identified that the board of elections had more votes than actual voters.\u201d After unfolding mostly as an afterthought to many New Yorkers for months, in the shadow of a devastating winter wave of Covid-19 and allegations of sexual harassment against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the campaign to succeed term-limited Mayor Bill de Blasio began to heat up in early May. The focus of the race also began to change as voting neared. With vaccination rates up and infections plummeting, public safety \u2013 amid a rise in violent crime \u2013 took center stage. Adams leaned on his past in law enforcement to make the case that he was singularly qualified to stem the tide. He also pointed to a decades-long history of advocating against racism in the NYPD to argue that, despite his support for a dialed-back form of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d and the return of a controversial plainclothes unit, he offered the best option to successfully overhaul the department. \u201cThe police department would run rings around\u201d the other candidates), Adams told CNN in late May. \u201cThey are masters. If you\u2019re a good mayor, you\u2019re only here for eight years. I\u2019ve been here for 30-something years in the department. Police departments will wait you out.\u201d Adams\u2019 argument landed with a base that largely resides outside of more liberal parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Adams ran up his vote totals in places like Southeast Queens, which is predominantly Black, and other working-class outer borough hubs. He also enjoyed considerable support from the city\u2019s labor establishment, was a prolific fundraiser and was backed by a big-spending super PAC. De Blasio, though he never publicly endorsed Adams, was widely believed to prefer him and reportedly made as much clear to some high-profile union leaders. Wiley, who worked in de Blasio\u2019s administration during his first term as counsel to the mayor, and Garcia gained traction as the race moved into its final weeks, and both had said they saw paths to victory after the first two rounds of counting. But Wiley on Tuesday, after criticizing the BOE\u2019s handling of the count and urging a reform of the bumbling bureaucracy, struck a conciliatory note. Garcia conceded on Wednesday morning, noting \u2013 as she had during the campaign \u2013 that in four centuries, no woman had held \u201cthe top seat at City Hall.\u201d \u201cThis campaign has come closer than any other moment in history to breaking that glass ceiling in selecting New York City\u2019s first female mayor,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe cracked the hell out of it, and it\u2019s ready to be broken, but we have not cracked that glass ceiling.\u201d Wiley, who on Tuesday night criticized the BOE\u2019s handling of the count and urged a reform of the bumbling bureaucracy, also said she accepted that Adams would be the nominee \u2013 and highlighted its historical significance. \u201cThis is only the second time a Black New Yorker has been elected mayor of this city and that has tremendous meeting for so many New Yorkers, particularly Black people,\u201d Wiley said. (Adams still needs to defeat Sliwa, the Republican, in November to officially claim the office.) The newly released numbers include about 118,000 newly tabulated ballots, in addition to votes from early in-person and election day voters. Almost 126,000 Democratic absentee ballots were returned, so this release includes the vast majority of the outstanding ballots, but it is not a final result. This count published Tuesday night is the fourth \u2013 all of them partial and preliminary \u2013 of the primary vote. The first, after the polls closed on June 22, showed Adams with about a 10 point-lead in first choice preferences among in-person early and Election Day voters over his nearest competitors. The next, pushed out one week ago, was retracted because the BOE mistakenly included test ballots in its tabulation. A day later, last Wednesday, the first ranked-choice dry-run was successfully conducted. It showed Adams\u2019 lead dwindling to 2.2% over Garcia in the final round, who advanced ahead of Wiley by fewer than 400 votes. Earlier in the day, the BOE announced at a meeting that there were 3,699 outstanding ballots waiting to be \u201ccured\u201d \u2013 or corrected because of a minor error \u2013 by voters. Officials at the gathering downplayed last week\u2019s mess, when the board initially published erroneous figures, describing the public\u2019s desire for timely information and transparency as being at odds with the BOE\u2019s producing accurate data \u2013 a situation one described as a \u201cCatch-22.\u201d They also sought to assure New Yorkers that the final results would not be compromised. \u201cWe were trying to satisfy expectations of quick results with a new way of voting,\u201d one BOE official said at the meeting. \u201cWhat we can say with certainty this issue caused no votes to be lost, no voter disenfranchised, and no incorrect results to be certified.\u201d Voters in the Big Apple had the option to rank up to five of the 13 candidates in the race. Since no candidate won a majority of the initial preference votes outright, the New York City Board of Elections is counting voters\u2019 ranked choices to determine the winner. In ranked-choice voting tabulations, the candidate with the fewest votes after the initial count is eliminated and all ballots for that candidate are reallocated to the next highest-ranked candidate selected. That process continues with the remaining candidates until two are left, with the winner determined by who has the most votes in that final round.",

            "article_content": "When Rep. Rosa DeLauro first introduced legislation to expand the child tax credit 18 years ago, even her fellow Democrats dismissed it as a fringe idea. \u201cLike crazy aunts in the attic,\u201d is how DeLauro described the way her colleagues looked at her in 2003, and nearly every year since then, as she re-introduced the measure over and over again. But by the 2020 election, such progressive ideas had moved center stage in her party, and when President Joe Biden and the Democratic majority in Congress drafted the American Rescue Plan earlier this year, DeLauro\u2019s patience ran out. \u201cI spent almost a weekend on the phone,\u201d the Connecticut Democrat said in an interview with CNN in May, recounting how she spoke with various members of the White House, fighting to get her tax credit into the large legislative package. \u201cEnough,\u201d DeLauro \u2013 now the chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee \u2013 recalled telling the White House. \u201cThis is it. It\u2019s now. It\u2019s now our watch. Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s get this done,\u201d she remembered saying. It was added to the bill within 48 hours, which Congress passed in March. The newly expanded child tax credit will provide financial relief to some 39 million households. Not only will the credits increase in value, but for the first time they\u2019ll be fully tax refundable. Starting July 15, eligible families will receive payments each month \u2013 a change from the previous policy, which paid families only once a year. The administration estimates that nearly 90% of children in the country will be covered. \u201cIt\u2019s a New Deal,\u201d DeLauro declared proudly. \u201cIt really is a lifeline to middle class families, as well as lifting over 50% of kids out of poverty.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most transformative pieces of legislation that we could have come by,\u201d she added. \u201cThe years paid off.\u201d Now, DeLauro is working with fellow veteran female lawmaker, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, to push other longtime progressive priorities like paid family leave and equal pay. Murray \u2013 the chair of the Senate Health, Education Labor and Pensions Committee \u2013 said the pandemic \u201creally exposed\u201d the inequality she and DeLauro have spent their careers fighting against. In a year when many frontline workers were unable to work from home, and left without options for childcare, the disparities were exacerbated. \u201cOur frontline workers, women of color, people who\u2019ve been put down forever \u2013 they clean your bathrooms and they are behind the scenes, but they\u2019re raising kids and they\u2019re part of our communities,\u201d Murray said in the same interview with CNN. Women have borne the brunt of the job loss; the newfound caregiving responsibilities drove many out of the workforce. Women had lost a net of more than 5.4 million jobs since February 2020, according to a National Women\u2019s Law Center study published in January. When the Washington State native first arrived in the Senate in 1993, the first issue she worked on was unpaid family leave. \u201cThis is a great first step,\u201d Murray recalled thinking at the time. But now, nearly three decades later, she argues it is long past time to pass paid family leave. \u201cWomen hold this stress right here,\u201d Murray, clutching her chest, said about the fear many working women have if they don\u2019t have childcare or paid sick leave. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking about it on a national stage,\u201d she said \u2013 a relief for so many women, including these two lawmakers. Despite the enormous impact they\u2019ve had on moving the national narrative forward, both Democrats feel a sense of urgency now more than ever \u2013 with the House, Senate and the White House in Democratic hands and the 2022 midterms right around the corner. \u201cThe window only opens for a short time in Washington, DC. So, we got to move and we got to move now,\u201d DeLauro said. Murray jumped in: \u201cAnd I am not going to listen to anybody say to us, \u2018Well, it\u2019s a really good issue. Let\u2019s fold it and run on it in the next campaign.\u2019 I mean\u2026\u201d she said, stopping just short of rolling her eyes. \u201cHow many times have people said that to you about this issue?\u201d We asked. Murray took a beat to answer, pursing her lips with a knowing stare. \u201cMore than you will ever know.\u201d When we sat down with DeLauro and Murray in a gilded House Appropriations Committee office inside the Capitol, the conversation was reminiscent of longtime friends reconnecting, picking up right where they left off. In fact, they hadn\u2019t seen one another in more than a year. The two talked openly about the challenges they still face as women \u2013 even finishing each other\u2019s sentences talking about sexism. \u201cI was the only woman in the room so many times, and I could bring these issues up and no one would act with them. It would be, \u2018Yeah. Right,\u2019\u201d Murray remembered. After Murray won her seat during the \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d 1992 election, which ushered in a record number of female senators, there were only seven women in the Senate. The other 93 senators were men. Now there are 24 female senators \u2013 far from parity \u2013 but, Murray said, enough to change the conversations about issues relating to family and female equity. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got other people going, \u2018Wait, this is an issue.\u2019 Echoing you down the row in our committee hearings, in meetings. You\u2019re not the only one saying that. They cannot ignore us,\u201d the five-term senator said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in the House,\u201d DeLauro added. While they agree that yes, having more women at the table is important, they make an important distinction. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that our male colleagues are in great opposition,\u201d DeLauro noted of the men\u2019s attitude toward family equity. \u201cThey didn\u2019t talk about it before because they didn\u2019t feel like it was manly,\u201d Murray added, using her hands to put \u201cmanly\u201d in air quotes. These issues just didn\u2019t naturally occur to most men. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it okay for them to talk about it,\u201d said Murray as DeLauro nodded in agreement. Despite each of them being high-profile committee chairs, and even with a female House speaker and newly elected female vice president, both women bluntly said that Congress is still very much a man\u2019s world. \u201cThis is still an institution where women have to work much harder,\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that many bites at the apple. When you get up to speak, you need to know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d \u201cOh, my gosh, that\u2019s so true,\u201d Murray interjected. \u201cHave you ever heard men speak to a Chamber of Commerce and talk about the weather?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll say anything and it\u2019s okay,\u201d DeLauro added. A cathartic moment to witness \u2013 two powerful female lawmakers, talking openly about the realities they faced \u2013 and still experience. \u201cI learned from women that you don\u2019t take no for an answer, you don\u2019t give up, and you make your voices heard. And that\u2019s what keeps us together as well on these issues,\u201d DeLauro said. These veteran progressive women paved the way for the growing, younger social media savvy generation. \u201cHow you pass legislation is the actual getting the votes,\u201d DeLauro said about the 18 years it took to pass the child tax credit. It\u2019s about negotiating, she said, the convincing, the give and the take. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen on Twitter and it\u2019s not instant.\u201d Both DeLauro and Murray said they try to gently guide and mentor their younger progressive colleagues. \u201cI think experience in knowing which levers to push at what time, and when to make an issue an issue is important. But you have to have both. You have to both experience, passion and that new (feeling of), \u2018I\u2019m here, I got to get something done.\u2019\u201d Murray was elected to the Senate in 1992 as a \u201cmom in tennis shoes,\u201d an expression her opponents tried using as an attack until she embraced it as her campaign slogan. She held her tennis shoes proudly in the air during her victory speech on election night. DeLauro started her career on Capitol Hill more than 40 years ago as chief of staff to former Sen. Chris Dodd, also of Connecticut. In 1990, she ran for a seat in the House. She forged a friendship early on in her career with now Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two are still close friends. Though their experience and persistence unite them, the legislative styles of Murray and DeLauro could not be more different. Murray is a more of a quiet legislative tactician who famously forged a rare bipartisan budget agreement with former House Speaker Paul Ryan. And DeLauro? \u201cShe will throw the dynamite,\u201d Murray said of her friend. The dichotomy is visible. Murray sported a classic black suit and sensible sneakers during our interview, while her purple-haired colleague sat beside her in a bright patterned dress with a ring on nearly every finger. \u201cTwo different styles, with the same goal, and the same determination,\u201d DeLauro said. DeLauro vividly remembers the day her family was evicted from their home. \u201cWe went home with my folks on a Friday night, and our furniture was out on the street.\u201d Her parents simply couldn\u2019t make ends meet, she said. It was that childhood trauma that propelled her to push to expand the child tax credit, which will only last through this year, but she intends to fight to make it permanent. Murray had never heard that story from her friend. Despite working together for decades on family issues, they\u2019d never shared their own childhood stories with each other. \u201cI was a teenager, and my dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and of course my mom was a stay-at-home mom. She stayed home and took care of seven kids, and never thought she\u2019d have to work, and my dad had to quit his job,\u201d Murray shared. The senator said her family turned to government assistance programs like Pell Grants and food stamps to make ends meet. \u201cSo many people don\u2019t recognize that terrible drop in your soul, when you are a child and something like this impacts you,\u201d Murray said, locking eyes with her colleague. \u201cRosa, I\u2019m so glad to hear that about you, because we come with that passion that \u2013 it happened to me, but I don\u2019t want it to happen to anybody else.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the 30 years we\u2019ve spent in this institution,\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cIt\u2019s your life\u2019s experience. It\u2019s the values from that life experience that move you to take up these efforts.\u201d \u201cAnd make you into a fighter,\u201d Murray added.",

            "article_content": "No matter the charge, the defense is the same: Donald Trump is the victim of a vicious political vendetta. By a quirk of fate, two of the most troublesome threats to the ex-President\u2019s political viability and business legend unfolded almost simultaneously Thursday in two cities he once dominated. And he responded the way he always does, by going on the attack. In New York City, prosecutors arraigned Trump\u2019s financial right-hand man, Allen Weisselberg, on charges including grand larceny and tax fraud. And the Trump Organization itself was accused of a fraudulent multi-year scheme to avoid due taxes. Back in Washington, meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi named those who will serve on a select committee on the January 6 US Capitol insurrection, which was incited by Trump in a bid to overturn his election defeat. In a poke in the eye to the former President, they include one of his mortal enemies, Wyoming\u2019s Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the few Republicans to speak truth to his abuses of power surrounding last year\u2019s election. Takeaways from the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg indictment No recent former President has faced the kind of threat to his legacy, reputation and potentially even his fortune now being encountered by Trump. And the ferocity of his defense \u2013 faithful to his mantra of never giving an inch to his adversaries \u2013 suggests he plans to respond with the kind of all-consuming assault on America\u2019s psyche that unfolded during his presidency. The line from Trump world is that the former President is being targeted not for what he did but for who he is, a construct that has carried him through the Russia probe, two impeachments and numerous other political, personal and business scrapes. \u201cIf the name of the company was something else, I don\u2019t think these charges would have been brought,\u201d said Alan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization legal team largely avoided a point-by-point rebuttal of 15 grand jury counts alleging that Weisselberg \u2013 the organization\u2019s chief financial officer \u2013 evaded taxes on $1.7 million in income and falsified documents in a 15-year scheme. The indictment said the activity allegedly involved other unnamed executives in a firm in which the Trump family itself holds all the top roles. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization both pleaded not guilty. The former President was not personally charged. Another Trump organization attorney, Susan Necheles, was even more aggressive than Futerfas in alleging a corrupt political conspiracy against Trump. \u201cWe will win this case, but this case should have never been brought,\u201d Necheles told reporters outside the courtroom. \u201cThis is a political prosecution.\u201d Earlier, prosecutor Carey Dunne anticipated the counterattack that the case was rooted in partisan distaste for the former President. \u201cPolitics has no role in the grand jury chamber, and I can assure your honor that it played no role here,\u201d Dunne told the judge, according to a transcript of his remarks released by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. Back in Washington, the nature of the turmoil surrounding Trump was political and not legal. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has repudiated his earlier criticism of Trump over the mob attack on the Capitol by \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d supporters, insisted the real issue was malfeasance by Democrats. \u201cI regret the politics of Nancy Pelosi. For six months she played politics with this,\u201d said the California Republican, who crushed a plan for an independent bipartisan commission on the attack co-written by one of his own GOP lawmakers. There is an argument that Pelosi waited too long to agree to a compromise with Republican Rep. John Katko of New York on the makeup of a bipartisan panel. And there are obvious political upsides for Democrats in continuing to investigate Trump\u2019s abuses of power, with midterm elections ahead. But at the same time, the failure of the independent commission deprived the country of the kind of catharsis and historic marker that such panels have provided at moments of national tragedy, so there is a case to be made that a reckoning \u2013 over and above probes by regular congressional committees \u2013 was due. It is not all about politics. The complaint that any attempt to subject Trump to legal accountability is politically motivated is not a new refrain. Every time the former President is accused of wrongdoing, he and his acolytes rarely rebut the charges with any level of seriousness or specificity. And Trump himself never takes responsibility for his actions, but instead seeks to flood the zone with partisan confusion and misinformation. When the Justice Department and the FBI, for instance, became suspicious about multiple contacts between Russia, a hostile foreign power meddling in the US election, and his 2016 campaign aides, Trump claimed he was the victim of a massive \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d In his first impeachment, his Republican attack dogs complained about a politicized process while sidestepping allegations that he had tried to get Ukraine to launch an investigation into then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Trump\u2019s second impeachment \u2013 after the most flagrant attack on the peaceful transfer of power in US history \u2013 was branded by Senate Republicans as a political plot to persecute an ex-President by anti-Trump zealots as he settled into private life. And even Trump\u2019s denials that he actually lost the last election are part of a sweeping and false narrative \u2013 rejected by multiple courts \u2013 that there was a vast Democratic Party conspiracy to deprive him of a second term in office. \u201cThey used Covid in order to rig the election and in order to steal the election,\u201d Trump said in a rally in Ohio last Saturday night. Trump knows what he is doing. He built his political appeal on the idea that he was a spokesman for millions of Americans who had been rejected by the cozy elite club \u2013 just as the brazen billionaire was often mocked by Manhattan high society. This canny understanding of the politics of victimization helped a real estate tycoon from one of the most liberal cities in America, who flew in a personal airliner, bond with millions of working-class voters in the American heartland. Paradoxically, a new set of controversies might embolden Trump and help him refresh his appeal to his base, as he seeks to play the kingmaker in the midterm elections and teases another presidential run in 2024. His frequent message to his supporters might be paraphrased as: They are not coming after me \u2013 they are coming after you. Or as the former President put it in a statement soon after Weisselberg left court, \u201cDo people see the Radical Left prosecutors, and what they are trying to do to 75M +++  Voters and Patriots, for what it is?\u201d Although the Trump Organization\u2019s legal team insisted that Weisselberg was being used by the former President\u2019s enemies, the detailed indictment against him will require a staunch and formal legal defense. Political soundbites generally do not stand up in court \u2013 as the multiple rejected cases brought by Trump\u2019s campaign legal team alleging election fraud in November demonstrate. The Trump Organization\u2019s lawyers did tip their hand as to one aspect of that defense, namely an argument that it is unprecedented to prosecute a tax case such as this as a criminal rather than a civil matter. Some legal experts said the practice is somewhat unusual given that this prosecution centers on rent-free apartments, car leases, school fees and other fringe benefits. But Harry Litman, a former deputy assistant attorney general, told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow that given the prominence of Weisselberg in the firm and the allegations of a scheme to defraud, the approach was in line with precedent. \u201cThis is spin and talking points that they prepared before, I think, they saw the indictment,\u201d Litman said. Two big questions were left unanswered by Thursday\u2019s indictment. The first is whether the robust indictment against Weisselberg may be designed to get him to cooperate with prosecutors in return for lesser charges \u2013 and potentially to testify against Trump family members. Weisselberg has so far refused to do so. The second question is whether the unsealed indictment represents the full extent of the two-year investigations against Trump and his company or whether there is more to come for the ex-President. Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen, who himself went to jail after pleading guilty to campaign finance and tax charges, said he could have scripted the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d defense in advance. \u201cThere is nothing that happened at the Trump Organization that did not go to Donald,\u201d Cohen told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota. \u201cWhether it was the purchasing of paperclips or the payment of Allen Weisselberg\u2019s grandchildren\u2019s tuition. Every single thing went on Donald\u2019s desk for signature.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak signed a sweeping law Friday that moves its party presidential selection contest up to the first Tuesday in February in 2024 and changes it from a caucus to a primary. \u201cI am deeply grateful to the legislators, community advocates, and supporters who were instrumental in ensuring that Nevada continues to push forward and prioritize our access to voting,\u201d Sisolak, a Democrat, tweeted. Assembly Bill 126 puts Nevada\u2019s new primary near the traditional dates for the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, traditionally a third rail in presidential politics that has caused complications in past elections. Nevada Democrats initially were even more aggressive. The bill\u2019s first draft would have put the presidential primary date in the middle of January, but an amendment pushed that date back by two weeks. For now, the Democratic National Committee is officially staying above the fray. \u201cWe are going to continue to let the process play out, as it does every four years, and look forward to hearing the insight and recommendations from all interested parties on the 2020 reforms, and on the 2024 calendar at the appropriate time in the process,\u201d chair Jaime Harrison said in a written statement released by the party Friday. But momentum to change the 2024 calendar has been picking up, both because of the chaos around the 2020 Iowa caucuses and the growing belief from some Democrats that two states with predominately White populations should not be the first states to vote in the Democratic presidential primary. And both Iowa and New Hampshire are sure to fight back against any planned move by Nevada. \u201cI remain confident New Hampshire will retain our first in the nation presidential primary,\u201d New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley told CNN Friday. \u201cIowa going first does not take away from other state\u2019s abilities to hold primaries, it adds an important voice to the conversation. I believe Democratic candidates have a real opportunity in Iowa to connect with a diverse electorate that includes voters of color and rural working class Americans,\u201d Iowa Democratic Party Chair Ross Wilburn said in a statement to CNN. \u201cIowa Democrats and Republicans don\u2019t agree on much, but we do agree in keeping Iowa first in the nation. I have had conversations with Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann and will continue to be in communication with him going forward.\u201d In addition to changing the nature and date of the contest, the new law requires each county to have 10 days of early voting ahead of the presidential primary. It is part of a raft of election reform laws Sisolak signed Friday, including measures that expand the number of ways a resident can register to vote and distribute mail-in ballots to voters without requiring them to request one. The change from a caucus to primary has strong opposition from Republicans. A joint statement from the GOP leaders of Nevada, Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina said, \u201cAs the GOP leaders of the four carve out states, we want to make clear that we stand together in protecting the presidential nominating schedule as it has existed for many years. Our alliance is strong and we will continue to work together to preserve this historic process.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The leaders of the world\u2019s advanced economies gathered Friday on the Cornish coast for the first time since the global coronavirus pandemic began, welcoming President Joe Biden as a new member who arrived here intent on restoring traditional American alliances. With a pandemic raging in much of the world, a global economy still in shock and threats rising from Russia and China, the Group of 7 summit that formally began on Friday was shaping up to potentially be one of the most consequential in recent memory. The gathered nations will pledge to donate 1 billion Covid vaccine doses, with the US providing about half of those shots. Biden has ramped up those stakes, framing the moment as one just as momentous as the years during and after World War II, when the US, the United Kingdom and their allies worked together to help the world recover. An army mechanic from that war \u2013 Queen Elizabeth II \u2013 will join leaders Friday night for a reception. His day began with the landmark \u201cfamily photo,\u201d a symbolic moment for a President who has long sought a place in the club of world leaders. The group smiled for the picture with scenic Carbis Bay in the background. Biden was seen in friendly conversation with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada as he walked to the platform. As the leaders were returning inside after the photo was taken, Biden walked arm-in-arm with Macron, whom he had not yet met as president. Already, Biden has used his first trip abroad as President to announce a purchase of new vaccines for the developing world, likening it to American wartime efforts building tanks and airplanes. And he sat down for his first face-to-face meeting with Britain\u2019s Prime Minister in a photo op designed to replicate a historic World War II alliance. He\u2019s sought to convey a message of unity after four years of fractured alliances under then-President Donald Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that she is \u201cvery happy\u201d to have Biden at the summit, saying that the G7 Summit will send a \u201cstrong\u201d message in support of multilateralism. \u201cI am, of course, happy that the American President is present here. Being able to meet Joe Biden is obviously important because he stands for the commitment to multilateralism which we were missing in recent years,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cWe will find strong words here in support of multilateralism and also for values based multilateralism which will lead to a dispute with Russia and in some aspects also with China,\u201d she added. While European leaders like Merkel are sighing with relief at a more traditional US presidency, there remain differences between the leaders.   Skepticism also abounds over the durability of Biden\u2019s message promoting democracy over autocracy. Biden has sought to use his new commitment on vaccines as a sign that democracies can deliver results for the world. But developments back home \u2013 including revelations about the Justice Department\u2019s pursuit of Democrats\u2019 data and an impasse in Congress on Biden\u2019s agenda \u2013 have undercut his pitch. On Friday, Biden turns to the full G7 group, which comprises the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and the United States. Biden\u2019s wife, first lady Jill Biden, said Thursday that her husband had been training for the moment. \u201cHe\u2019s been studying for weeks working up for today,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knows most of the leaders that will be here. Joe loves foreign policy. This is his forte.\u201d Later he\u2019ll meet for closed-door sessions on the global pandemic recovery, the driving topic for leaders urgently working to pull their nations from the grips of the worst global health crisis in a generation. The global economy is up first on the agenda, with the global tax rate and aid for countries in need on the docket. These efforts, the White House said, will \u201cforge a more fair and inclusive global economy\u201d as the world leaders gather in Cornwall. Biden and the G7 leaders, the White House said, will \u201cdiscuss ways to forge a more fair, sustainable, and inclusive global economy that meets the unique challenges of our time. President Biden and G7 partners are committed to a global recovery that benefits the middle class and working families at home and around the world.\u201d The group is expected to announce an endorsement for the global minimum tax of at least 15%, a Biden-led overhaul of the global tax system, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and her finance minister counterparts announced an agreement on the matter earlier this month in London. On Thursday, Biden framed his announcement that the US was purchasing 500 million Pfizer vaccine doses as a commitment akin to America\u2019s participation in World War II, saying the United States\u2019 values required it to help inoculate the world. \u201cIn times of trouble, Americans reach out to lend a helping hand. That\u2019s who we are,\u201d Biden said, describing his vaccine announcement as \u201chistoric\u201d and citing the tragedies of the pandemic in the US along with the government\u2019s \u201cHerculean effort\u201d to recover. Biden is at the G7 meeting of world leaders. Here's what to know about it \u201cAmerica will be the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against Covid-19, just as America was the arsenal of democracy during World War II,\u201d he said, harkening later to tanks and planes built near the Pfizer plant in Michigan during the war. \u201cNow a new generation of American men and women \u2026 are committing today\u2019s latest technology to build a new arsenal.\u201d According to a White House fact sheet, the other nations in the G7 will agree to donate an additional 500 million doses, bringing the total doses pledged by the world\u2019s richest nations to be 1 billion. \u201cThis commitment forms the basis of a comprehensive set of G7+ actions towards ending this global pandemic in 2022,\u201d the fact sheet states. \u201cThe G7+ action plan that will be agreed to by leaders in Cornwall includes vaccinating the world\u2019s most vulnerable, providing emergency supplies, bolstering world-wide economic recovery, and positioning the international community to prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to future biological catastrophes.\u201d The United Kingdom is an old ally, including during the war, and Biden has sought to underscore those historic ties during his time here. He and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have sought to replicate the historic alliance between President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill by signing a new version of the Atlantic Charter, a document signed after the war in an attempt to shape the new world order. The new document did not mention Russia or China by name but did mention persistent issues emanating from those countries, including disinformation campaigns and election meddling. \u201cIt\u2019s been 80 years since the last one, it\u2019s about time that it gets refreshed,\u201d a senior administration official said ahead of the signing, which came during Biden\u2019s one-on-one talks with Johnson in Cornwall. \u201cThe original really outlined what the postwar world order could and should look like; this new charter will make clear what the coming decades of the 21st century can and should look like.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "At first glance, they seem like an odd couple \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive and quintessential outsider, and President Joe Biden, moderate politician and political insider. And yet, the 79-year-old Vermont senator has become a key voice in the Biden administration: called upon, consulted and indispensable in keeping the liberal Democratic flock in line. After 30 years in Congress and two presidential runs, it\u2019s a new experience. \u201cAs somebody who wrote a book called \u2018Outsider in the House,\u2019 yes, it is a strange experience to be having that kind of influence that we have now,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger as they sat together in Burlington, Vermont, recently. The Biden-Sanders connection is not a love story; it\u2019s more a marriage of convenience. But as  Biden pushes an unprecedented progressive White House agenda, it\u2019s crucial. It\u2019s also personal. Over the years \u2013 both as colleagues and as political opponents \u2013 the two men have developed a relationship based on mutual respect and trust. \u201cWe have had a good relationship,\u201d Sanders told Borger. \u201cHe wants to be a champion of working families, and I admire that and respect that.\u201d As a result, Sanders has entered Biden\u2019s political tent. \u201cI can tell you that Bernie Sanders has real influence\u201d in the White House, senior Biden adviser Cedric Richmond told Borger. \u201cSen. Sanders is respected.\u201d That respect is mutual. \u201cOne of the things that struck me about Joe Biden is the very strong sense of loyalty, which I like and respect,\u201d Sanders said. Bernie Sanders: What happens next in Congress will determine future of country There is, of course, a history of political disputes between the two. Biden and Sanders have decades of hard-held disagreements, on issues ranging from health care and free college to how to deal with the situation in the Middle East. And that\u2019s just a short list. \u201cHe\u2019s more conservative than I am, obviously,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cBut on the other hand, he\u2019s not only a smart guy, he is a good politician who has a sense of where people are at and what is possible. And I think he understands that at this particular moment in American history where working families face so many problems, you\u2019ve got to go big, not small.\u201d Five months into his presidency, Biden has gone big. First up was the $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan \u2013 passed without any GOP support. He followed that up with a $6 trillion budget, a far-reaching plan to protect voting rights, and a massive proposed infrastructure plan, all of which still hang in the balance. And now, as Biden wrangles with Republicans over the price tag of an infrastructure bill, Sanders, now the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, is waiting \u2013 and ready \u2013 to use the budget reconciliation process to push spending through with 50 Democratic votes, if he can get them. \u201cI have very limited patience,\u201d he says. \u201cWe learned a lesson from the Obama years. And that is, Republicans will talk and talk, \u2018We want to work with you. Bipartisan.\u2019 Month after month after month, nothing happens.\u201d Sanders has already gone to bat for Biden. First up was the American Rescue Plan, which included direct payments to millions of Americans. When some House progressives considered withholding their votes after a minimum wage increase was taken out, Sanders convinced them to stay on board. What\u2019s more, he publicly touted the bill \u2013 much to the relief of the White House \u2013 calling it \u201cthe most significant legislation for working people in decades\u201d in a CNN interview after it was passed. He told Borger, \u201cWas it everything we wanted? No. Was it a major step forward for the working class of this country? You bet it was.\u201d Biden\u2019s shift from centrist to big spender has left progressives pleasantly surprised. Sanders told Borger, \u201cI think the Biden of today is not what I or others would have expected\u201d based on the Biden of 20 years ago. The shift may have been gradual during the Democratic primaries, but after the election \u2013 and certainly after the January 6 insurrection \u2013 Biden evolved. Two things, says Sanders, changed Biden\u2019s MO: the coronavirus pandemic and former President Donald Trump. \u201cCovid exacerbated all of the existing problems, in terms of the struggles of working families,\u201d he said. And after Trump\u2019s term in office \u2013 and the insurrection in particular \u2013 the stakes grew. Political decisions are not just about dollars, both men agree, but about saving democracy itself. \u201cWhat Biden sees out there is that if we do not move aggressively, and make it clear to people that government can work for them, then we stand a real chance of losing democracy in this country.\u201d Sanders\u2019 impatience also revolves around a political fact \u2013 that, for now, Democrats control the House, Senate and Presidency. The close margins in Congress means there are no votes to spare, so Sanders is looking for common ground, even with moderates, who would be needed to pass any large spending bill under budget reconciliation, a process that requires 50 votes. \u201cYou can vote no on every single bill and say, \u2018Look, this is not perfect\u2019 or \u2018I disagree. No, no, no,\u2019 \u201d the budget committee chairman said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not my job.\u201d But when asked how he deals with moderates like Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, Sanders told Borger, \u201cIn all honesty, Chuck Schumer does more of that talking than I do.\u201d As campaign rivals in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden and Sanders kept things mostly civil. Sanders told his team that he didn\u2019t want to launch any personal attacks against his opponent. And when a Sanders surrogate wrote an op-ed that said Biden had a \u201ccorruption problem,\u201d Sanders both privately and publicly rebuked it. When Sanders was getting ready to drop out of the race, on a plane back to Burlington after canceling a campaign rally due to Covid, he asked adviser Faiz Shakir to reach out to Biden\u2019s team. \u201cHe said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you reach out to them and see if they see a role for progressives in their campaign?\u2019 \u201d Shakir said. The Biden team was immediately receptive. Sanders says they made him feel \u201cvery welcome.\u201d (Notably, that\u2019s unlike Hillary Clinton\u2019s team in 2016, when he says he was  simply \u201ctolerated\u201d after dropping out.) This time, with Biden, Sanders suggested that they unite on a series of policy task forces and proposals. \u201cHe wanted to make sure that Bernie and his supporters had a real voice in where we go,\u201d Richmond, who served as Biden\u2019s campaign co-chair, told Borger. The Biden team, Richmond says, understood the power of Sanders\u2019 supporters. But it was about just more than votes, he adds: \u201cI think that there\u2019s some just places where they really align.\u201d Richmond points to climate change, lowering drug prices and raising the minimum wage as areas of common ground. \u201cSometimes you just have to remind people that their philosophies are not that far apart,\u201d he said. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Sanders and Biden have known each other for years and that they both come from working class families that struggled. Not surprisingly, they also share an admiration for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose portrait now hangs in the Oval Office. Sanders approves of Biden\u2019s art selection wholeheartedly. \u201cI think that was a very, very good sign,\u201d he said. Sanders points to one defining moment in this relationship. When Biden decided not to run for president in the 2016 race, and the Democratic Party establishment lined up behind Clinton, Biden invited Sanders, Clinton\u2019s rival, to meet with him at the vice president\u2019s residence. \u201cHe was giving me his advice, political advice,\u201d Sanders says of those meetings. \u201cThey were, I think for me, very useful conversations and friendly conversations.\u201d Sanders adviser Shakir puts it more bluntly. \u201cI certainly believe that Sen. Sanders left that meeting feeling that Joe Biden was giving him a, \u2018Hey, go make your case, Bernie, because there\u2019s a lot of people who need to hear it,\u2019 \u201d he said. At a time when Clinton was the prohibitive favorite \u2013 and few in the Democratic Party expressed support for Sanders \u2013 Biden made it clear he wanted the senator to be heard. This is not to say they will always agree \u2013 they won\u2019t. Sanders makes it clear he will continue to push back when he feels it\u2019s necessary. \u201cHe does things sometimes that I think are really not a good idea, but I understand why he does it,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s made promises to people, and he wants to keep his promises.\u201d",

Eric Adams Age: 60 Job: Brooklyn borough president A retired former captain in the New York Police Department, Adams is a vocal advocate of the NYPD and is running on a platform that includes stepped-up policing. The former officer has been critical of the department, however, calling out racism in the NYPD. Adams has been a fixture on the New York political scene for decades \u2013 making many friends and enemies along the way \u2013 and has argued that he is the candidate best-equipped to fight a surge in violent crime. The former New York state senator is running to be the second Black mayor in New York City history. He has support from a number of major unions and local leaders, including Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. Art Chang Age: 58 Job: Former managing director at JPMorgan Chase and entrepreneur The technologist and entrepreneur started 12 small businesses in New York City and co-created an initiative called \u201cNYC Votes\u201d to promote citywide democracy.

Shaun Donovan Age: 55 Job: Senior strategist and adviser overseeing Harvard University\u2019s campus expansion A former Obama administration Cabinet member, Donovan served as  secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the housing market crisis of 2008, and later as director of the Office of Management and Budget. He\u2019s running on a platform to build \u201c15-minute neighborhoods,\u201d a plan that seeks to provide New Yorkers with schools, transportation and food within 15 minutes of their homes. Prior to his time in the Obama administration, Donovan was commissioner of New York City\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development under former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Donovan has been criticized by his rivals over an independent expenditure group almost entirely funded by his father. Aaron Foldenauer Age: 45 Job: Lawyer An attorney who has practiced employment litigation and election law, Foldenauer\u2019s platform seeks to rebuild New York City\u2019s economy with a focus on small business and property owners.

Foldenauer ran for New York City Council in Lower Manhattan but lost in 2017. Kathryn Garcia Age: 51 Job: Former New York City sanitation commissioner As commissioner of New York City\u2019s Sanitation Department, Garcia oversaw a staff of 10,000 and managed the city\u2019s trash collection, water distribution and snow removal. Running on a platform that centers on New York City\u2019s health and safety, Garcia says she would bring her crisis management skills and experience with local systems to City Hall. Garcia led New York City\u2019s emergency food program at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and served as incident commander during Hurricane Sandy. She was endorsed in May by the New York Times editorial board, which wrote that she \u201cbest understands how to get New York back on its feet and has the temperament and the experience to do so.\u201d Garcia, if elected, would be the city\u2019s first female mayor. Raymond McGuire Age: 64 Job: Businessman The former investment banker and Citigroup executive\u2019s campaign centers on fueling an economic rebound and his platform includes a job accelerator to bring back 50,000 jobs in New York City.

Before that, Stringer served as a New York state assemblyman and Manhattan borough president. His platform includes early childhood education and the creation of a \u201cchief health officer\u201d to focus on public health. A graduate of New York City Public Schools and the CUNY system, Stringer got his start in politics as an aide to Jerry Nadler, who was a New York State assembly member at the time. In April, Stringer was accused of sexual harassment by a former political ally. He has denied the allegations, which led some prominent endorsers to withdraw their support. He has retained the backing of a number of high-profile labor unions.

He wants to give some low-income New York city residents a basic income, providing those who need it most with direct cash payments of about $2,000 each year. The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Yang worked as a lawyer before launching a number of startups focused on health care and education. He is viewed as one of the front-runners in the Democratic primary, despite facing criticism for not having previously voted in a mayoral election and questions over whether he has the experience to take on the job.

As a city activist, Mateo served as president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers and advocates for bodega owners, most recently as founder of the United Bodegas of America.

            "article_content": "With just four legislative days left before the Senate\u2019s week-long Memorial Day recess, it\u2019s still unknown when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer bring the legislation to create a commission to investigate the January 6 Capitol Hill riot to the floor for a procedural vote that will test whether if it can get the 60 votes needed to advance and pass. Right now, the measure is expected to fail, as a CNN count shows there are not 10 Republican senators who would vote to override a GOP filibuster. Republicans are concerned the commission proposal has become partisan, is duplicative of law enforcement and congressional investigations, and would slow down implementing needed security reforms at the Capitol, which is now without the National Guard contingent that was brought in when the riot happened almost five months ago. The key vote may happen this week, but could slide past the weeklong Memorial Day recess. Biden faces crunch moment in his presidency That\u2019s because Republicans are indicating they expect a China competition bill that\u2019s on the floor now \u2013 the Endless Frontiers Act \u2013 may not get completed before the end of the week. The measure, which is meant to counter China\u2019s increasing superiority in manufacturing and global supply chains, boosts technology funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and funds upgrades to the US supply chain. It also confronts China on intellectual property theft and revamps the National Science Foundation to better position it to help spur US manufacturing. The bipartisan bill is considered a bellwether for any future interparty deals, although with almost all the other top items on President Joe Biden\u2019s legislative agenda imperiled, it\u2019s not evident now that the bipartisan spirit will carry over. Here\u2019s where the issues stand: We\u2019re one week away from the White House\u2019s soft Memorial Day deadline for significant progress on infrastructure. CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly and Lauren Fox report the talks are on the brink of falling apart, with major disagreements on the size and scope of the bill and how to pay for it. The White House lowered its price tag by $500 billion to $1.7 trillion last week, and it\u2019s unclear if Republicans will present an additional counter-offer, with the GOP group meeting Monday to discuss next steps. Biden adviser: President will 'change course' in infrastructure talks if inaction seems inevitable In a sign that the White House is gearing up to go it alone via reconciliation, a shift in messaging from senior adviser Cedric Richmond, who told Dana Bash on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Sunday that Biden \u201cwants a deal\u201d and \u201cwants it soon,\u201d but, \u201che will not let inaction be the answer. And when he gets to the point where it looks like that is inevitable, you\u2019ll see him change course.\u201d A decision could come from the parliamentarian this week, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the influential Senate Budget Committee, is waiting in the wings, and is prepared to work on a budget resolution \u2013 the first step in the reconciliation process \u2013 as soon as the White House unveils its budget. The expectation, according to aides, is that process will begin in June although that deadline could slip again if rank-and-file members want more time for bipartisan talks. Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware unveiled a $340 billion surface transportation bill over the weekend that could serve as a potential building block for a bipartisan infrastructure bill. On voting rights, as CNN reported Friday, Senate Democrats will meet privately Wednesday and will continue deliberations on how to advance S1. It is a top legislative priority for Chuck Schumer, but currently doomed to fail in the Senate because it is opposed by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, along with every Republican. Some Democrats want the bill dramatically changed to bring on board Manchin and enough Republicans to pass it. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming dodged a question about linking Donald Trump\u2019s election lies and GOP voting rights laws, telling Axios on HBO in an interview that aired Sunday night, voter fraud, \u201ccertainly exists. I will never understand the resistance for example to voter ID, I think you ought to have to show ID to go vote.\u201d But, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between that and a president of the United States who loses an election after he tried to steal the election and refuses to concede, and then continues to say the election was stolen.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston and Jessica Dean report lawmakers are still hopeful they\u2019ll make a deal on police reform, but they will not meet their own self-imposed Tuesday deadline of the anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s death. Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey told CNN\u2019s Bash that the core negotiating group has made \u201cmeaningful progress,\u201d but that Democrats and Republicans are still far apart on how to deal with qualified immunity, which shields police officers from civil lawsuits. Republicans oppose getting rid of qualified immunity. \u201cWe need to, at some point, get qualified immunity. That\u2019s what I\u2019m determined to at this negotiating table to get,\u201d Booker said on SOTU. \u201cThis is one of the big issues that we\u2019re working very hard to see if we could bridge this wide gulf.\u201d Booker, Tim Scott and Karen Bass are all still talking, and Bass is sticking around DC this week, even as the House is out, to keep the talks going. A series of mass shootings over the weekend left at least 11 people dead and another 69 injured. There were at least 12 mass shootings between Friday night and Sunday, according to CNN reporting and an analysis of data from the Gun Violence Archive, local media and police reports. And, so far this year, more than 7,500 people have died from gun violence across the US, according to that archive. But legislation on background checks is stalled in the Senate. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said late last week time is running out, and he wants to move forward by voting on House-passed bill that Republicans are sure to block. The vote, while symbolic, could put pressure on Republicans to demonstrate to their constituents they are responding to the stunning spate of mass shootings in the country. This is a bipartisan measure that could actually pass. The measure was introduced by a bipartisan group of senators last week and aims to change the bleak financial straits of the US Postal Service by eliminating the very unpopular and burdensome mandate to pre-fund the retirement savings accounts for every employee for decades ahead of time. It also lowers the requirements on first-class mail delivery, and for now at least makes room for former President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to stay on as Postmaster.

            "article_content": "As the Republican Party finds new ways to pay homage to Donald Trump and attack democracy, Joe Biden is pushing ahead with the grunt work of building a substantive presidency that could change the shape of America. The contrast in approaches between the White House and the GOP encapsulates the risky bet that each has adopted at what is beginning to look like a tumultuous and potentially decisive turning point in the political history of the early 21st century. In the country\u2019s relentless march through the next biennial election cycle, each side is making choices now that will provide the foundation of their strategies in 2022 and 2024 elections in which Trumpism and Bidenism will again be on the ballot in some form. The President traveled to Louisiana on Thursday to promote a package that expands the definition of infrastructure from transportation projects to broadband Internet right through the provision of home health care for sick or elderly Americans.   But he chose a traditional backdrop, an aging bridge, to argue for tax raises on corporations and the wealthiest Americans to fund vital projects \u2013 a centerpiece of his plan. He also offered some flexibility on the scale of a hike to corporate rates \u2013 as he tries to get GOP senators on board \u2013 hinting he may settle for a 25% ceiling instead of his initial bid for 28%. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to have another period where America has another infrastructure month, and doesn\u2019t change a damn thing,\u201d Biden said at a highway bridge that carries I-10 in Lake Charles. \u201cThe truth is, across the country, we have failed \u2013 we have failed to properly invest in infrastructure for half a century.\u201d Biden also spent the week working on the core task of his presidency \u2013 ending the pandemic and repairing the economy. He announced a new target to convince wary Americans to get vaccinated. He made a decision to back waiving patents on Covid-19 vaccines, which reverberated around the world and could help save millions of lives in poorer nations. Biden also highlighted a restaurant rescue plan that is typical of his approach \u2013 in that it uses a gusher of government money to safeguard a vital economic sector. The plan is an apt symbol of a presidency rooted in fixing problems that makes a bet that after a murderous pandemic, Americans have arrived at one of the periodic moments in history when they are willing to endorse the sweeping use of government power to ease social and economic deprivation. The strategy requires Biden to open a narrow path through tiny Democratic majorities in the House and Senate \u2013 which isn\u2019t guaranteed. And if he has misjudged the public mood, he could risk a public backlash that could benefit Republicans next year. Ironically, one of the Republicans who has made one of the most targeted attacks on Biden\u2019s big government approach is Rep. Liz Cheney. But the Wyoming lawmaker, who\u2019s the No. 3 House Republican, may no longer have a leadership platform to make those arguments. She is set to be toppled as conference chair simply because she tells the truth, repeatedly, about the ex-President\u2019s lies about election fraud, points out that he whipped up an insurrection designed to overthrow Biden\u2019s victory and punctures his personality cult. The fact that her likely replacement, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who has become a fiercely pro-Trump lawmaker and promotes his falsehoods, is far less conservative than Cheney, offers an eloquent picture of the modern GOP\u2019s priorities. As Trump loyalty trumps ideology, conservatives hold their noses for Stefanik Seeking to ease concerns among fiscal conservatives about her record, Stefanik played her, literal, Trump card, underscoring the power of the former President\u2019s aura in her party. \u201cMy vision is to run with support from the (ex) President and his coalition of voters,\u201d Stefanik said on Steve Bannon\u2019s radio show Thursday. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the small band of Republican House members willing to stand with Cheney in opposing Trump, refuted Stefanik\u2019s claims that she was a unifying figure. \u201cI\u2019m gonna just go ahead and say this ain\u2019t unity. It\u2019s capitulation to crazy,\u201d Kinzinger tweeted. The total embrace of Trump by House Republicans represents a counter-wager on the scale of the President\u2019s belief that Americans want a multi-trillion dollar overhaul of society designed to make the economy more equitable for working class Americans. Given the popularity of Trump among GOP base voters and their willingness to buy into the false reality he created over last year\u2019s election, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s strategy could work, as he seeks to wrest control of the House next year in midterm elections that may be decided by whichever party manages to excite their core voters. Yet Trump\u2019s appeal is limited \u2013 he never reached a 50% approval rating as president in the Gallup poll. He alienated crucial suburban voters and led House Republicans to defeat in the 2018 midterm elections and lost the White House in 2020 and two subsequent Senate runoffs. It\u2019s far from clear that devotion to the disgraced former President is a viable path for Republicans if Biden makes a success of his presidency and the economy is doing well as voters cast ballots in 2022 and 2024. On the Senate side of the Capitol, meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to signal a characteristic policy of obstruction when he said this week that 100% of his focus was on stopping the current administration. The Kentucky Republican\u2019s comments raised the question of whether a GOP counter-proposal to Biden on infrastructure and negotiations currently taking place with the White House is nothing more than political posturing. McConnell\u2019s attitude recalled a similar stance he took against former President Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. It may also reflect insight from Biden \u2013 a longtime sparring partner \u2013 about the gravity of the current political moment. While Republicans in the House are almost exclusively positioning for the midterms already, McConnell, with his chamber\u2019s institutional capacity to serve as a roadblock, is also concentrating on shorter-term efforts to thwart Biden\u2019s transformational aspirations. But McConnell may also have offered the President an opening to argue that Washington Republicans spurned his offer of compromise on key issues like infrastructure and his plans targeting American jobs and families. His remarks also immediately trained attention back on West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who is a bulwark against the power of progressives in the party and wants compromise with minority Republicans on big Biden agenda items. Manchin said on CNN\u2019s \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d on Wednesday night that he didn\u2019t know what McConnell\u2019s reasoning was but insisted \u201cthere are Republicans working with Democrats who want to make something happen.\u201d Outside Washington, Republican state lawmakers continued to build on the ex-President\u2019s lies about election fraud to make it more difficult for Americans to vote. In Arizona, state Senate Republicans pressed ahead with a sham partisan recount of general election votes in Maricopa County after Biden\u2019s win was repeatedly verified by courts and election officials. The Texas state House, meanwhile, debated a Republican bill that would limit extended early voting hours, give partisan poll watchers more authority and make it tougher to cast a vote in city areas where Democratic voters live. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law the Sunshine State\u2019s new restrictive voting measures. Had the goal been to bolster public confidence in the electoral system he might have held a public event. But exposing the partisanship behind the move, he signed it into law on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d in a stunt that excluded journalists other than those on one of Trump\u2019s favorite mouthpiece networks. The fact that DeSantis is so willing to use the electoral system \u2013 the core of US political freedoms \u2013 as a prop to advance his own political career shows why some pundits believe he has the brazenness needed to serve as an heir to Trump \u2013 a figure whose power still looms over Washington despite his departure for Florida more than three months ago.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Thursday suggested he was open to a corporate income tax rate between 25% and 28% to pay for his sweeping infrastructure and jobs proposal, the most concrete view he\u2019s given to date on his negotiating position. \u201cMaking sure the largest companies don\u2019t pay zero \u2026 and reducing the, the tax cut to between 25 and 28 (percent), it\u2019s a couple hundred billion dollars. We can pay for these things,\u201d Biden said, speaking in front of the Calcasieu River Bridge in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Biden noted the corporate rate, which is currently 21%, had been as high as 35% before former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans cut taxes in 2017. How to pay for Biden\u2019s roughly $2 trillion American Jobs Plan has been a hotly contested topic on Capitol Hill, and Biden has said repeatedly it is something he is open to negotiating. The corporate tax hike has been met by fierce opposition by Republican lawmakers, who also take issue with the size and scope of Biden\u2019s proposal. Raising corporate taxes was a core campaign promise of Biden\u2019s, and the administration says doing so would raise more than $2 trillion over the next 15 years. The President on Thursday traveled to Louisiana as part of his \u201cGetting America Back on Track\u201d tour to make the case that his sweeping economic proposals will benefit middle-class Americans and took aim at tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to build from the bottom up and the middle out. That\u2019s how we build America,\u201d Biden said. Biden stood in front of the Calcasieu River Bridge \u2013 a 70-year-old bridge that is 20 years older than its designated lifespan, according to the White House \u2013 to highlight the need to invest in the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. \u201cWe\u2019re standing here in the shadow of the I-10 Bridge, which I\u2019ve gone over several times myself in the past, and it\u2019s a perfect example how we\u2019ve neglected as a nation to invest in the future of our economy and the future of our people,\u201d Biden said. The President said reforming the tax code would allow for the kind of large-scale investments in infrastructure his American Jobs Plan calls for. He framed his proposal as a choice between giving tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans and investing in working class families. \u201cIn my view it\u2019s an easy choice,\u201d Biden said. The President touted the American Jobs plan as a \u201cblue-collar blueprint\u201d and a \u201conce-in-a-generation investment in America.\u201d Biden said his plan would put electricians to work building a modern energy grid, engineers and construction workers would rebuild roads and bridges, and plumbers and pipe fitters would replace all of the nation\u2019s lead pipes. The plan would modernize 20,000 miles of highways and roads and repair 10,000 bridges across the country, the President said. He stressed the economic value of the bridges while also highlighting the crucial role they play in transporting first responders when disasters strike. \u201cThis is about jobs and also saving lives,\u201d Biden said. The President said the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the need for the US to rebuild its foundation and invest in infrastructure in order to grow the economy, create jobs and be a global competitor. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to not do it,\u201d Biden said. The President said: \u201cWhen I think about the threats of hurricanes and global warming and the poor condition of our economy as a relates particularly infrastructure, I think one thing \u2014 I think of jobs, jobs, jobs,\u201d Biden said. The President highlighted the economic impact his proposals would have on the American middle class and note that 90% of the jobs his infrastructure plan would create wouldn\u2019t require a college degree. Biden was joined in Lake Charles by the city\u2019s Republican mayor, Nic Hunter, and the state\u2019s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards. The Republican mayor recently co-authored an op-ed with the Democratic mayor of Shreveport on the need to the pass the American Jobs Plan. The President noted investments in infrastructure have been bipartisan priorities for decades. \u201cWhen it comes to bridges and roads and the like, I\u2019ve never seen a Republican or Democrat road. I just see roads,\u201d Biden said. Later on Thursday, the President will tour the Carrollton Water Plant in New Orleans. During the 2020 election, Trump vowed to improve the Calcaiseu River Bridge during a speech in Hackberry, Louisiana, acknowledging the bridge\u2019s notorious problems. Trump promised \u201ca brand new I-10 bridge,\u201d if he won the presidential election. Biden on Wednesday defended his pitch to raise certain taxes to fund his economic proposals by saying his plan will not hurt most wealthy Americans and corporations but will instead help\u00a0the kind of people he grew up with. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to deprive any of these executives their second or third home, travel privately by jet. It\u2019s not going to affect their standing at all. Not a little tiny bit. But I can affect the standard of living of people I grew up with \u2013 if they have a job,\u201d Biden said on Wednesday at a White House event. He said restoring higher tax rates on the wealthiest Americans would grow the economy. \u201cBenefits everybody. Hurts nobody,\u201d Biden said. Biden\u2019s American Jobs Plan is a roughly $2 trillion proposal to improving the nation\u2019s infrastructure and shift the country to greener energy over the next eight years. The proposal would invest heavily in transportation, caregiving for aging and disabled Americans, manufacturing, housing, research and development, schools, and digital infrastructure, among other areas. Biden\u2019s $1.8 trillion American Families Plan focuses on helping families afford child care, making two years of community college free, enhancing Pell Grants, providing paid family and medical leave, universal preschool, recruiting more teachers and providing more nutrition assistance for children. The President\u2019s two proposals are aimed at helping the nation\u2019s economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d idea is that government is not the problem in America but the multi-trillion-dollar solution that can end the pandemic, equalize the economy and make life better for millions of working people. As he marks his first 100 days in office on Wednesday night with an address to a joint session of Congress, Biden will seize what may be a once-in-a-generation chance amid a deep crisis to change the trajectory of the country. How to watch President Biden's first address to Congress The President is no firebrand ideologue but he\u2019s aiming at more than conquering Covid-19 and the massive jobs crisis it sparked. He is bringing activism and ambition to bear to tackle inequality in an economy that is working poorly for millions of citizens. And according to a CNN poll released Wednesday, a majority of Americans approve of the way Biden is handling the job and say he has had the right priorities. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to punish anybody. But damn it, maybe it\u2019s because I come from a middle-class neighborhood, I\u2019m sick and tired of ordinary people being fleeced,\u201d he said at the White House last week. Biden\u2019s quiet radicalism is expressed through a huge pandemic rescue bill, a larger proposal that redefines the concept of infrastructure, and a massive health and child care blueprint. It\u2019s an agenda that argues government can still solve national problems, 40 years after an era-defining Republican president spelled out the opposite conclusion.   In his inaugural address in January 1981, Ronald Reagan declared \u201cgovernment is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.\u201d The 40th President\u2019s armory of income and capital gains tax cuts for the rich, a shrinking of the state and shredding of regulations was in itself a reaction to earlier societal shifts by Democratic presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Reagan\u2019s philosophy powered years of unfettered capitalism that helped widen economic inequalities, which two subsequent Democratic presidents struggled to redress. Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, says Biden is not consumed by ideology but sees an opening to expand his governing coalition in a way that ex-President Donald Trump refused to do. \u201cPresident Biden has tried to speak over the heads of the Washington elite, which is deeply partisan, and say, \u2018Look \u2013 I think I understand you better than Washington (does) and I think you\u2019re more interested in results than in being ideologically pure,\u2019 \u201d Naftali said. \u201cThe federal government has some advantages; it\u2019s got comparative advantages in dealing with crises. He is using them to reestablish a healthier relationship between the American people and their federal government.\u201d Biden is hardly going to extremes. But it\u2019s still Reaganomics in reverse: He\u2019s planning to pay for his plans with a modest rise in the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and with higher taxes on capital gains and the highest earners. Republicans, however, see a radical, and not in a good sense. They are seizing on the cost and size of the President\u2019s ambition, portraying him as an extreme liberal, hoping to seed a backlash that will tip them Congress in the midterm elections. If they can solidify the idea that Biden has overreached and campaigned as a moderate but governed as a radical they could prosper, since voters often use midterm elections to modify a course set in the previous White House race. \u201cIt is clear that Democrats intend to pursue a radical agenda full of left-wing priorities with the full support of President Biden,\u201d Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said in February. Last week, the Republican attorney general of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, used the \u201cr\u201d word again in threatening to sue Biden if he uses executive power to meet US global emissions commitments because he can\u2019t get the plan through Congress. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s promise that America wants to take radical, transformational and too rapid reductions in carbon and carbon emissions by the end of the decade is a colossal domestic and foreign policy blunder of epic proportions,\u201d Morrisey said. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, clarified the strategy on Tuesday when he admitted that Biden was relatable but predicted the President\u2019s approach would backfire. \u201cThis is a very, very liberal, expansive approach to government,\u201d Thune told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cI think at some point parts of that may be popular, but when they start paying for it, I think it\u2019s going to be unpopular real fast.\u201d Republicans have struggled since the presidential campaign to portray Biden, a classic Washington Democratic centrist for 50 years, as some kind of raging socialist who wants to bring down US society. As a White, elderly man, Biden is a difficult target for Trump-loving conservatives, who like to portray racially diverse Democrats as a threat to what they see as Anglo-Saxon cultural traditions. And the radicalization in America politics currently is not in the Oval Office but in a Republican base awash in conspiracy theories, which believes Trump\u2019s lies of election fraud and has all but given up on US democracy. The breadth of Biden\u2019s ambition has been disguised by the moderation of his character. He appears to feel no need to dominate the nation\u2019s psyche \u2013 a sharp departure from the antics of Trump, who built a presidency in the image of his volcanic temperament. While Biden\u2019s detailed plan to tilt the economy back in the direction of less well-off Americans has struck many in Washington as a surprise, it perhaps should not have: It was a constant theme in his campaign. He has scripted an entire political career with fables of his own blue-collar origins as an effort to lift up working- and middle-class Americans. But when the No. 3 House Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, and Democratic progressive champion Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York both agree Biden is more progressive than anticipated, something is clearly going on. The President ran to the right of Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in the Democratic primaries, but both have warmly praised the reach of his policies. At times, the President has shown boldness that plays into the idea that he is indeed quite radical. He spoke out in favor of conviction for Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd hours before the jury returned \u2013 earning criticism from judicial purists and conservatives but voicing the emotions of millions of Black Americans who helped him win the presidency. Biden also plans to end US involvement in the war in Afghanistan by September 11. Both Trump and President Barack Obama vowed to do the same but balked in the end. But Biden has also taken care to guard against being seen as more extreme than the centrist bloc of voters he courted last year. He effectively stalled on demands by liberals to expand the size of the Supreme Court by punting to a nonbinding presidential commission. And he has made no secret of his distaste for dismantling the 60-vote Senate filibuster, although it\u2019s hard to see how he can pass his most audacious plans without doing so. The size of Biden\u2019s bills, however, is startling. The Covid rescue plan cost $1.9 trillion. His infrastructure plan \u2013 which provides billions for items such as home health care, as well as creaking roads and bridges \u2013 comes in at about $2.2 trillion. And an American Family Plan, which he will highlight in his address on Wednesday evening, is valued at $1.8 trillion. For one issue, child care, Biden has already pledged billions of dollars in his infrastructure plan and the Covid relief package. He is expected to include new child care funding, universal pre-K, expanded tax credits, and paid family and medical leave in the family plan. He is seeking $400 billion for home care of elderly and infirm Americans, funding that would not normally be expected to be included in an infrastructure bill. The President has prepared the ground for such largesse by presenting himself as a fixer who is using government to return the country to a semblance of normal life. Now he\u2019s implicitly arguing that it is time to turn the same methodology to fix other problems, siding with FDR \u2013 who Reagan admired as a young man but ended up repudiating with his sharp turn to the right. This is where Biden is often compared to Roosevelt, who took office at a time of deep crisis and then went on to remodel the US economy and social safety net. Biden, however, doesn\u2019t have FDR\u2019s massive majorities in Congress. \u201cThe message is one of very brisk activism on the part of the President to address the crisis at hand, which of course is what Roosevelt did as well,\u201d said Ellen Fitzpatrick, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cI think the level of activism on Biden\u2019s part is very, very notable. His ambition is great. His success may be more doubtful. But I think this shift in tone is itself important.\u201d",

Carolyn Maloney in New York\u2019s 12th congressional district, marking the third straight election in which Maloney, who has been in Congress since 1993, will face intense opposition from party progressives. This time, though, the field will include a candidate with the support of Justice Democrats, the group that spearheaded the campaigns of incumbent-ousting leftist New York Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2018 and Jamaal Bowman in 2020. Abdelhamid is the second Justice Democrats-backed candidate of the 2022 midterm cycle, following last week\u2019s announcement that Nashville-based activist Odessa Kelly was running to unseat longtime Tennessee Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper. Maloney\u2019s diverse, heavily Democratic district has one of highest levels of income inequality in the state and country. Abdelhamid comes from a working class, immigrant Muslim family in Queens and, in a statement kicking off her candidacy, accused Maloney \u2013 the chair of the House Oversight Committee \u2013 of failing large parts of the sprawling district. \u201cAs the pandemic has exacerbated inequities in our communities, this district deserves a representative who fights for renters instead of developers, and small shops instead of big banks,\u201d Abdelhamid said. \u201cA leader who went to New York City public schools, isn\u2019t a millionaire, and answers to all of us \u2014 not just the corporate PACs who fund her reelection campaigns.\u201d Maloney announced plans to seek reelection last month, and Suraj Patel, who challenged her in the previous two primaries, recently indicated that he is preparing to run for a third consecutive cycle. Patel came within a few thousand votes of defeating Maloney last year in a contest that included another progressive candidate, Lauren Ashcraft. Maloney finished with 43% of the vote, down from nearly 60% two years earlier in a one-on-one race with Patel. Abdelhamid\u2019s announcement was met with scorn by New York Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs, who declared her campaign as a power grab by the Democratic Socialists of America. (Abdelhamid is a DSA member, but the group has not yet endorsed her. In addition to her advocacy work, she is also employed by Google.) \u201cMake no mistake about it. This challenge is not about progressive causes. This challenge is about one thing: power. Maloney has it and the DSA wants it,\u201d Jacobs wrote in a long, scathing statement. In a tweet, Abdelhamid swiped back at Jacobs, who is a close ally of embattled New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. \u201cIf my primary job was defending Andrew Cuomo, I\u2019d be looking for an excuse to talk about literally anything else too,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis unhinged statement is beneath anyone claiming to represent Democrats \u2013 it could have been written by Donald Trump.\u201d Democratic City Councilman Brad Lander, a leading candidate this year for city comptroller, was more welcoming: He endorsed Abdelhamid earlier in the day. The early clashes are another sign of what is expected to be a pitched fight ahead. Maloney\u2019s district has become more competitive in recent years. It was one of the few statewide that delivered a sizable chunk of support to Cynthia Nixon in her 2018 primary challenge to Cuomo, which appealed to Justice Democrats as they helped recruit Abdelhamid. But she was no stranger to the political or civic scene before jumping into the race. Abdelhamid\u2019s activism began more than a decade ago after she was attacked on the street by a man who tried to rip off her hijab. \u201cAs someone who has fought tirelessly for her community against racism and economic insecurity, we\u2019re proud to support Rana Abdelhamid\u2019s campaign for progressive change,\u201d Alexandra Rojas, Justice Democrats\u2019 executive director, said in a statement. \u201cVoters and activists all across the district have made clear that they want to help usher in a new generation of leadership into the Democratic Party free of corporate money and dedicated to uplifting all of our communities.\u201d Following her summer 2009 assault, Abdelhamid \u2013 already a black belt in karate \u2013 made a fateful decision. \u201cI thought that maybe I should go out into my neighborhood and teach self-defense to young girls,\u201d she said in a 2019 speech. \u201cAnd so I actually went out and knocked on doors, spoke to community leaders, to parents, to young women, and finally was able to secure a free community center basement and convince enough young women that they should come to my class.\u201d The small gatherings, which evolved to include more personal conversations, grew over a decade into an international organization called Malikah. In a video accompanying her announcement on Wednesday, Abdelhamid talks about her father, who lost his deli after a landlord\u2019s rent hikes made it unaffordable, and her mother, who was told by doctors, after contracting Covid, that \u201cshe\u2019d have a better chance (of) surviving if we could get her care at a private hospital.\u201d (Her mother has since recovered.) \u201cThrough a year of pain and loss, we\u2019ve shown up for each other,\u201d Abdelhamid says in the video. \u201cWe deserve a representative who shows up for us too.\u201d In 2020, Bowman defeated 16-term incumbent Rep. Eliot Engel in a Democratic primary with a similar message \u2013 that he had become disconnected from large parts of his constituency in New York. Maloney has a liberal voting record, was a cosponsor of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal resolution in Congress and is a member of the House \u201cMedicare for All\u201d caucus. Abdelhamid supports many of the same big ticket progressive agenda items, but criticized Maloney for taking campaign donations from real estate developers and big banks. In her reelection announcement last month, Maloney highlighted her own personal journey. \u201cWhen I first ran for office, they said I was too young,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThey told me I\u2019d never win because I was a woman. $10 billion dollars to NYC and 70 bills signed into law later, I say never take no for an answer.\u201d In a photo underneath the text, Maloney held up a card with the message: \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In the wake of a new election law passed through the Georgia legislature and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, Major League Baseball decided to pull this year\u2019s All-Star Game out of the state to \u201cdemonstrate our values as a sport.\u201d The move, one of a series of decisions by large corporations and institutions \u2013 Delta, Coke, etc. \u2013 to speak out against the law has triggered a massive political back-and-forth at the national level, with Democrats insisting Republicans are trying to change the rules after losing the 2020 election and GOPers arguing that the reaction to the law is yet another example of cancel culture run amok. Amid all of the spin and name-calling, I wanted to get at how the law was playing in Georgia \u2013 among both its political class and its voters. To do that I reached out Greg Bluestein, a political reporter at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Is the reaction to the MLB decision purely along partisan lines? Republicans hate, Democrats applaud? Any exceptions? Bluestein: The reaction is broadly along partisan lines, but there are important splits. On the Democratic side, there are growing worries that MLB\u2019s decision is the latest in what could be a domino effect of companies and events that pull out of Georgia \u2013 and a worry that Republicans could pin the blame on them for the economic damage. So there\u2019s an internal rift between some demanding boycotts and others, including many elected officials and party leaders like Stacey Abrams, who say it\u2019s too soon to take that sort of step. Among Republicans, there\u2019s a sort of rallying effect behind Gov. Brian Kemp and the GOP legislators who voted in unison to support the law. But there\u2019s an outlier: Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, the No. 2 state official and the nominal leader of the state Senate. Duncan, a former minor league pitcher, said he disagreed with Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s decision but respected the outcome. But he\u2019s also stepped up his criticism of former President Donald Trump for promoting lies about Georgia\u2019s election, saying the post-election misinformation campaign is divisive. Duncan\u2019s stance is no surprise. He was one of the first elected GOP leaders to loudly debunk the pro-Trump conspiracy theories, and he\u2019s questioned the need for an election overhaul. And earlier this year, he refused to preside over the vote on a previous, and more restrictive, proposal. But it does represent a rift among top Georgia Republicans over the fallout. Cillizza: What about the average Georgia voter? Are they following the law? Do they care? How do they feel? Bluestein: That\u2019s a great question, because there\u2019s been so much splattered all over social media on this it\u2019s hard for the average voter to keep track. (You can read the key details here.) And as some Republicans will admit, it\u2019s partly because they pushed a far more restrictive measure earlier this year, one that would severely limit who can vote by mail and restrict weekend voting. As Duncan put it, the GOP fell into a \u201ctrap\u201d on voting laws. I\u2019ve covered Georgia politics for roughly two decades now and all the perennial problems that crop up each vote: hours-long lines at polling sites, overwhelmed local election officials, dreadfully slow results in key counties. And when Georgians have to bring a lawn chair as an accessory to vote because the waits are so long, everyone can agree there\u2019s a problem. We\u2019re seeing huge interest in this bill and the aftermath, but the question of how voters feel about the law is a little harder to pin down. The last poll we conducted, in late January before the law was signed, found most Georgia voters endorsed requiring some form of ID to cast an absentee ballot and broad support for stronger election safeguards. But it also showed most voters didn\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s lies about widespread fraud and they didn\u2019t want new restrictions on ballot drop boxes and no-excuse absentee voting. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Cillizza: Brian Kemp has been front and center in the pushback to MLB. Is this what gives him his credibility back among base GOPers? Bluestein: That\u2019s one of the most important questions leading up to next year\u2019s election in Georgia. The governor has been in deep trouble with his base, and Trump has vowed to support a primary challenger. This is Kemp\u2019s chance to play the hero to the pro-Trump crowd, and so far he\u2019s trying to maximize the attention. He\u2019s done dozens of media interviews, mostly with conservative outlets, touting the law in the last week. And he\u2019s vowed to defend it, even if it means more economic threats, lawsuits and boycotts. This is comfortable territory for him, too, as the state\u2019s top election official for much of the last decade, and you can tell he\u2019s spoiling for this fight. But as we saw from a statement Monday night, Trump still isn\u2019t won over \u2013 and says the law doesn\u2019t go far enough. He wants more restrictive standards for absentee ballots that he says would have made him the winner in Georgia, even though there\u2019s no proof whatsoever of any widespread voting fraud of any kind. And there are still rumbles about credible pro-Trump primary challenges to Kemp right now, though it\u2019s getting harder to see that happening. Cillizza: Are these the opening shots in the 2022 governor\u2019s race? Bluestein: That\u2019s how I see it. Abrams hasn\u2019t announced a 2022 rematch against Kemp, but she\u2019s expected to launch her campaign in the next few months. And there\u2019s reason to believe next year\u2019s campaign will be even more bitter and divisive than the 2018 race. In that contest, Kemp and Abrams slugged it out over voting rights and access to the ballot box in the closing months of the campaign, ending with Abrams\u2019 famous decision not to concede defeat to a Republican she believed unfairly presided over his own victory. The shots between Kemp and Abrams over this bill are a prelude of what\u2019s to come next year: Abrams accuses the governor of willfully working to block Black Georgians, the poor and the elderly from voting. Kemp tries to pin the economic fallout on Abrams, saying that corporate critics and others have \u201ccaved to fear.\u201d Cillizza: Finish this sentence: In November 2022, Georgia Republicans will look back on this law and think ____________.\u201d Now, explain. Bluestein: \u201cThey\u2019ll think of it as both a uniter and a divider.\u201d In one sense, it\u2019s given Republicans still torn over a devastating double-whammy of defeats \u2013 Democrats flipped Georgia in a presidential vote for the first time since 1992, and then swept GOP Senate incumbents in January\u2019s runoffs \u2013 something to crow about. Republican lawmakers embraced the election law and Kemp\u2019s allies are exulting in the corporate backlash, privately calling it a \u201cgift\u201d for his campaign for a second term. If he avoids a serious primary challenger, this legislation will be a major reason why. But in Georgia, like other battleground states, general election campaigns are no longer about a race to the middle. In 2018, Kemp and Abrams set turnout records by appealing directly to their parties\u2019 bases. Democrats say these efforts to roll back voting rights will only help energize their supporters \u2013 and appeal to moderates and independents disgusted by Trump\u2019s still-looming shadow over the Georgia GOP.",

            "article_content": "Iowa Democrat Rita Hart decided this week to withdraw her challenge to her defeat in Iowa\u2019s 2nd Congressional District last year. Her six-vote loss to Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks capped off a successful year for Iowa Republicans who won the presidential race, Senate race and three of four House races in the state in 2020. Hart\u2019s loss is one of the strongest signs of a larger story: educational polarization in our politics dominating even in places it didn\u2019t previously exist, while income has become considerably less important in determining voting patterns. Iowa\u2019s 2nd District, in the state\u2019s southeastern quarter, simply doesn\u2019t fit the bill of a Democratic district anymore. According to the government\u2019s latest American Community Survey, 63% of the district\u2019s residents 25 years and older are Whites without a college degree. That puts the district in the top 66 of 435 (15%) of the nation for adults who match this description. Democrats represent a mere five seats of the 65 districts (8%) that have a higher proportion of Whites without a college degree in their ranks. All of those Democratic representatives were incumbents heading into the 2020 elections (i.e. no non-incumbents like Hart won in these districts). Going further, a mere two of the top 50 districts with Whites without a college degree have a Democratic representative and none of the top 10 do. It\u2019s important to note that it wasn\u2019t this way the last time Democrats won back the House from Republicans in 2006, when the seat was last held by Republicans. Democrat Dave Loebsack\u2019s win over moderate Republican Jim Leach that year capped off the Democrats\u2019 midterm victory. (Loebsack held the seat until earlier this year, when he was replaced by Miller-Meeks, after he declined to run for another term in 2020.) The district lines that decade were slightly more favorable to Democrats in terms of White non-college graduates (i.e. the district ranked 76th out of 435), but education mattered far less to how people voted. After the 2006 elections, Democrats controlled 44% of the districts with as many or more White non-college graduates as Iowa\u2019s 2nd District. They held 23 of the top 50 districts matching this description, or 21 more than they do now. Additionally, Democrats held five of the top 10 of these districts compared to zero today. One of those five in 2006 was Democrat Zack Space from Tuscarawas County, Ohio, in the state\u2019s 2nd District. He won by 24 points in an open seat and by 45 points in his home county. That district, in its form then, had more non-college Whites as a proportion of the adult population than all but one district nationally. To give you an idea of how much things have changed in the last 15 years, former President  Donald Trump won Tuscarawas by 40 points in 2020. The cultural shift that has allowed education to become a predominant factor in our voting patterns has also shifted the way we think about class in politics. Today, it\u2019s common to say that Republicans do well among \u201cWhite working class\u201d voters, which we mean to be a stand-in for them doing well among Whites without a college degree. Of course, working class can also mean those who are lower on the income ladder. The reason we don\u2019t focus on income is because it simply doesn\u2019t explain as much about our politics. Take a look at the Cooperative Election Study, which is a large academic survey of voters taken after each election, to better understand how little income matters to White voting patterns. Non-college White voters wanted no part of voting Democratic in 2020 House races, regardless of their income levels. White voters without a college degree favored Republicans by about a 26-point margin, if their family income was below the median. They voted Republican by a 31-point margin if their family income was above the median. Among all White respondents, the Democratic margin increased by 39 points when respondents had a college degree. The House margin among all White respondents shifted by 5 points toward the Democrats, when their family income was above the median compared to below. It\u2019s not that higher income makes White voters more Democratic, but rather that education is such a powerful pull and more educated voters tend to be wealthier. This is why we see wealthier White areas trending Democratic and poorer areas trending Republican in recent years. The latter tend to be filled with less educated voters, while the former tend to have more educated voters. In other words, income matters very little among White voters. Education means everything. But in 2006, it was very different. White voters without a college degree actually favored Democrats by a 3-point margin, if their family income was below the median. White voters favored Republicans by a 13-point margin, if their family income was above the median. In fact among all White respondents, the Democrats\u2019 margin increased by 14 points depending on whether their family income was below or above the median. It increased by just 5 points, depending on whether they had a college degree. That is, income seemed to have a greater effect on voting patterns than did education levels in 2006, which is very different from 2020. When you had districts that had below-average education levels and income levels, there was a decent shot they\u2019d vote Democratic, just like Iowa\u2019s 2nd and Ohio\u2019s 18th Districts did in 2006. This isn\u2019t the case today. Back in 2006, Democrats could rightly argue they had a lot of support by at least one definition of the White working class. Today, Republicans can rightly claim to have the support of the White working class based on either an economic- or education-based definition.",

            "article_content": "Senate elections typically happen only every two years \u2013 except sometimes they\u2019re three years in a row. Democrats picked up two seats in November 2020. They won two more in Georgia runoffs in January 2021. And in 2022, they\u2019ll be fighting to keep control of the evenly divided chamber, where Vice President Kamala Harris is the tie-breaking vote. But the fight for control is already center stage, since Congress \u2013 and the 50-50 Senate, in particular \u2013 helps shape how successful President Joe Biden will be in enacting his agenda. Democrats are eager to grow their majority so they can pass legislation with a more comfortable margin, while Republicans want the Senate back so they can check the Biden White House. History is on Republicans\u2019 side. The party that loses the presidency usually gains seats in the midterm elections. By the numbers, at least, Republicans are more on defense heading into 2022: Of the 34 Senate seats up next year, Republicans are defending 20 to Democrats\u2019 14. Not all of those are competitive, though: Only eight seats are currently rated as \u201cbattlegrounds\u201d by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. The seat most likely to flip partisan control next fall, according to CNN\u2019s inaugural ranking, is in Pennsylvania, currently held by GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, who\u2019s not running for reelection. The top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip are based on CNN\u2019s reporting, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. As the cycle heats up, polling, fundraising and advertising spending data will also become factors. In this first edition, the top 10 slots happen to be evenly divided between GOP-held and Democratic-held seats. Three open seats are on the list, all currently held by Republicans who are retiring, making their seats more competitive than they otherwise would have been. Regardless of historical precedent, the map of seats at play is important to consider. In 2018, for example, Democrats won the House by capitalizing on anti-President Donald Trump energy in the suburbs two years after he had been elected. But the Senate was a different story: Republicans gained seats because Democratic senators were up for reelection in rural red states where Trump had won. This cycle, only one senator is running for reelection in a state carried by the opposite party\u2019s 2020 presidential candidate: GOP Sen. Ron Johnson. His Wisconsin seat is the third most likely to flip, but the two-term senator is the most vulnerable Republican incumbent. Some states on this list will feel familiar. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Georgia was the epicenter of the political universe, helping to deliver the White House and the Senate to Democrats. Expect the Peach State to be a big player again in 2022, with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock running for a full six-year term and control of the Senate on the line once more. Among the other states that were hotly contested in the 2020 cycle and again are on this list are Arizona, North Carolina and Colorado. But long before the \u201cMagic Wall\u201d is coded in shades of red and blue, intra-party battles will dominate much of the news in 2021, with next year\u2019s nominating contests going a long way toward determining how competitive some of these general elections will ultimately be. Senate primaries \u2013 the fields nascent as they may be \u2013 are emerging as early indicators of where each party\u2019s base is headed. That\u2019s especially true for Republicans, who are very publicly grappling with what the GOP looks like with Trump out of the White House. The former President may have left Washington \u2013 and in unorthodox fashion, as the first President to ever be impeached twice \u2013 but the control he has over the Republican Party was on display at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando this past weekend. It was all about him \u2013 gold statue and all. And even if his winning percentage in the unscientific straw poll wasn\u2019t commanding (55%), the rhetoric his acolytes and other 2024 prospects used was a nod to \u201cTrumpism\u201d \u2013 a noun that the former President delighted in defining onstage in his first public remarks since leaving the White House. Listing every Republican who voted to impeach him in the House or convict him in the Senate, Trump is targeting them for removal by challengers more loyal to him. He recently endorsed a former aide who\u2019s running against one of those House Republicans, and as he considers launching a super PAC, he\u2019s signaling he may be investing in additional races with more than just endorsements. The extent to which Trump will get involved and will back candidates at odds with Senate GOP leadership remains to be seen. But he could be a potent factor in open-seat Senate races, like those in Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina, where GOP incumbents \u2013 two of whom voted to convict him \u2013 are not seeking reelection. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is the only Republican senator who voted to convict Trump who\u2019s running for reelection next year, but he\u2019d threatened her even before that vote. And the moderate Republican proved in 2010 that she can lose a primary (and GOP leadership\u2019s support) and still win the general election as a write-in candidate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged on Monday that national Republicans will stand by her. Also working in Murkowski\u2019s favor this cycle may be a new \u201ctop four\u201d system in the state, where all candidates run together in a nonpartisan primary and the four top finishers advance to the general election, where voters rank their preferences. For all those reasons, Alaska doesn\u2019t come close to cracking this list of seats most likely to flip, despite Trump\u2019s threats to Murkowski. A few other GOP-held states could eventually earn honorable mentions. For now, the only chance that Iowa becomes competitive is if the 87-year-old Sen. Chuck Grassley retires. He hasn\u2019t said what he\u2019s doing yet. But even Joni Ernst, the state\u2019s junior GOP senator, who was in a top-targeted seat last year, won reelection by more than 6 points. Similarly, Missouri looks to have become more solidly red since GOP Sen. Roy Blunt defeated Democrat Jason Kander by less than 3 points in 2016, which was a presidential year. One of his first Democratic challengers launched his campaign this year by mostly criticizing the other Missouri senator (Josh Hawley, who objected to the certification of Biden\u2019s electoral win) and trying to tie Blunt to him. The 10 seats below are ranked in order of most to least likely to flip. But it\u2019s still early in the cycle, with candidate fields in flux, so be sure to check CNN\u2019s next ranking to see how things have changed. Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring) Toomey\u2019s announcement that he won\u2019t seek reelection makes this state even more competitive than it otherwise would have been. Biden\u2019s win here was a shift from four years ago, when Trump narrowly carried the Keystone State in 2016. That same year, Toomey won reelection by less than 2 points, defeating a Democratic nominee who attracted big-time endorsements but wasn\u2019t the strongest campaigner. As with all open seats, the contours of this race will depend on who runs \u2013 and who wins each party\u2019s nomination. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who finished third in the 2016 Senate primary, is the biggest name. The tattooed former mayor of Braddock, a working-class town east of Pittsburgh, sells himself as a progressive who can appeal to voters who saw something in Trump. Although his campaign is already touting big fundraising, he won\u2019t have the field to himself. State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, a Biden surrogate during the 2020 campaign, has announced his bid and others \u2013 including members of the congressional delegation \u2013 could soon follow. Kenyatta was the first member of color who identifies as gay in the state Legislature. Without Toomey in the race, the Republican side is wide open and may attract a range of candidates on the spectrum of Trump loyalty, including prominent Trump critics like moderate former Reps. Charlie Dent and Ryan Costello. Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock It\u2019s time to talk about Georgia \u2013 again! Warnock won this seat earlier this year, defeating appointed Sen. Kelly Loeffler in a special election runoff to fill out the term of former Sen. Johnny Isakson. Warnock made history in January, becoming the first Black senator from the Peach State, and \u2013 along with Sen. Jon Ossoff, who won the state\u2019s other Senate runoff \u2013 he flipped the chamber after Biden became the first Democrat in 28 years to carry the state. In 2022, Warnock is running for a full six-year term. There may not be as many resources poured into Georgia as there were when it was a presidential battleground or when it held simultaneous Senate runoffs, but the underlying factors that made the state competitive in 2020 aren\u2019t going away. The Atlanta suburbs are still changing, attracting diverse and well-educated voters who lean Democratic. And all eyes are on Stacey Abrams to run for governor again, which would energize the Black voters Democrats need to turn out as part of their winning coalition. On the Republican side, former Sen. David Perdue now says he\u2019s not running, but Loeffler \u2013 who recently launched a PAC aimed at conservative voter registration \u2013 is considering it, as is former Rep. Doug Collins, whose candidacy pushed Loeffler to the right last year when he failed to make it to the runoff. They all are coming off of losses, but Republicans feel better about their bench here than in some other offensive opportunities. As 2020 showed, Georgia is an evolving state, but it may not be as friendly to Democrats when it\u2019s not a presidential year, and Republicans think they still have some sway with suburban voters if Trump isn\u2019t on the ticket. It\u2019s yet to be seen what role the former President could play in this race, but Republicans are hoping he\u2019ll lay off attacking the state\u2019s election system, which may have depressed GOP turnout in the runoffs. Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson Johnson hasn\u2019t said whether he\u2019s running for reelection, and it\u2019s not clear which decision would give Republicans better odds of retaining this seat. If he retires, this race could get more competitive for Democrats as an open-seat contest, although Republicans feel confident they have a strong bench here. And if Johnson stays, he\u2019s vulnerable, having ended 2020 with just over half a million dollars in the bank and barreling through 2021 with a penchant for saying conspiratorial things about the 2020 election and its aftermath (including questioning whether the attack on the US Capitol was an armed insurrection). The two-term senator seems to see some political benefit to catering to the former President, but that may not be the most viable path to reelection in a state that Biden reclaimed from Trump last fall. In 2016, Johnson dashed former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold\u2019s hopes of a comeback, beating him by about 3 points in a race that many observers had prematurely written off as a Democratic pickup. Whether Johnson stays or goes, Democrats have a decent chance to pick up the seat, although their field is still emerging. Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry is running, as is Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson, a former lieutenant governor nominee who lost a House bid in 2016. Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring) Trump\u2019s win here last fall, coupled with the reelection of Sen. Thom Tillis, proved that there\u2019s still a lot of red in this purple state. But with Burr not running for reelection, Democrats have a stronger chance of flipping his seat. Again, a lot depends on who the candidates are, but likely GOP candidates are already tripping over each other trying to criticize Burr\u2019s surprise vote to convict Trump in his impeachment trial. Former Rep. Mark Walker, who declined to run for reelection in 2020 after his House district was redrawn, announced last fall that he\u2019s running for the GOP nomination, but plenty of others could jump in, including former Gov. Pat McCrory, state GOP party Chair Michael Whatley, current members of the congressional delegation and even the former President\u2019s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. A Trump-style candidate could turn out his base but could also turn off voters in the growing suburban areas that have made this state competitive and allowed Democrats to win other statewide races. Democratic state Sen. Jeff Jackson is running, as is state Sen. Erica Smith, whom Republicans tried to prop up in the 2020 Senate primary because they believed she\u2019d be a weak general election candidate. The Democratic field is likely to grow much larger. Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly Kelly won in November, defeating Republican Martha McSally to fill the remainder of the late Sen. John McCain\u2019s term. And like Warnock in Georgia, Kelly now has to run for a six-year term in a state that Biden flipped blue. This race is lower on the list of seats most likely to flip than Georgia, though, because it\u2019s harder to see Republicans mounting an aggressive challenge to Kelly, who they admit ran a strong campaign and is an impressive fundraiser. McSally lost two successive Senate races, unable to perfect the delicate balance of appealing to Trump\u2019s base without alienating suburban women, and there isn\u2019t an obvious bench of viable candidates waiting in the wings. Arizona Republicans are deeply fractured, with those who have spoken out against Trump censured by the state party, which is now run by Trump loyalist and failed Senate candidate Kelli Ward. Those censured include GOP Gov. Doug Ducey, who has said he is not running for Senate. There\u2019s plenty of time for him to change his mind before the filing deadline, though, and if he does, this race could look more competitive for Republicans. Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto Cortez Masto was elected to her first term in 2016, beating Republican Joe Heck by about 2 points and becoming the first Latina senator. She went on to chair the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which should arm her with the contacts and fundraising ability to run a strong defensive campaign. Although Democrats have done well here in recent years, with Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen unseating Republican Dean Heller in 2018, the Silver State is still competitive territory that Democrats shouldn\u2019t take for granted. Biden won the state only by a little more than 2 points. Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan Hassan, a former two-term governor, won her seat by the narrowest margins in 2016, defeating Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte while Hillary Clinton also carried the state by less than a point. Fast-forward four years, and Biden carried the state by 7 points, while Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen won a third term by nearly 16 points. All that makes New Hampshire look like a state that\u2019s trending more blue. But either Ayotte or Gov. Chris Sununu could make this race competitive if they decide to run \u2013 and if and when that happens, this will move up the list of flippable seats. Sununu has said he\u2019ll \u201ctake a look\u201d at the race but wants to get through the legislative session first (which ends in June). His ambivalence could keep other Republicans out of the race until he decides, which could ultimately be a good thing for Hassan. But his potential candidacy is a threat Democrats are taking seriously. Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring) Trump\u2019s strength in Ohio (he carried the state by 8 points in 2016 and 2020) is a clear sign of its partisan lean. But with Portman announcing in January that he won\u2019t seek a third term, Democrats have a better shot at flipping the seat. (Portman last won reelection by more than 20 points, defeating former Gov. Ted Strickland, who was tarred as a DC liberal.) On the Democratic side, some of the bigger names to watch include Rep. Tim Ryan \u2013 who ran a short-lived 2020 presidential campaign and has long toyed with running statewide \u2013 and Amy Acton, the former state health director. But it\u2019s the GOP primary that\u2019s bringing the most drama so far, with the biggest names openly competing for a Trump endorsement while trying to tie one another to former GOP Gov. John Kasich, a noted Trump critic who endorsed Biden. Former state Treasurer Josh Mandel has adopted Trump\u2019s rhetoric about a stolen election and attacked Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, a member of the delegation who voted for impeachment. Mandel has twice tried to knock out the state\u2019s other senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, but he lost in 2012 and dropped out in 2018, although he ended up with nearly $4 million left over for this race. Meanwhile, former state party Chair Jane Timken, who\u2019s part of a wealthy steel manufacturing family, launched her campaign with a video filled with photos of Trump and her. \u201cI cleaned house of the Kasich establishment,\u201d she says. She\u2019s now piled on Gonzalez, calling this week for him to resign. She\u2019d be the first female senator from Ohio, and some Republicans like the idea of a Harvard-educated woman with Trump credibility campaigning in the suburbs. Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio As in Ohio, Trump\u2019s win here affirmed a lot of people\u2019s thinking that Florida is a tough state for Democrats, although Republicans\u2019 margins here are smaller. But unlike in the Buckeye State, the GOP incumbent is sticking around. Rubio last won reelection in 2016 (after dropping out of the presidential primary) by about 8 points, and since then, GOP Sen. Rick Scott \u2013 the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee this cycle \u2013 unseated Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Any initial threat to Rubio from the Trump flank seems to have been dispelled with Ivanka Trump, the former President\u2019s daughter, saying she won\u2019t challenge him, but other challengers could emerge. Democrats to watch include Reps. Val Demings and Stephanie Murphy, both of whom have compelling personal stories and could help turn out diverse voters. Murphy, the co-chair of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, launched a listening tour on issues last week \u2013 which is usually code for testing the waters of a campaign \u2013 but she\u2019s said she may also hold out for a 2024 Senate run. Incumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet After Biden\u2019s nearly 14-point victory here last fall and Democrat John Hickenlooper\u2019s defeat of GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, Colorado looks like a blue state. Gardner was one of the most vulnerable incumbents for all of the 2020 cycle, struggling to appeal to moderates and please the Trump base simultaneously. In an overt attempt to look bipartisan, one of his ads even flashed a picture of Bennet, who had endorsed his opponent. Now it\u2019s Bennet\u2019s turn to run for reelection. And despite those recent victories, Democrats aren\u2019t taking this race for granted in a state that still has plenty of conservative areas. Bennet is known as a cerebral legislator, but he earned national attention for a fiery Senate floor speech lambasting Texas\u2019 Sen. Ted Cruz that went viral in 2019. He briefly ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, but even though some of his more moderate votes distinguished him from other contenders he failed to stick out or gain traction. He was first appointed to this seat in 2009, then won a full term in 2010 by defeating Ken Buck, now a Republican congressman who has said he\u2019s not running for Senate this year. The Democrat didn\u2019t face much of a challenge in 2016, with observers writing off his race well before it was over. But in the end he won reelection only by about 6 points. And although Colorado has trended more blue in the last six years, Bennet\u2019s relatively close 2016 margin is a reason not to move this race off the list quite yet. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Pat Toomey\u2019s title in one instance. He is a senator from Pennsylvania.",

            "article_content": "Democrats\u2019 quest for a $15/hour minimum wage may be over before it even began. The Senate parliamentarian ruled this week that it cannot be passed, as currently constructed, by reconciliation as part of Democrats\u2019 Covid-19 relief belief. That means this increase in the minimum wage needs 60 votes, not a simple majority, to pass the Senate. With Democrats controlling just 50 seats in the Senate, this makes for an uphill battle for them. Still, polling and election results show Democrats should be hesitant to give up too quickly. A $15 minimum wage is quite popular and does well among voters who haven\u2019t been voting Democratic the last few cycles. Take a look at a recent Quinnipiac University poll. The poll released in early February found that 61% of registered voters supported raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Opposition stood at 37%. In the same poll, President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating clocked in at 50% among registered voters. In other words, support for a higher minimum wage was bigger than the baseline Democratic support. To be clear, the $15 minimum wage being a winning issue isn\u2019t just an artifact of one poll. Other polling, including a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, generally indicates the same thing. Further, the popularity of a $15 minimum wage is something we have seen replicated in at least one recent election: Florida\u2019s 2020 campaign. A $15 minimum wage by 2026 passed with 61% of the vote. Biden, of course, lost in Florida. He got 48% of the vote, and it was one of the rare states where Biden lost by more than Clinton did in 2016. When you dig further into both the polling and Florida returns, you see why the minimum wage does better than Biden: The issue seems to do much better than the Democratic baseline among groups who either aren\u2019t Democrats or have been shifting to the right in the past few elections. The increase in the minimum wage is something that is far more popular among Republicans and independents than Biden. His approval ratings with Republicans and independents stood at 11% and 44% in the Quinnipiac poll, while approval for a $15 minimum wage came in at 32% and 63% respectively. Among Democrats, Biden\u2019s approval rating (89%) is basically the same as support for a $15 minimum wage (88%). LIkewise, people of color and White people without a college degree are much more supportive of a $15 minimum wage (79% and 47%) than they are of Biden (60% and 33%). White working class voters were Donald Trump\u2019s base and people of color were less supportive of Biden than they were of Hillary Clinton. If Democrats are looking for something that appeals to the mythical White working class voter, the minimum wage may be it. Concentrating on the Florida returns, a look at the map reveals that the $15 minimum wage outperformed Biden all over the place. The wage hike got 71% of the vote in heavily Hispanic Miami-Dade. Biden picked up 53% of the vote, a relatively weak performance for a Democrat there. Similarly, the $15 minimum wage picked up 45% of the vote in the panhandle\u2019s Bay County, while Biden picked up a mere 28%. Bay is disproportionately White and has fewer college educated adults compared to the state and nation. Note that in these two dissimilar places in Florida (both in terms of demographics and geography), the minimum wage outperformed Biden by more than its overperformance statewide. Interestingly, approval of Biden at 59% and support for a minimum wage increase at 60% are nearly identical in the Quinnipiac poll among White adults with a college degree, who have been becoming more Democratic in the past couple of years. It seems at least somewhat possible that some senators don\u2019t recognize how popular a minimum wage increase is because it\u2019s not one that falls neatly along the traditional demographic and ideological lines. There may be a blind spot because most senators are White, well-educated and wealthy. This is a group of people who are less likely to be in favor of a minimum wage increase, once you control for partisanship. Prior polling from the Pew Research Center shows that Republicans whose family income is less than $40,000 a year are 22 points more likely to be in favor of a $15 minimum wage than adults whose family income is $75,000 or more per year. Now, we obviously don\u2019t know if embracing a $15 minimum wage will actually help Democrats nationally. It\u2019s tough to see how it hurts, though. If a $15 minimum wage can do so much better than Biden the national polling and in a state Democrats would love to win in the future like Florida, then it would make sense for them to be more forcibly behind it on a national level.",

            "article_content": "The deadly January 6 insurrection in the Capitol may have caused many voters to recoil at former President Donald Trump\u2019s election lies. But on Capitol Hill, it\u2019s a different story. In interviews with more than two dozen House and Senate Republicans this week, a wide variety of GOP lawmakers refused to debunk Trump\u2019s lie that the election was rigged or stolen, often qualifying their statements with claims that there are mass \u201cirregularities\u201d that need to be investigated and offering no pushback to the former President\u2019s rhetoric at all. While the lawmakers condemn the violence that occurred on Capitol Hill, a number argue that Trump had no role at all, despite the then-President\u2019s constant rhetoric of mass voter fraud, regular promotion of the January 6 rally and incessant claims that Congress and his vice president, Mike Pence, could reverse Biden\u2019s electoral victory. \u201cHere\u2019s how I know the President didn\u2019t play a role in that: because if the President would have told people to sack the Capitol or attack the Capitol, there wouldn\u2019t have been a couple thousand. It would have been a couple million,\u201d said Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican. Asked if he believed the election was stolen, Mast said: \u201cI think there\u2019s some real inaccuracies that we\u2019re not investigating.\u201d For all the talk about a party divided, Republicans on Capitol Hill are largely in Trump\u2019s corner, with a smaller contingent eager to move past the tumultuous era and willing to call out his election rhetoric and lies. After being acquitted by the Senate following his impeachment on a charge of inciting the insurrection, the former President plans to reemerge this weekend and deliver a speech before conservative activists, a venue where he could very well continue his assault on the integrity of the elections. With polls showing roughly three-quarters of GOP voters believing there was widespread fraud, many Republican lawmakers show little willingness to set the record straight with their voters, even as court after court rejected one Trump-backed lawsuit after another in a futile bid to throw out Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cI have a lot of concerns about election integrity that I think that some of their own state election laws and computations were broken,\u201d GOP Sen. Roger Marshall, a medical doctor and Kansas freshman, said when asked if he\u2019s willing to say the election was not stolen. \u201cThat\u2019s why we needed to look at it.\u201d That view is not universal among Republicans, particularly senior Senate Republicans who are ready to move past the tumultuous Trump era. House Freedom Caucus members question Liz Cheney's leadership again after her latest Trump comments \u201cI am not,\u201d Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of Senate GOP leadership, said when asked if he planned to go to Mar-a-Lago to visit Trump in Florida, as the top two House Republicans did in the aftermath of January 6. But many others view Trump as still the dominant force and plan to stay allied with him. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican up for reelection next year, says he plans to visit with Trump at some point, noting that \u201che\u2019s a constituent.\u201d He credits the former President with bringing together \u201ccommon sense wisdom and working class values\u201d into the GOP, saying it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d for Trump to not play a major role in the party. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that would be the case or why we would want that to be the case,\u201d Rubio said when asked if Trump should have no role in the party going forward, as Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney asserted this week. Rubio, who said he\u2019s seen no evidence to suggest that the election was stolen, also indicated he would have no qualms if Trump asserts to his supporters this weekend that the election was stolen. \u201cHe can say whatever he wants to say,\u201d Rubio said. In recent days, Trump has been in touch with his staunchest allies, including Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who spoke to the former President by phone last week. Johnson, who has been sharply critical of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s comments lambasting Trump for his role in the riot, has himself questioned whether Trump supporters were responsible for the violence \u2013 all the while downplaying that there was indeed an \u201carmed insurrection\u201d at the Capitol. \u201cI think there are some real issues that have not been answered, and I think these are legitimate concerns about the election,\u201d Johnson told CNN when asked if he believes the election was rigged. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the truth, OK?\u201d Johnson, who has yet to decide whether to run for reelection, faced a barrage of criticism this week for spotlighting during a high-profile hearing an article by a purported eyewitness suggesting that Trump supporters were not to blame for the violence on January 6. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who has become a leading critic of the Trump election lies, called out Johnson \u2013 and told CNN \u201cno\u201d that he would not support the Wisconsin Republican if he runs for a third term. \u201cYou can\u2019t peddle in conspiracies,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cMy basic bar for anybody now is just to tell the truth. We need to peddle less in fear \u2013 peddle more in truth and inspiration.\u201d Pennsylvania GOP meeting ends with no resolution on whether to censure Toomey Yet Kinzinger is in the clear minority of his party. \u201cI agree that the election was compromised in several of the southern states,\u201d said Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican. \u201cI look forward to get that down accurately.\u201d Asked if he believed Biden was legitimately elected, Higgins said: \u201cI believe that the election was compromised and investigations take time.\u201d \u201cI want the states to look into it \u2013 so I\u2019m not going to pre-judge,\u201d said Rep. Joe Wilson, a South Carolina Republican said when asked if he believes the election was stolen. Many Republicans won\u2019t adopt the Trump line to say the election was \u201cstolen.\u201d But at the same time, they suggest that something went terribly awry in November. Rep. Jim Jordan, who helped lead the charge on the House floor to overturn the election results in six states, said he\u2019s \u201cnever\u201d said on the floor that the election was \u201cstolen.\u201d But he quickly added: \u201cFifty million Republicans have real concerns \u2013 over one-third of the electorate. And several states, the key states, changed their election laws in an unconstitutional fashion.\u201d Yet efforts in the courts to challenge those state election rules were roundly dismissed \u2013 even rejected by Trump-appointed judges, including at the US Supreme Court. Adam Kinzinger says he's glad family letter was released so Americans could see the real divides over Trump Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm, voted to overturn Pennsylvania\u2019s election results even after the riot happened on January 6. Scott said \u201cno\u201d on Thursday when asked if he regretted that vote, arguing that the state \u201cdidn\u2019t follow the law\u201d in accepting ballots after Election Day, though courts upheld Pennsylvania\u2019s actions. Asked if he agreed with Trump that the election was rigged or stolen, Scott would only say: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what he says. I know that Joe Biden is the President.\u201d Republicans on Capitol Hill often say that they are simply reflecting concerns voiced by millions of Trump supporters about mail-in voting problems and concerns about potential fraud that need to be fully investigated. A recent Quinnipiac poll said that 76% of Republican voters believe there was widespread fraud \u2013 even though clear majorities of Americans believe the election was free and fair. Yet critics blame top Republicans for feeding that misperception by refusing to say the election was free and fair. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy joined efforts to overturn the electoral results after January 6, and signed onto a Texas lawsuit to invalidate millions of votes, as did his No. 2, Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican who refused to say over the weekend that the election was not stolen. A minority of House Republicans believes that their party\u2019s leadership should be clear that the election was legitimate and it wasn\u2019t stolen. \u201cI think we need to move forward,\u201d said Rep. Tom Reed, a New York Republican who co-chairs the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to try to compete and gain power by blaming stolen elections,\u201d Kinzinger said. Asked if he could back McCarthy for speaker if the GOP takes back the majority next year, Kinzinger suggested it depended on the message embraced by the House\u2019s top Republican. \u201cThat\u2019s two years from now,\u201d Kinzinger said. Indeed, Republicans have concerns that the party\u2019s split over Trump could endanger their prospects at retaking the majority in both houses come 2022, something exemplified last week when the former President lashed out at McConnell in strikingly personal terms after the Senate leader accused Trump of a \u201cdisgraceful dereliction of duty\u201d and for being responsible for the events of January 6. McConnell declined to comment this week when asked if he regretted his remarks about Trump. \u201cI do believe it would be a lot cooler if we tried to get along and if we stopped kicking our own ass,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican. Asked if he believes the election was stolen, Kennedy didn\u2019t want to engage. \u201cI\u2019ve said all I want to say on this issue. At some point you have to stop talking about yesterday,\u201d he told CNN. Yet Trump could very well bring attention back to the election results when he speaks Sunday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, even as several Republicans don\u2019t want him to suggest the election was stolen. Pence and Trump's relationship is 'amicable,' source says \u201cThat would be a big mistake,\u201d said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump confidant who said he\u2019s encouraged the former President to avoid saying the election was rigged and instead focus on comparing his policies with Biden\u2019s. \u201cThe election is over, and losses are tough,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican and part of McConnell\u2019s leadership team. \u201cI think the healing part of the nation is unity that the President could serve the nation better by accepting that fact.\u201d But some Republicans see it differently. \u201cI\u2019m OK with him saying that,\u201d Mast said when asked about the potential that Trump could tell the CPAC crowd that the election was stolen. Cheney, for one, said the decision is up to CPAC about whether he should speak there, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that he should be playing a role in the future of the party or the country.\u201d But Cheney\u2019s Wyoming senator, freshman GOP Sen. Cynthia Lummis disagrees. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with Liz Cheney on that at all,\u201d Lummis said. And indeed, Cheney is outnumbered when it comes to her views about Trump among Republicans in the Capitol \u2013 even more than a month after he\u2019s left office. \u201cShe\u2019s an outlier in the party,\u201d said Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican. CNN\u2019s Olanma Mang contributed to this report.",

But when it comes to the people who help get them elected \u2013 specifically the people who tell their stories in the still wildly influential form of TV advertising \u2013 diversification has taken much longer. Political consulting is still a male-dominated world, and that\u2019s particularly true for ad making. The number of female-owned TV ad firms, on both sides of the aisle, can practically be counted on one hand. That\u2019s beginning to change, though, with a notable shift even since the 2020 elections. Three longtime female Democratic strategists are launching their own firm this week, the details of which were shared first with CNN. Mindy Myers, the first female executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Tracey Lewis, most recently the Georgia state director for the Biden campaign and a senior adviser to the state party during the twin Senate runoffs, and Sarah Callahan Zusi, who\u2019s made ads for six presidential campaigns, including Biden\u2019s, are joining forces to create MZL media \u2013 a rare media venture that\u2019s led and owned by three Democratic women. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment for us,\u201d Myers said, \u201cto step up and be more out in front. \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of great women consultants out there who are doing great work,\u201d she added. \u201cWe just happen to believe there needs to be more of them.\u201d The women at MZL are not the only ones putting their names on the door of a new shop announced this week. Meredith Kelly, former communications director for Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is a co-founder and co-owner of Declaration Media, a new firm launched with veteran ad maker AJ Lenar and strategist Trey Nix. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a breakthrough since the 2020 elections,\u201d said Martha McKenna, a veteran Democratic strategist who started her own ad-making business 10 years ago, back when Mandy Grunwald and Ann Liston were essentially the only Democratic women in the game. \u201cAt the time, you know, it was a very male-dominated industry. Ten years later, it\u2019s a very male-dominated industry,\u201d McKenna said. But she\u2019s actively encouraging other Democratic women to step up, and those women are eager to blaze a path. \u201cWomen are driving the conversation in politics, and helping to change the direction of our country,\u201d Lewis said, noting that in 2020, Black female voters helped lead to wins in states like Georgia. \u201cI was the first African American woman to run a coordinated campaign in Massachusetts,\u201d she said, \u201cand taking a line from Vice President Harris, I may be the first but I won\u2019t be the last.\u201d Political ads are ubiquitous. They\u2019re often the primary way voters are meeting candidates \u2013 especially now, during a pandemic. But the process of making an ad \u2013 what goes on behind the camera and who\u2019s calling the shots \u2013 is a little more opaque. \u201cIt starts with research, and understanding the town you\u2019re in, the state you\u2019re in, the problem you\u2019re solving,\u201d said Callahan Zusi, who\u2019s been making political ads since 1992. She met Myers in 2006, working on Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse\u2019s campaign in Rhode Island, where she made an ad that to this day Myers recalls as one of her favorites \u2013 it spotlighted Whitehouse\u2019s community dinner series, showing him connecting with real people. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most provocative of ads, but it was so important to us \u2013 strategically important,\u201d Myers recalled, explaining how essential it is to tell candidates\u2019 unique stories. \u201cNow more than ever, cookie cutter, kind of generic campaigns don\u2019t work.\u201d The veteran of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has never lost a race. She\u2019s managed three Senate campaigns \u2013 for Whitehouse and Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2013 and served as a chief of staff and adviser for Warren. She stayed out of the 2020 presidential primary but later advised Kamala Harris during the vice presidential selection process. \u201cI used to advise on the candidate side and had people come in and pitch, and I would say (to candidates), \u2018Think about who you want on the other end of the phone.\u2019 \u201d Her pitch for her firm is about the range of experience that she and her partners bring. Lewis, who first met Myers in New Hampshire in 2008 on the Obama general election campaign, has spent years in the field, across 17 states, especially places like Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. All three partners see that on-the-ground experience, particularly in traditionally red states, as a crucial part of their ability to tell authentic stories. \u201cEspecially early on, being one of the few people of color on a campaign and in a leadership role,\u201d Lewis said, \u201cpeople would say how excited they were that they were supporting a campaign that hired and had people in leadership roles that looked like them.\u201d In 2018, Lewis helped her longtime friend Ayanna Pressley unseat a 10-term Democratic representative and become the first Black woman elected to represent Massachusetts in Congress. Lewis later worked for former Rep. Joe Kennedy\u2019s primary bid against Sen. Ed Markey in 2020 \u2013 an effort that Myers assisted with an independent expenditure campaign. Knocking out longtime, often White, incumbents has been seen as a way of shaking up an aging Democratic caucus and diversifying Congress. But for consultants, the work has sometimes been risky business. In the 2020 primary cycle, for example, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee promised to blacklist consultants who worked against incumbents. Will MZL take on challengers to Democratic incumbents as clients? \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t have any plans to right now, but certainly also have not ruled it out,\u201d Myers said. Female ad makers agree that they are well-positioned to tell female candidates\u2019 stories and communicate with female voters. It seems obvious. Yet women haven\u2019t always had a seat at the table. \u201cI\u2019ve been on a lot of shoots and in a lot of rooms where I am the only woman,\u201d Callahan Zusi said. The consequences of not including women in the decision-making process can be strategically costly, multiple female ad makers said. \u201cImagine this. You see a woman \u2026 a middle-class White woman standing at the window, holding a cup of tea, staring out the window at the rain,\u201d said McKenna, the longtime ad maker. \u201cThat is the stock footage that was used over and over and over and over again, whenever an ad \u2013 positive or negative \u2013 mentioned reproductive freedom for women. And it\u2019s like, that is absolutely not how women approach their reproductive health care.\u201d Being able to communicate with women is especially important for Democrats. \u201cYou cannot win a primary or general election as a Democrat if you aren\u2019t appealing to women in a major way,\u201d said Kelly, who helped Democrats flip the House in 2018 in large part by electing women. \u201cTo have a consultant team and a campaign team advising candidates without any women at the table is complete malpractice.\u201d Ad-making has been male-dominated on the Republican side, too, where there are fewer women-led media firms. But having women involved, female Republican ad makers said, is just as important. \u201cWomen bring a unique perspective to storytelling and I think we understand the importance of imagery and little moments that drive emotions and which leads to persuasion,\u201d said Liesl Hickey, a former executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee who is now a partner at Ascent Media. That extends to winning over female voters, too. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to women in advertising is very different than what resonates with men,\u201d said Ashley O\u2019Connor, a partner at Strategic Partners & Media, another GOP firm. The puzzle no one can answer is why media consulting has lagged other political jobs, like pollsters or campaign managers, in diversifying its ranks. To be sure, starting a business is expensive, and that\u2019s especially true for ad makers, who are compensated as a percentage of the ad buy that a campaign makes. That means ad makers may not be paid until months after a shoot, maybe not even until right before the election. Money, as in all aspects of politics, has a way of shaping access. With more diverse voices holding higher-level jobs, though, there\u2019s now a pathway. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt we need more women leading campaigns to victory, and I know Mindy and Tracey will do just that,\u201d Warren said in a statement to CNN. Both women worked on Warren\u2019s 2012 campaign before eventually landing at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Lewis later advised her presidential bid. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the pipeline,\u201d said Kelly, who went from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to the Gillibrand campaign. \u201cIt starts with who\u2019s working on and then running these campaigns, and then who gets these high-level strategic jobs at the committees.\u201d Over time, those roles have diversified, and, she added, \u201cthat has slowly but surely led to the consultant class diversifying as well.\u201d That\u2019s a shift that these women are hoping to hasten. \u201cI hope to change that, and we look back in \u2013 I don\u2019t know how long \u2013 and it\u2019s not such a rarity that it\u2019s a women-owned and -led firm,\u201d Callahan Zusi said. Does more competition worry the women whose firms came before? \u201cI look forward to losing a pitch to another woman,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sign. That\u2019s a good day.\u201d",

            "article_content": "To Democrats last year, he was the ultimate boogeyman: Louis DeJoy, the man they believed mounted a brazen campaign to slow down the mail and thwart Joe Biden\u2019s presidential hopes. But Biden is now President \u2013 and times have changed. Changes made to the Postal Service under DeJoy, the US postmaster general and major donor to former President Donald Trump, sparked outrage last year when critics blamed him for the slowdown of mail delivery ahead of the critical November election. Democrats linked DeJoy to Trump\u2019s anti-mail-in voting rhetoric and accused him of attempting to sabotage the Postal Service just as Biden was relying on mailed ballots to deliver him the White House. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy apologizes again for slow mail But now, Democrats are at odds over how to handle DeJoy \u2013 who can only be dismissed by the USPS Board of Governors \u2013 with Biden himself yet to weigh in on DeJoy\u2019s future even as it\u2019s dividing his party on Capitol Hill. Wednesday, DeJoy told the House Oversight Committee he\u2019s not planning to resign. Asked by Tennessee Democrat Rep. Jim Cooper how long he plans to stay, DeJoy said: \u201cA long time, get used to me.\u201d Cooper noted that the Board of Governors makes that decision, leading DeJoy to respond: \u201cWell it could be determined by me, I could resign, I could get tired of it, I have other things I can do.\u201d RELATED: Postmaster General Louis DeJoy apologizes again for slow mail DeJoy was in the hot seat in front of the Oversight Committee, a panel where Democrats grilled him last summer and demanded his immediate ouster amid the tense final weeks of the presidential campaign. But this time, Democrats are not speaking with one clear voice, with some pushing for a brand new slate of governors who could immediately fire DeJoy, while others are taking a more moderate approach, hoping they can instead work with the controversial USPS leader and cut a deal on a long-awaited bill to overhaul the postal service. In the latter camp is House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who is working behind the scenes with DeJoy on a potential reform bill that has eluded Congress for more than 14 years, according to multiple Democratic sources. Her goal: Secure backing from DeJoy and win over Republicans whose support they\u2019ll eventually need in the Senate to push the bill into law. But taking that tack has caused unease among Democrats who don\u2019t trust DeJoy and worry that keeping him in the slot will solidify his standing and give him a fresh chance to restore his reputation. \u201cI think he needs to be replaced,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginian who chairs a key House subcommittee with oversight of the post office. \u201cI think there is a growing sentiment that we need to just start with a clean slate.\u201d A number of Democratic representatives agree with Connolly. In a letter last month, Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey wrote a letter calling on Biden to fire the entire USPS Board of Governors in an effort to eventually replace DeJoy. \u201cThrough the devastating arson of the Trump regime, the USPS Board of Governors sat silent. Their dereliction cannot now be forgotten,\u201d Pascrell wrote. Last week, Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley wrote to Biden and slammed DeJoy for his \u201cfailed leadership,\u201d accusing him of sabotaging the agency through changes that slowed down mail delivery and the board of being complicit. In a statement to CNN, Maloney said she\u2019s been \u201cconsistent\u201d that DeJoy \u201calready would have been removed from his position\u201d if he were a CEO of a private company. And she said that her panel is investigating his actions, \u201cwhich clearly harmed mail delivery operations.\u201d But she emphasized the focus now is getting a postal overhaul bill finalized and signed into law. New Postal Service delivery vehicle unveiled. It's a pretty radical change \u201cThe Committee will not be delayed or deterred from passing significant reforms to help the long-term financial sustainability of the Postal Service \u2013 a goal the American people overwhelmingly support,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cOur members have expressed their own views, just as I have expressed mine, and now it is up to the President and the Senate to begin filling the vacant seats on the board.\u201d There are four vacancies on the board, and Democrats such as Maloney could be satisfied with Biden moving to just fill those slots alone. But taking that moderate course of action may not guarantee that DeJoy will be pushed out. A major focus at Wednesday\u2019s hearing will be DeJoy\u2019s long-term focus for the USPS, yet the postmaster general has yet to release his forthcoming 10-year-plan for the service. One source familiar with the plan told CNN that changing first class mail delivery is under consideration \u2013 a move that experts say could further slow down mail. In the middle is Biden, who has yet to publicly tip his hand on his feelings about the postmaster general. \u201cPresident Biden has made clear his feelings on the current leadership of the Postal Service and the challenges it faces, and his team is working as quickly as possible to fill board vacancies so the USPS can effectively fulfil its vital mission for the country, and live up to the commitments made to its workers,\u201d White House spokesperson Michael Gwin told CNN. Even in private, the administration hasn\u2019t said much else. In meetings with lawmakers, administration staffers have sought to assure Democrats calling to overhaul USPS leadership that filling board vacancies will be prioritized, but made no promises beyond that. This story has been updated with comment from DeJoy.",

            "article_content": "The news that Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan is moving toward a bid to replace retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R) is a major early recruiting win for Democrats as they seek to hold \u2013 and widen \u2013 their majority in the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing from Democrats across Ohio and the country who are excited at the possibility of picking up a Senate seat that we haven\u2019t held in decades,\u201d Ryan told CNN Monday night. \u201cI have been encouraged by their support, enthusiasm and commitment. The US Senate needs another working class voice and I\u2019m very serious about the opportunity to continue representing the people of Ohio.\u201d While many people roll their eyes when it comes to talking about the 2022 election just months after the conclusion of the 2020 presidential race, the political reality is that it\u2019s often in these early months of an election cycle where majorities are lost and won. You don\u2019t beat someone with no one, as the cliche goes. And the search to find the best \u201csomeone\u201d is often a years-long effort that can make or break a party\u2019s chances at competitiveness. That\u2019s certainly the case in Ohio and with Ryan. While the Buckeye State was considered a key swing state in the early 2000s, it has moved clearly toward Republicans in the past two decades. Former President Donald Trump won the state by 8 points and Democrats hold only one statewide office. (Sen. Sherrod Brown is the lone Democrat.) As Jessica Taylor wrote of the state (and its now-open) Senate seat for the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan campaign tip sheet, last month: \u201cAs other Sun Belt states like Georgia and Arizona are trending more Democratic, Ohio\u2019s demographics are moving in the opposite direction. And Democrats have better opportunities in the two other open GOP-held seats in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Still, even Republican strategists privately admit this decision from Portman isn\u2019t good news for them and that they will have to fight \u2014 likely through a large and messy primary \u2014 to hold onto the seat.\u201d Enter Ryan. While he is remembered nationally \u2013 to the extent he is remembered at all \u2013 for his quixotic bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 (he dropped out of the race in October 2019), Ryan has long been seen as Democrats\u2019 best hope to crack the increasing Republican dominance in the state. He has been mentioned as a Democratic candidate for, literally, every statewide office since at least 2006 \u2013 when he deferred to Brown in the open seat Senate race. Ryan has forever been the one that got away for Democrats, always opting to stay in the House (and accrue seniority on the influential Appropriations Committee) rather than take the risk of running statewide. (Sidebar: Following his speakership challenge to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after the 2016 election \u2013 he got 63 votes in a loss \u2013 Ryan was seen as a potential House leader. But the House Democratic caucus has lurched far to the ideological left, making a centrist like Ryan persona non grata.) That Ryan appears to have finally decided to get off the sidelines and run for Senate is, then, a very big deal. His profile \u2013 centrist politics married with extremely strong union support and a base in northeastern Ohio \u2013 would seem like the ideal one to give Democrats a real chance at putting Ohio in their column next November. Notice that I said \u201ca real chance\u201d not a \u201cguaranteed victory.\u201d Because even with Ryan as their nominee, Democrats are no better \u2013 and likely slightly worse \u2013 than an even money bet to win. (The Cook Report rates the open seat race as \u201cLean Republican,\u201d which feels right.) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! But remember that winning isn\u2019t always the only goal. There is only so much money that party committees and outside groups will spend on the battle for the Senate. And every dime spent to defend Ohio, which Portman would likely have won without much trouble had he run, is money that can\u2019t be spent by Republicans on winning back Democratic-held states like Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. And given the size of and number of media markets in Ohio, a competitive Senate race in the state doesn\u2019t come cheap. (Portman\u2019s last reelection race in 2016, which he won by 21 points, had a price tag well over $100 million.) What Ryan\u2019s candidacy would guarantee is that Republicans would have to spend millions of dollars simply to hold one of their own seats. (And yes, the possibility does exist that Ryan could actually win the race outright.) Facing the prospect of having to dump millions into open-seat races in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and maybe Wisconsin, Ryan\u2019s likely candidacy is a headache Republicans absolutely do not want.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Tim Ryan is laying the groundwork for a run at Ohio\u2019s open Senate seat, a source familiar with his plans tells CNN, with the congressman planning a potential announcement in late February or early March. Ryan\u2019s entrance into the race would represent a chance for Democrats to prove the party is still viable in a state that has drifted toward Republicans in almost every statewide race of the last decade. Ryan, a Democrat who has represented the Youngstown area since 2003 and mounted a long-shot 2020 presidential bid, is closely aligned with organized labor and often touts his blue-collar roots in the Mahoning Valley. In a statement to CNN on Monday night, Ryan said only that he was \u201cvery serious\u201d about the open Senate seat, which was created when Republican Sen. Rob Portman decided not to run for reelection in 2022. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing from Democrats across Ohio and the country who are excited at the possibility of picking up a Senate seat that we haven\u2019t held in decades,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI have been encouraged by their support, enthusiasm, and commitment. The U.S. Senate needs another working class voice and I\u2019m very serious about the opportunity to continue representing the people of Ohio.\u201d The New York Times was first to report that Ryan was planning a 2022 Senate run. The congressman has previously flirted with running for statewide office in Ohio. In 2017, for example, he was courted to run for governor in 2018 but decided against it. Ryan has received some high-profile encouragement to enter the race, including from Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. The Ohio State Conference of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers endorsed his potential Senate bid on Monday, offering him \u201cour best wishes for a successful campaign.\u201d If Ryan officially gets into the race, he is unlikely to clear the field, though. Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley is considering both a run at the open Senate seat and a gubernatorial bid in 2022. Democrats also are growing more confident that Dr. Amy Acton, who rose to prominence as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine\u2019s public health director during the coronavirus pandemic, could announce a Senate run. And other Democrats have looked at Emilia Sykes, the young, Black minority leader of the Ohio House of Representatives, as someone who could mount a historic campaign and motivate the party\u2019s base. \u201cOne thing that we have an opportunity to do is show that with diverse candidates, with women and people of color, there is a pathway to win,\u201d Sykes told CNN previously, adding that she is considering a bid. \u201cWhat we are learning is that when you put women on the ballot, women win. When you put people of color on the ballot, we win.\u201d Key to any Democratic bid will be the Republican who wins the party\u2019s primary. Portman\u2019s decision to retire caused nearly a dozen Republicans to consider running for the seat, making it possible that the party\u2019s primary could become a crowded, contentious affair. Some of the possible Republican candidates include J.D. Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d; Josh Mandel, the former state treasurer who lost a 2012 race to Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown; Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose; and Jane Timken, the Ohio Republican Party chair. Last week, Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, decided not to run for the seat, opening the door to other House Republicans. At least four \u2013 Reps. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup, Mike Turner and Warren Davidson \u2013 are considering bids. In the past three election cycles, Republicans won statewide races in Ohio for president, governor and Senate. Trump beat Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden there by 8 points in November. But Brown\u2019s 2018 reelection victory gave the Democratic Party hope that its populist wing could still resonate in Ohio. This story has been updated to include the endorsement of Ryan\u2019s potential bid by the Ohio State Conference of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A new federal criminal indictment against three alleged insurrectionists who plotted their trip to Washington, DC, reveals more about their preparations than was previously known, including their discussing or attending training camps. The Justice Department indicted Thomas Caldwell of Virginia and Jessica Watkins and Donovan Crowl of Ohio on Wednesday, alleging that the three are affiliated with the Oath Keepers, a right-wing extremist group, and that Watkins discussed a basic training camp in Ohio and Crowl attended training in North Carolina before January 6. The Oath Keepers generally believe the federal government has been corrupted and that former military and police can defend the Constitution as a self-styled militia, according to court records. Paramilitary groups have become a major focus of investigators as they work toward understanding why attendees of the Trump rally were armed and wore body armor, and how groups of extremists may have coordinated before the siege. And the mentions of training camps have dotted some of the early court records charging paramilitary-linked rioters with federal crimes. This is at least the second case related to the Capitol riots where defendants are alleged to have ties to military-style training. In the other case, against Robert Gieswein of Colorado, federal law enforcement say he wore to the Capitol a patch on his tactical vest representing a group called the Woodland Wild Dogs, a private paramilitary training organization that he allegedly runs. Geiswein also was indicted on Wednesday by the grand jury in DC on six counts, including using an irritant spray and a baseball bat against US Capitol Police. Paramilitary training had also been a feature of the case against right-wing extremists in Michigan who had plotted to kidnap the Democratic governor and took part in tactical training. At a news conference this week, the US attorney in Washington, DC \u2013 Michael Sherwin \u2013 described the Caldwell case as one that showed active planning among militia groups, and said law enforcement was working toward building sedition conspiracy cases. The indictment filed on Wednesday against the alleged Oath Keepers does not include a sedition count, though it accuses Caldwell, Crowl and Watkins of speaking to one another and others about ways they could hamper Congress\u2019 certification of the Electoral College vote confirming Joe Biden as the 46th president. The three allegedly communicated for almost two months before January 6 about how they would prepare, including by talking about training. In early November, nearly a week after the presidential election, Watkins texted people who were interested in her paramilitary group in Ohio about a week-long \u201cBasic Training class\u201d run by a drill sergeant near Columbus to become \u201cfighting fit\u201d for the inauguration, prosecutors revealed on Wednesday. Prosecutors also highlighted that Crowl attended a training camp in North Carolina in December. Watkins also responded to an invitation to a \u201cleadership\u201d conference call about a \u201cDC op\u201d on the encrypted messaging app Signal. Caldwell and Crowl also allegedly messaged about meeting up with a \u201cNorth Carolina crew,\u201d the indictment says. Prosecutors say that in addition to the Oath Keepers, Watkins and Crowl also are part of a group called the Ohio State Regular Militia, which has some members who pay dues to the Oath Keepers. The indictment approved by the grand jury in DC Wednesday formalizes four charges that prosecutors had previously leveled against the three, including conspiracy, obstructing an official proceeding, destroying government property and unlawfully entering the restricted grounds of the US Capitol. When they were first charged, the case was the first significant conspiracy allegations related to the Capitol attack. The Justice Department alleges that the three extremists planned and coordinated ahead of the January 6 assault, beginning in November of last year as they discussed lodging and meet-ups in Washington. The indictment filed on Wednesday added details about the Oath Keepers\u2019 use of the walkie-talkie-like app Zello to communicate and their intentions for January 6. Watkins, for instance, allegedly said on a channel called \u201cStop the Steal J6,\u201d \u201cWe have a good group. We have about 30-40 of us. We are sticking together and sticking to the plan,\u201d the Justice Department said. In other messages via text and Facebook leading up to January 6, Caldwell wrote about a need to \u201cget violent\u201d and a \u201ccall to action\u201d in Washington. They discussed buses of people coming from around the country, including North Carolina, and three unnamed people they were in communication with, according to the indictment. Prosecutors say Watkins and Crowl left Ohio to stay with Caldwell in Virginia after the siege, before their arrests. The three have not yet responded to the indictment formally in federal court in Washington.",

            "article_content": "The unexpected retirement of Republican Sen. Rob Portman has set off a frantic scramble in Ohio, leading numerous Republicans and a handful of Democratic lawmakers to consider making a run at the now open seat. The race, beyond being key to control of the Senate, will have significant implications for a state that has been steadily moving to the right for a decade and will speak volumes about the state of each party. For Republicans, the race represents a chance to further assert their dominance in the onetime battleground, signaling yet again that a state former President Barack Obama won twice is no longer a welcome place for Democrats. But the party is also in a precarious position after the tumultuous departure of former President Donald Trump. A contentious primary for a coveted Senate seat could further exacerbate these deep fissures. For Democrats, the seat offers a chance to prove that a member of their party not named Sherrod Brown can win a statewide election in the Buckeye State. But the race, alongside one for the governor\u2019s mansion in 2022, also threatens to expose the damage that years of Republican victories have done to the Democratic bench in Ohio, a reality that could allow younger talent to test their statewide ability. \u201cIt changes the landscape,\u201d Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat seen as a top contender for the Senate seat, said of the Portman decision. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are very happy [in Ohio], in terms of their families, their communities and how they feel about their future. And in Ohio, the only people who have been in charge are Republicans. So I think that gives us a great opportunity.\u201d Republicans have dominated Ohio ever since Obama won the state during his reelection bid in 2012. The party swept statewide office races in 2014. Two years later, Trump carried the state by 8 points while Portman easily beat former Gov. Ted Strickland in his bid for reelection. The party again showed its strength in 2018, electing Mike DeWine to his first term as governor. And last year, Trump once more carried Ohio. This dominance on both the congressional and statewide level has created a deep bench of Republican office holders, many of whom quickly sprang into action at the chance to run for an open Senate seat. \u201cThese seats don\u2019t open up very often,\u201d said Mike Hartley, a longtime Republican strategiest in Ohio. \u201cSo if you are in any position and have ever wanted to do it, you do it.\u201d Hartley later joked that when national Republicans called him on Monday to talk about who is thinking about filling the seat, he simply said, \u201cEvery name you could possibly think of.\u201d The most significant divide in Republicans seeking the job will be between the state\u2019s congressional delegation and the statewide elected officials. At least four members of Ohio\u2019s congressional delegation are considering running, but the person seen as the best positioned is Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch conservative with deep ties to Trump. Reps. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup and Mike Turner are also considering bids, people close to the process said. Because these lawmakers come from reliably Republican districts aided by gerrymandering in the state, they are more conservative than others considering running for the seat, and none more so than Jordan. But the congressional candidates won\u2019t clear the field. Multiple statewide elected Republicans in Ohio are considering a run, including Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Unlike Jordan and the other congressional lawmakers, Ohio\u2019s statewide elected officials, while conservative, have not been as deeply devoted to Trump and, at times, have been seen as out of step with the Trump base of the party. Both Husted, who has been an elected official in Ohio since 2001, and LaRose, who served as a Green Beret in Iraq and is a former member of the state Senate, would be seen as more establishment choices, in line with DeWine, who has, at times, been a Trump critic. The two have been critical of Trump in the past, including when Husted was heckled at a Trump rally for urging attendees to put on masks to combat the coronavirus. \u201cIn my humble opinion, it starts with Congressman Jim Jordan,\u201d said Mike Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life. \u201cHe has an opportunity to be either a king or a king maker.\u201d The Trump factor will loom large over the race. The former president is so close to Jordan he gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor a president can bestow on a civilian, shortly before he left office. And Trump has been critical of DeWine, especially after the Ohio governor broke with other Republicans to say Biden won the election. And there is no indication that Trump\u2019s grip on the party \u2013 especially on the right \u2013 will weaken over the next two years. \u201cI live in rural Ohio, 25 miles from the Capitol. There are five Trump signs or flags that remain on my street,\u201d said Colton Henson, a Republican operative in the state. \u201cIf a candidate thinks there won\u2019t be a Trump litmus test for many Republican voters, they may want to rethink strategy.\u201d Democrats face a markedly different issue. While the party is largely unified in Ohio, significant losses in the last eight years have diminished the bench of talent in the state and left the party searching for big names who could mount campaigns for statewide office. \u201cIt is a good opportunity to show Democrats can be viable in the state,\u201d said Aryeh Alex, the executive director of the Ohio House Democratic Caucus. In order to succeed, however, some Democrats believe the infighting inside the Republican Party needs to continue, hoping it further splits the party ahead of the general election. \u201cThe Republican Party is having such a massive civil war,\u201d said former Ohio Democratic Party Chair David Pepper. \u201cThey have more of a bench, but the way they have won through gerrymandering has also shaped the politics of their office holders and [the possible candidates] from Congress are much further to the right because they have been living in these gerrymandered districts.\u201d The two Democrats seen as top candidates for the Senate seat are Whaley and US Rep. Tim Ryan, both of whom said they were considering their options in the wake of the Portman news. But the list of candidates does not stop there. Danny O\u2019Connor, the county recorder in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, told CNN he is considering mounting a campaign. Some Democrats are looking to recruit Dr. Amy Acton, who rose to prominence as DeWine\u2019s public health director as the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Other Democrats have looked at Emilia Sykes, the young, Black minority leader of the Ohio House of Representatives, as someone who could mount a historic campaign and motivate Democrats. For Ohio Democrats, the model for someone who can win statewide is Brown, the populist senator who, despite being an avowed liberal, has found success in the state by relating to both independents and Republicans. While that legacy has led some in the state to believe nominating candidates like Brown is the surest way to win, the last decade has demonstrated that his appeal is not only unique, but also difficult to replicate. \u201cI\u2019m considering this because Ohioans have been left behind time and time again,\u201d said O\u2019Connor. \u201cI\u2019m from a small town that gets smaller every year. I know the decency of our people but also that our niceness isn\u2019t going to put food on the table. We need someone who will fight, scrap and claw for every worker who hasn\u2019t had a pay raise or is looking for work.\u201d Other possible candidates argued that trying to be Brown is what Ohio Democrats have done for the past decade \u2013 and it hasn\u2019t worked. \u201cOne thing that we have an opportunity to do is show that with diverse candidates, with women and people of color, there is a pathway to win,\u201d said Sykes, who told CNN she is considering a bid. \u201cWhat we are learning is that when you put women on the ballot, women win. When you put people of color on the ballot, we win.\u201d Sykes pointed to Melody Stewart, a Black Democrat who won a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court in 2018. Whaley made a similar case, too, noting that many of the Democratic losses over the last decade have come when Democrats put up White male candidates. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be insane as a party,\u201d she said. \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Certainly, trying something new would be good after decades of trying things the other way.\u201d And while almost all Democrats argued that the path to victory comes through organizing the base and creating excitement, people like Shannon Hardin, the president of the Columbus City Council, backed up Sykes and Whaley. \u201cWe have to get real organizing and real voter registration efforts in urban communities and in some of our rural areas,\u201d said Hardin. \u201cA Black man, middle named Hussein, last name Obama, won this state in 2012. It is still right, we have a lot of work to do, we have some cultural hills to climb here, but I think with the right candidate and that message on the working class, I think we have a real shot at this thing.\u201d",

            "article_content": "On Monday night, the Oregon Republican Party issued a formal condemnation of the 10 House Republicans who voted in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6. Here\u2019s a sampling of actual lines from the Oregon GOP\u2019s, uh, proclamation. * Whereas history tells us that after George Washington appointed Major General Benedict Arnold to command West Point, Arnold conspired to surrender the fort to the British.\u201d * \u201cWhereas the ten Republican House members, by voting to impeach President Trump, repeated history by conspiring to surrender our nation to Leftist forces seeking to establish a dictatorship void of all cherished freedoms and liberties.\u201d * \u201cWhereas there is growing evidence that the violence at the Capitol was a \u2018false flag\u2019 operation designed to discredit President Trump, his supporters, and all conservative Republicans; this provided the sham motivation to impeach President Trump in order to advance the Democrat goal of seizing total power, in a frightening parallel to the February 1933 burning of the German Reichstag.\u201d OK, OK, OK. So, just so we are clear here, the Oregon Republican Party is saying that in voting to impeach Trump, these 10 Republicans are the equivalent to the burning of the German seat of government that led to Adolf Hitler\u2019s seizure of absolute power? Or that they are in the same boat as legendary traitor Benedict Arnold who conspired to sell out America during the Revolutionary War? Oh, and also that the January 6 riot at the Capitol was also a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation organized by anti-Trump forces designed \u201cto advance the Democrat goal of seizing total power.\u201d (Worth noting: The claim that the Nazis purposely started the Reichstag fire is still up for debate.) Uh \u2026 this is crazy. And yet, it\u2019s not an isolated incident. In recent days, the Arizona Republican Party has reelected Kelli Ward as its chair \u2013 a woman who has repeatedly insisted that the 2020 election was stolen and that Republicans in Congress should have sought to overturn the results. And the state party censured its own governor \u2013 Doug Ducey \u2013 as well as Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, and former Sen. Jeff Flake. Those moves follow this tweet from the Arizona GOP\u2019s official account on January 1: \u201cAs the sun sets on 2020, remember that we\u2019re never going back to the party of Romney, Flake, and McCain. The Republican Party is now, and forever will be, one for the working man and woman! God bless.\u201d Taken together, what the moves in Arizona and Oregon \u2013 not to mention the Arkansas gubernatorial candidacy of former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and the attempts to oust Rep. Liz Cheney from GOP leadership for her impeachment vote \u2013 suggest that attempts by the likes of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Kentucky) and other prominent establishment Republicans to rid the GOP of the memory (and influence) of the 45th president are very likely to fail. As CNN\u2019s Michael Warren wrote Tuesday in a piece about the ongoing civil war within the GOP: \u201cSome in congressional leadership have signaled their desire to move the party beyond Trump by impeaching and convicting him. Allies of the former President, on the other hand, are proclaiming their loyalty to him in conservative media and in state and local party organizations. Still other Republicans remain fearful of the power Trump may yet wield in GOP primaries or see electoral possibilities in embracing a version of his populist-conservative approach. \u201cThe result is a Republican Party in a fight with itself over who will determine its path forward \u2013 and, more crucially, who should be kept from the levers of power in the GOP. For the moment, party unity is giving way to recriminations, a culmination of the longstanding dispute between the party\u2019s grassroots and its leadership class that was mostly put on hold during Trump\u2019s presidency, when few Republicans dared to cross him.\u201d As North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer (R), an ardent defender of the former president who did not vote to object to the Electoral College results on January 6, put it in an interview with CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox: \u201cThere are a lot of Republicans who would like my head. I haven\u2019t been loyal enough.\u201d Add it all up and you get this: The GOP isn\u2019t at the end of this war for its future. It\u2019s at the very beginning, And it is going to get very, very ugly. CNN\u2019s Allison Gordon contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A cold war is underway within the Republican Party as its members begin to navigate how former President Donald Trump and his legacy fit into the GOP\u2019s future. Some in congressional leadership have signaled their desire to move the party beyond Trump by impeaching and convicting him. Allies of the former President, on the other hand, are proclaiming their loyalty to him in conservative media and in state and local party organizations. Still other Republicans remain fearful of the power Trump may yet wield in GOP primaries or see electoral possibilities in embracing a version of his populist-conservative approach. The result is a Republican Party in a fight with itself over who will determine its path forward \u2013 and, more crucially, who should be kept from the levers of power in the GOP. For the moment, party unity is giving way to recriminations, a culmination of the longstanding dispute between the party\u2019s grassroots and its leadership class that was mostly put on hold during Trump\u2019s presidency, when few Republicans dared to cross him. \u201cRepublicans are entering the wilderness and looking desperately to point blame,\u201d said Erick Erickson, the conservative commentator and radio host. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to make room for each other or let the Democrats run over them in the midterms.\u201d Disunity could present a more existential threat to Republicans. In his final days in the White House, Trump raised the idea of starting a new political party, a senior Trump adviser told CNN. While others around him dismissed this scheme to launch a \u201cpatriot party\u201d as unserious, the potential of a split among right-of-center voters looms for Republicans.   Erickson says the divide in the party isn\u2019t just philosophical but literal, with both sides having their own redoubts within the GOP infrastructure. \u201cThe pre-Trump establishment right now largely runs the policy-making arm of the party, and the Trump wing controls the state party arms,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can\u2019t last and have the party winning.\u201d For Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a six-term Illinois congressman and one of just 10 Republicans in the House to vote for impeachment, the party is in the midst of a difficult fight about its own identity. \u201cI do think we are in a battle,\u201d Kinzinger told CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto Monday. \u201cAnd it may be a battle that really needs to happen for our party to say, what does it we stand for? Not when it comes to policy, but as much as anything, are we aspirational or are we a party that feeds on fear and division?\u201d Two announcements on Monday reflected how much the Trump wing of the party remains in the GOP\u2019s driver\u2019s seat \u2013 and that members of the pre-Trump establishment are fading. The first was from former Trump White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who declared her candidacy for governor of Arkansas with a press release touting her allegiance to the former president. \u201cA trusted confidant of the President, Sarah advised him on everything from press and communications strategy to personnel and policy,\u201d read the release. \u201cFor two and a half years, Sarah worked closely with the president, battling with the media, working with lawmakers and CEOs, and accompanying the president on every foreign trip, including dozens of meetings with foreign leaders.\u201d Trump endorsed Sanders later on Monday, saying in a statement that she \u201cis a warrior who will always fight for the people of Arkansas and do what is right, not what is politically correct.\u201d GOP Sen. Rob Portman won't run for reelection, saying it's difficult to 'break through the partisan gridlock' The second came from Sen. Rob Portman, the moderate Ohio Republican and veteran of the George W. Bush administration who announced he would not seek reelection in 2022 \u2013 prompting a free-for-all for the GOP primary in a state that has taken an increasingly Republican turn in the Trump era. Portman\u2019s decision to leave a \u201csafe seat tells you that he doesn\u2019t think much is going to get better in Washington, and we are unlikely to take the majority in \u201922,\u201d one strategist close to Republican fundraisers told CNN. \u201cWe need all the moderates we can get,\u201d said a second GOP strategist familiar with Ohio Republican politics. \u201cHe\u2019s exactly the type we want, and now he will be replaced by someone more \u2018conservative\u2019 by ideology or by positioning.\u201d But \u201cmore conservative\u201d \u2013 or at least more dedicated to Trump \u2013 is exactly what those most loyal to the former President want. For the party\u2019s current problems, they blame Republicans too willing to toss Trump overboard following the election. That includes Sen. Mitch McConnell and Rep. Liz Cheney, two GOP leaders in Congress who publicly condemned Trump for his actions surrounding the January 6 insurrection. Cheney, the chair of the House Republican conference, was among the House Republicans who voted for impeachment earlier this month. For that vote, some of the most strident Trump allies in the GOP conference are threatening to strip her of her leadership role. And one of them, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, is going to Cheney\u2019s home state of Wyoming this week to speak out against her vote. McConnell, meanwhile, has only gestured at his openness to voting to convict, but that has been enough to turn up the pressure from some Republican colleagues. And in two recent speeches on the Senate floor, the Republican leader harshly criticized Trump\u2019s actions surrounding the attack and denounced the lie propagated by the President that the 2020 election was stolen from him. All of that\u2019s made McConnell a target of pro-Trump voices in the conservative media. \u201cMitch McConnell, if you\u2019re not going to fight, we deserve better,\u201d said Fox News host Sean Hannity last week. \u201cYou can go back to representing the people of Kentucky and let somebody that knows how to lead, lead.\u201d Many Republicans with potential White House ambitions are therefore treading lightly. Sens. Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton, for example, did not object to counting electoral votes like their other ambitious colleagues Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley did. But Trump remains popular among Republican voters, and most polls show little appetite among them to impeach Trump. So both Rubio and Cotton, along with other senators who may be looking at running for President, have already indicated they won\u2019t support convicting Trump \u2013 a potential hedge against primary voters who may be counting fealty to Trump as an asset in a presidential nominee. In some states, party committees and local activists have been lashing out at those who have not sufficiently defended Trump. Backed by Trump himself, Republicans in Georgia have gone after their own elected officials, including Gov. Brian Kemp and secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, for not trying to overturn the election. Arizona Republicans wrestle with their party's future In a statement following the January 13 House vote on impeachment, the Texas Republican Party blasted the vote as \u201cfrivolous and cruel.\u201d And last week, the Oregon Republican Party released a lengthy, fiction-filled statement calling the 10 GOP votes to impeach Trump a \u201cbetrayal.\u201d Over the weekend, the Arizona Republican Party, which had just narrowly reelected its pro-Trump chairwoman Kelli Ward, passed resolutions censuring three of the state\u2019s most prominent Republicans: Cindy McCain, former Sen. Jeff Flake, and Gov. Doug Ducey. What happened in Arizona \u2013 a longtime Republican state that Trump lost and where Democrats are ascendant \u2013 worries longtime GOP operatives like Michael Steel, a former top aide to House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cIf you say to the people of Arizona that your successful, conservative, two-term governor is somehow a problem, you are dooming yourself to minority status,\u201d Steel told CNN. Erickson agrees. \u201cA party that isn\u2019t big enough for Dick Cheney\u2019s daughter, Trump\u2019s secretary of transportation\u2019s husband, John McCain\u2019s wife, and the sitting governors of Arizona and Georgia is a party not big enough to win,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Even after President Donald Trump\u2019s disproven allegations of voter fraud fueled last week\u2019s deadly assault on the US Capitol, Republicans across an array of swing states are still touting his baseless allegations to advance measures that would make it tougher to vote. When Congress voted last week, in the immediate aftermath of the Trump-fueled riot, to finalize the Electoral College results declaring Joe Biden the winner of November\u2019s election, bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate joined dozens of courts around the country in concluding that there was not meaningful fraud in the election. But despite those findings, Republicans in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Texas and likely other states including Michigan and Wisconsin are moving to roll back access to mail balloting, eliminate drop boxes, toughen voter identification laws and erect other barriers to the ballot in the name of improving voter security and restoring \u201cfaith\u201d in the outcome. \u201cWe are seeing a continued use of the voter fraud lie and thoroughly debunked conspiracy theories over the integrity of this election to drive a vote suppression agenda,\u201d says Wendy Weiser, who directs the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Law enforcement braces for more extremist violence in DC and around the US ahead of Inauguration Day This renewed push places Republicans on a collision course with congressional Democrats, who are likely to move quickly on legislation that would expand access. It will also likely prompt a procession of legal battles between GOP states pursuing new restrictions and a Biden Justice Department likely to resist them as violations of the Voting Rights Act. With Trump\u2019s long march to discredit the election results \u2013 a campaign joined by scores of GOP elected officials \u2013 culminating in last week\u2019s horrific violence at the Capitol, voting rights advocates believe they have their best opportunity in memory to galvanize public support for fortifying the right to vote. \u201cThe country has now, I think, seen the logical endpoint of this [suppression] strategy,\u201d says Weiser. \u201cThis insurrection might have unmasked the strategy for what it really is, which is an anti-democratic effort to use lies to thwart our democratic system, in particular by repudiating the votes of Black and brown people.\u201d Although the riot (understandably) overshadowed the proceedings, the congressional vote in the wee hours Thursday finalizing the Electoral College results represented a bipartisan repudiation of Trump\u2019s groundless fraud claims. While a majority of House Republicans voted to reject the results, an overwhelming majority of Senate Republicans as well as all Democrats in both chambers voted to accept them \u2013 and in the process more Republicans than at any point since Election Day acknowledged that Trump and his team had not provided evidence to validate their claims of massive fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of significant fraud conspiracies or even significant anomalies that cast any serious doubt on who actually won the election,\u201d declared Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump\u2019s most reflexive defenders, agreed during his remarks that Trump had not produced evidence to support his claims: \u201cFraud? They said there\u2019s 66,000 people in Georgia under 18 voted. How many people believe that? I said, give me 10. Hadn\u2019t had one. They said 8,000 felons in prison in Arizona voted. Give me 10. Hadn\u2019t got one. There\u2019s problems in every election. But I don\u2019t buy this. Enough\u2019s enough.\u201d Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky acknowledged during his statement that \u201cnothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election.\u201d Public doubt about the result, he continued, \u201cwas incited without any evidence.\u201d These admissions by Senate Republicans capped weeks of similar conclusions from courts and state election officials. The result of Trump\u2019s extensive campaign to overturn the result was that this year\u2019s balloting received likely the most extensive and comprehensive after-action review of any modern election. And, like earlier efforts from Republican administrations to find systematic fraud \u2013 such as a push under the Department of Justice under George W. Bush, along with Trump\u2019s own disbanded voter fraud commission \u2013 the reviews turned up almost nothing. \u201cThis has been as vetted as any election could possibly be, and has gotten as clean a bill of health as any election could,\u201d says Weiser. Yet none of that has prevented Republicans across key swing states from offering measures that would create new obstacles to voting on the grounds of fighting fraud or restoring \u201cfaith\u201d in the election system. In a parallel move, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida plans to shortly reintroduce legislation that would mandate national voter-ID laws, require all absentee ballots to be requested at least 21 days before Election Day and bar states from accepting mail-in ballots received after that date. Scott is the incoming chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party\u2019s Senate campaign arm. The most hardcore Trump backers have *always* taken him literally \u201cThis election has shown we need reforms to our election systems and we need to rebuild trust in our elections,\u201d Sarah Schwirian, Scott\u2019s deputy communications director, told me in an email. Despite his remarks acknowledging the absence of fraud, McConnell also called for \u201cstrong state-led voting reforms.\u201d In the states, the push may be greatest in Georgia, which, amid record turnout, saw Biden carry the state \u2013 the first Democrat to do so since Bill Clinton in 1992 \u2013 and Democrats sweep both of this month\u2019s US Senate runoffs. In the state legislative session that convened Monday, the state Senate Republican majority pledged to repeal the state\u2019s law allowing voters to request absentee ballots for any reason, to impose new photo-identification requirements on any absentee voting that remains and to eliminate drop boxes for returning such ballots. \u201cThe Georgia Senate Republicans have heard the calls of millions of Georgians who have raised deep and heartfelt concerns that state law has been violated and our election process abused,\u201d the caucus said in a statement last month. \u201cWe will fix this.\u201d The Republican speaker of the state House has expressed reluctance to revoke no-excuse absentee balloting, but Georgia\u2019s GOP secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, who drew national attention for resisting Trump\u2019s demands to subvert the election, has endorsed the repeal. Raffensperger has cited both claims of \u201celection integrity\u201d and the argument that large-scale absentee voting, combined with early in-person voting and Election Day itself, creates too much work for county election officials. Raffensperger continues to support the repeal even though an audit of absentee ballots in Cobb County conducted by his office found virtually no discrepancies. Republican legislators are also pushing proposals to bar local governments or organizations from mailing absentee-ballot requests to voters and to prohibit groups from organizing buses to the polls during early voting. In Pennsylvania, Republican legislators have also proposed bills to repeal the no-excuse absentee ballot law passed in 2019. Though Toomey, the state\u2019s Republican US senator, has acknowledged that no one has produced evidence of fraud in Pennsylvania\u2019s balloting, state Rep. Jim Gregory introduced the repeal by declaring, \u201cThis past Presidential Election cycle we witnessed an extreme amount of irregularities regarding mail-in ballots.\u201d Other state legislative Republicans, hesitant about completely repealing no-excuse absentee balloting, want to ban drop boxes, bar voters from signing up to automatically receive absentee ballots during each election and impose tighter signature-verification requirements. What we\u2019ve seen coming out of Covid is this extraordinary surfacing of these profound inequities in voting, and people don\u2019t want to go back. People never should have waited in a long line to vote; people never should have had to pay to return an absentee ballot. But now we see that as even more unfair. Hannah Fried, national campaign director, All Voting is Local, a project of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights Texas is already one of the states that make it toughest to register or vote (it allows absentee voting for only a limited number of causes), but Republican legislators there are looking at adding new hurdles, including a ban on local governments mailing out absentee ballot requests, as some Democratic-leaning large counties tried to do last year. Specific proposals to roll back absentee balloting haven\u2019t yet surfaced in Michigan, but appear likely in the upcoming session after the GOP-controlled state House and Senate each held extensive hearings in December that allowed Trump allies to air wild claims of fraud. At the hearings, \u201cit was pretty clear \u2026 that they were trying to build fodder for potential voter suppression efforts,\u201d says Sam Inglot, deputy director of Progress Michigan, a progressive advocacy group. The Republican-controlled state Legislature in Wisconsin seems poised to act too. The prospects for these measures \u2013 and others that may be coming in states with Republican-controlled legislatures \u2013 are mixed. Democratic governors in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania would be certain to veto any GOP efforts to roll back ballot access. But advocates of expanding voter access worry that even if legislation fails in those states the effort will provide new oxygen for the same unproven fraud claims that fanned last week\u2019s insurrection. For Michigan Republicans, pursuing legislation that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is certain to veto may be just \u201ca tactic to really try and fire up their base, but that is a very dangerous proposition because what we just saw was an insurrection fueled by this misinformation,\u201d says Art Reyes III, executive director of We the People-Michigan, a liberal group that organizes working-class communities around the state. Civil rights experts say that if red states pass laws rolling back mail balloting or adding other restrictions, it\u2019s likely the Biden Justice Department would fight them in court. But that may be a limited remedy. In the 2013 Shelby County decision, five Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices outvoted four Democratic-appointed justices to effectively repeal the federal government\u2019s authority under the Voting Rights Act to require that states with a history of discrimination receive preclearance for changes in election laws. As a result, Washington can fight such laws only with litigation after the fact under another section of the act. And that is a lengthy and time-consuming process, as Vanita Gupta, at the time president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, acknowledged in an interview with me last month. Gupta has since taken a leave from the organization now that Biden has nominated her for the number three position at the Justice Department. \u201cIt can take years and a lot of money to actually litigate these cases, during which elections are taking place pursuant to what could be unconstitutional laws,\u201d she told me. \u201cSo [that] is hardly a remedy.\u201d Gupta said the more feasible response was intense pressure on legislatures not to add these restrictions in the first place. Such resistance could emerge: Efforts to protect the vote against Trump\u2019s calls to overthrow the results drew intense public pushback in Michigan, Georgia and other states, and the expanded mail balloting and other measures taken to ensure access during the pandemic proved extremely popular with voters. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen coming out of Covid is this extraordinary surfacing of these profound inequities in voting, and people don\u2019t want to go back,\u201d says Hannah Fried, national campaign director for All Voting is Local, a project of the Leadership Conference. \u201cPeople never should have waited in a long line to vote; people never should have had to pay to return an absentee ballot. But now we see that as even more unfair.\u201d   In states with unified Republican control of government, however, like Georgia and Texas, opponents may not be able to stop new voting restrictions. That could focus more attention on Democratic efforts to establish expansive nationwide voting rules. In the previous Congress, House Democrats passed both a new Voting Rights Act restoring the federal government\u2019s preclearance authority, and a sweeping election bill known as HR 1, which, among other things, requires states to permit online and same-day voter registration and provide at least 15 days of in-person early voting. Reintroduced in the new Congress this month as HR 1, the bill now also requires states to offer no-excuse absentee voting. House sponsors say they expect the bill to pass within the opening weeks of the new Congress. In the previous Congress, House Democrats passed the new Voting Rights Act and HR 1 without a single dissenting vote; every Senate Democrat endorsed both measures as well. Every House Republican opposed both bills except for one who supported the new Voting Rights Act. Even if the House, as is likely, passes both bills, Senate Republican filibusters against each are virtually certain. It would be extremely difficult for Democrats to attract enough GOP support to reach the 60 votes required to pass such measures through the upper chamber. John Roberts can't escape the shadow of Donald Trump For that reason, these measures to protect and expand voting rights could become a flashpoint in the debate among Senate Democrats about whether to try to overturn the filibuster, which could be eliminated with a majority vote. In an interview with me last summer, Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the principal proponent of ending the filibuster, said he believed that Democrats reluctant to terminate it for all issues might consider doing so solely for revisions in election rules. Uniting all 50 Senate Democrats behind even a limited filibuster repeal wouldn\u2019t be easy. But ironically, a new push in Republican states to restrict voting access \u2013even after Trump\u2019s fraud claims were both disproven and implicated in last week\u2019s unprecedented violence \u2013 could increase pressure on Senate Democrats to act, even if that means confronting the filibuster. \u201cVoters do not want to go back to how things were,\u201d says Fried. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think people who are in position to change this \u2026 want to be on the wrong side of history.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden on Friday introduced key nominees for his economic and jobs team, including Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo for commerce secretary and\u00a0Boston Mayor Marty Walsh\u00a0for labor secretary. The two picks mark the completion of Biden\u2019s announcements for his Cabinet secretary nominees, and come less than two weeks from the President-elect\u2019s inauguration. Biden touted the diversity and historic firsts in his Cabinet, and said he had fulfilled his promise of having his Cabinet look like America. \u201cThis will be the first Cabinet ever that is evenly composed with as many women as men in the Cabinet. This will be the first Cabinet ever with the majority of people of color occupying this Cabinet,\u201d the President-elect said. He noted his nominees would, if confirmed, include the first female treasury secretary, the first African American defense secretary and the first Native American Cabinet secretary. Biden on Friday also announced Isabel Guzman, the director of California\u2019s Office of the Small Business Advocate, to lead the Small Business Administration and Don Graves, who was the executive director of the President\u2019s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness at the Obama White House, as his nominee for deputy secretary of commerce. Biden spoke of the challenges his administration will face when he takes office in the middle of a pandemic and economic downturn, when so many Americans have lost their jobs and are struggling financially. Biden said his administration would prioritize distributing emergency economic aid to \u201csmall\u00a0businesses on Main Street that\u00a0aren\u2019t wealthy and well\u00a0connected, that are facing real\u00a0economic hardships through no\u00a0fault of their own.\u201d He said he would focus on supporting Black, Latino, Asian, Native American and women-owned small businesses. The President-elect stressed that Americans and small businesses struggling amid the pandemic need immediate and direct economic relief, including $2,000 stimulus checks. \u201c$600 is simply not enough, when you have to choose between paying rent, putting food on the table, keeping the lights on,\u201d Biden said of the stimulus checks that were recently approved by Congress. He sympathized with Americans across the country who have lost their jobs and are now forced to line up at food banks to feed their families. He pointed out that the gap between White unemployment and Black and Latino unemployment \u201cremains much\u00a0too large.\u201d   In the wake of the two Democratic US Senate wins in Georgia, the President-elect said he hoped that having Democrats controlling both the House and the Senate will increase the changes of raising the minimum wage. During a Q&A after he introduced the nominees, Biden said President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to skip his inauguration is \u201cone of the few things he and I have ever agreed on.\u201d Here are key lines from the nominees, who will all require Senate confirmation: Gina Raimondo, Commerce Secretary \u201cWhen I announced my run for governor, Rhode Island was in the midst of an eight-month streak as the state with the highest unemployment rate in the nation. But over the last six years, we\u2019ve worked hard, we fought back and we\u2019ve grown our way back, achieving a record number of jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in over 30 years.\u201d \u201cI am excited to get to work on a national scale to help realize the vision of the President-elect and Vice President-elect to help more hardworking families in every community write the next chapter of their own American stories.\u201d Marty Walsh, Labor Secretary \u201cToday, we\u2019re at a crossroads in America. It\u2019s a time of great hardship. Working people are holding their country together. I\u2019ve seen it up close as mayor of the city that I love, Boston. Health care workers, first responders, grocery store workers, delivery drivers, postal workers, sanitation workers, custodians. Coming through for us under impossible conditions.\u201d \u201cWorking people have been struggling for a long time under the erosion of their rights and the deep inequities of race, gender and class. For the last four years they\u2019ve been under assault, attacks on their rights, their livelihoods and the unions that built the middle class. We are facing hard times but nobody\u2019s tougher than the American worker, and now, now we have the opportunity to put power back in the hands of working people all across this country.\u201d Isabel Guzman, Small Business Administrator \u201cI\u2019m honored to return to the SBA at a crossroads moment for small businesses, the dreams they embody, the people they lift up and the communities they serve. So many small businesses across the country have been devastated by the pandemic and economic crisis. A disproportionate impact has fallen, as it often does, on our businesses owned by people of color.\u201d \u201cSmall businesses have had to adapt quickly to survive and chase down relief while facing closures, drops in revenues, shrinking cash flow and increasing debt. I know you believe wholeheartedly, Mr. President-elect and Madam Vice President-elect, that all of our small businesses are critical to our collective success as a nation.\u201d Don Graves, Deputy Secretary of Commerce \u201cI\u2019ve spent my career \u2013 in government, the private sector and nonprofits \u2013 finding ways to ensure that economic opportunity is inclusive and broad-based. And as it is for all of us in our own ways, it\u2019s personal. I come from a long line of small business owners, including one who owned and operated the only African American-owned hotel in the mid to late 1800s just four short blocks from where the Commerce Department sits today.\u201d \u201cBut for too many people in this country, the chance to start and grow a business, to take their idea into market and sell all over the world remains elusive all these years later. But we also know that government, its resources and its experienced and capable civil servants can help level the playing field and empower people, communities and our economy to reach their full potential.\u201d Raimondo is the first woman governor of Rhode Island, and has served in the role since her election in 2014. She was among the women considered to serve as Biden\u2019s vice president, and has been praised for her leadership amid the coronavirus pandemic. Raimondo was also considered for Biden\u2019s health and human services secretary, but The New York Times reported\u00a0last month that labor unions helped block Raimondo from becoming his pick to lead HHS because of her record on pension changes. Walsh is a veteran union operative and rose to lead Boston\u2019s Building and Construction Trades Council, a group that represents ironworker and electrician unions, among others. Walsh has been serving as Boston\u2019s mayor since 2013, and was a rumored potential Labor pick in 2016 if Hillary Clinton had won the presidency. Walsh\u2019s selection is a victory for AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who rallied his federation of 56 unions to back the Boston mayor soon after Biden won the election. Guzman is the director of California\u2019s Office of the Small Business Advocate, a government office that works to support and grow small businesses in America\u2019s most populous state. Prior to taking over the state office, Guzman was the deputy chief of staff and senior adviser at the US Small Business Administration, the office she will now lead. Graves served in the Obama White House as the executive director of the President\u2019s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and as the deputy assistant secretary for small business, community development and housing policy at the US Department of Treasury. Graves was previously a partner with Graves, Horton, Askew & Johns, LLC. He was the former director of public policy for the business roundtable and was previously a policy adviser for the US Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Domestic Finance. The announcements come days after pro-Trump supporters stormed and breached the US Capitol. Five people are dead, including a US Capitol Police officer, after President Donald Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes in Congress, repeating lies about the election being stolen from him and promising to join them. Biden on Thursday slammed the police for their different treatment of the pro-Trump mob and Black Lives Matter protesters during demonstrations last year. The day prior, he said the rioting at the US Capitol amounted to an \u201cunprecedented assault\u201d on US democracy, and called for Trump to immediately go on national television and \u201cdemand an end to this siege.\u201d CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jennifer Rodgers is a former federal prosecutor, adjunct professor of clinical law at NYU School of Law, lecturer-in-law at Columbia Law School and a CNN legal analyst. The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN. For most of 2021, we have been engaged in a national conversation around why the January 6 insurrection happened and who was responsible. In this conversation, government officials have been some of the loudest voices \u2013 perhaps, not surprisingly, breaking down along party lines: Democrats loudly exclaiming the need for an extensive investigation to explore the Big Lie and its consequences; Republicans, by contrast, proclaiming with a few exceptions that there is no need for an investigation at all, and that to the extent that January 6 stood for anything it represented legitimate concerns over election fraud. But there is one group of government officials who have been mostly quiet about the root causes of the events on January 6: federal judges. In recent days, however, three judges have made news with comments and rulings about the events on or leading up to January 6. Judge Amit Mehta of federal district court in Washington, D.C., said during the sentencing of a January 6 defendant that the defendant was a \u201cpawn\u201d who was \u201ctold the election was stolen when it was not,\u201d and that \u201cthose who created the conditions that led to [the defendant\u2019s] conduct have in no meaningful measure been held accountable.\u201d Unite the Right verdict sends an urgent message Judge Reggie Walton, also a federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., said during a guilty plea proceeding for another January 6 defendant that the judge\u2019s concern was that the defendant was \u201cgullible enough to come to Washington D.C. from Florida based on a lie \u2026 and the person who inspired you \u2026 is still making those statements, and my concern is that you are gullible enough to do it again.\u201d Walton also compared former President Donald Trump unfavorably with Al Gore, calling Gore \u201ca man\u201d for declining to challenge the election results in 2000 despite having a better case for claiming the presidency than Trump had in 2020. Finally, Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neuriter ordered lawyers who filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of voters to pay attorneys\u2019 fees of $180,000 to defendants, including Dominion Voting Systems, whom they sued alleging fraud during the 2020 election. Neuriter said, \u201cI believe that rather than a legitimate use of the legal system to seek redress for redressable grievances, this lawsuit has been used to manipulate gullible members of the public and foment public unrest.\u201d Given the likely continuing fallout from frivolous litigation over the 2020 election, and the 600-plus defendants charged thus far in the January 6-related cases still working their way through the system, there will be many more statements by judges in the months to come that could be construed as offering opinions about the results of the 2020 election and the parties responsible for the attack on the Capitol. You don't agree with anything they say. But you should still invite them to Thanksgiving But are such comments \u2013 dealing as they do with an issue that has become a major political flash point \u2013 appropriate for members of the judiciary, which is supposed to be the least political of our three branches of government? After all, judges are supposed to stay out of the political fray. Federal judges are appointed, not elected. And despite the recent, and regrettable, trend of identifying judges by the politics of the president who appointed them, judges have lifetime tenure for the very reason that the founders did not want judges to be beholden to the politics or party of the president who appointed them. Judicial ethics rules underscore judges\u2019 apolitical status, expressly prohibiting them from all forms of political activity, including making political speeches. For this reason, the judiciary usually polls as more trustworthy than the other branches, although its lead has slipped in recent years (likely due to respondents\u2019 views of the Supreme Court). When such comments are made as part of the judge\u2019s duties, the answer is clearly yes. A judge\u2019s job is to make decisions on issues before them by finding facts and applying the law to them. When judges make comments that logically bear on that work, they are entirely proper. Why the tide may be turning on Trump Thus, for example, Mehta\u2019s comments about the relative culpability of the defendant he was in the process of sentencing were appropriate, as was Walton\u2019s statement of concern that the defendant before him may re-offend because the impetus for his criminal conduct remained in play. Similarly, like the many judges before him who issued highly critical rulings about the frivolous lawsuits filed challenging the results of the election, Neuriter\u2019s statements about the nature of the lawsuit he oversaw were more than reasonable \u2013 they were necessary to his finding to grant attorneys\u2019 fees. Of course, when judges in their comments stray beyond the issues they need to decide in the cases before them, they risk losing credibility. While Walton was well within bounds in most of what he said during the plea proceeding, his statement that Gore acted \u201clike a man\u201d in conceding the 2000 election when compared to Trump in 2020 was unnecessary to the proceeding, not to mention insulting to women.  Hundreds more of the January 6 defendants will plead guilty and be sentenced in the months ahead, and undoubtedly in the course of handling those proceedings, federal judges will continue \u2013 as they should \u2013 to discuss the causes of the insurrection as they bear on the issues at hand. Measured, fact-based descriptions of relevant events by judges have the potential to persuade where hyper-partisan rhetoric from elected officials may not. Indeed, the public should place greater weight on what judges are saying because of their unique role as neutral arbiters and their mastery of the relevant evidence. Let\u2019s just hope people are listening.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings have been sinking for months, and last week\u2019s election results felt like a slap in the face to Democrats. To hear some of the analysis, you\u2019d think the Biden\u2019s presidency is done. Don\u2019t believe it. Sure, some of the problems are real. But things are not nearly as bad as they seem; not for the president and not for the country. There\u2019s time to make the kinds of adjustments that could quickly improve Biden\u2019s prospects. In CNN\u2019s latest poll, Biden\u2019s approval stands at 48 percent. That\u2019s far from calamitous, although the trend is moving in the wrong direction for him. But the poll shows a significant weakening among those who say they \u201cstrongly approve\u201d of his performance, and 58 percent say he isn\u2019t paying attention to the most important issues. The drop in his support is real and requires a course correction. Biden needs to correct misperceptions \u2013 especially about the economy  \u2013 and he needs to recalibrate his stance on some key issues. He has lost some of the connection he made with voters who embraced him as a centrist leader who would not only restore a sense of normalcy and decency to the country, but would improve the lives of middle-class Americans of all political persuasions, working with leaders of both parties. Even if you don\u2019t believe CNN\u2019s poll and think other more negative ones paint a more accurate picture, remember first-year opinion surveys can turn out to be outliers. I remember the early months of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. He seemed destined for disaster. His approval collapsed from 59% in February 1993 to just 37% four months later, in Gallup polls. Clinton won reelection and finished his second term with an average approval of 61 percent. Biden has not finished his first year, and his prospects already look better today than they did just a few days ago, since Congress approved major infrastructure legislation. In fact, if the bill had been passed sooner, the conversation today would sound completely different. Every American has known for years the country is in dire need of large-scale infrastructure upgrade. Trump tried and failed to do it. Now Biden has. And it will benefit everyone, Republicans and Democrats. The crucial point we're missing after the Virginia election Infrastructure is not a sexy topic. But, as then-Vice President Joe Biden told former President Obama when he signed Obamacare into law, this one is a \u201cbig f\u2014ing deal.\u201d   The administration needs to emphasize the content: roads, bridges, parks, internet. Better, safer roads, modernized transit systems, electric and hybrid buses, intercity rail service, etc. etc. It will make life easier, better, and will also create huge numbers of jobs and make American more competitive. It will boost the economy enormously. Biden needs to become a better salesman. As CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta noted, \u201cIf Trump had gotten an infrastructure bill after all those Infrastructure Weeks, he\u2019d have been flying stealth bombers over the Lincoln Memorial and unveiling the Trump bridge in every swing district in America\u2026\u201d Trump, of course, is the consummate marketing man. Biden needs to up his game in that department. And it is nowhere more evident than in impressions about the economy. The CNN poll found 38% of Americans say the economy is the most pressing problem facing the country. It\u2019s the number one concern of Republicans and the second highest among Democrats, who worry more about the pandemic. If Americans felt the economy is doing well, they would not call it one of the country\u2019s most pressing problems. But the notion America is experiencing a grave economic crisis is simply false. The Biden administration has allowed Republicans and their mouthpieces in right-wing media \u2013 with some help from the rest of the mainstream media \u2013 to create the incorrect impression the economy is not doing well. Talk of \u201cbrutal\u201d economic data is absurd hyperbole. And reports focusing exclusively on supply chain issues without noting  the overall economy is growing, strongly miss the forest for the trees. It\u2019s true there are problems. Inflation is climbing and there are severe disruptions in supply chains. These are serious issues that must be addressed to prevent them from derailing the recovery. But they are to a large extent the result of unprecedented rates of economic activity on the heels of severe disruptions caused by the pandemic. The unemployment rate is dropping faster than it ever has. Just look at this chart. Last week\u2019s report of 4.6 percent unemployment is excellent by historical standards, and the US economy has arrived there much faster than predicted. If Biden and Democrats want to improve their prospects for 2022 and 2024, they need to make sure people know things are, indeed, better for most Americans. The stock market is at all-time highs, and the median checking account balance today is 50 percent more than before the pandemic. Biden is on to something important It\u2019s not surprising people were disappointed in Biden when they went to the polls last week. Biden promised to bring the country together after four years of bitter acrimony under the previous president. Until 11:30 p.m. last Friday, it looked like he couldn\u2019t even bring Democrats together. The months of intra-party bickering among Democrats was an ugly \u2013 and pernicious \u2013 sight. But now Biden has, in fact, produced a major bipartisan law. Democrats and Republicans supported it. In the House, six of the most leftist Democrats voted against it. By doing that, they may have drawn a useful line for Biden. Members of the so-called Squad advocate many policies Biden and millions of Americans support, but their inflexibility, their unwillingness to fall in line behind the president, are hurting Biden. Doing so reveals a stunning disregard for the cost of making Biden\u2019s agenda crash. If Biden fails, the 2024 election could well bring an end to American democracy. The President needs to re-sell himself to the country. He needs to remind middle America the policies he is pursuing are not radical, even if his opponents paint them so. They are aimed at improving living standards for all Americans. He needs to talk more about content, and when forced to discuss cost, make sure people understand they are part of a fiscally responsible package that will not add to the debt unlike (even the pre-pandemic) policies of the previous administration. And he must erase the impression he is beholden to the most intransigent, most extreme members of his party.  Democrats can win only if they work together and convince others they\u2019re working for all. Most Republicans today would not support a Democrat, but independents and the less-partisan conservatives are open-minded. Biden has had some rocky months, but he has a very good chance of strengthening his position. In sharp contrast to his predecessor, Biden is uncomfortable boasting, but he needs to let people understand the magnitude of what he has achieved. The economy is mostly doing very well. He has scored important victories, and he is not a wild-eyed radical. If he does that, his approval ratings will climb as quickly as they fell.",

His most recent book is \u201cThe Giants and Their City: Major League Baseball in San Francisco, 1976-1992.\u201d (Kent State University Press, 2020) The opinions expressed here are his own. View more opinion at CNN. We are frequently told that the key to the Democrats\u2019 chances in the 2022 midterm elections is for President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and the Democratic majority in Congress to deliver meaningful legislation for the American people. There are many good reasons for Biden and the Democrats to pass the spending bills currently being discussed in Congress. Expanding social and physical infrastructure is what many Democratic candidates said they would do. For example, candidate Biden promised \u201cto imagine and build a new American economy for our families and the next generation \u2026 where every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy more vibrant and more powerful precisely because everybody will be cut in on the deal.\u201d The Party\u2019s platform included similar language, saying Democrats are committed \u201cto forging a new social and economic contract with the American people\u201d that affirms housing as a right, raises wages and \u201csupports working families and the middle class by securing equal pay for women and paid family leave for all.\u201d It is probably what their voters want and it may well be the right thing to do for America. There is also something intuitively appealing about the argument that delivering on campaign promises leads to victory for the president\u2019s party. It is consistent with common sense as well as with a fundamental idea of democracy, that voters reward parties for keeping promises and crafting good policy and punish them for failing to do that. The idea that delivering on policy promises is the key to victory in the midterms also happens to be wrong \u2013 or at least not supported by any evidence from the last half century or so. As a motivator for Democrats to act, the idea that delivering major policy accomplishments will pave the road to electoral success may be a good approach, but as political analysis it runs counter to history. Tucker Carlson's insulting attack on Pete Buttigieg Recent decades are filled with examples of a new administration passing major legislation only to lose seats in the midterm election. After being elected in 1964 in a landslide with huge Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, President Lyndon B. Johnson passed a battery of policies in 1965 that included the Voting Rights Act, the creation of Medicare and Medicaid and a number of other Great Society programs. The reward for the Democrats was the loss of 47 seats in the House of Representatives and three seats in the Senate in the 1966 midterm elections. For good measure, Johnson\u2019s Vice President Hubert Humphrey was defeated in the 1968 presidential election. A few years later, in 1981 President Ronald Reagan delivered on a campaign promise and passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which was the core of his economic agenda and his campaign platform from his 1980 election. Reagan\u2019s Republican Party then went on to pick up one Senate seat but lost 26 House seats in the 1982 midterms. In more recent years President Donald Trump passed major tax cuts, significant deregulation and two Supreme Court justices while President Barack Obama delivered the Affordable Care Act early in his first term. Both Trump and Obama saw their party drubbed in their first midterm election. The pattern of the president\u2019s party losing seats in the midterm is well-known and vexing for almost all presidents. Simply delivering on campaign promises has, at least since the New Deal era, not been enough to stop that trend. It is extremely unlikely that will change now in an era of a deeply polarized electorate, highly partisan media and a relative paucity of undecided voters. A woman is raped and onlookers record it: the story beyond the outrage There are several reasons for this. First, it takes a while for major policies to be felt by voters. For example, the Affordable Care Act was passed in spring of 2010, so voters were not experiencing the benefits, or downsides, of that in time for it to make a major impact on the election. In today\u2019s context that means that even if Biden were able to pass both pieces of his Build Back Better program \u2013 the hard and soft infrastructure \u2013 the impact would not be felt right away. Groundbreakings on a few infrastructure projects or the awareness that, for example, new climate legislation or expanded Medicare that would include dental coverage was coming soon would be unlikely to sway too many voters in 2022. Second, American politics no longer work, if it ever did, on a simple principle of major policy accomplishments being rewarded. Even when presidents are reelected, it is more frequently due to a perception that things are going well rather than any great enthusiasm for their policies, because voters care more about outcomes than inputs. In other words, the state of the economy is more important to voters than what laws the president and his party did or did not pass. Additionally, in our current highly polarized political context, we have seen over and over, particularly in the last year or so that external factors, whether the Covid-19 pandemic, an impeachment hearing, the Mueller Report or even the January 6 insurrection have simply pushed people back into their political corners. For example, the polls in late March of 2020 showed Biden, shortly after wrapping up the Democratic nomination, about nine points ahead of then-President Trump, but over the next months when the pandemic was rampant and huge protests roiled American cities after George Floyd\u2019s murder in Minneapolis, the numbers did not change much and the final pre-election polls showed Biden leading by about eight points. If those events have not significantly moved voters, why would we expect a piece of legislation or two, even major ones, to be any different?  Despite this, the Biden administration needs to accomplish something before the midterms. While it is not true that delivering legislation is the secret to success in the midterms, it is almost certainly true that it is better for the Democrats to have something to show for their two years in the majority when they go before the voters next November than to have done nothing with their majorities. Supporters of Biden\u2019s legislative agenda should defend their position on the substance of his policies, not on the Pollyannish opinion that passing major new laws is the secret recipe for electoral success in the midterm elections. As Presidents Johnson, Reagan, Obama and Trump all learned, American politics is not that simple.",

He is the author of \u201cBibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. On May 31, Naftali Bennett, the right-wing politician who became Israel\u2019s new prime minister on Sunday, finally broke cover and lambasted his old boss and mentor Benjamin Netanyahu for trying to lead the state of Israel to his own \u201cpersonal Masada\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Jewish zealots who committed mass suicide rather than become Roman slaves in the first century A.D. Bennett announced that he would be forming a national-unity government with Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid opposition party. The parties opposed to Netanyahu not only have a majority in Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, but they are now actually working together. This seems to have spelled the end of Netanyahu\u2019s long period in power \u2013 12 years since he returned to office in 2009, 15 years in total. But it would be premature to pronounce the end of Israel\u2019s Netanyahu Era. For a start, Netanyahu may have lost any prospect of mustering a majority of his own, but he seems certain to continue exerting every ounce of pressure on wavering members of the opposition, including allowing proxies like his son Yair and his social media manager Topaz Luk to amplify the toxic social-media campaigns against Bennett and members of his Yamina party that have fueled angry protests outside their homes accusing them of being \u201cLeftist Traitors.\u201d Even if they succeed in keeping their coalition together, Netanyahu is going nowhere. He remains leader of Likud, Israel\u2019s largest party, and he\u2019s unlikely to give up that position. Although he\u2019s facing criminal charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust \u2013 all of which he has denied \u2013 his trial is expected to take years. And Israeli law would allow him to serve again as prime minister while the case is continuing. Nor is there any Likudnik on the horizon with anything coming close to his popularity, who can threaten to unseat him. What the real-life 'Oslo' tells us about the dream of Israeli-Palestinian peace As the leader of the opposition, with a considerable hardcore of fanatical supporters still intact, Netanyahu is sure to be daily plotting another comeback, awaiting any slip-up of his successor and exploiting discord in the unwieldy new coalition of wildly diverse and disparate parties. Yet another election \u2013 the fifth in two years \u2013 could be just around the corner and Netanyahu remains a constant campaigner, even at 71. Those who expect Netanyahu\u2019s stature and ability to dominate Israel\u2019s agenda to be severely diminished if he\u2019s pushed out of office could end up sorely disappointed. For many Israelis, Netanyahu will remain the king-in-exile, for years to come. And even if he never makes it back into the prime minister\u2019s office, his stamp on Israel will last for decades. For a start, the incoming government is comprised to a large degree by politicians he molded. Bennett began his public career as Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff and learned how to be a politician from him. Likewise, Netanyahu shaped many of the new government\u2019s senior members \u2013 Avigdor Lieberman, Ayelet Shaked, Gideon Sa\u2019ar, Zeev Elkin and others. They may have become his implacable rivals, but they were all his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s unlikely ever to fully emerge from his shadow. The Trump-Netanyahu bromance deepened American Jews' divide on Israel It\u2019s not just Israel\u2019s political class that has been imprinted by Netanyahu. In pursuit and perpetuation of his power, he has exploited every divide, between Jews and Arabs, religious and secular, Ashkenazi and Mizrahi, stoking historic resentments and playing communities off each other. It will take years, probably decades, for Israeli society to heal. Meanwhile he has done everything in his power to reverse any progress that was achieved by his predecessors on trying to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu refused to countenance any concessions to the Palestinians, insisting that time is working on Israel\u2019s side. His approach worked under the supportive Donald Trump administration, when four Arab countries were prepared to ignore the Palestinian issue and make peace with Israel, but more recently, tensions have once again exploded into violence in the latest bloody clash with Hamas in Gaza and riots on the streets of Israel. The new government is united only by the desire to replace Netanyahu. It\u2019s unlikely to be capable of agreeing of any policy going forward on resolving the conflict. Neither is the new government expected to make any radical changes to Israel\u2019s regional policy. It will continue to confront Iran\u2019s nuclear program and proxies, though it may be less vocal than Netanyahu was against the Iran nuclear deal if the Biden administration rejoins it.  Netanyahu\u2019s Israel is at war with itself and far from realizing any peace with its Palestinian neighbors. It will remain Netanyahu\u2019s Israel long after he is no longer its prime minister. Note: This column has been updated to include the news of Bennett being sworn in as Israel\u2019s new prime minister on June 13.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University and president of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. His most recent book is \u201cThe Ages of Globalization\u201d (Columbia University Press, 2020). The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion on CNN. The alarm bells are sounding for President Joe Biden\u2019s ambitious American Jobs Plan, which aims to rebuild the nation\u2019s aging infrastructure while preparing it for the demands of the 21st century. After weeks of seemingly endless bipartisan negotiations, it\u2019s time for Biden to give up and push through his plan on a party-line vote. At the start of Biden\u2019s presidency, I very much hoped for bipartisanship, but that hope was based on my expectation that the GOP would repudiate former President Donald Trump, defeated and disgraced after his botched handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the January 6 insurrection. Instead, the handful of Republicans who voted to impeach him for his role in the insurrection have been censured by their own state parties and/or are facing primaries from Trump loyalists next year. Too many Republican leaders would rather tear apart the country than admit that Trump lost the 2020 election. These profoundly cynical leaders seem to believe that their overriding economic aim \u2013 to enrich the wealthiest Americans who are their biggest donors \u2013 can succeed only by tacitly supporting Trump\u2019s lies and drafting legislation to suppress liberal voters. Though Biden is a true believer in collegiality and compromise, he must face the truth \u2013 the Republican Party is not committed to reaching a bipartisan deal. Sure, when Biden introduced his American Jobs Plan, the Republicans called for bipartisanship. But their counteroffer to the President\u2019s plan is a sham \u2013 based on three faulty premises.  First, their offer is simply a continuation of the status quo under a false headline. The Republicans announced that they would spend $928 billion on infrastructure over eight years. Yet only $257 billion of that offer would go toward funding new public works projects, as the rest was already budgeted in baseline transportation spending. That $257 billion is a pittance compared with the needs of the American people. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that the 10-year funding gap for surface transportation, water and wastewater, airports and seaports comes to $2.6 trillion, and that sum doesn\u2019t include digital infrastructure, retrofitting buildings and other capital improvements in the Biden infrastructure plan. The Republicans\u2019 proposal is, therefore, less than a tenth of our nation\u2019s estimated infrastructure needs. Second, the Republicans want to tax average Americans rather than the richest Americans to pay for the infrastructure plan. They have the audacity to criticize Biden\u2019s plan to tax corporations and the wealthiest Americans while saying that their plan would be paid for by \u201cuser fees,\u201d such as gasoline taxes, toll fees, and other charges, which would hit working-class Americans the hardest. So while Biden is trying to protect average Americans, the Republicans are trying to squeeze them. Third, the Republicans claim that Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan is too costly, would create a \u201cmassive tax increase\u201d and lead to generational debt. This is utter nonsense, argued by people who either cannot do basic arithmetic or, more likely, do not want average Americans to. On jobs, McConnell just doesn't get it. Biden does. The Biden plan, presented in detail in the 2022 fiscal year budget, would spend about $2.2 trillion over 10 years. (Though, in the context of negotiations, Biden has also offered a more limited package at $1.7 trillion.) The $2.2 trillion plan sounds like a lot when stated as a single number, but it\u2019s actually quite moderate and easily affordable. The US gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the nation\u2019s domestic output and income, is currently around $21.7 trillion. With economic growth and inflation, GDP will average around $28.2 trillion per year from fiscal years 2022 to 2031, or $282 trillion in total. The $2.2 trillion American Jobs Plan over 10 years is therefore only about 0.8% of GDP per year. Suppose that you are a family earning $100,000 per year. Would it be outrageous to spend an extra 0.8% of your income, or $800 per year, on capital upgrades of your property, including your electrical system, automobile, cable connection and home repairs? Clearly not. It\u2019s even more reasonable since Biden is proposing that it\u2019s the rich CEO living in the mansion behind the tall gates at the end of the street who should pay for the neighborhood\u2019s capital repairs, given that the corporate sector has gotten massive tax breaks over the years, culminating in the 2017 Trump tax giveaway, while your take-home pay has barely kept up with inflation. Corporate taxes as a share of GDP were 4.0% in 1960. After rounds of tax cuts, they were a minuscule 1.2% of GDP in 2020. Biden\u2019s plan calls for a partial reversal of the 2017 tax cuts and a minimum corporate tax to prevent companies from using tax havens and other tricks to avoid paying taxes altogether.  And the leaders of America\u2019s biggest companies certainly have some change to spare. Professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, specialists in income inequality, recently wrote in The Washington Post that the richest 400 Americans have a combined wealth equal to 18% of the US GDP. According to the Economic Policy Institute, CEO pay, which averaged 15 times the average worker earnings in 1965, was 320 times the average earnings as of 2019. So we have come to the crux of the matter. The Republican Party aims to serve a tiny coterie of the nation\u2019s wealthiest Americans. The public gets this. An overwhelming majority believes that the political system unfairly favors powerful interests. And, as recent polling shows, a majority of the American people support taxing corporations to pay for infrastructure needs. The US needs to move forward, and the President and Democrats in Congress need to lead. The time has come to pass the American Jobs Plan. A new generation of Republican politicians, no longer beholden to the richest Americans, will eventually follow \u2013 if they hope to regain the support of the people.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. If Postmaster General Louis DeJoy were working for a private business instead of a government agency, he\u2019d have been fired a long time ago. He doesn\u2019t deserve his job, which was a partisan gift that he is using to damage the very institution he runs \u2013 now and for years to come. On Tuesday, DeJoy unveiled his 10-year plan for the US Postal Service. The Washington Post said it would be \u201cthe largest rollback of consumer mail services in a generation,\u201d making them slower and more expensive. Some of the changes are both positive and overdue \u2013 expanding package-sorting, while scaling back the use of increasingly irrelevant mail-sorting machines, for example. Others, not at all. Under DeJoy\u2019s plan, first-class mail for items sent more than 930 miles, for one example, would travel cross-country on trucks instead of in airplanes, adding as many as two days to the trip. Postage costs will go up, and post offices will see their hours reduced. If that doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal, consider the small-business owners who rely on first-class mail to send important financial documents, or the low-income Americans with diabetes who pay to have their insulin delivered via the USPS. Higher postal costs and slower delivery are matters of financial solvency and physical health. DeJoy says his plan will save the Post Office by lowering both consumer expectations and costs.  But he is hardly a trustworthy messenger. Indeed, his appointment last June and his actions since then have turned a previously low-key position into another point of political polarization, and another lightning rod for Trump administration drama. DeJoy, a North Carolina businessman, was a prominent fundraiser for Donald Trump. And while he was not technically appointed by the former president (Postmasters General are never appointed by presidents) Trump had his finger on the scale. Tapped by a board of governors that had been stacked with Republicans and pressured by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, DeJoy had actually failed to make the list of hopefuls compiled by two far more neutral arbiters, executive search firms hired to recruit candidates. One Democrat on the board resigned out of frustration with the Trump administration\u2019s interference. Late-night hosts\u00a0react to new USPS truck design That dubious induction into the role only grew worse as the 2020 elections loomed \u2013 in the midst of a deadly pandemic. It was widely understood that a combination of pandemic accommodations made in voting laws and the danger of gathering indoors would mean record-setting numbers of Americans voting by mail. And yet in the months leading up to Election Day, DeJoy instituted cost-cutting measures that created longer delivery times for mail service, at the same time that the then-president was undermining public confidence in mail-in voting. Democrats wondered if DeJoy, himself a longtime Republican donor, had nefarious motives and called him up to testify on Capitol Hill, where he claimed that Democrats were pushing a \u201cfalse narrative.\u201d But a federal judge in Washington State disagreed, saying DeJoy\u2019s actions were \u201cpart of an effort by the current administration to use the Postal Service as a tool in partisan politics\u201d and that \u201cthe heart of DeJoy\u2019s and the Postal Service\u2019s actions is voter disenfranchisement.\u201d He ordered an immediate stop to the pre-election Post Office changes. DeJoy, for his part, apologized, and the election was carried out successfully. How are taxpayers supposed to trust that DeJoy has our best interests in mind and is not \u2013 cue the 2022 election race \u2013 trying to make it more difficult to exercise our right to vote? DeJoy has been in his role for less than a year and has courted nothing but controversy. His record as Postmaster General has been dreadful, marked by a series of agency failures and a decline in service that reached its nadir over the busy holiday season. While he apologized for the Post Office\u2019s slowed-down holiday service, he did not take personal responsibility, instead pointing to what he described as long-standing problems. The buck, it seems, does not stop with him \u2013 despite whatever failures have occurred on his watch. Sidney Powell's ridiculous defense in big lie case Consider that before DeJoy became Postmaster General, the Post Office was delivering upward of 90% of First Class mail on time. That declined to a low of 71% over the holidays, owing in large part to a combination of winter storms and a massive increase in demand, thanks to Covid-19 stay-at-home orders. But DeJoy isn\u2019t blameless: Since he took office, the Post Office has never again met that 90% delivery rate, even outside of the busy holiday season. That isn\u2019t to say that the Post Office doesn\u2019t have real problems. The agency carries $188.4 billion in liabilities; he says the next decade could bring $160 billion in additional liabilities  Service is certainly mixed, especially in crowded urban centers \u2013 I don\u2019t know a single New Yorker who hasn\u2019t experienced long lines and long waits, including during a pandemic that made crowding into a small space a significant health risk. There is no question that the Post Office needs help. But DeJoy has shown a shocking lack of regard for the agency, has alienated a significant chunk of the public and has failed to offer a path forward that does not diminish the service. The fact is, most Americans \u2013 at the moment \u2013 do not experience the postal service as an unmitigated disaster; it has long been one of the most popular government agencies in America. People want it to survive. But the numbers tell a striking story: ticking along as usual isn\u2019t working. The Post Office should not be a partisan agency, and is set up to avoid partisan spats \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s so egregious that DeJoy was put in the role in the first place, and it\u2019s the same reason President Joe Biden can\u2019t simply fire him. Only the board of governors that appointed DeJoy can fire him. But that doesn\u2019t mean there are no options. To begin with, Americans can demand that DeJoy resign. And Biden can remove members of the board of governors for cause, though that, too, runs the risk of being perceived as compounding the partisanship.  The most straightforward route involves the board removing DeJoy. Currently, there are three Republicans, one Democrat, and three open seats on the board; if the Senate confirms all of Biden\u2019s nominees to those open seats, then the board will have the power to remove DeJoy if he refuses to step down. Solving problems in a public institution requires broad  trust in the person in charge. The Trump administration hollowed out American confidence in government and in some of our most valued institutions. DeJoy is one of Trump\u2019s legacies. If we want to save the Post Office, then he needs to go.",

Conversations About Women, Leadership and Power\u201d and the founder of Feminist.com and What Will It Take Movements. At the onset of the pandemic, she created  COVID Gendered, a digital newsletter and online platform that looks at how this crisis is affecting women, girls and other marginalized communities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. One year later, the world is still struggling with the myriad ways it has impacted our lives and created hardship for so many \u2013 especially women and girls, Black, indigenous and people of color and other marginalized communities. In addition to the medical, economic and social devastation that the pandemic has caused \u2013 including the staggering loss of over 500,000 lives in the United States \u2013 throughout the year we have seen many alarming trends in the pandemic\u2019s effects on women and girls, all of which are exacerbated for women of color: spikes in domestic violence; a departure of more than 5.4 million women from the workforce due to layoffs or the challenge of caretaking with kids out of school; millions of girls being taken out of school worldwide; and 47 million more women being pushed into extreme poverty due to the economic fallout, according to estimates from the United Nations. Despite the challenges and inequities of the past year, we did still celebrate important milestones for women, which are worth noting as we celebrate Women\u2019s History Month: the historic election of Kamala Harris as the first woman, first Black and first South Asian vice president; the transformative impact of Black women organizers and voters; the efficacy in the handling of the pandemic by women-led countries; and the women heroes on the front lines of this pandemic \u2013 from healthcare and essential workers to caretakers and scientists at the forefront of vaccine development. At a time when the world is realizing the vital perspectives and leadership of women, which includes the long overdue recognition of the powerful and essential influence and leadership of women of color, now is the time to be proactive to ensure their rights are protected, their needs are met, and that they are supported during these challenging times. With this in mind, I reached out to a diverse selection of global women leaders, asking them to share their views on where we\u2019ve made progress in fighting the effects of the pandemic on women and girls, as well as where we need to focus our efforts. Although the pandemic has starkly laid bare the many cracks in our systems, it has also given us a unique opportunity to rebuild in more equitable and just ways \u2013 with women\u2019s leadership at the helm, which would benefit us all across many divides. The ongoing story of women\u2019s history is being created every day and depends on what we do now, collectively, in every moment. As Michelle Nunn, president of international humanitarian organization CARE, put it: \u201cAs we move forward, we must respond to the acute needs of women and girls, but we must also invest in them as leaders for our recovery and re-building.\u201d Here is what she and other women leaders had to say: At the start of the pandemic, it became clear immediately that women were going to do what needed to be done, and that\u2019s show up for our elders, our families and each other. We saw this within our own communities of survivors of sexual violence. We pivoted to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and expanded our catalogue of healing resources. The mental, emotional and financial cost of being a survivor was high before the pandemic, and we knew that the disparities would widen along the lines of gender, race and class. \u201cIdentifying The Economic Impact of COVID-19 on Survivors of Color\u201d \u2013 a joint report we co-published in November with FreeFrom and a brilliant team of researchers \u2013 confirmed that survivors of color are especially at risk of facing pronounced food and housing insecurity during this pandemic. In addition, they are more likely to experience financial insecurity, are at greater risk than White survivors of halting their education and have the greatest risk of falling behind on multiple bills. Even as we see cases fall and the number of vaccinations rise, these findings still ring a loud and serious alarm. We need a series of actions that will repair the damage and move us forward. This includes addressing economic abuse in the Violence Against Women Act; creating paid and protected leave for survivors; building capacity by supporting survivor-led initiatives to end sexual violence and investing in housing, health care, child care and programs that prioritize both cisgender and transgender women and girls. Survivors will always find a way to show up and advocate for one another \u2013 that is how our movement began \u2013 but if we want to heal as a nation, we need elected leaders and public officials to show up for us, too. Tarana Burke is the founder and executive director of me too. International, a global movement working toward eradicating sexual violence by shifting culture, policies and institutions. A year after Covid-19 was declared a pandemic, hope is finally on the horizon as hundreds of millions of safe, effective vaccines reach people\u2019s arms. But not everyone is seeing the glimmers of a better tomorrow. This disease, like so many others, has exploited pre-existing inequalities \u2013 particularly when it comes to gender. In the US and around the world, women have been disproportionately harmed by the pandemic\u2019s social and economic impacts. In one year, decades of progress toward gender equality were erased. But in addition to exploiting old inequalities, the pandemic is also creating new ones. Right now, vaccines are reaching people in high-income countries much faster than people in low-income countries. The UN reported last month that more than 130 countries still hadn\u2019t received a single vaccine dose. As long as the pandemic goes on, it will continue to devastate women\u2019s lives. And the pandemic won\u2019t be over until it\u2019s over for everyone, everywhere. The hard-won gains we\u2019ve made against Covid-19 would not be possible without the heroic work of health care workers around the world, 70% of whom are women. During Women\u2019s History Month, we can honor these women on the front lines by coming together as a world to insist people everywhere \u2013 regardless of who they are, where they live, or what they can afford to pay \u2013 have access to vaccines. Melinda Gates is co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, founder of Pivotal Ventures, and best-selling author of \u201cThe Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World.\u201d We know that the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic will be felt in communities of color long after vaccines have been distributed and the disease itself is under control. We have seen increases in unemployment, evictions and suicides, and we know that it\u2019s largely because the pandemic has exacerbated existing societal inequalities and amplified systemic failures. This is even more true with a gender lens, and for the experiences of women and girls in communities of color during the pandemic. Despite the amazing achievement of having more women in political and community leadership than ever across the country, which gives us plenty of hope, there is still work to be done. As a society, we have not made women and girls a priority, and that\u2019s become clear during this pandemic. A recent study by feminist humanitarian organization VOICE found that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to alarming increases in domestic and sexual violence. Women and girls have been burdened with more childcare responsibilities, and we have disproportionately lost our jobs and access to healthcare. As we work to contain the virus and speed the recovery of the economy, it is imperative that we prioritize the needs of women and girls. We must make sure that their access to critical resources for health and wellness, as well as their access to employment, stays free and unrestricted. Opal Tometi is co-founder of #BlackLivesMatter and founder of the new media and advocacy hub, Diaspora Rising. Indigenous women are key leaders in their communities and in the world because of our cultural foundation of holistic and collective problem solving. Indigenous women organized during the pandemic as we often have to protect our sisters, family, region and Mother Earth. Yet we continue to fight for visibility and resources. Further investment in this narrative and healing work is essential to all of us. We funded traditional helpers and healers because we understand that in a post-Covid world, those that safeguard and sustainably cultivate our traditional medicines like elderberry, nettle and wild bergamot will be critical to ensuring collective healing in the future. During the pandemic, indigenous women built healing and distribution centers, as well as registered voters changing the tide for leadership in America. Our fellow Allie Young, co-founder of Protect The Sacred, distributed personal protective equipment with the nonprofit group CORE and supported voter registration efforts across the Navajo Nation spanning across New Mexico and Arizona. Allie also organized Ride to the Polls, which was a group of young voters on horseback riding to polling stations. Navajo Nation had historic voter turnout in 2020. The pandemic shed light on systemic racism in health care systems, justice systems and states where mask mandates were not enforced. Movement leaders and allies following the death of George Floyd lifted up their indigenous brothers and sisters by stating, \u201cBlack and Indigenous\u201d over and over, educating the world on the systemic racism in the justice system. We are supporting one another because we understand that standing in allyship makes us stronger. Sarah Eagle Heart is the co-CEO of the Return to the Heart Foundation, an indigenous-led grantmaking organization. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, women have been on the frontlines of the battle to defeat it, and as a result, have been more likely to be exposed to the virus. Globally, 70% of health care workers are female, as are the majority of health facility staff. In Latin America and the Caribbean, nine out of 10 nurses are women. But despite their vital contributions, women are under-recognized and under-represented in positions of leadership. About one quarter of the health ministers in Latin America and the Caribbean are female, and only 25% of executive positions in hospitals are held by women. An estimated 1% of global leaders are women and 14% are parliamentarians. Governments must take bold actions to transform systemic gender inequalities and strengthen health systems with a gender perspective. They must place the care economy at the center of recovery and ensure women\u2019s leadership across society. The rights, health and well-being of women must be at the core of our public health actions. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health Organization (WHO)  has long championed the essential role of gender equality in determining health and social protection. It is time to challenge the entrenched gender norms and inequality that have held women back. Now more than ever, women\u2019s leadership is essential to recover from Covid-19 and rebuild a sustainable and healthy future. Dr. Carissa F. Etienne is the director of the PAHO and regional director for the Americas of the WHO. Mothers are getting crushed in this pandemic. The last year has shown that when structures like school and childcare come crumbling down, it\u2019s moms who are left holding the bag. We are the ones being asked to juggle Zoom school, housework and caregiving with full-time jobs. We have sacrificed our sleep and deferred our dreams. Individually, our mental health is suffering: Many of us have gone from hanging on by a thread to free falling. I read a statistic recently that gave me chills: During the pandemic, there has been a 41% increase in heavy drinking by women. That means more than four drinks in one sitting. The same study from RAND showed only a 7% increase among men. Nationally, our hard-fought gains toward gender parity have vanished. More than 30 years of progress in women\u2019s labor force participation have been erased overnight. Millions of us have been pushed out of the workforce, either because we lost our jobs or our circumstances made it impossible for us to keep them. The latest jobs report shows that it is women of color who have been hit the hardest. Our paid labor at work has been replaced by unseen, unpaid labor at home. A woman who used to work with us at Girls Who Code, Loraya Harrington-Trujillo, is one of these moms. She recently chose \u2013 if you can call it a choice \u2013 to leave a job she loved at a tech startup. At the start of the pandemic, she was keeping her head just barely above water, working remotely while caring for two kids under 5 and elderly parents who live with her. Her father has Parkinson\u2019s disease, and her mother was his primary caregiver. But when kindergarten started up for her oldest at a school where pandemic-impacted scheduling kept changing at the last minute, the combination of that unpredictability and her mom getting sick, too, pushed her over the edge. No amount of flexibility offered at work could change that she had more than a full-time job on her hands at home. And only she could do it. For too long moms have been treated as America\u2019s safety net. And we collectively say no more. As we build America back better, we demand that we build motherhood back better: By making it possible for us to work and have kids. By ensuring we have jobs to go back to. By valuing our work both in and outside the home, once and for all. That is why we need a Marshall Plan for Moms, a 360-degree plan that gets women back to work, not in a few decades but a few months. It is a growing movement that calls for direct payments to moms; passing legislation like paid leave, affordable childcare and pay equity; retraining programs to ensure women can fill the jobs that exist and safely reopening schools five days a week. A national crisis requires bold solutions, and that is what the Marshall Plan for Moms is all about. Reshma Saujani is the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, an international nonprofit organization working to close the gender gap in technology while teaching girls confidence and bravery through coding, and the founder of the Marshall Plans for Moms movement. Women\u2019s History Month traditionally celebrates all that women have done \u2013 past tense \u2013 but this year we are celebrating all that women continue to do. In the last year, women \u2013 especially women of color \u2013 have shown up for us as essential workers, as voters, as caregivers and beyond. We\u2019ve seen how women fuel our country and yet, we\u2019ve also witnessed that when their collective well-being is an afterthought, all of us are harmed. No one prospers when states escalate attacks on reproductive freedom, or when institutions from our schools to the media continue to fail survivors of sexual violence. Our entire nation suffers deeply when women are forced out of work and not paid equally, and when our care infrastructure collapses. The last year has been a case study of what happens to the country when women are constantly forced to prove our individual resilience and our perseverance in the face of adversity \u2013 enough is enough. We need future-forward policies, laws and culture change that lead us into safety, security, dignity and freedom. Fatima Goss Graves is the president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which fights for gender justice in courts, public policy and society, and cofounder of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund. On International Women\u2019s Day, President Joe Biden signed an executive order establishing the White House Gender Policy Council to ensure that the policies of the Biden-Harris administration rest on a foundation of dignity and equity for women. This is not just a council. It is a government-wide commitment to gender equity, which is needed more now than ever before. Women everywhere are bearing the brunt of the pandemic. And, as is so often the case, Covid-19 is hitting the poorest and most marginalized women the hardest. In the US, more than 30 years of progress in labor force participation has been eviscerated. Women, who already shouldered a disproportionate share of caregiving responsibilities, are taking on even more, filling in as teachers and childcare providers and caring for sick and aging loved ones. Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law Thursday, which will bring immediate relief to American women and their families. The plan will provide vital economic relief by providing $1,400 checks to 85% of households and make transformative investments that will lift 11 million people out of poverty. It will also make a historic expansion of the child tax credit that will benefit 66 million kids across the country and cut child poverty in half. The plan further helps working families who are having to juggle childcare and work by providing the necessary resources to safely reopen our schools. In the weeks to come, the administration will lay out additional plans to build back better \u2013 to remedy longstanding barriers so that our economy works for everyone. Jennifer Klein is a co-chair of the White House Gender Policy Council. After more than a year, there is no escaping the impacts of Covid-19 on our communities. And without question, around the world, this pandemic has only exacerbated the social and economic inequities facing the most vulnerable and marginalized among us, most often women and girls. CARE, the international humanitarian organization I lead, is continuing to provide the basics to stop the spread by building water stations, providing hygiene kits and empowering millions of women to share accurate public health information through our village savings program. Critically, we are combating the secondary effects of the pandemic that hit women and girls hardest, like job loss and hunger. Sadly, we know for every month of lockdown, we can expect about five million more cases of gender-based violence. Data also shows more girls entering child marriage and dropping out of school. CARE is now mobilizing for a fast and fair vaccine distribution. Our goal is to help vaccinate 100 million people starting with 275,000 health care workers, 70% of whom are women. It is our strong belief that none of us are safe until all of us are safe. As we move forward, we must respond to the acute needs of women and girls, but we must also invest in them as leaders for our recovery and re-building. Investing in women and girls is not just the right thing to do; it is the best and most pragmatic way to advance human development and security\u202faround the world. This transformational moment calls upon us to not only continue to advance gender equality, but to accelerate it. Michelle Nunn is the president and CEO of CARE USA, an international development organization that works around the world to save lives, defeat poverty, and achieve social justice. Although the pandemic did not create the social, financial and political inequalities that define life for Black women, it laid bare intersectional oppression more drastically than any moment in recent history. And as the African American Policy Forum\u2019s \u201cUnder The Blacklight\u201d series has made abundantly clear, the virus posed a disproportionate and deadly threat to Black women and girls. After all, in a country whose systems are fundamentally defined by racism and White supremacy, Black womanhood itself becomes a pre-existing condition. Cases like that of Dr. Susan Moore expose the stark precarity of Black women\u2019s lives in America. Dr. Moore \u2013 a Black physician \u2013 recognized in real time the discrimination she faced, advocated for the remedies that could have saved her life and exposed the failures in her care to a national audience. Still, days later, she became another of the nearly 80,000 Black Americans who died from the virus in the past year. The fact that Black people are twice as likely to die of Covid-19 than their White counterparts should be an alarm that vaccine rollout and public health systems must be re-imagined and designed to address. In a year of so much tragedy, I gain some optimism from the fact that our collective consciousness is now anchored in outrage from the lives we have lost. And from that outrage, we can begin to build back \u2013 not just \u201cbetter,\u201d but otherwise. Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw is the co-founder and executive director of the African American Policy Forum, professor of Law at UCLA and Columbia, and host of the podcast Intersectionality Matters!. Within this pandemic, and the global economic crisis it\u2019s caused, there is a separate crisis for women that threatens to set back all the gains women have made going back decades. Women were already paying a higher price than men for our culture of stress and burnout, but now there is an even more urgent need to address the deepening gender inequality. I am hopeful because the depth of this crisis is forcing an acknowledgment that a return to \u201cnormal\u201d is not enough. The pandemic is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine how we integrate work and life to create a more equitable and inclusive culture. At Thrive Global, we\u2019re partnering with companies to do just that with our Working Families program, a work-life integration solution that creates more harmony, more equity and less stress both at home and at work for working women and mothers. Right now too many women feel like they\u2019re being forced to choose between being successful in their careers and successful in their roles at home. Getting the economy running again isn\u2019t enough. Our new normal has to be a better normal for women \u2013 and the generations of girls who will rise to be our future leaders. Arianna Huffington is the founder and CEO of Thrive Global, whose mission is to end the stress and burnout epidemic and unlock human potential. Unfortunately, we have not made significant progress at fighting the effects of the pandemic on women and girls. Despite modest job gains in February, women are still down more than five million jobs since the start of the pandemic. Because women are often the primary caregiver in families, schools and daycare closures have hit them particularly hard, forcing them to leave the workforce. To chart a path for women and a full recovery, we must first get the pandemic under control, reopen schools and then get women back to work. For women who will not be able to re-enter the workforce because of caretaking responsibilities or the lack of available jobs, we must ensure that they have continued economic support. And for those women who will not be able to return to their former jobs, we should invest in education and training for jobs and sectors with higher wages and upward mobility opportunities. Other key investments for women to ensure they can re-enter the workforce and sustain employment include childcare and paid sick leave. C. Nicole Mason, PhD is the president and CEO of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that engages in research and dissemination to shape public policy and improve the lives and opportunities of women from diverse backgrounds. The pandemic was a crisis within a crisis for women in the US. Women were immediately forced to make impossible choices, and it revealed just how much \u2013 absent a real infrastructure to support our caregiving responsibilities \u2013 we were holding it all together by a thread. When care workers are underpaid, without benefits like paid sick leave, and unprotected at work, the care economy is in crisis: And that was before the public health crisis shut down our child care centers, schools and nursing homes. Our care workforce \u2013 disproportionately composed of Black and other women of color, including many immigrant women \u2013 continues to support us through the pandemic without access to a safety net or decent wages, while their own families need them too. What gives me hope is that as we rebuild the economy out of the worst economic crisis of our lifetime, we have the opportunity to rebuild the care infrastructure, from unjust systems that have devalued women, especially Black women, to one that puts their safety and well-being front and center. Our society and economy have been built on the contributions of women: paid and unpaid, visible and invisible. We have the chance now to build a care economy that recognizes all of that work and supports all of our families, with quality jobs for care workers, too. Ai-jen Poo is executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, director of Caring Across Generations and a co-founder of Supermajority, a women\u2019s equality organization made up of women from all backgrounds, races and ages. During the pandemic we have seen incredible innovation and ingenuity in the way that women\u2019s funds and gender equity funders have addressed both the urgent needs of their local communities as well as investing in long-term policy solutions. Women\u2019s funds are not only hyper local, but they are also part of an ecosystem that includes national and global foundations working together through a dynamic network. They are uniquely positioned as both philanthropic institutions and advocacy organizations. Over the past year, this design allowed women\u2019s funds to move money up to nine months faster than traditional philanthropy to where people were hurting most. They were also able to shape policy and funding recommendations to effectively address the challenges of a post-Covid reality, like securing private-public support for workforce flexibility, universal access to high-quality, affordable childcare and early childhood education. While we remain hopeful that the demonstrable impact the women\u2019s funding sector has had on the lives of women and their communities during the pandemic will trigger long overdue investment in solutions led by marginalized genders. With the vaccine rollout, we are already hearing clamor to return to status quo. And the status quo is killing us. We know that Black, Latina and Native American women tend to have higher rates of pre-existing conditions that are associated with increased risk for severe cases of Covid-19, compounded by the lack of health insurance and higher rates of poverty. We must do better. We must invest in women- and girls-of-color-led efforts that address the complexity of their lives. We must remember that single issue solutions are fragile. Now is the time to build something that lasts. Now is the time to invest in women\u2019s funds and the women\u2019s funding sector. The roadmap to recovery must include racial and gender transformative policymaking. The only way to respond and rebound effectively from the Covid-19 crisis is to ensure women are heard and empowered to design and implement programs and policies that are mapping an inclusive economy built on racial and gender equity and justice. Elizabeth Barajas-Rom\u00e1n is the president & CEO of the Women\u2019s Funding Network, a philanthropic network of more than 120 women\u2019s funds and foundations devoted to gender equity and justice. Many women were hanging by a thread before the pandemic, in no small part due to decades of insufficient investment in our care infrastructure, and now that thread is unraveling altogether. In fact, since the pandemic began, women \u2013 particularly moms and women of color \u2013 lost nearly 1 million more jobs than men. This puts women\u2019s labor force participation at a 30-year low, with more than a quarter of women aged 25 to 44 pushed out of the labor force because they are without access to affordable childcare. This has been a huge setback for families, for gender and racial equity, for businesses, for our economy and our country. Families like Jessica\u2019s, in Hawaii, are trying to make ends meet. Jessica lost her small business after her kids\u2019 childcare closed. She then got her real estate license so she could return to the workforce; but she still couldn\u2019t find affordable child care. Her family has depleted their savings and is relying on SNAP. Tami in Kansas was forced to take unpaid leave during the pandemic to recover from open heart surgery. She returned to work but soon after had to take more unpaid leave when her children\u2019s schools closed. Now more than ever, we are all realizing just how important moms are to the economy; that\u2019s why Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently raised the importance of finally building a care infrastructure to lift our economy, like other industrialized nations have done. There\u2019s no time to waste. This is a time of tremendous urgency but also of hope: We can finally build a care infrastructure that spans generations to lift our families and economy, including universal paid family/medical leave, universal childcare, universal long-term care, and raise the minimum wage. These policies would help address the extreme emergency that many women, moms and families are facing \u2013 especially Black, indigenous, people of color moms who are experiencing compounded health and economic harms \u2013 and also help us build a future toward fair wages for everyone. We can, and we must, build bridges to opportunity and create avenues for everyone to thrive. Some of those bridges to opportunity are being built right now with this week\u2019s passage of the American Rescue Plan, which will significantly lift families and the economy and is a great start toward the transformational, permanent and universal change we need. It\u2019s time to address the foundational values and systems we\u2019ve neglected building for far too long. Now is the time to get this important work done. Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner is the executive director/CEO and co-founder of MomsRising, a million-member organization that takes on the most critical issues facing women, mothers and families by educating the public and mobilizing massive grassroots actions. Our work is to help support and elevate migrant women. So many migrant women in our nation have been deemed essential. They have put their lives on the line to keep this country running, and their sacrifice has not been met with the protections they deserve. Aside from the real danger they face during this crisis from the possibility of contracting and dying from Covid-19, they have also shouldered the fear of being among the hundreds of thousands of women who have lost their jobs. There is no safety net to catch these women. Missing work means the inability to sustain their families. Migrant women are experiencing both the risks of being essential workers and the challenges of high unemployment rates, becoming more vulnerable to different forms of violence and to the difficulties of meeting basic needs. Amidst these challenges, however, I also have hope. Women are organizing and building power together to create a world that invests in and listens to migrant women, women of color and their families. We must follow their lead: the lead of the women and girls who may not be visible to some, including the Latinx women, Black and indigenous women in rural America. If we do this, our country stands the chance of seeing real transformative change as we rebuild from this pandemic. M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez is the founder and president of Justice for Migrant Women, co-founder of The LatinxHouse and founding principal of She Se Puede.  When hurricanes ravaged Central America in the midst of pandemic last November, indigenous women there sprang into action, distributing food and medical supplies and sheltering those who lost their homes in the storms. But they didn\u2019t stop there. They used that process of aid delivery to strengthen the community for the long-term, leveraging their credibility as first responders to bring their communities\u2019 demands to local government. This model for saving lives and transforming communities will put us on a path to the future we need as we strategize how to end and recover from this pandemic. One of the greatest lessons of global feminist organizing \u2013 that we all need to embrace now \u2013 is the need to put care at the heart of everything we do as a society. To ensure this phase of our pandemic response reflects the reality of interconnection across borders, we need to reject nationalistic impulses that hoard medical breakthroughs for the wealthiest countries and insist on an international vaccine distribution to keep all people healthy, no matter where they live. Surviving the next pandemic also means enacting long-needed policies now, like universal health care, child care and parental leave here at home. We need to robustly increase resources for international aid and health systems, and for the caregivers \u2013 largely women and girls \u2013 who sustain communities worldwide. We need to treat the pandemic not as a one-time emergency that will soon be behind us, but as a wake-up call to cultivate the resilience we need for the future. Yifat Susskind is the executive director of MADRE, an international human rights organization and women\u2019s fund that partners with community-based, women-led organizations on the frontlines of war, climate breakdown and their aftermath. With Covid-19 we saw a total breakdown of economic support and lack of a social safety net by the government, but we also saw philanthropy respond quickly to significantly increase and distribute funding to help communities meet essential needs such as housing and food. However, it\u2019s still not nearly enough. The pandemic shone a light on so many of the injustices and inequalities that we have in our society, and it\u2019s critically important to recognize that women have been disproportionately impacted. In particular, women of color and women of low-income are too often underpaid and undervalued; yet they are the very people holding our society together, on the frontlines of our public health crisis and heading households. There\u2019s an estimated 65 million women and girls of color in the US, and total philanthropic giving is about $5.48 for each woman or girl of color. In 2018, this accounted for just 0.005% of the $66.9 billion given by foundations. There is hope and opportunity in investing in women. Be as committed as we are in supporting grantee partners such as The MS Black Women\u2019s Roundtable, value and fund organizations by and for women and girls of the color that are leading and are at work in every part of this country to create a more just society for all. Teresa C. Younger is the president & CEO of the Ms. Foundation for Women, whose mission is to build women\u2019s collective power in the US to advance equity and justice for all.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Robert M. Franklin is the James T. and Berta R. Laney Professor in Moral Leadership at Emory University\u2019s Candler School of Theology. He is the author of \u201cMoral Leadership: Integrity, Courage, Imagination.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN. For the past several years I have served as a pastor in Trump country. I have listened to the public and private fears, hopes and stories of those who feel unheard, ignored and scorned by America\u2019s elites in both political parties. While living in predominately White upstate New York and Western Pennsylvania, I commuted regularly to Atlanta, home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and an influential Back middle class, that is reshaping \u201cthe blackest city in America,\u201d as \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedian Michael Che calls it. As senior pastor of the historic Chautauqua Institution and as former president of Morehouse College, I have been able to feel the pulse of these two Americas side by side. Let me share some of the home remedies I have tried and tested in recent years. Just in case it may help my neighbors \u2013 all of them. Let us encourage a new etiquette for civic life that is rooted in respect, restraint, humility and humor. Let us remember that our ancestors are watching us. Since we are not yet ready or willing to heal our deepest wounds or repent the harshest damage done by our injustice, there are some things that patriotic Americans can undertake now to reduce the tension, volume and heartburn in the country. Ordinary people can do these things, but they will have greater impact if all of our leaders in politics, business, religion, education, healthcare and the arts join in to do likewise. In fact, I am asking for more. Let our leaders behave like moral leaders. Moral leaders are people who invite us to become better, truer versions of ourselves, while holding us accountable for the fruits of our action. So what can each of us do now, today? What 'unity' really means in America 1. Reset the national tone. In recent years, we have come to expect our national discourse to be loud, harsh and impatient. It\u2019s time to set a new, constructive and creative tone at the top. Even if we have little or no appetite for moral rhetoric right now, we can all help to improve our habits of communications. Leaders from different sectors report that among the things we need most now are true stories of diverse Americans working together. 2. Restore respect for facts, evidence and science. When you read or hear a statement, ask critical questions about its sources and their veracity and reliability. President John Adams, America\u2019s second president, said, \u201cFacts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\u201d 3. Affirm leaders who are courageous, competent and demonstrate integrity. We are a nation in desperate need of profiles in courage. Only integrity and public accountability can restore and inspire trust. Leaders who do the right thing have been badly treated of late. But the entire nation should be proud of people like Georgia\u2019s voting systems manager, Gabriel Sterling, who pleaded for sanity and peace while affirming the accuracy and trustworthiness of state election results and recounts. And, Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming\u2019s lone member of the House of Representatives, spoke out as one of a few Republicans who condemned President Donald Trump\u2019s irresponsible behavior on January 6. Let\u2019s make it safe for such leaders to tell the truth with a clear conscience and respect for common decency. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy demands truth before unity 4. Restrain from taking cynical cheap shots at others who are honestly trying to improve our society. In the months ahead we will hear plenty of platitudes from every partisan angle. When you hear them holding forth, take a deep breath, and dare to whisper, \u201cforgive them for they know not what they say.\u201d A cynic is a person \u201cwho knows the price of everything and the value of nothing,\u201d as Oscar Wilde noted. It\u2019s time to put the value of our country above the price of partisan power for its own sake. 5. Begin every difficult conversation with humility and humor. It may help to say something positive about your opponent before you dive into the honest debate to follow. Consider sharing something about yourself that releases a little hot air from the bright balloon of vanity. Great leaders like John F. Kennedy, Joseph Lowery, and others practiced the art of self-deprecation to good effect. 6. Be generous to strangers. As the speeches during Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and remarks elsewhere begin to flow and voices rise, instead of dismissing them outright or pigeon-holing them as radical or reactionary, racist or elitist, socialist or fascist, cut them a little slack. Imagine how and why those views may ring true to their experience. They may be trying their best to find answers to problems we have not faced. Put on charity, urges the Apostle Paul. The ancient philosopher Philo advises, \u201cBe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great struggle.\u201d 7. Educate yourself about the experience of others who are different. There are a lot of great books out there to help with this. Create or join a book club to inform your intuitions and share your insights. Before calling names or cursing enemies, read a good book out there by or about a sister or brother from \u201canother planet,\u201d a cultural conservative or liberal, a voice raised from the Black Lives Matter movement or from an evangelical pulpit. Trying out these simple practices may foster the manners and morals of a civic life rooted in mutual respect and restraint. Living in two very different communities taught me patience, empathy and respect for the good and decent people in both places.  Many of my neighbors in Trump country were striving and struggling to live up to the dreams of their parents, grandparents and ancestors. Some may judge that no cause for a sense of entitlement or grievance, anger or despair. But, in fact, the real wages of non-college hourly wage workers have not matched the cost of living for decades, growing at a slow speed. They are falling behind, and they feel the loss of broken dreams and the bite of personal failure as well as the pinch of economic hardship.  Many voted for former President Barack Obama, then Trump. Now they hope and pray that government, no matter who is president, will provide good jobs and living wages for all Americans. My neighbors in Atlanta, or what many have called \u201cStacey Abrams country,\u201d were offended by the duplicity and hypocrisy in the policing we saw on Capitol Hill compared to Black Lives Matter rallies. These parents want their kids who exercise their First Amendment rights to free speech and lawful assembly in peaceful protest to return home no less safely than Capitol Hill protesters who refrained from riot or assault. Many echo the frustration captured in the 1988 rap classic album by Public Enemy, \u201cIt takes a nation of millions to hold us back.\u201d They hope we can all come to recognize their patriotism and love of country, and to heed their voices and vision, not only to give them a fair shake under the law and a fair slice of the economic pie. According to \u201cHidden Tribes,\u201d a 2018 report on political polarization in America, some 77% of Americans \u201cbelieve that our differences aren\u2019t so great that we can\u2019t come together.\u201d Our fellow citizens on the far left and right may never come together, but I know that most people across this land do not want to hate each other. My neighbors in Atlanta and in Chautauqua share lots of common ground. They can come together. I want them to know that. I hope that Mr. Biden and a new Congress will keep this aim in mind and lead us to keep our promise to form a more perfect union. The future of American democracy depends on it.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Bernie Sanders, an Independent who caucuses with the Democrats, is the junior US senator from Vermont. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN. The headlines dominating the news understandably deal with the outrageous behavior of President Donald Trump and the attempted coup he inspired at our nation\u2019s Capitol. Yes, it was important for the House of Representatives to impeach Trump. Yes, the Senate must convict him. No president, now or in the future, can lead an insurrection against the United States government and get away with it. But as enormously important as that is, we must not lose sight of the pain and anxiety of millions of working families all over this country, as they suffer through the worst public health and economic crises in the modern history of our country. In fact, many working families are facing more economic desperation today than any time since the Great Depression. As a result of the pandemic, tens of millions of our fellow citizens have lost their jobs and incomes. Hunger is at its highest level in decades, and 40 million could be on the brink of eviction when the federal moratorium expires at the end of January.  While more than 24 million people in our country have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus, tens of millions of Americans are uninsured or under-insured. Amid so much economic suffering and despair, when many Americans have lost faith in their government \u2013 and when millions are prepared to accept lies about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election \u2013 it is imperative that Democrats pass a bold and aggressive economic agenda within the first 100 days of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Now is not the time to think small. It is the time to think big and to restore faith among working families \u2013 Black, White, Latino, Asian American and Native American \u2013 that in a democratic society, government can respond to their needs. Joe Biden's Ronald Reagan problem Failure to adequately respond to the economic desperation in America today will undermine the Biden administration and likely lead Democrats to lose their thin majorities in the US House of Representatives and US Senate in 2022. Democrats suffered significant loses in 1994, two years after President Bill Clinton\u2019s victory \u2013 and, in 2010, two years after President Barack Obama\u2019s victory. We must not repeat those mistakes. The danger we face would not be in going too big or spending too much but in going too small and leaving the needs of the American people behind. If Republicans would like to work with us, we should welcome them. But their support is not necessary. In 2010, Sen. Mitch McConnell was willing to sabotage the economy to advantage Republicans, doing everything he could to make Obama a \u201cone-term president.\u201d We cannot let him play the same games again. The Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold to pass major legislation has become an excuse for inaction. But let\u2019s be clear: We have the tools to overcome these procedural hurdles. As incoming Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I will use a process known as budget reconciliation that will allow us to pass comprehensive legislation with only 51 votes. This is not a radical idea. When the Republicans controlled the Senate during the George W. Bush and Trump presidencies, they used reconciliation to pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations. They also used reconciliation to try and repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. Today, Democrats must use this same process to lift Americans out of poverty, increase wages and create good-paying jobs. The world has more riding on Joe Biden than any US president in decades First, we must increase the direct payments passed by Congress in December from $600 to $2,000 for every working-class adult and their children. On this issue, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, several Republicans in the House and the Senate and undoubtedly millions of struggling Americans \u2013 who wanted more stimulus in December \u2013would agree. But given the enormous crises facing the country, that is not enough. Through reconciliation, we must pass a major Covid-relief package that expands emergency unemployment benefits to $600 a week, provides aid to state and local governments to prevent mass layoffs, enacts hazard pay for frontline workers, saves the US Postal Service, addresses the crisis of homelessness and ensures that no one in America goes hungry or is evicted. During the crisis, we must provide emergency health care to all by requiring Medicare to pay the medical bills of the uninsured and under-insured. We must fully fund Covid-19 testing, tracing and vaccine distribution.  At a time when our primary care health care system is faltering, and when millions have no medical home, we must also substantially increase funding for community health centers and the National Health Service Corps, which provides scholarships and forgive student debt of medical professionals who agree to work in underserved areas. Biden's ambitious 100-day plan to erase Trump's legacy Through reconciliation, we must make sure that unemployment benefits during this crisis period are not taxable so that workers don\u2019t get hit with a huge tax bill they didn\u2019t expect on April 15. Moreover, we need to create millions of good paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure \u2013 our roads, bridges, sidewalks, schools, water systems and affordable housing. Further, as we lead the world in combating the existential threat of climate change, we can create millions more jobs by making massive investments in wind, solar, geothermal, electric vehicles, weatherization and energy storage. We must guarantee at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave and end the international embarrassment of the United States as the only high-income nation that fails to provide paid maternity leave. In order to address our dysfunctional early childhood education system, we must provide universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old in the country and greatly expand childcare. And, if we are to have the best-educated workforce in the world, we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and cancel all student debt for working-class Americans.  As we do all these things, we can use the reconciliation process to substantially lower the outrageous cost of prescription drugs and raise the minimum wage to $15. Not only would these provisions improve life for millions, they would save the federal government hundreds of billions. In this extraordinarily difficult moment, poll after poll has shown that the American people want government to respond aggressively to address the crises they face. The job of Congress now is to listen to the American people, move our country boldly forward on a path to economic success and show voters that Democrats are prepared to do everything possible to improve their lives. This is an unprecedented moment in American history. We must act in an unprecedented way.",

            "article_content": "A new Texas law aimed at restricting discussions of race and history in schools has some educators second guessing themselves and forgoing civics-related activities to avoid running afoul of it. HB3979, one of the legislative efforts to ban critical race theory in American classrooms, went into effect Wednesday as schools in the Lone Star State continue to be embroiled in debates over mask mandates. While some school districts are waiting for official guidance on what the law means for them, others are making curriculum changes \u201cout of caution.\u201d The law states that social studies teachers can\u2019t \u201crequire\u201d or include in their courses, the concept that \u201cone race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex\u201d or the concept that \u201can individual, by virtue of the individual\u2019s race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.\u201d It also notes that \u201ca teacher may not be compelled to discuss a particular current event or widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.\u201d Teachers, according to the bill, can\u2019t require or give extra credit for a student\u2019s political activism. CNN spoke to nearly two dozen school districts across the state of Texas about how HB 3979 already was impacting their plans for the school year. In College Station, some government teachers won\u2019t be asking students to take notes at city public meetings for a grade. Elementary school students in Leander won\u2019t be asking students to write letters addressing lawmakers anymore. In Keller, some resources offered online to students, including ebooks and news articles have been temporarily removed. They were forced to repeat first grade three times in the 1950s. Soon, Texas students might not even know about them Officials at a school district about 30 miles north of Dallas decided to stop offering course credit to middle school students participating in a renowned nationwide civil engagement program \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d The change was first reported by the Texas Tribune. For the past couple of years, students in two middle schools at the McKinney Independent School District were enrolled in an elective course that allowed them to spend several days a week researching and writing legislative bills that could fix issues in their communities. They would then present and debate their bills in a mock legislature and election process organized by the YMCA\u2019s Youth and Government program. After HB3979 passed this summer, school officials decided the schools should only offer the Youth and Government program as an extracurricular activity as five other campuses in the district have been doing, said Cody Cunningham, the district\u2019s chief communications officer. \u201cThe decision was made based upon legal counsel after receiving an interpretation of HB 3979 that would restrict offering the course,\u201d the district said in a statement. \u201cThe law was overly vague and the district chose to follow the legal advice of our attorneys out of an abundance of caution.\u201d Cunningham said the program\u2019s enrollment has not been impacted by the change. Last year, about 50 students were enrolled in the elective course and the same number of students joined the program but as a club, he said. Vivienne Garner, 18, was part of the program for seven years and was elected governor at the Texas Youth and Government state conference in 2020.  She said the students who were part of the class were \u201ca lot stronger\u201d delegates compared to those who were members of a school club. They would get a deeper understanding of \u201cthe importance of civil discourse and how to debate something civilly, especially in the world today.\u201d Garner, who is now a freshman at Ohio State University, couldn\u2019t speak to somebody and look them in the eyes when she started the program. \u201cIt forced me to come out of my shell,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gave me a chance to make myself heard even by people who were older than me.\u201d Garner said she\u2019s concerned about how HB 3979 could further impact the future of Youth and Government across the state. While there will be students interested in joining clubs, she says, the fear surrounding civil discourse activities may prevent teachers from sponsoring the clubs. At her former high school, students needed a new teacher sponsor for this school year and finding one was \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d in recent weeks, she says. There has been confusion and fear for weeks as teachers have been discussing any potential changes to their lessons with curriculum coordinators and among themselves. At a Tuesday webinar organized by the Association of Texas Professional Educators, the largest teacher union in the state, members asked whether they will be allowed to discuss redlining in the classroom or let their students listen to clips from Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s iconic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech and his famous \u201cLetter from the Birmingham Jail.\u201d Renee Blackmon, president of the Texas Council for the Social Studies, said some teachers are fearful of what will happen to them if a lesson \u201ctouches tangentially on racism\u201d and they are second guessing their lesson plans. \u201cAm I doing the right thing or not?,\u201d Blackmon said teachers are constantly asking themselves. She says they are wondering whether some people would think that a lesson about slavery, which is a part of the state\u2019s standard curriculum, is about critical race theory. \u201cWe do teach current events and present both sides, our teachers weren\u2019t teaching critical race theory in their classrooms,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cThere are people who believe they were probably because we do not have the public nor our state leaders in agreement about what really critical race theory is and what it encompasses. There\u2019s this misinformation that has clouded things.\u201d Alejandra Lopez, 35, the president of the San Antonio teachers\u2019 union, said the law is meant to have a chilling effect on educators who have been pursuing a more culturally relevant curriculum and broader conversations about race and equity. Growing up in San Antonio and attending public schools, Lopez says she didn\u2019t feel that her \u201ccommunity was reflected back at me in a way that was valued, and in a way that allowed me to feel dignity.\u201d Years later, Lopez became a second grade teacher and along with other colleagues founded PODER, a social justice caucus of the San Antonio teachers\u2019 union. The group now offers training every year to help educators reflect on how their lessons approach students\u2019 identities and allow them to explore them. Lopez says the union will continue offering those trainings because it is \u201cright for our students and our communities\u201d and the union will defend educators who may be accused of running afoul of the law. Randi Weingarten: You can't keep us from teaching students honest history As of Wednesday, the Texas Education Agency had not yet issued guidance on the law. Several school districts, including some of the 10 largest in the state, told CNN they were not planning any adjustments due to HB 3979 and plan to continue following the curriculum standards given to them by the state. Those standards, known as Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS), are reviewed by the State Board of Education once every eight years. The review of the social studies curriculum will begin this fall but won\u2019t be implemented until the 2025-2026 school year, which will give publishers time to update their textbooks and instruction materials. The new law shows a lack of understanding from lawmakers about how education standards are created in the state and the absence of teachers\u2019 input, Blackmon said. For now, Blackmon says her organization is focusing on reassuring teachers they will be out of trouble if they teach the standard curriculum and use \u201csound instructional practices.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all you can do. You cannot anticipate what parents are going to be misinformed of,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson and social justice activist Rev. William Barber II were arrested this week during a Capitol Hill protest over voting rights and the filibuster\u2019s abolition. US Capitol Police said Jackson and Barber were among 21 people arrested on Wednesday near the US Supreme Court building for crowding and obstructing. Video footage shows the faith leaders were outside the Hart Senate Building at the time of their detention. \u201cWhen you start rolling back voter registration, rolling back early voting, undermining mail in balloting, putting limits on people even being able to get water, doing racist gerrymandering, class-based gerrymandering, you hurt Black people, you hurt White people, you hurt Asians, Natives, Latinos, young people and the disabled,\u201d Barber told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. The faith leaders are part of several high-profile figures and organizations demanding that lawmakers at the state and federal halt efforts to enact bills that restrict voting access and support the For the People Act, a signature voting and election bill that Democrats had pitched to counter state-level efforts. Prior to their arrest, Barber held a rally in front of the US Supreme Court as part of the \u201cMoral March on Manchin and McConnell.\u201d The event organized by the faith-led grassroots organization The Poor People\u2019s Campaign aimed to call on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to abolish the filibuster. Civil rights leaders announce another March on Washington after voting rights bill fails in Senate Manchin has previously said he would not commit to voting to open debate on the For the People Act.  On Tuesday, a procedural vote to open debate on the legislation was defeated by a tally of 50-50.  The legislation needs the support of 60 senators to break the filibuster and open a debate. After speaking in front of the US Supreme Court, Barber and Jackson led demonstrators to the nearby Hart Senate Building, where they marched on the sidewalk. A video live-streamed by Repairers of the Breach, a group that Barber leads, shows that the faith leaders then stepped on the middle of the street, blocking traffic along with a smaller group of people who held a sign calling for Manchin to stop the filibuster. Minutes later, Capitol police officers began warning the group they were engaging in \u201cillegal demonstration activities,\u201d the video shows. Video footage captured by CNN shows the group was later escorted to the sidewalk by officers. This is not the first time Barber led a protest against the filibuster. Last week, Barber and dozens of people marched to Manchin\u2019s office in West Virginia. \u201cThey\u2019re tired of Manchin supporting the filibuster and not supporting them. Talking about bipartisanship rather than talking about the needs of West Virginia,\u201d Barber told CNN earlier this month about Manchin\u2019s constituents. Civil rights groups are expected to continue their efforts in their fight against voter suppression. Earlier this week, a group of civil rights groups announced the August 28 \u201cMarch On for Voting Rights,\u201d which will mark the 58th anniversary of the historic March on Washington where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Martin Luther King III, the eldest son of Martin Luther King Jr., will lead the march with his family\u2019s organization the Drum Major Institute along with March On, Service Employees International Union and the National Action Network. \u201cIt\u2019s time for all Americans to come together and join this non-violent, non-partisan movement in the spirit of Dr. King and the values he pushed this nation to uphold,\u201d said Rev. Al Sharpton, who heads the National Action Network. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a part of the March On for Voting Rights because there is no democratic right more sacred than the right to vote, and it is under threat across America. We must fight to protect it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s exactly the scenario Democrats had worked for months to avoid \u2013 but now find themselves confronting. Vulnerable members were forced to cast a tough vote in an already daunting election year. And now, they are left with nothing to show for it. With Sen. Joe Manchin effectively wielding a veto over President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda, House Democrats are now fuming at the prospects that their vote last month to pass the Build Back Better bill will be all for naught, having made scores of promises to voters only to have them all go unfulfilled. And Democrats in difficult races are calling on Manchin to return to the negotiating table and for their party\u2019s leaders to recalibrate their strategy to find some way to pass individual pieces of the $1.75 trillion proposal, even though doing that would require sign off from Manchin and would force them to replay the party infighting that has dogged Biden in his first year in office. How months of talks between Biden and Manchin over Build Back Better broke down \u201cI\u2019m obviously upset \u2013 pissed off about what happened,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski, a Democrat who represents a New Jersey swing district. \u201cWe certainly are not going to win an election spending the next year bemoaning the fact that Joe Manchin didn\u2019t do Build Back Better in December. We win by sprinting out of the starting gate in January.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s imperative that Democrats pass a measure to support children and families and the economic wellbeing of the American middle class and to take steps to address climate change,\u201d said Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota Democrat. \u201cIf we do nothing, it would be a terrible reflection on Democrats.\u201d And Phillips said his party needs to stop squabbling and instead coalesce around a new strategy to find consensus on some pieces of the legislation. \u201cIf we continue to point fingers at one another, and not recalibrate, that\u2019s a recipe for absolute destruction,\u201d he said. After the talks collapsed and led to a bitter round of finger-pointing, Manchin and Biden tried to cool tensions. They spoke by phone Sunday night and discussed reengaging on the matter in the new year. Yet getting a scaled-back plan through Congress is hardly a guarantee \u2013 especially with the trust deficit at rock bottom. \u201cHe simply can\u2019t be trusted to be a man of his word,\u201d Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said of Manchin. There are clear signs that the party is hardly on the same page about how to move ahead. In a phone call Monday, Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said she conveyed her frustration directly to the senator \u2013 and she\u2019s now calling on Biden to act administratively instead. Manchin says he still sees himself as a Democrat even after thwarting Build Back Better plan But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says he will still put the $1.75 trillion bill on the floor in January, forcing Manchin to officially vote no to block the measure. It will take weeks to even get to that point to hold the first procedural vote, which is bound to fail, as Senate Democrats prepare to discuss the matter at a Tuesday night virtual meeting. And Manchin is showing little interest in pushing through a narrower bill, arguing that Democrats should instead take their time and go through the committee process, something that could take months and ultimately would require the backing of 10 Republicans if they opt to go through the normal legislative order, as the moderate Democrat has been demanding. All of which means Democrats could be faced with many more weeks of legislative squabbling and no bill to show for it. \u201cAfter months of negotiations, one Democratic US senator has now summarily walked away from productive negotiations,\u201d said Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat facing a difficult race. \u201cThat is unacceptable.\u201d Pelosi says Democrats 'will not let this opportunity pass' on Build Back Better Act despite Manchin's stance Democrats believe there\u2019s still time to reverse voter sentiment. And they plan to campaign heavily on approval of the sweeping $1.2 trillion infrastructure law \u2013 and the nearly $2 trillion in Covid relief package enacted in the spring \u2013 despite the failure to approve the Build Back Better measure. \u201cVoters make up their minds starting next summer,\u201d Malinowski said, calling on Congress to also approve a bill aimed improving US competitiveness with China. \u201cInfrastructure is a huge deal in New Jersey. There\u2019s going to be so much money coming into my district from the infrastructure bill and what has already come via Covid relief.\u201d Of the larger package, the congressman added: \u201cWe haven\u2019t not gotten it done yet.\u201d Yet the situation Democrats are in now is emblematic of the scenario that Speaker Nancy Pelosi found herself in 12 years ago. Bolstered by a huge majority in 2009, Pelosi pushed through a major bill aimed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 something that was furiously opposed by the fossil-fuel industry, Republicans and moderate Democrats \u2013 and was narrowly approved despite 44 Democrats who voted against it. The bill was later ignored by the Senate, drawing the ire of House Democrats who had to cast a tough vote on a bill that went nowhere. 'We have got a problem here': Low morale and redistricting hand Democrats a growing retirement issue They lost the House in 2010, in an election where Democrats encountered backlash for their push to expand social programs and enact the Affordable Care Act. This year, Pelosi tried to avoid a similar scenario \u2013 and she had promised for weeks that House Democrats would only approve a bill that had been agreed to by all 50 Democratic senators. With an agreement elusive after months of talks, the California Democrat reversed course and scheduled a vote on the House Democrats\u2019 version of the bill last month. Only one Democrat, Jared Golden of Maine, voted against it. Asked if the biggest hurdles were in \u201cthe rearview mirror\u201d during a press conference last month, following the House\u2019s passage of the bill, Pelosi told reporters: \u201cYes.\u201d She later added: \u201cIt\u2019s really cause for celebration for us now.  And we\u2019re not getting bogged down in long speeches or (are) people\u2019s careers over, what happens if this doesn\u2019t happen. What we\u2019re talking about is what has happened.\u201d Yet if the bill doesn\u2019t become law, Democrats will have to confront the promises they made to their voters that didn\u2019t pan out. For Democrats in high-tax cities and states, primarily in the Northeast and on the West Coast, they had promised to relieve their constituents from getting hit with huge levies because of the limits Republicans placed on state and local tax deductions in their 2017 tax law. But with the collapse of Build Back Better, getting a deal to pass a SALT plan seems grim at best. Manchin's offer to Biden included universal pre-kindergarten and Obamacare expansion, but no child tax credit \u201cHaving passed SALT relief through the House floor four times, I remain as committed as ever to finding a path through the Senate for this and other New Jersey priorities,\u201d said Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat from New Jersey who faces a potentially tough road to reelection. Democrats already face bleak prospects of holding onto their razor-thin House majority, especially as retirements continue to climb \u2013 with 23 Democrats already publicly announcing they plan to step aside, compared to 11 Republicans. Plus with the challenges of redistricting, Biden\u2019s sagging poll numbers and the difficulties a President\u2019s party typically faces in his first midterm, the environment facing Democrats is dire. In the Senate, where the battle for the majority could go either way, vulnerable Democrats had been hoping to campaign on the bill\u2019s passage as well. \u201cI\u2019m more about getting it done right than getting it done on some schedule,\u201d Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat facing reelection next year, said when asked last week about the slipping timetable. But Kelly also acknowledged the problems facing families in his state if the child tax credit expires at year\u2019s end. \u201cThat\u2019s not ideal.\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat facing a potentially tough reelection in New Hampshire, said she wants to find consensus on the social safety net package, citing \u201clowering costs by taking on Big Pharma, providing tax cuts for families and acting on climate change.\u201d The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Yet without Manchin\u2019s support, and with steadfast GOP opposition, none of those initiatives will become law. Manchin\u2019s criticism of the bill spans the gamut \u2013 the price tag, the size of the plan, the temporary programs and scope of the bill \u2013 and he says he wants work requirements set around the child tax credit, in particular. \u201cWe\u2019ve been way far apart philosophically,\u201d Manchin said on West Virginia Radio on Monday. There\u2019s still some hope among his colleagues that he will come around. Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the most senior Democrat in the chamber, said Monday: \u201cThere is a lot in the bill that I hope we can still get through.\u201d Asked what it would mean for his party\u2019s prospects in next year\u2019s midterms if they can\u2019t get it approved, Leahy, who is retiring, quipped: \u201cI probably won\u2019t be elected.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rep. Peter DeFazio, the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, announced Wednesday that he will not seek reelection in 2022, the latest in a long stream of House Democrats leaving Congress at the end of their terms. \u201cWith humility and gratitude I am announcing that I will not seek re-election next year,\u201d DeFazio said on Twitter. DeFazio is at least the 19th Democrat to announce plans to leave the House this cycle, compared to 11 Republicans in the chamber. Democrats hold a slim majority in the chamber, and face an uphill battle in trying to maintain their control of the House during next year\u2019s midterm elections. Oregon\u2019s Fourth District, which includes the college town of Eugene, has been a political battleground in recent years. Joe Biden won it by about four percentage points last year, but it split almost equally between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016. While the district became more favorable to Democrats in redistricting, in a challenging political environment and without its longtime incumbent it\u2019s possible it could be competitive in 2022. DeFazio was first elected in 1986. Before coming to Congress he served in the Air Force Reserve, worked as a congressional staffer and was a county commissioner in Oregon. In addition to his work on transportation, DeFazio previously served as the ranking member on the Natural Resources Committee. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cited DeFazio\u2019s work on the recently passed bipartisan infrastructure bill as part of his \u201c36 years of effective leadership.\u201d \u201cChairman DeFazio is known and respected by all as a champion of sustainable, smart and green infrastructure, whose progressive values, passion and persistence have helped rebuild America and the middle class,\u201d Pelosi said.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Wednesday received an unwelcome wake-up call for his still-new presidency as the Democrat arrived back in Washington from a European excursion suddenly facing a transformed political landscape. Republican Glenn Youngkin\u2019s projected gubernatorial victory over Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in Virginia, which Biden won by 10 points last year, and a too-close-to-call race in New Jersey made for dispiriting news for the President as he flew over the Atlantic. Returning to the White House in the dark, Biden declined to answer questions about the race, which he\u2019d incorrectly predicted Democrats would win eight hours earlier. The results had been called a half-hour before Biden touched down at Joint Base Andrews. Aboard Air Force One, people familiar with the matter said the mood was grim as a weary team returned to what has become a swirl of recrimination and second-guessing. A subdued Biden told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that the results of the election must be accepted, and said that he was proud of the race McAuliffe ran \u2013 arguing that the former governor had received the most votes a Democratic gubernatorial nominee had ever received in the commonwealth. But, Biden said, there\u2019s not much that could have been done given historical trends and enthusiasm among Republican voters. \u201cI think it should have passed before Election Day,\u201d Biden said of his legislative agenda, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure that I would have been able to change the number of very conservative folks who turned out in red districts who were (former President Donald) Trump voters. But, maybe. Maybe.\u201d He added, \u201cPeople want us to get things done, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m continuing to push very hard for the Democratic Party to move along and pass my infrastructure bill and my Build Back Better bill.\u201d Questions remain over how the shifting dynamic will play out in the coming days, weeks and months. Biden has for months been locked in a repeating cycle of pressure-packed weeks for his legislative agenda as his party has failed to pass his sweeping domestic agenda, comprised of a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan and a $1.75 trillion social safety net expansion bill. Those priorities remain unfinished \u2013 and a potential government shutdown and default on the nation\u2019s debt looms in early December. It all adds up to a potential turning point in Biden\u2019s presidency before he has reached a full year in the job. The White House already feels a new sense of urgency to both pass the agenda and provide direction for a party in panic, and an official tells CNN it is possible Biden will directly address the American people on Wednesday. \u201cHopefully lights a fire under our team on the bill to act,\u201d a senior administration official told CNN, but added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to overreact here.\u201d The official also said, \u201cBut clearly voters are frustrated by the pace of action and we need to pick up that pace.\u201d After months of infighting over Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar legislative agenda, which laid bare the divisions in the Democratic Party, it has not taken long for finger-pointing and panic to set in among Biden\u2019s allies. A source close to the White House argued the results showed that voters are frustrated with the lack of action in Washington. \u201cVoters were clear that they were unhappy with inaction and nitpicking,\u201d the source said. \u201cAnd Democrats widely agree that there is greater impetus to go ahead, faster, with bills that will be economic game-changers for middle-class families and ensure the economy delivers for hardworking people in their daily lives, not just those at the top.\u201d \u201cIf voters are frustrated with inaction, the obvious response is to be more decisive and pass bills based on an agenda for the middle class that received a record-breaking 81 million votes last year,\u201d the source added. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a strong consensus about that across the party. Doing less is plainly the opposite of what people want.\u201d On Wednesday morning, a source close to House progressives pushed back on criticism from moderate Democrats that McAuliffe lost because they held up Biden\u2019s agenda. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even begin to pass the sniff test. Voters did not base their choice between McAuliffe and Youngkin off of infrastructure negotiations in DC. A state did not just swing by more than 10 points in a single year because of some bill moving through Congress,\u201d the source said. Still, over the final weeks of the campaign, McAuliffe and his allies repeatedly raised warnings that Biden\u2019s inability to pass a sweeping social safety net expansion was hindering his race. Some of Biden\u2019s advisers have chafed at the notion the President\u2019s stalled domestic agenda was to blame, pointing instead to a lingering pandemic and its economic aftereffects. Some Democrats close to Biden have also privately lamented at McAuliffe\u2019s stumbles, including sparking outrage with a comment on education that came to define the closing weeks of the race. The Virginia governor\u2019s race in particular was seen as a referendum on the first year of Biden\u2019s presidency, even though the President said he didn\u2019t view it that way, and Tuesday\u2019s loss could lead to second-guessing on the Democrats\u2019 strategy on Biden\u2019s economic agenda. More moderate Democrats could join Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia in raising concerns about Biden\u2019s massive economic and climate spending bill, which would further draw out the process and complicate the path forward. Biden, who campaigned for McAuliffe in Virginia, had expressed confidence on Tuesday that McAuliffe would win. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win. I think we\u2019re gonna win in Virginia,\u201d Biden said during a news conference in Glasgow, while also acknowledging it would be a tight race. However, the President said had the race wouldn\u2019t be a reflection on his agenda. \u201cI don\u2019t believe, and I\u2019ve not seen any evidence, that whether or not I am doing well or poorly, whether or not I\u2019ve got my agenda passed or not, is gonna have any real impact on winning or losing,\u201d Biden said during the news conference. \u201cEven if we had passed my agenda, I wouldn\u2019t claim we won because Biden\u2019s agenda passed.\u201d A Biden adviser acknowledged to CNN that McAuliffe\u2019s loss is a warning sign for Democrats\u2019 chances in the midterms next year but warned against drawing sweeping conclusions from a single election. The loss makes clear that Democrats can\u2019t simply run against Trump to win elections, the adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on Democrats to be loud and clear about what we\u2019re for and not just running against Donald Trump,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s also clear that voters are unhappy about inaction and this drives home the point that Democrats in Congress should move quickly on our agenda.\u201d Discontent over the coronavirus pandemic and the economic problems associated with it are currently Democrats\u2019 biggest issues. If the state of the pandemic improves it would lead to economic growth, more jobs and inflation getting under control. That could brighten the overall mood among Democrats, restore Biden\u2019s poll numbers a bit and give the party a little space to sell what they\u2019ve passed and go on offense against Republicans. \u201cPeople are upset and uncertain about a lot of things from Covid to school to jobs to a whole range of things,\u201d Biden said on Wednesday, arguing that the passage of his agenda items would \u201csee a lot of those things ameliorated.\u201d \u201cI think we should produce for the American people,\u201d the President said. \u201cPeople need a little breathing room. They\u2019re overwhelmed and what happened was, I think we just have to produce results for them to change their standard of living and give them a little more breathing room.\u201d He asserted that elements of his agenda \u201care overwhelmingly popular,\u201d but \u201cwe have to speak to (voters) and explain them.\u201d \u201cI think that people are at a point, and it\u2019s understandable, where there\u2019s a whole lot of confusion,\u201d Biden added. For now, GOP leaders are reveling in the results and forecasting them to be a signal of what to expect in 2022 \u2013 and beyond. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told his members in a letter overnight: \u201cVirginia voters sent an undeniable message that extends beyond the Commonwealth to every corner of the country. In times of anxiety, Americans are focused on the success and stability of their families and communities. Americans want a change in leadership, and Virginia is just the first step.\u201d Biden\u2019s allies in Congress are now hoping that the grim election night will spur quicker action on the President\u2019s agenda as he appears in deep need of a win. Moderate Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Wednesday: \u201cPeople want action. They want results, they deserve results\u2026 This is a wake-up call for all of us.\u201d Gottheimer called on his party to \u201ctake action\u201d and pass the bipartisan package and economic agenda. Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico echoed his colleagues\u2019 frustrations with their party\u2019s messaging, saying they need to \u201cinspire\u201d the American public. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to tell the American people why they should vote against someone else. You need to show them why they should vote for you and inspire them and encourage them to come out to vote,\u201d he told CNN.  \u201cAnd I think that we need to do better across America.\u201d Luj\u00e1n emphasized that action on key Democratic agenda items could sway voters and that passing Biden\u2019s economic agenda and voting rights legislation would \u201cshow the American people what we stand for and who we are.\u201d \u201cThese are the very commitments that we made to voters back \u2026 when they entrusted us with the majority in the House, ultimately the presidency and majority in the US Senate, and we have to deliver upon them,\u201d he said. But Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii defended Democrats\u2019 efforts, and attacked Republicans for their inaction. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Terry should have done different, but my goal has always been to communicate to the American public who is actually screwing them over and it\u2019s not the Democrats,\u201d Hirono told CNN.

The race took place for the US House seat previously held by former GOP Rep. Steve Stivers, who left Congress to lead the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. Carey, a coal lobbyist who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, won the Republican special primary in August. Carey had been the favorite to win the seat in the heavily Republican district, but Democrats had still been hoping for an upset with Russo, a Democratic state representative.

In one campaign video, Russo said, \u201cWe can\u2019t let our recovery be rigged to favor Wall Street while the rest of us on main street are left behind.

            "article_content": "House Democratic leaders on Thursday were once again forced to push back the timeline for a vote on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, a sign of ongoing divisions within the party and a major blow to President Joe Biden and party leaders eager to show they can deliver on their agenda. The decision to delay the vote came just hours after Biden appealed directly to House Democrats in a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, pitching them on a framework for a separate, larger climate and economic package. The problem for party leaders is that progressives made clear they would not vote for the infrastructure bill unless the larger bill moves in tandem and said a framework was not enough to win their votes. That bill has not yet been finalized or publicly signed off on by all Senate Democrats. Delaying the infrastructure vote is a significant setback for Democrats with Biden making clear privately for more than a week he wanted an agreement and passage of the bipartisan measure before he arrives at a UN Climate Conference on November 1. Biden departed for his foreign trip later in the day on Thursday. Speaker Nancy Pelosi had told House Democrats earlier Thursday not to \u201cembarrass\u201d Biden by voting down the infrastructure bill during Biden\u2019s trip overseas. This is the second time in two months that House leadership has had to delay the infrastructure vote after a similar scenario played out at the end of September. For now, it\u2019s unclear how long the vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill will be delayed. Amid resistance from progressives over moving ahead with the infrastructure bill, the House instead voted Thursday night to approve a short-term extension of highway funding. The transportation bill vote was needed to avoid a lapse in funding for transportation projects starting Monday. The Senate agreed by unanimous consent that once the House passed the extension, it would be deemed passed by the Senate as well. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer\u2019s office sent a notice that the transportation extension vote would be the last of the week. Hoyer later told reporters that \u201cyes\u201d he is disappointed they weren\u2019t able to vote on the infrastructure package. Asked if it would take until December 3 to pass it, which is when highway funding would lapse after the stopgap was passed, Hoyer said, \u201cno, I don\u2019t think,\u201d it will take that long. On when they will finally vote on the infrastructure bill, he said, \u201cI hope soon.\u201d Some moderates expressed frustration over yet another delay, arguing that the bipartisan infrastructure bill should be passed now. That\u2019s especially a concern for some vulnerable incumbents looking for a tangible win as they head into the midterm elections. \u201cUnfortunately, a small number of Members within our own party denied the President \u2013 and the American people \u2013 a historic win,\u201d Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, the co-chair of the Blue Dog Coalition, said in a statement. \u201cWe are extremely frustrated that legislative obstruction of the BIF continues\u2014not based on the bill\u2019s merits, but because of a misguided strategy to use the bill as leverage on separate legislation.\u201d Reps. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey and Dean Phillips of Minnesota both expressed deep frustration with their party\u2019s handling of the infrastructure vote \u2013 and voted in protest against the short-term extension of transportation funding. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about Virginia, I\u2019m concerned about the message. I\u2019m concerned about the message it sends to the world right now that is looking at our system of governance with increasing concern about its viability,\u201d Phillips said, alluding to Tuesday\u2019s gubernatorial election in Virginia, where Democrats had been hoping a legislative win for Biden would help boost Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe. Malinowski, whose district is targeted by Republicans, said of delaying the vote: \u201cIt is frustrating to a lot of us that we are now in a game of \u2018who goes first\u2019 when all sides seem to be in agreement on the substance. The country has been begging for this, my constituents have been begging for this.\u201d During the closed-door meeting with House Democrats, Biden laid out in person long-awaited details of his $1.75 trillion economic and climate package, trying to convince progressives who are skeptical of anything short of a fully written bill and commitments from all 50 members of the Senate Democratic caucus to back his framework. But he came up short, with progressives still demanding that both bills move in tandem. Phillips was critical of Biden because he did not explicitly say the infrastructure vote should occur on Thursday in the meeting; Pelosi is the one who pushed for the vote. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say I wish he was more explicit. \u2026 This is the commander in chief of the United States. When you spend political equity in front of a caucus two times in a month, I think it\u2019s got to be awfully explicit \u2013 and be more forthright.\u201d Phillips added: \u201cIf the President had led us down that hallway onto and on the House floor, I think it would have been close. \u2026. I think with Republican votes, it would have passed.\u201d The personal pitch to House Democrats marked a concerted effort by the President to wrest control of an unwieldy process that has led to significant revisions to Democratic goals in the effort to appease Sens. Joe Manchin Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. While Biden\u2019s proposal isn\u2019t finalized in its entirety, days of negotiations have brought it to a place where the key elements are all locked in. Not all Democrats have signed off on the framework that Biden announced Thursday morning, two people familiar with the plan cautioned, but the President believes it\u2019s a consensus all Democrats should be able to support. Neither Manchin nor Sinema explicitly committed to backing the plan Thursday, though they both said they were continuing to negotiate after Biden\u2019s meeting with House Democrats. Sinema reacted to the framework by saying in a statement, \u201cWe have made significant progress\u201d and \u201cI look forward to getting this done.\u201d Manchin was noncommittal when asked by reporters whether he will support the framework agreement. Later on Thursday, he said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the text yet. Everyone has to see it. I don\u2019t think anybody could say they could support it until they see the text.\u201d Notably, however, Manchin signaled support for a $1.75 trillion top line for the package. Asked by CNN if that price was too high, he said, \u201cNo,\u201d adding, \u201cThat was negotiated.\u201d This is the first public indication that Manchin will accept a price tag higher than $1.5 trillion, which he had previously said was the figure he was willing to settle on. And despite the scrapped infrastructure vote, the White House expressed optimism that both bills would eventually pass. \u201cLegislative text is starting to become public, and the road to passing both critical parts of the President\u2019s plan to make our economy deliver for middle class families\u2014not just the wealthy\u2014is clearer than ever,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Thursday evening. As she left the final House vote of the night, Rep. Pramila Jayapal \u2013 the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who has said that just having a framework on the larger spending plan is not enough \u2013 told reporters, \u201cWe are going to pass both bills.\u201d \u201cThe President said he believes he\u2019s got 50 votes in the Senate and I think it\u2019s a lot for him to say that,\u201d the Washington state Democrat said.  She has made clear, though, that progressives want a vote on both bills in the House at the same time. Earlier in the day, after a separate meeting with House progressives, she had said, \u201cEveryone in the room enthusiastically endorsed a resolution that approves in principle the framework the President laid out today.\u201d \u201cWe intend to vote for both bills when the Build Back Better Act is ready,\u201d she said, referring to the larger climate and economic package. But, she added, \u201cwe do need the vote on both bills in the House at the same time.\u201d \u201cWe have 96, 98% of the caucus on the same page,\u201d Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said. \u201cWe just need to figure out what these two folks are willing to commit to and once we get real clarity on that, on what is a yes, then I think we\u2019ll be able to move forward,\u201d she said of Manchin and Sinema. Senate Democrats cannot afford to lose a single vote to pass the bill under a process they plan to use known as budget reconciliation. That dynamic has given every single member \u2013 and in particular, moderates including Manchin who have pushed back on a number of the original proposals for the package \u2013 an outsized influence over the process. After his visit to Capitol Hill, Biden delivered public remarks on the framework. \u201cToday I\u2019m pleased to announce that after months of tough and thoughtful negotiations, I know we have a historic economic framework,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s a framework that would create millions of jobs, grow the economy, invest in our nation and our people, turn the climate crisis into an opportunity and put us on a path not only to compete, but to win the economic competition for the 21st century against China and every other major country in the world,\u201d he said. Biden later left for Europe for the Group of 20 Summit in Rome. Climate is a topic Biden is expected to discuss Friday morning during an audience with Pope Francis in a historic meeting. Later, he plans to deliver a major climate speech when visiting the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The trip presents a major moment on the world stage for the President that has added urgency to the push for a deal and a House infrastructure vote. The $1.75 trillion proposal focuses on care for families, addressing the climate crisis, expanding access to health care, lowering costs for the middle class and tax reforms. The new plan makes major concessions and does not have several key planks that Biden had initially proposed, including paid family and medical leave, prescription drug pricing provisions, free community college and vision or dental Medicaid coverage. Elon Musk used government money to build Tesla. But he fears a tax on billionaires It does include provisions to help families with childcare and caregiving, including free and universal preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, which amounts to the biggest expansion of public education in 100 years, according to the White House. The largest portion of the framework focuses on climate and would include the largest legislative investment in combating climate change in US history, according to the White House. As part of that, there would be $320 billion for clean energy tax credits. This includes 10-year expanded tax credits for utility-scale and residential clean energy, transmission and storage, clean passenger and commercial vehicles and clean energy manufacturing. On health care, the plan would close the Medicaid coverage gap and deliver health care coverage through Affordable Care Act premium tax credits to certain uninsured Americans. It would also expand Medicare coverage to include hearing services. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Thursday.

            "article_content": "House Democrats in competitive races are putting little daylight between themselves and President Joe Biden, even as Republicans ratchet up their efforts to use the President as a cudgel against their Democratic opponents in the midterm elections. After struggling for months to dent Biden\u2019s popularity, House Republicans finally see an opening with his sagging approval ratings and are looking to take full advantage. The House GOP\u2019s campaign arm rolled out new attack ads this week tying 17 House Democrats to Biden and their $3.5 trillion economic bill \u2013 the GOP\u2019s first campaign blitz directly linking the most vulnerable Democrats to the President. And during a political GOP conference meeting on Tuesday, House Republican leaders shared polling in several key swing districts where Biden\u2019s numbers are underwater, according to a source in the room. Among the seats they singled out were Reps. Cindy Axne of Iowa, Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Chris Pappas of New Hampshire. \u201cEverything (Biden) touches becomes a disaster,\u201d said Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the vice chairman of the House GOP conference. \u201cThe longer he serves, the better off we are for the next election cycle. And I think the polling numbers show that.\u201d \u201cIt is not a good trend for the Democrats,\u201d he added. A president\u2019s job approval rating is one of the strongest indicators of how their party will perform in the midterms, and Republicans see Biden as increasingly toxic in battleground districts. The president\u2019s party typically loses 26 seats in their first midterm, and the GOP needs to flip only five to seize back power next year. Ahead of the 2010 midterm \u201cshellacking,\u201d some Democrats had distanced themselves from Barack Obama as voters soured on the then-President. Joe Biden's poll numbers are plummeting at exactly the wrong time A series of polls released last week found Biden\u2019s approval rating underwater and down significantly from earlier this year. A CNN Poll of Polls of five surveys of adults conducted entirely in September shows that Biden\u2019s approval rating averages 45% approve to 51% disapprove. But so far, Democrats are showing zero signs they\u2019re sweating the GOP\u2019s efforts to yoke them to Biden or expressing any concern about his decline in poll numbers. In fact, several of them who were targeted by the latest ads from the National Republican Congressional Committee said they\u2019d welcome the President into their districts with open arms. Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey said he would have Biden campaign in his district \u201cany day, any time.\u201d Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux of Georgia said she would \u201cabsolutely\u201d welcome both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. And Rep. Haley Stevens said the President is \u201cdoing a great job\u201d and \u201cshould come to Michigan.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the way he is leading with science,\u201d said Stevens, who noted that Biden had won Oakland County by 100,000 votes. \u201cI am very proud that he loves the auto industry and is going to support what we do in Michigan manufacturing.\u201d The National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s 17 new digital spots attempt to paint vulnerable Democrats as foot soldiers of Biden who are going to support the \u201cbiggest tax hike in decades.\u201d The ads also use an out-of-context clip of Biden saying \u201cyour taxes are going to be raised, not cut,\u201d even though he has said he would support tax hikes only on the wealthiest Americans. \u201cHouse Democrats are helping Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi pass the biggest tax hike in decades,\u201d National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer of Minnesota said in a statement. \u201cWith costs already through the roof, the last thing middle-class Americans need is the government taking more money from their paychecks. Voters will hold every Democrat who votes for this reckless tax and spending spree accountable.\u201d Democrats aren\u2019t yet sounding the alarm over Biden\u2019s approval ratings, which have taken a dip following the surge in the Delta coronavirus variant and the administration\u2019s chaotic exit from Afghanistan. They argue there is plenty of time for things to trend back in the right direction. \u201cPresidents go up and down,\u201d said Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, who chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and was one of the Democrats targeted by the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cWe get this stuff done, he\u2019s going to go back up.\u201d Americans turn pessimistic amid concerns over economy and coronavirus But Democrats in front-line districts are warning about their party\u2019s electoral prospects next year if they don\u2019t deliver on key pillars of Biden\u2019s domestic agenda, which faces an uncertain path in Congress. Front-line Democrats have publicly and privately implored their colleagues not to sink a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill when it comes up for a vote on Thursday, and some of them encouraged the President to get more engaged in the negotiations. Yet many progressives are still holding firm that they won\u2019t support the measure unless Democrats first pass legislation to expand the social safety net and address climate change. \u201cThis has to work, because we need the Biden presidency to succeed, and if the Biden presidency doesn\u2019t succeed, democracy doesn\u2019t succeed,\u201d said Malinowski. \u201cWe have to land these bills. So I\u2019m not concerned about Biden\u2019s approval ratings today, but I am concerned about getting this stuff done.\u201d Notching a key victory on something as popular as roads and bridges could not only lift Biden\u2019s poll numbers, but also provide a big boost to House Democrats in competitive districts, who don\u2019t want to return to their districts empty-handed once again. Centrist Democrats, however, are determined to scale back the size and scope of the massive economic package, with Republicans signaling that they plan to label Democrats as \u201ctax-and-spend liberals\u201d in the midterms. And even Democratic leaders have acknowledged that the price of the economic plan has to get shaved down to win over moderates in both chambers. Still, even as the GOP hammers Democrats over their combined $5 trillion in proposed spending, Democrats are making clear that they see passage of both bills as key to their midterm success. This summer, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, encouraged vulnerable House Democrats to run as \u201cBiden Democrats\u201d and tout the President\u2019s economic agenda, which remains largely popular with voters. When asked about the GOP\u2019s new efforts to make Biden into a midterm bogeyman, Maloney responded: \u201cI\u2019ll let the NRCC come up with their own dumbass strategy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden didn\u2019t enter the back-to-back-back meetings on Wednesday with nearly two dozen Democratic lawmakers demanding a deal \u2013 or even looking for one. Things are simply too far apart for that at the moment. But he did demand action, according to lawmakers and officials involved in the meetings. Through four hours and 21 minutes, Biden probed, cajoled, praised, told a few stories and made sure lawmakers had access to the individually-wrapped chocolate chip cookies with the gold embossed White House seal provided for snacks. He urged lawmakers not just to find common ground, but also to explicitly lay out what they would accept in a deal, according to multiple participants. Biden wasn\u2019t just seeking to shake up a process that appeared to have run into a brick wall, they said. Fully aware of a compressed time window for action, he was actively searching out the end game. Why it's getting even harder for Biden to pass his legacy-defining agenda Lawmakers and White House officials were universal in the view that progress was made. All said the temperature, which had reached an intraparty boiling point, had started to come down. Yet all also acknowledged the same thing: the real work comes in the next few days. Biden\u2019s public schedule is quite open on Thursday. Expect it to fill up with more meetings with lawmakers, White House officials say \u2013 something that will likely be a regular occurrence in the days ahead. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will hold her weekly press conference at 10:45 a.m. ET. The meetings were substantive. They were detailed, with multiple lawmakers laying out priorities and issues across the key planks of Biden\u2019s proposal, from child care and paid leave, to concerns over the structure of specific tax proposals. There are, in short, a lot of policy details still to be hammered out, even if the key elements of the plan are both widely agreed upon \u2013 and widely supported. But the reality remains this: Moderate Democrats won\u2019t accept a $3.5 trillion package. Progressives made clear they view $3.5 trillion as a compromise already. White House officials have acknowledged for more than a week that the size of the package would have to be scaled back in order to secure the votes of moderate Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. To what degree, however, and through which programs or priorities, has remained an open question. There was a discussion in the moderate meeting on Wednesday about whether $2 trillion, or around that level, would be acceptable. But no commitments were made, people involved said. Biden had an explicit ask for moderates, who have frustrated all involved by not laying out what exactly they would accept on the topline: tell the White House what would work. There are two time pressures driving things right now. On the macro level, there is the necessity of getting everything done by the end of the year. While it\u2019s not a written rule, history is pretty clear that once lawmakers enter a midterm election year, the ability to coalesce around anything substantial dissipates dramatically. Multiply that by about 10 this Congress given the exceedingly bare Democratic majorities. The more immediate trigger, of course, is the commitment to House Democratic moderates to vote on the Senate-passed $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill by September 27. Progressives haven\u2019t backed off their pledge to kill that vote if it moves forward. Moderates came away from their meeting with the impression that that vote was still on. Progressives made clear they\u2019d told Biden it need to be moved. Biden made no explicit commitment. \u201cMembers said it\u2019s just kind of arbitrary to us. What are the possibilities?\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden told reporters, per CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Ted Barrett. \u201cAnd the President left it at, and said: \u2018Let me think it over, and talk to Sen. Schumer, Speaker Pelosi and get back.\u2019\u201d The bottom line here is the most immediate issue Biden and Democratic leaders need to resolve is the looming infrastructure vote. Biden pressed lawmakers to make \u201csignificant progress\u201d on the economic and climate package by early next week, according to one participant. It\u2019s a hint toward the goal right now \u2013 lock in some kind of framework that gives progressives a reason to vote for the infrastructure bill. It\u2019s a heavy, heavy lift. But something to keep a close eye on. One thing to keep in mind, however: people involved expect no quick solution or end to this process. The divides are too deep at the moment, and the stakes are too high to shut anything down. As one senior Democratic aide joked in reference to past major congressional debates and action: \u201cWe do some of our best work around the holidays.\u201d \u201cWe are calm and everybody\u2019s good and our work is almost done. So we\u2019re in good shape.\u201d \u2013 Pelosi Yes, everyone not in Generation Z picked up the very \u201cKevin Bacon in the final-scene-of-Animal House\u201d vibes from that remark. (To be clear, that was not its intent, nor the view of where things actually stand. But a little levity isn\u2019t a bad thing.) The President hosted three productive and candid meetings with congressional Democrats, representing a wide range of views of the caucuses in both Chambers, about the urgent need to deliver for the American middle class through the Build Back Better Act and the bipartisan infrastructure deal. This was an important opportunity for the President to engage with Members and hear their perspectives, and progress was made toward finding the pathway forward for lowering costs for hardworking people and ensuring that our economic growth strategy is based on investing in families, not more giveaways to big corporations and the wealthiest taxpayers. There is more work ahead in the coming days, and he and his team will have follow-up meetings, starting tomorrow, to continue to advance the process of passing these critical bills. One thing to keep in mind as lawmakers enter a critical period in advance of the scheduled September 27 infrastructure vote: for the better part of the last nine months, it has been progressives who have compromised. The point here is not some robust defense of progressives, but instead to show why progressives are so firm in their position right now. \u201cWe\u2019ve been the ones constantly giving way in order to keep things on the tracks,\u201d one House Democrat told CNN. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for our priorities to be the focus.\u201d White House touts 'productive' meetings with Democratic leaders, moderates and progressives at critical moment for Biden's agenda As Biden began his biggest legislative outreach day to date at the White House, Democrats on Capitol Hill were noticeably losing patience with the process One House Democrat said Biden\u2019s direct engagement was welcome. But the member made clear he \u2013 and many of his colleagues \u2013 didn\u2019t understand why it had taken so long. \u201cIt\u2019s about damn time,\u201d the member told CNN in a text. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a state secret we\u2019ve been at each other\u2019s throats for weeks.\u201d White House officials said Biden\u2019s engagement has been carefully calibrated to have the most substantial effect. He\u2019s been on the phone with members and had several private meetings in recent weeks. But some House members are pointing the finger at Biden himself for not doing more to cultivate relationships outside of the Senate. That message had been delivered to senior White House officials multiple times over the course of the last several weeks, according to people familiar with the discussions. It\u2019s important to note here that members aren\u2019t really referring to his legislative affairs team \u2013 one that is generally respected and has engaged intensively across the caucus. But the direct attention from the President himself is a critical tool \u2013 one many House Democrats thought would be coming in spades given Biden\u2019s legislative bona fides. Biden campaigned for a big chunk of the frontline Democrats in 2018. Some clearly thought there would be a more open line of communication with him. It\u2019s also not all that surprising that a more than three-decade veteran of the Senate would spend more time there than in the lower chamber. Not to mention the Senate was viewed as the playing field for the bipartisan infrastructure talks. But in a moment when the President\u2019s entire legislative agenda is going to be determined by the House of Representatives, it\u2019s worth noting the sense of frustration. \u201cIf I were the President of the United States in a time like this in our nation\u2019s history with a platter of legislative opportunities that are facing us, would I spend a lot more time cultivating relationships? Darn right I would,\u201d one Democratic House member said. \u201cI am troubled by the inability it seems by the administration to build the connections and the trust and the relationships that are so important. The former President did it pretty well. He brought members to Camp David. He cultivated relationships in a way that executives tend to do. That is not condemnation, it\u2019s just frustration.\u201d A key caveat here: member frustration can be quelled pretty quickly when their concerns are not only heard, but acted on. Members who met with Biden on Wednesday came away universally pleased with the opportunity. It\u2019s a tale as old as time, but it\u2019s always a critical piece of big negotiations: some House Democrats are also blaming the other side of the Capitol. House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth said he can\u2019t begin to finalize a reconciliation package that progressives are calling for until he knows what is going to be included in the package, how much the bill is going to cost or what senators actually want. Aides debriefed on Democratic Senate lunches this week have complained that senators are largely just talking in circles, not engaged in a direct negotiation about what each corner is willing to give. \u201cClearly, one of the problems is we don\u2019t know what the Senate will do,\u201d Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat, said. Members have firmly entered the time-honored tradition of the airing of grievances. This is an enormously consequential negotiation and it is not remotely unusual for things to get worse before they get better. Nor are members being anxious or displeased about the state of those talks a new phenomenon. Senators look down on House members. House members loathe their Senate counterparts. It\u2019s a tried-and-true bipartisan tradition. But to a degree, given it\u2019s the first major battle of a new administration and newly unified Democratic Congress, it has some echoes of the 2017 Republican Obamacare repeal effort, when House Republicans fumbled the ball amid sharp differences between conservatives and moderates. House Republicans eventually found a pathway forward (though not one that could get through the Senate). Anxious Democrats float Plan B: Raise debt ceiling on party-line vote Democrats still have to map out a path forward to fund the government beyond next Thursday and avoid the first US default in the country\u2019s history. It was something discussed by Biden and the Democratic leaders on Wednesday, even if it wasn\u2019t the primary focus of their meeting, according to one personal familiar with the discussion. To be clear, House Democrats passed a bill to do just that. They don\u2019t have the votes for that bill in the Senate due to near-unified GOP opposition. Democrats are furious at what they view as equal parts intransigent and irresponsible. They plan to continue to hammer that in the days ahead, multiple officials and aides said. But quietly, CNN is told, there are discussions about an alternative to at least keep the government funded. What that would entail \u2013 or if Democrats take that path \u2013 is not yet clear. But it underscores a quiet view on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue: a government shutdown at this highest stakes of moments for Biden\u2019s domestic legislative agenda is simply not an acceptable outcome. Most Democrats on Capitol Hill aren\u2019t acknowledging (at least out loud) what they are going to do when Republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling next week. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, has said a vote to fund the government and raise the country\u2019s borrowing limit won\u2019t happen until next week, which will give Congress just a handful of days to come up with a plan B to avert a government shutdown. The options at this point are limited. With every passing day they become more so. So, what can Democrats actually do to raise the debt ceiling on their own? Yarmuth tipped his hat Wednesday that Democrats are quietly exploring their options. Yarmuth said his staff counsel was looking at it, but he was fuzzy on what the political appetite there would be for Democrats to go it alone. On whether Democrats could raise the debt ceiling on their own, Yarmuth said it is, in fact, \u201cpossible for us to do it.\u201d But, he quickly added, \u201cI have rarely heard the speaker and leadership more adamant about anything that they are not going to do this through reconciliation.\u201d Aides say Democrats essentially have two options if they have to pursue this without Republicans: So if Democrats can do it alone, why is there such a fight? Democrats fundamentally believe that it\u2019s the responsibility of everyone to pay the check for spending that they argue Republicans and Democrats are both responsible for. Under Trump, Congress passed trillions in new spending to protect against the coronavirus and buoy the economy, and Democrats argue Republicans racked up more debt with their 2017 tax bill. For Democrats, this is a matter of fairness. But there are also political reasons why raising the debt ceiling alone is problematic. Both amending the budget resolution and writing another one would require a vote-a-rama, an unpleasant marathon amendment vote series that leaves members vulnerable to tough votes. Both options would also require Democrats to lay out exactly how much more money they will need to pay down the country\u2019s debt. They literally have to write exactly how much they are going to spend. If you are running in a tough state, that could be politically toxic for a reelection. The political ads virtually write themselves \u2013 something Republicans are keenly aware as they\u2019ve stuck to their opposition. The government funding bill is not a walk in the park, either. Even if Democrats decouple the debt ceiling from the government spending bill, there are still other sticking points that Democrats and Republicans have to work through. The differences aren\u2019t insurmountable, but they are real and they require time, something that Congress doesn\u2019t exactly have in spades right now. Republicans have filed their own short-term spending bill that contains alternative language on how to process Afghan refugees and includes the additional $1 billion in iron dome funding, something that was stripped from the House bill.",

            "article_content": "House Democrats in some of the most competitive districts are growing increasingly anxious about their ability to hold on to their seats, with party leaders warning that they could sustain deep losses if they don\u2019t sharpen their message and retool their strategy in the battle for control of the chamber in next year\u2019s midterms. The concerns, voiced by several moderate Democrats in swing districts, center on fears that their economic messages \u2013 and some of their party\u2019s biggest accomplishments like an expanded child tax credit \u2013 have not broken through. And the sharp warning some endangered Democrats are delivering to their leaders: They are not willing to take messaging votes on hot-button issues with little chance of becoming law, a dynamic that was on full display as moderate Democrats revolted against a plan to extend the federal eviction moratorium through the end of the year or mid-fall before it expired last week. \u201cThere is a lot of anxiety,\u201d said one vulnerable House Democrat. \u201cI think that\u2019s why there\u2019s such a negative reaction to the eviction moratorium.\u201d Rep. Susan Wild, a Democrat who represents a swing district in Pennsylvania, said voters \u201cfeel like\u201d her party is delivering for them. \u201cI think in many ways we are letting our results speak for themselves,\u201d Wild said. But she added, \u201cNow, obviously we need to talk about those results so that people don\u2019t forget them.\u201d Democrats increase pressure on party leadership to act on eviction moratorium as White House shifts focus to federal aid That was the stark assessment delivered last week to vulnerable Democrats at a closed-door meeting with senior officials of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the caucus\u2019 main campaign arm. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a New York Democrat who chairs the DCCC, discussed new polling of 1,000 likely 2022 voters in more than 48 battleground districts and areas. And Maloney told his colleagues: \u201cIf the election were held today, we would lose,\u201d according to multiple sources and confirmed by the DCCC. The message \u2013 intended to give their most vulnerable Democrats a wake-up call as they returned home for a seven-week recess \u2013 was also meant to give their members a clear sense that they can hang on to their seats if they emphasize a message they believe will break through to voters. \u201cWe are not afraid of these polling numbers,\u201d Tim Persico, the DCCC executive director, told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThey are not gloom and doom; they show a clear pathway to keeping the House. We have to be very clear about what the numbers say: We have incredible strengths. The Republicans have incredible weaknesses.\u201d Persico added, \u201cWe need to be more focused on what we are talking about and how we are talking about it. \u2026 It\u2019s not a question of alteration, it\u2019s a question of emphasis.\u201d But for some of the party\u2019s most vulnerable members, the fresh batch of polling had another effect: It crystallized their resolve to push back on votes that could make them more vulnerable back home \u2014 foreshadowing a potential intraparty clash to come as Democrats haggle over the price and scope of a massive spending bill for social programs that they want to pass this fall. \u201cIt reaffirmed our belief, and our urging of the DCCC, to make sure that leadership understands that they need to really listen to us \u2026 They\u2019ve got to trust us,\u201d said one Democrat in a key battleground district. \u201cIgnore us at your peril.\u201d Persico said that there are multiple ways to help the party keep the House, including approving the Biden agenda, which he argued was popular with voters, and the massive infrastructure package, along with touting their record on economic issues like middle-class tax cuts. Persico added that Democrats need to contrast that with House GOP efforts to overturn the electoral results in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 insurrection \u2013 in addition to comments that some Republicans have made questioning the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines. Sinema says she does not support $3.5 trillion reconciliation package Democrats plan to pass along party lines \u201cIt\u2019s great to know where you stand. \u2026 Information is valuable,\u201d said Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a former intelligence officer who represents a frontline district. The Virginia Democrat went on to argue that it\u2019s beneficial to have \u201cany sort of awareness that, \u2018Hey, there might be attacks that are problematic\u2019\u201d \u2014 especially after House Democrats were caught off guard last November and barely ended up holding the majority. Democrats say that their polling shows that clear majorities of battleground voters have \u201cserious doubts\u201d about Republicans after hearing about anti-vaccine views and their January 6 positions. \u201cIt\u2019s still resonant,\u201d Persico said of the Republican response to the Capitol Hill insurrection. \u201cAnd the vaccine (concerns) are new.\u201d Politico reported on the Maloney warning earlier Tuesday. Republicans have history \u2014 and redistricting \u2014 on their side in the battle for the House, as the President\u2019s party typically loses 26 seats in his first midterm. And the GOP only needs to flip five seats to seize back power next year. But Democrats are hoping to learn some of the hard lessons from 2010, particularly when it comes to better communicating their accomplishments. \u201cObamacare had a lot of promise back in 2009 \u2026 and did Democrats do a good enough job of explaining that? Obviously, they didn\u2019t, because the House majority was lost that year in 2010,\u201d said Wild, who noted that the health care law has only increased in popularity. \u201cDemocrats generally learned a lot from past midterms.\u201d Democratic sources say that the White House and Democratic leaders are trying to impress on their members that their policies \u2013 including higher taxes on corporations and high-income earners \u2013 are popular with voters. But some moderate Democrats are extremely wary, portending challenges that they face in getting their agenda through. And some Democrats fear that Republicans are successfully painting them as tax-and-spend liberals as they attempt to push through roughly $4 trillion of Biden\u2019s agenda after enacting a $1.9 trillion Covid-relief plan earlier this year. One moderate Democrat with knowledge of the conversations told CNN that \u201cthere\u2019s lot of anxiety about doing more tax and spending\u201d right now. While the Democratic source believes the Senate\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure deal could be helpful for their electoral prospects, the source says that liberals\u2019 hopes of passing a $3.5 trillion plan to expand the social safety net will have to be pared back substantially, something that would enrage the left. The failure of Congress to extend the eviction moratorium was a clear indication of the challenges facing Democratic leaders. Despite calls from some liberals in her caucus, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opted not to force her chamber to hold a roll-call vote that would put all members on the record about where they stood \u2013 and would have led moderate Democrats to vote against it and invite backlash from the left. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, who represents a Florida swing district, was among the members privately urging her leaders not to go ahead with the vote, saying it made little sense to go ahead with the extension vote when it had virtually no chance of passing Congress, according to multiple sources. \u201cShe believes the votes were not going to be there,\u201d said one source familiar with moderate Democrats\u2019 thinking, indicating that Murphy wanted the focus to instead be on pressuring local governments to dole out rental assistance already enacted by Congress.",

            "article_content": "J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist and best-selling author who last week entered the Republican primary for Ohio\u2019s open Senate seat in 2022, apologized for criticizing former President Donald Trump in now-deleted tweets. In deleted tweets first discovered by CNN\u2019s KFile, Vance wrote in 2016 that he would not vote for Trump in the presidential election and instead] support Evan McMullin, a former CIA operations officer who ran as an independent. Vance also called Trump \u201creprehensible.\u201d \u201cTrump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,\u201d he wrote in October 2016. In another deleted tweet \u2013 this one sent following the fallout of the infamous Access Hollywood tape \u2013 Vance wrote, \u201cFellow Christians, everyone is watching us when we apologize for this man. Lord help us.\u201d And in a tweet from March 2017, he wrote, \u201cIn 4 years, I hope people remember that it was those of us who empathized with Trump\u2019s voters who fought him the most aggressively.\u201d But as he gears up his Senate bid, Vance has changed his tune as he vies against a crowded field for the former President\u2019s base. The GOP primary to succeed retiring Sen. Rob Portman also includes Josh Mandel, the former state treasurer; Jane Timken, the former chair of the Ohio Republican Party; and businessmen Bernie Moreno and Mike Gibbons. Trump\u2019s centrality in the GOP fight reflects how the former President remains a political force in the Buckeye State. All of them are fighting over who is the most authentically pro-Trump candidate. On Fox News on Monday night, Vance said he regretted making his earlier comments and asked viewers not to judge him on his past statements. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd I ask folks not to judge me based on what I said in 2016, because I\u2019ve been very open that I did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy.\u201d Vance added that he thought Trump was a good president and that \u201che made a lot of good decisions for people, and I think he took a lot of flak.\u201d \u201cI think that\u2019s the most important thing, is not what you said five years ago, but whether you\u2019re willing to stand up and take the heat and take the hits for actually defending the interests of the American people,\u201d he said. Vance\u2019s scrubbing of his Twitter account and subsequent apology on Fox reflect how the Republican primary is turning on the question of loyalty to Trump. The knives were out for Vance before he even joined the race. Last week, Ohio Republicans received anonymous text messages blasting Vance as a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d The texts are similar to a flurry of messages sent to voters in April, denouncing Vance shortly after he announced he was exploring a Senate run. Once considered a perennial swing state, Ohio has trended toward the GOP for the past decade. In that time, Republicans have held every state executive office and the majorities in both houses of the state legislature. Since 2010, only two Democrats have been able to win statewide in Ohio: Barack Obama in his 2012 reelection bid and Sen. Sherrod Brown, who won reelection in 2012 and again in 2018. Trump, for his part, won the state twice, earning more than 3 million votes in 2020 and improving his share of the vote from four years earlier by 2 percentage points. Vance\u2019s political fate could come down to how he talks about his transformation on Trump, who he publicly opposed in 2016 in ways beyond his deleted tweets. During the 2016 campaign, Vance wrote in USA Today, \u201cTrump\u2019s actual policy proposals, such as they are, range from immoral to absurd.\u201d The same year, as it became clear Trump would become the GOP presidential nominee, Vance wrote in The Atlantic that \u201cTrump is cultural heroin,\u201d who \u201cmakes some feel better for a bit.\u201d \u201cHe cannot fix what ails them, and one day they\u2019ll realize it,\u201d added Vance. Deleting his old tweets are just part of what Vance is doing to reset his public position on the former president. Earlier this year, Vance met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. He also attended his rally in Ohio late last month. And his connection with the pro-Trump donor Peter Thiel may further help soften any bad feelings Trump could have for Vance. A spokesman for the Thiel-backed super PAC, Protect Ohio Values, told CNN that Vance \u201cbelieves deeply in President Trump\u2019s America First agenda and is laser focused on fighting for policies that will benefit Ohio\u2019s mighty Middle Class.\u201d \u201cOhioans want elected leaders with the spine to stand up to Washington\u2019s corrupt political class and we\u2019re confident that JD Vance is the only candidate in this race who fits that bill,\u201d added the spokesman. But national conservative movement, which has started to coalesce around Mandel, has already begun to weaponize Vance\u2019s past statements against him. The Club for Growth\u2019s political action committee, which endorsed Mandel in March, released a statement last week going after Vance. \u201cHe claims to be a Trump Republican, but in the short time Mr. Vance has been active in politics he\u2019s spent the bulk of it tearing down President Trump and mocking Trump voters,\u201d said the Club\u2019s president, David McIntosh.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The murder of George Floyd a year ago Tuesday by a now-former and convicted Minneapolis cop was the touchstone that set off a national reckoning over race and policing. That much-needed conversation is ongoing in cities and states around the country \u2013 and in the Senate, where a bill to create new national policing standards, like every other piece of major legislation, remains stalled. A lot of attention was paid last year to calls for redirecting police budgets toward mental health and social services, shorthanded as \u201cdefund the police.\u201d Those moves will be complicated by an increasingly visible and alarming rise in crime over the past year. More than 7,500 people have died from gun violence in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, including at least 471 teenagers and 120 children. In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed and the City Council and mayor cut down the policing budget, reacting to progressive calls to invest money elsewhere, the city is now seeking outside help to police the streets. Jacob Frey, the city\u2019s mayor, announced the need for federal and state reinforcements at a news conference Sunday, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The paper has also written that in the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s killing, the Minneapolis police began losing officers and has 200 fewer available to work. There were at least 12 mass shootings this past weekend. Crime is up nationwide, as CNN reported in April, looking at an uptick in homicides in major cities in 2020. Why is crime up? Here\u2019s what CNN\u2019s Emma Tucker and Peter Nickeas wrote, in a thorough report with data from cities around the country, including Baltimore and St. Louis: Experts point to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors \u2013 economic collapse, social anxiety because of a pandemic, de-policing in major cities after protests that called for abolition of police departments, shifts in police resources from neighborhoods to downtown areas because of those protests, and the release of criminal defendants pretrial or before sentences were completed to reduce risk of Covid-19 spread in jails \u2013 all may have contributed to the spike in homicides. Covid-19 seemed to exacerbate everything \u2013 officers sometimes had to quarantine because of exposure or cases in their ranks, reducing the number of officers available for patrol, investigations or protest coverage. It was difficult-to-impossible to keep physical distance during protests. Now, police departments are reeling, police officers are changing their tactics and the country is gearing up for an unpredictable summer as the country emerges from pandemic lockdown. Re-fund the police. The New York Times has a very specific look at policing in Los Angeles, where after George Floyd protests city leaders re-directed $150 million from the police budget. But in the face of rising crime rates, a new effort to hire 250 additional officers has the effect of re-funding the police. The politics of police are complicated. Nationally, Republicans have made the rate of crime in US cities a major part of their criticism of protests and calls for police accountability. Democrats are more likely to blame the fact that the country is literally awash in guns, and particularly appalling to them is the latest issue du jour \u2013 so-called ghost guns, DIY firearms kits sold in parts over the internet without oversight or serial numbers. What is all but guaranteed is that thousands of Americans will die from gun violence over the next few months. Summer is the high season for gun violence. Rising anti-Semitic attacks in the US. CNN\u2019s report cites attacks in New York and Los Angeles, which were condemned Monday by President Joe Biden. From the story: The attacks appear to be inspired by the latest round of violence in the Middle East between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas, with the perpetrators in one incident in Los Angeles being identified as pro-Palestinian men. They have added to a climate of fear in the Jewish community that has been exacerbated by conspiracies propagated by politicians in the US, said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene does not understand the Holocaust. Separately, in Congress, Greene has been criticized for repeatedly comparing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s insistence that lawmakers wear masks on the House floor to the Holocaust. This is what she said: \u201cYou know, we can look back at a time in history where people were told to wear a gold star, and they were definitely treated like second class citizens, so much so that they were put in trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany. And this is exactly the type of abuse that Nancy Pelosi is talking about.\u201d Republican leaders have declined to distance themselves from this absurd comparison. The Covid origin mystery gets more mysterious. A few months ago I wrote a newsletter with this headline: On Covid origin, it\u2019s spies v. scientists. That\u2019s no longer an accurate headline, since at least one notable scientist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, along with former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield, are not so sure Covid occurred naturally, which is the prevailing scientific view. \u201cI am not convinced about that, I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened,\u201d Fauci told PolitiFact\u2019s managing editor Katie Sanders. \u201cCertainly, the people who investigated it say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then infected individuals, but it could have been something else, and we need to find that out. So, you know, that\u2019s the reason why I said I\u2019m perfectly in favor of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus.\u201d \u2018State-sponsored hijacking.\u2019 The diversion of a Ryanair flight by Belarus, tricking it into landing in order to arrest a dissident journalist, has caused an international incident. The activist, Roman Protasevich, was traveling from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania, when the plan was diverted to Belarus, supposedly for a security alert. But really it was just so Belarussian authorities could arrest Protasevich. Western airlines are now avoiding Belarus airspace and some countries, like Poland, are suspending flights to Belarus. Olympics in trouble again. The US has advised US citizens to avoid travel to Japan. The Olympics, postponed from last summer, are scheduled to start July 23. Covid vaccine milestone. Half of US states have vaccinated half of their eligible individuals. Also, the 2021 vaccination map looks exactly like the 2020 election map, writes CNN\u2019s Harry Enten in a story I wish I\u2019d gotten to first.",

            "article_content": "Bipartisan talks over a cornerstone infrastructure package sit on the brink of falling apart completely just days before a White House-imposed deadline for tangible progress. Gone is what for several weeks appeared to be positive, if cautious, sentiment about the prospects of President Joe Biden and a group of six Senate Republicans reaching consensus on a deal to inject hundreds of billions in investment into the nation\u2019s aging infrastructure. In its place is a clear inflection point on talks that have yet to make the kind of progress to advance beyond Biden\u2019s Memorial Day deadline. \u201cWe continue to think there needs to be major progress by Memorial Day,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day\u201d Monday, acknowledging that getting a bill through Congress and to Biden\u2019s desk is a process. \u201cAll that is not going to happen by Memorial Day. But we really need to get this done this summer, which is why we continue to want to see, even just in the few days between now and the holiday, some real progress if we\u2019re going to pursue this path.\u201d The break comes at a crucial moment for Biden\u2019s legislative agenda, with a convergence of dynamics that, if mishandled, could threaten to torpedo the prospects of the $4 trillion in infrastructure, economic and social safety net spending he has put on the table. Several other key agenda items, from police reform and tighter gun laws to voting rights, are also stuck in slow-moving bipartisan talks. Key progressive initiatives stall in Congress as some on the left urge Biden to go bold, and go alone But on infrastructure, where both sides signaled a genuine willingness to try and identify a path forward, those involved say there is palpable frustration from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue that the significant divides on everything from the topline cost to what actually constitutes \u201cinfrastructure\u201d in the scope of any deal may be impossible to bridge. Democrats have for weeks debated how to thread the needle between the desire not just by Biden, but also key moderates in the Senate, to seek a bipartisan pathway without undercutting the ambitious legislative goals of the party that controls the White House and both chambers of Congress. \u201cHe wants a deal. He wants it soon, but if there\u2019s meaningful negotiations taking place in a bipartisan manner, he\u2019s willing to let that play out,\u201d Cedric Richmond, a White House senior adviser, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cBut again, he will not let inaction be the answer. And when he gets to the point where it looks like that is inevitable, you\u2019ll see him change course.\u201d But with the barest of majorities in the House and Senate, any misstep could cost Democrats the very votes they need to pursue the changes they campaigned for \u2013 and view as a necessity to have as accomplishments as they head into a midterm election year. \u201cWe all know there\u2019s a narrow window here,\u201d a Democratic senator told CNN. \u201cWe obviously want to make sure we\u2019ll have the votes with whatever we move forward on, but we also can\u2019t play the game where this drags out for weeks or months.\u201d Biden\u2019s top negotiators sought to accelerate the process on Friday, putting a $1.7 trillion counter-proposal on the table in a video conference with the GOP group. It was a reduction of more than $500 billion from his initial proposal and sought to outline a series of key areas officials said moved them closer to what Republicans put on the table. While a senior White House official acknowledged the proposal was still far from the $568 billion offer from Republicans on nearly every front, the proposal was designed to elicit some kind of movement \u2013 the kind of movement that hadn\u2019t materialized after two meetings between senators and White House officials over the course of the week. But to Republicans, the offer served to bolster a sentiment that has become pervasive inside the conference since early fruitless talks over Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan: that Biden himself may strike a deal, but his staff is firmly in a different place. \u201cBased on today\u2019s meeting, the groups seem further apart after two meetings with White House staff than they were after one meeting with President Biden,\u201d Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican leading the GOP side of the negotiations, said in a statement Friday. Republicans also point to divides inside the Democratic caucus about how long to pursue \u2013 and how seriously to take \u2013 any bipartisan effort as another signal for caution.   \u201cThere has to be an alignment of interests and both sides have to want to deal. The President and his folks want the big deal, but they don\u2019t have the votes for it. And as long as they don\u2019t have the votes for it, we have a window to get a deal,\u201d Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican, told CNN. \u201cThe people who are in the room truly want a deal, and I think the President does too, but I don\u2019t know how motivated the Democrats are up here.\u201d Those are concerns that senior White House officials dispute, noting in this case that Biden signed off on the counter-proposal and viewed a half-trillion reduction in his topline not as a final offer but as a way to jar loose a significant shift on the part of the Senate GOP group. \u201cThe President put forward a reasonable offer in the interest of finding bipartisan common ground that includes critical investments in our infrastructure to create middle class jobs and strengthen our competitiveness in the world, as well as cuts to his original proposal and a way to pay for it,\u201d Andrew Bates, deputy press secretary, told CNN in a statement. \u201cThe ball is now in their court to respond with a good faith counter-offer.\u201d Biden adviser: President will 'change course' in infrastructure talks if inaction seems inevitable Republicans, they countered, hadn\u2019t moved at all off of their topline despite their assurances to Biden in an Oval Office meeting that they would bring their own counter-offer to the table. White House press secretary Jen Psaki welcomed GOP lawmakers back to the White House once they produce their own counterproposal. \u201cThe ball is in the Republicans court,\u201d Psaki said in Monday\u2019s press briefing. \u201cThe last counteroffer that came from the Republicans came up, just came up $50 billion dollars. So, our concessions went 10 times as far \u2026 so the ball is in their court. The GOP group plans to meet on Monday to discuss next steps, but it\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s any willingness to put on the table anything that would reach the scope and scale White House officials say is necessary for talks to continue in earnest. One GOP source involved with the talks said their negotiators thought the offer was designed to get Republicans to walk away from the table. It\u2019s a sentiment shared by Republicans on Capitol Hill and one that underscores another existing dynamic \u2013 neither side, Republicans nor the White House, wants to be seen as walking away from the negotiating table. The White House also has to manage progressives, who have grown increasingly impatient with each passing day. To this point, Biden\u2019s left flank on Capitol Hill has given the White House the month to try and find consensus in no small part because Democrats are keenly aware it\u2019s necessary for moderate Democrats to see a serious effort at bipartisanship before they\u2019d open the door to the partisan reconciliation process. But the patience is beginning to wane. \u201cI am anxious about our ability to meet the President\u2019s stated August deadline if this delay continues, and I am concerned about giving the Republicans a chance to break up the infrastructure bill strategically into things that might be harder to support,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Senators have just one more week in session before the Memorial Day recess, a deadline that Republicans and Democrats recognize as a potential moment when both sides will be forced to evaluate if the bipartisan talks are fruitful enough to continue. \u201cWe have to have significant movement between now and the end of next week if we are going to be able to put a deal together,\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri, told CNN. There are also a series of smaller, bipartisan efforts underway. Over the weekend, Capito and Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware unveiled a $340 billion surface transportation bill that could serve as a potential building block for a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a series of smaller, bipartisan conversations are still ongoing even as lawmakers warn they have yet to find a breakthrough. \u201cThere are a handful of folks who want to make sure we try bipartisanship first, and I don\u2019t know if those folks feel like we have exhausted that yet,\u201d one Democratic aide said. \u201cWe have to wait for Manchin and his friends,\u201d the aide said, alluding to the moderate West Virginia Democrat. Democrats are still laying the groundwork for a scenario in which they may have to go it alone just in case. Here's what's in Biden's counteroffer on infrastructure Waiting in the wings, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, is prepared to work on a budget resolution \u2013 the first step in the reconciliation process \u2013 as soon as the White House unveils its budget. The expectation, according to aides, is that process will begin in June although that deadline could slip again if rank-and-file members want more time for bipartisan talks. Democrats on leading committees like Finance Chairman Ron Wyden have also begun rolling out proposals to pay for a robust infrastructure plan. Last week, Republican and Democratic aides also met with the Senate parliamentarian to try and iron out whether Democrats could use an existing budget to try and pass infrastructure with just 51 votes. Aides are still waiting for more clarity on what tools Democrats will have at their disposal. If the parliamentarian allows Democrats to use one budget multiple times for reconciliation, it would mean Democrats could potentially have multiple opportunities at passing bills with just 51 votes this year. A decision could come from the parliamentarian this week just as Democratic lawmakers will have to decide if they are ready to move on without Republicans. \u201cI would hope we can resolve it soon,\u201d Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin said. \u201cThere comes a time when we have to say, \u2018This just isn\u2019t going to happen.\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As President Joe Biden used the grand Washington stage to bemoan the Capitol insurrection as the worst attack on US democracy since the Civil War, a flurry of Trump-era flashbacks underscored the depth of the still unvanquished threat. Biden\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night was a ritual rooted in tradition and featured a President trying to coax America back to normality. To that end, the new commander in chief told lawmakers in the House of Representatives that America was \u201con the move again\u201d \u2013 emerging from a deadly pandemic, reviving its economy, and primed to recapture its role as a leader of nations and to take care of its own citizens better than ever before.   He made clear the scale of his ambition \u2013 not just to heal national divisions opened up by Donald Trump\u2019s tumultuous presidency \u2013 but to launch a new epoch in which government is a tool to raise the living standards and ease the plight of workers and the middle class. But the pageantry of political continuity created by Wednesday\u2019s time-honored address, albeit curtailed by Covid-19, couldn\u2019t quell the raging, inferno that Trump left behind for even a day. It was striking, and a little unsettling, to hear an American President warn that the democratic foundation on which the nation rests remains fragile \u2013 months after a majority of Republicans who sit in the House chamber in which he spoke refused to vote to confirm his election win. \u201cThe insurrection was an existential crisis, a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did. But the struggle is far from over,\u201d Biden said. Rudy Giuliani \u2013 once the former President\u2019s lawyer and one of the Trump acolytes who did so much to tarnish the democracy Biden wants to protect \u2013 threatened to steal the President\u2019s headlines earlier in the day. In a scene that once would have been considered outlandish but for the head-spinning uproar of the four years just passed, federal agents carried out sunrise searches of Giuliani\u2019s office and apartment. This, again, was a raid that targeted the lawyer of an immediate past President. Giuliani has not been charged with a crime and has denied all wrongdoing. The searches were in connection with a probe into whether the man formerly feted as America\u2019s mayor lobbied illegally for Ukraine while caught up in Trump\u2019s scheme to coerce Kiev to damage Biden, then a potential 2020 foe. Giuliani\u2019s efforts did not secure a second term for Trump, but the wider operation to discredit an election that Trump lost drags on, as a second flashback on Wednesday made clear. The ex-President\u2019s supporters won a court fight that will allow them to press ahead with a sham recount of election votes in Maricopa County, Arizona. The charade is being orchestrated by Trump supporters and one of the conservative TV networks that is undermining US democracy by highlighting the ex-President\u2019s election fraud lies. The court case was far from the only blast from the recent past that showed how democracy is in peril. Memories of a day of infamy on January 6 were everywhere on Capitol Hill on Wednesday night. Biden\u2019s speech came hours after CNN aired the harrowing eyewitness account of Michael Fanone, a police officer beaten by the mob, that refuted Trump\u2019s revisionism and his lie that police were greeted by \u201chugging and kissing.\u201d  The return of Giuliani to the headlines, continued attempts by Trump\u2019s orbit to discredit his fair-and-square election loss and haunting reminiscences of the Capitol riot raise the question of whether the Republican Party is willing \u2013 or able \u2013 to drag itself away from Trump. The answer, which the GOP appears to be answering in the negative, will have a huge bearing on the ambitious plans Biden laid out on Wednesday night, including his vow to try to unite the country and even to produce some bipartisan legislation. Hosting television anchors before his address, the President warned that he needed a partner across the aisle. \u201cI got to figure out if there\u2019s a party to deal with. We need a Republican Party, we need another party, whatever you call it, that\u2019s unified \u2013 not completely splintered and fearful of one another,\u201d Biden said. One of the key points of Biden\u2019s address was his striking warning that US rivals like Chinese President Xi Jinping were betting that the US could not compete with their rampaging autocracies. But a day in which Trump\u2019s long shadow yet again loomed over American politics underscored that the gravest threat to free political traditions and fair, untainted elections comes not from overseas but within the country. That it\u2019s necessary to stipulate which Trump impeachment is related to the raid on Giuliani\u2019s home is its own commentary on the corruption and scandal that boiled almost every day of the last presidency. It is also highly unusual for the Justice Department to execute a search warrant against a lawyer, let alone a former deputy attorney general who was the high profile lawyer of a former President. The White House said it had no heads up about the search warrants being executed, in line with Biden\u2019s vow to rebuild the wall that most presidents have maintained between the Justice Department and politics. But the obvious and huge political implications of the move likely meant that approval to go ahead must have come from the very highest echelons of the department itself. The hyper-sensitive nature of the case also led to immediate speculation about the gravity of the evidence investigators were seeking, since a raid against Giuliani probably would require a high bar to get the go-ahead. Giuliani\u2019s son Andrew, who is also a member of Trump\u2019s circle, claimed the raid was part of a political vendetta being waged by the Biden administration. \u201cAll I will say is this: To all Americans out there, our Justice Department should be independent on politics,\u201d the younger Giuliani said. \u201cEnough is enough, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot stand for this anymore.\u201d It will also likely not be long before Trump\u2019s media propagandists start to concoct conspiracy theories about a \u201cDeep State\u201d plot against the ex-President. But if a political interference was involved, it may have been to Giuliani\u2019s benefit since New York federal prosecutors had previously sought a search warrant but were met with resistance from the Trump-era Justice Department over the strength of evidence. Former Attorney General William Barr was repeatedly accused of acting more like Trump\u2019s personal lawyer than a neutral arbiter of justice. It might actually have been more politically advantageous for Biden had officials changed the timing of the Giuliani searches, given that they forced the President to share news coverage on Wednesday. Biden senior adviser Cedric Richmond said that the White House wouldn\u2019t comment on the move against Giuliani since the Justice Department was meant to be independent. But he also made a clear implicit comparison between the behavior of Biden and the former President who frequently used to openly call on the department to go after his political enemies. \u201cWe are very mindful that the people in this country have to have full trust in the Department of Justice,\u201d Richmond told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cThe President is not going to put his thumb on the scale or comment about any investigation, and the investigations should just take their course without political interference.\u201d Amid a current whirl of conspiracy theories, flagrant lies from Trump world and in the bitter overhang of the 2020 election and the last, aberrant presidency, Biden\u2019s toughest task may be convincing the red half of the country that\u2019s true.",

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is dangerous. The Georgia congresswoman\u2019s comparison of having to wear a piece of cloth on her face while she\u2019s on the House floor to Adolf Hitler waging a genocide that resulted in the slaughter of over six million Jewish people is revolting. While many of Greene\u2019s bigoted comments, such as calling the election of two Muslim women to Congress in 2018 an \u201cIslamic invasion of our government,\u201d occurred before she was elected to Congress, her vile belittling of the horrors of the Holocaust by suggesting they were similar to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requiring members of the House to wear masks on the floor of the chamber are more dangerous because she made them as a member of government. Earlier this week, Greene jaw-droppingly declared on a conservative podcast, \u201cWe can look back at a time in history where people were told to wear a gold star, and they were definitely treated like second class citizens, so much so that they were put in trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany.\u201d Then she added: \u201cAnd this is exactly the type of abuse that Nancy Pelosi is talking about.\u201d The American Jewish Congress immediately slammed Greene\u2019s remark and called for an apology, stating that health-related restrictions can never be compared with yellow stars, gas chambers and other Nazi atrocities. \u201cSuch comparisons demean the Holocaust & contaminate American political speech,\u201d the organization said in a tweet. Greene, however, is refusing to back down. \u201cI stand by all of my statements\u2026I said nothing wrong,\u201d she told an Arizona reporter after she and GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz held a rally in the state that perpetuated Donald Trump\u2019s Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Greene\u2019s alarming repetition of Trump\u2019s falsehood, along with her previous targeting of minorities, seems to be drawn from the Trump playbook. That it\u2019s dangerous can be seen in the undeniable data showing a documented spike in hate crimes during Trump\u2019s time in office. And his incitement of the Jan. 6 act of \u201cdomestic terrorism,\u201d as FBI Director Christopher Wray described the attack on our Capitol, was predicated upon that Big Lie. He couldn't take Trump's lies anymore It\u2019s impossible to know exactly why Greene invoked the Holocaust \u2013 besides perhaps a need for attention at any cost. But Greene\u2019s defense of these comments is potentially a dangerous demonization of Jewish Americans who don\u2019t agree with her views. \u201cI stand by all of my statements\u2026I said nothing wrong.\u201d Greene then alarmingly added, \u201cI think any rational Jewish person didn\u2019t like what happened in Nazi Germany, and any rational Jewish person doesn\u2019t like what\u2019s happening with overbearing mask mandates and overbearing vaccine policies.\u201d  Greene is now telling her supporters that \u201crational\u201d Jews should support her views, meaning only irrational Jews would be concerned by her comments that demeaned the Holocaust. You don\u2019t need to be an expert on demonization to understand how this could result in more vitriol by Greene\u2019s supporters directed against Jews who continue to denounce her comments. Greene can\u2019t be dismissed as a lone wolf bigot. She has a large network of supporters, as evidenced by her astonishingly raising over $3 million in campaign donations in just the first three months of the year. (In contrast, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez raised only $726,000 in her own first three months in office.) Adding to concerns is the recent alarming rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes arising from the fighting in the Middle East between Hamas and Israel. This is not the first time Greene has made bigoted comments about Jews or furthered dangerous anti-Semitic tropes. Earlier this year, Greene suffered a backlash when her 2018 Facebook post came to light where she claimed the deadly wildfires in California were caused by a laser from space that was possibly controlled by the Rothschild investment bank. As the Times of Israel noted in January, \u201csuggesting that the Rothschild family is conspiring to cause damage for profit is a longstanding anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, and one that is baked into the QAnon mythology.\u201d (Greene defended this post by incredibly saying she hadn\u2019t known the Rothschilds were Jewish.) Covid protesters must stop exploiting symbols of the Holocaust Greene also peddled another anti-Semitic trope that received less attention but is potentially even more dangerous. As the Times of Israel detailed, in 2018 Greene shared on Facebook a video advocating the White nationalist \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d theory that \u201cfalsely alleges that Jews are conspiring to undermine White-majority countries by bringing in non-White immigrants.\u201d This toxic conspiracy theory appears to have helped fuel the 2018 attack by the White nationalist \u2013 a man who posted messages that Jews were helping to transport members of migrant caravans \u2013 charged with the tragic murders of 11 Jews in Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life Synagogue. A number of House Republicans have slammed Greene\u2019s latest remarks. Rep. Liz Cheney, who was recently removed from her House GOP leadership position for calling out Trump for continuing his Big Lie, slammed them as \u201cevil lunacy.\u201d But by Sunday morning, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy was still silent. When Greene was involved in another controversy in February, he issued a statement that he \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned her past comments on \u201cschool shootings, political violence and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,\u201d saying that they \u201cdo not represent the values or beliefs of the House Republican Conference.\u201d He did not, however, join the 11 House Republicans who voted with Democrats to remove her from her committee assignments.  It\u2019s time for the GOP leadership to denounce Greene\u2019s despicable words in one loud voice to make it clear there\u2019s no place for anti-Semitism or any other form of fearmongering of minorities in America. Given the stakes, any Republican leader who stays silent in the face of Greene\u2019s continued bigotry must be viewed as complicit.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Meg Jacobs teaches history at Princeton University. Follow her on Twitter @MegJacobs100. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Read more opinion on CNN. The best thing about President Joe Biden is that he\u2019s old. And that means he can remember a time before \u2013 and not just before the rightward swing of former President Donald Trump or even the centrism of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. He remembers a time before small-government proponent former President Ronald Reagan, when Democrats stood before the country and said unabashedly that a big and bold government was exactly what the country needed. And that makes Biden an old fashioned New Deal liberal in all of the best ways. The number of times that Biden said \u201cjobs\u201d on Wednesday night \u2013 over 40 \u2013 was almost worthy of parody. But in some ways, it was as if he was making up for what\u2019s been missing in government for decades. Americans, particularly in the wake of the pandemic, suffered significant job loss. And Biden fully believes that job creation is one of the most basic functions of government. He also believe green jobs can be a part of the solution. The Green New Deal has appeal not just because of climate change but because of the potential job opportunities it offers. Biden said as much: \u201cFor me, when I think climate change, I think jobs.\u201d The last president who pushed solar energy, Jimmy Carter, said Americans were being too self-indulgent and needed to move away from fossil fuels. During the energy crisis of the 1970s, when supply shortages led to skyrocketing gas prices, Carter told Americans this directly: \u201cIn a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit communities, and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption.\u201d However, instead of pushing alternative fuels as economic stimulus and job creation, Carter, the moralizing Sunday school teacher and centrist Democrat, was shaming Americans for their consumerist ways. That went over like a ton of bricks. Still, despite Carter\u2019s shortcoming, he and Biden have remained close, and on Thursday, the President even visited him at his home in Georgia. But Biden has also learned from Carter what not to do when selling an idea to the American people. What grade did Biden get on his speech to Congress On Wednesday night, Biden understood that he had to offer \u2013 and provide \u2013 something more palatable. He reached back to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt because he was the president who, like Biden, was unflinchingly a proponent of the little guy. With one in four Americans out of work, Roosevelt came into office during an incredibly challenging point in US history. In the days after his election, as he was planning for an unprecedented growth of government to rescue the unemployed and transform the nation, Roosevelt confided to Frances Perkins, the first female secretary of labor, \u201cmy hope is that I can accomplish something worthwhile for the man at the foot of the ladder.\u201d And, in his 1933 inaugural address, Roosevelt asked for \u201cbroad executive powers against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were invaded by a foreign foe.\u201d The era of big government had arrived. Fast forward to the 21st century and Obama spent much of his administration talking about growing the country from the \u201cmiddle out.\u201d But, on Wednesday, Biden went one step further \u2013 saying it was not just about helping the middle class, but also about lifting up the poorest. \u201cMy fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has never worked. It\u2019s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and from the middle out.\u201d In a 1932 radio address, Roosevelt invoked \u201cthe forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.\u201d And nearly 90 years later, Biden was reaching for those Americans, too, when he described the over $2 trillion American Jobs Plan as \u201ca blue-collar blueprint to build America.\u201d He didn\u2019t spend time talking about the value of going to college and getting middle class jobs. Biden spoke about getting good paying blue-collar jobs. \u201cNearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created by the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree.\u201d  What\u2019s more, these \u201cgood paying jobs\u201d should be protected by the strength of unions. Now there\u2019s a throwback. When\u2019s the last time a president made a full-throated defense of unions in a speech to a joint session of Congress? But Biden\u2019s been advocating for the little guy since his first year in government \u2013 1973 \u2013 when the years of postwar boom came to a crashing halt and the energy crisis set in. Truck drivers, who transported the nation\u2019s fuel and food across America, were struggling to pay the soaring gas prices. When they rose up in protest, Biden was with them. Literally. He hopped on a big rig, traveled some several hundred miles from Delaware to Ohio, and said he knew why they felt \u201cangry and frustrated.\u201d They has been \u201cleft out\u201d and mistreated \u2013 and politicians has an obligation to help them. And that\u2019s what Biden did so brilliantly on Wednesday night. He stood before a hurting nation and said that government has a duty to help. And if Congress \u2013 and the American people \u2013 support his administration\u2019s initiatives, \u201cThere is nothing \u2026 nothing we can\u2019t do.\u201d",

View more opinion at CNN. Jeff Bezos has garnered headlines again for his comments on Amazon\u2019s taxes. This time it comes with a twist. Bezos is not defending Amazon against charges leveled by the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren over Amazon\u2019s less-than-zero federal taxes in 2018. (In 2019, the company paid slightly more than 1% of its profits in taxes.) Rather, the world\u2019s richest man is endorsing \u2013 albeit without a lot of specificity \u2013 the Biden administration\u2019s plan to increase the corporate tax rate and close down many of its loopholes to pay for a massive investment in America\u2019s infrastructure. That\u2019s good news for us non-billionaires. Biden knows his history. Democratic presidents have not fared well when increasing taxes. Bill Clinton raised tax rates in 1993. Although the increased revenue from higher individual and corporate taxes helped spur a recovery, Democrats got hammered in the subsequent midterm election that swept Newt Gingrich into power and gave the House to Republicans until 2006. And then the perception that the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, was some kind of tax increase led to an even greater pummeling the next time the Democrats held the House, in the 2010 midterm that ushered in the tea party and blocked the Obama-Biden legislative agenda for the next six years. The window of opportunity is closing fast on an Iran nuclear deal This time, out of the chute and needing funds for a host of long-deferred infrastructure projects, the Biden administration has put a laser focus on corporate tax revenues. And so it should. Wages have been stagnant for decades. But corporate stock returns have not languished \u2013 they have grown explosively. In the first three years of the Trump administration, wages rose 9%; the S&P 500 rose 42%. If we roll the clock back to 1964, the numbers become 852% for wages, unadjusted for inflation, versus 4,116% for stocks. Over decades, wealth has been beating wages by more than four times. What about tax policy? Ever since World War II, the American tax system has been increasing its burden on workers, they of the stagnant wages, and lowering it on corporations, those of the explosive growth. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s one major legislative accomplishment, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, was overwhelmingly a corporate tax cut. If we go back to 1964, we see America\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d of taxes \u2013 the individual income, corporate income and Social Security/payroll taxes \u2013 combining to amount to 14.3% of America\u2019s GDP. In 2019, the most recent year for which we have full records, the total was 15.1%, a slight increase in the total sum. It took a sea and land journey to prove to scientists they were wrong about physics But if we focus on the composition of the Big Three taxes, we see a more dramatic story.   Individual income taxes have gone up, from 7.4 to 8.1% of GDP.  Payroll taxes, the most regressive of the lot, have skyrocketed, from 3.3 to 5.6%.  Corporations? These big time winners from economic growth have seen their taxes as a percent of GDP plummet, from 3.6 to 1.1%. Corporate income taxes, which provided just about 40% of federal revenue in 1943, now account for only about 7% of total federal dollars; the individual income and payroll taxes, combined, come in at 86%. In sum, America is taxing work, not wealth, adding to the burdens that life is placing on our middle class. The Biden plan is smart.  It doesn\u2019t just raise the corporate tax rate \u2013 the proposal is to increase it to 28% from its current 21%, still below the 35% it was prior to the Trump cuts \u2013 but also does what the TCJA failed to do: close loopholes.  The Biden plan seeks a global minimum corporate tax rate, backed up by denying US tax deductions to companies operating in low-tax jurisdictions. It attempts to shut down \u201cinversions\u201d whereby American companies become children of corporate \u201cparents\u201d located offshore.  It attacks accounting tricks by imposing a minimum tax on a corporation\u2019s book value. These are highly technical matters that would have a beneficial effect: it would make companies like Bezos\u2019 Amazon pay something.  There\u2019s a time for everything, including to tax and spend.  Jeff Bezos gets it. Wall Street does, too; Goldman Sachs and others have come out with tepid endorsements or at least muted criticisms of the proposed tax hike. Most congressional Republicans will still cry wolf, because that is the nature of congressional Republicans.  But the wolves of Wall Street know better. If taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society, as Oliver Wendell Holmes once put it, it is well past time to get the richest corporations in the history of civilization to pay some fair share of them, before our civilization crumbles and collapses. Even the man with the most to lose agrees.",

Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s a look at the impact of this anniversary, plus everything else you need to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The FDA is considering whether to expand the emergency use authorization for Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine to include booster shots for all adults. A CDC advisory panel is set to meet Friday to discuss the same thing. However, some states aren\u2019t waiting for official sign-offs to start the process. Arkansas, California, Colorado, New Mexico and West Virginia have all expanded eligibility for Covid-19 booster shots to everyone 18 and older, six months after their second dose. The Biden administration also plans to purchase 10 million doses of Pfizer\u2019s experimental antiviral Covid-19 pill. The pill, known as Paxlovid, has been shown by Pfizer to significantly reduce hospitalization and death from Covid-19. It\u2019s not FDA-authorized yet, but the drugmaker says it will seek approval soon. Pfizer also signed a licensing agreement allowing broader global access to the pill. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. The House is expected to vote today on whether to censure Republican Rep. Paul Gosar and strip him of committee posts after he posted an anime video to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Biden. A censure resolution is the most severe form of punishment in the House and hasn\u2019t been handed down since 2010. So far, Gosar\u2019s Republican colleagues have mostly shrugged off the matter. It\u2019s a strong contrast to punishments some in the GOP are leveling against their own party members for breaking rank. Rep. Liz Cheney was recently disowned by her own state party for not supporting former President Trump\u2019s false election fraud claims, and some House Republicans still want to punish the 13 GOP members who backed the recently passed bipartisan infrastructure bill. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. Historic inflation in the US is driving up the price of gold and strengthening the US dollar, and investors and business leaders don\u2019t expect consumer prices to dip any time soon. Gold is a popular method for investors to guard against the long-term effects of inflation. Meanwhile, the solid performance of the US dollar shows markets are more confident in US growth relative to other economies, like in Europe, where rising Covid-19 case tallies are leading some major nations to consider new restrictions. In the UK, inflation rates are the highest they\u2019ve been in a decade, which could lead to Britain becoming the first major economy to hike interest rates since the pandemic began. Back in the US, the Treasury secretary now estimates the government will run out of money on December 15, not December 3 as previously predicted. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for two separate attacks that killed three people and injured 36 yesterday in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. (Note: In yesterday\u2019s newsletter, we misidentified who died in blasts. One police officer and two civilians were killed, police said.) The attacks bore the hallmarks of the Allied Democratic Forces, an Islamist rebel group affiliated with ISIS, police said. An ISIS-affiliated news agency detailed the actions of three ISIS fighters who it said were responsible for the suicide blasts. At least 81 suspects have been arrested, Uganda\u2019s President said. This is not the first time ISIS has struck the country recently. The Islamic State reportedly took responsibility for another blast in Kampala last month that killed one person and injured several others. The Philippines is gearing up for a presidential election next year to replace Rodrigo Duterte, who is stepping down after a single six-year term per the country\u2019s constitution. The race has led to high political drama that just intensified with the announcement that Sara Duterte-Carpio, the President\u2019s eldest daughter, will be the running mate of Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late dictator who was toppled in a 1986 uprising. In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately, but this alliance is a boon for both campaigns and could strengthen two powerful political dynasties. Experts say Marcos is favored to win now that the popular Duterte-Carpio is not running against him. Also in the mix: former boxing champion-turned-senator Manny Pacquiao, who says if elected, he\u2019d investigate members of Duterte\u2019s administration for corruption. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them.

Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. Democrats are still trying to decide how to bring down the cost of the $3.5 trillion spending bill, and highly-prized health care measures could be on the chopping block. The proposed package includes broadening Medicare to provide dental, vision and hearing benefits, and expanding Medicaid in the 12 states that refused to adopt the Affordable Care Act provision. Democrats would also enable Medicare to negotiate drug prices to help pay for these measures. However, it looks like the spending bill could have to be shrunk down to between $1.5 trillion and $2.2 trillion to appease moderate party members. (Remember, the package needs all 50 Dem votes to pass.) Even the most widely supported health care measures in the package have their detractors. Some fear that beefed up Affordable Care Act subsidies would eventually require a difficult rollback if they aren\u2019t extended indefinitely, and moderate Democrats and pharmaceutical companies have pushed back on allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. The US is now averaging about 85,000 new Covid-19 infections a day, which is down by more than 8,000 from the week before. Covid-19 deaths are also down. This could be an optimistic sign if the US manages to avoid a seasonal spike. It\u2019s possible, but Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts are still worried about low overall vaccination rates. While boosters are becoming widely available, there\u2019s also concern that an additional shot could widen the gap between vaccinated Americans and those skeptical of the vaccines\u2019 efficacy. Meanwhile, countries in the Asia-Pacific region are scrambling to place orders for an antiviral pill produced by US drug manufacturer Merck that\u2019s supposed to be an effective treatment against Covid-19. It\u2019s not authorized for use yet, but health experts are already warning it\u2019s not a replacement for vaccination.

            "article_content": "Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin dropped the axe on his party\u2019s agenda on Sunday when he said he would not support President Joe Biden\u2019s economic and climate package just as the White House is bracing for another Covid winter that is likely to further sour the nation\u2019s mood heading into a midterm election year. The West Virginia\u2019s senator\u2019s abrupt move was a sharp break from the White House and it infuriated progressives, who had reluctantly agreed to advance the bipartisan infrastructure deal earlier this year believing that Biden would be able to secure the votes needed to pass the Build Back Better bill in the Senate in short order. How months of talks between Biden and Manchin over Build Back Better broke down Manchin\u2019s split with his party underscored how the fissures within the Democratic caucus have often paralyzed their effort to deliver for voters. And while some progressives tried to rally their colleagues on Sunday not to lose hope and to press forward with negotiations to fashion the bill in a different form, the debacle illustrated how the loss of one vote in the 50-50 Senate could derail what Democrats have viewed as their best vehicle for creating tangible improvements in voters\u2019 lives before the 2022 elections. Biden campaigned on the promise that he would be able to build consensus in Congress and end the pandemic, but Manchin\u2019s defection could further undermine voters\u2019 confidence in the President\u2019s ability to lead. The moderate Democratic senator explained Sunday that even after months of prolonged talks with Biden \u2013 who he said was \u201cwonderful to work with\u201d \u2013 he could not overcome his concerns that the nearly $2 trillion bill would aggravate inflation when Americans are reeling from rising prices everywhere from the grocery store to the gas pump. (Democratic proponents of the bill and White House officials have repeatedly rejected that logic, insisting the legislation would lower inflation over time.) \u201cI cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried everything humanly possible. I can\u2019t get there,\u201d Manchin said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThis is a no on this legislation. I have tried everything I know to do,\u201d he said, adding that he could not explain the \u201cmammoth piece of legislation\u201d to constituents in his home state. White House aides learned about Manchin\u2019s decision from a member of his staff about 30 minutes before his television appearance, CNN reported, and the White House issued an unusually cutting rebuke \u2013 personally signed off on by Biden \u2013 after what they framed as a reversal of Manchin\u2019s stance in talks with the administration. White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted that Manchin presented the President with a \u201cwritten outline\u201d for the Build Back Better bill on Tuesday that was \u201cthe same size and scope of the President\u2019s framework,\u201d covering \u201cmany of the same priorities\u201d \u2013 raising hopes that the two could reach a compromise. She noted that the West Virginia senator had promised to continue talks in the days ahead. \u201cIf his comments on FOX and written statement indicate an end to that effort, they represent a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position, and a breach of his commitments to the President and the Senator\u2019s colleagues in the House and Senate,\u201d Psaki wrote. The economic and climate package includes a broad array of programs intended to help American families that Democrats were eager to talk about on the campaign trail next year, even though Republicans have already been attacking them over the size of the bill. It includes universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, child care assistance, a federally funded paid family and sick leave program and the extension of the enhanced child tax credit for another year. It would also allow Medicare to negotiate the price of certain medications administered in doctors\u2019 offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The bill includes tax increases on corporations and wealthy households in order to raise revenue to pay for new benefits. Democrats had planned to it using the budget process known as reconciliation, which only requires 51 votes to secure passage, meaning no need for Republican support. Here's what's in Biden's Build Back Better plan Despite Manchin\u2019s announcement, the Senate will vote on the legislation early next year anyway to allow members to make their positions known, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Monday morning, adding that Democrats will continue efforts to pass a version of the plan. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and was managing the package as the Budget Committee Chairman, demanded that Manchin be held accountable to his constituents. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have a lot of explaining to do to the people of West Virginia to tell them why he doesn\u2019t have the guts to take on the drug companies to lower the cost of prescription drugs; why he is not prepared to expand home health care,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, reeling off some of the benefits in the bill and how they would have helped impoverished West Virginians. In another sign of the open warfare within the party, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in a statement Sunday that Manchin had \u201cbetrayed his commitment not only to the President and Democrats in Congress, but most importantly, to the American people.\u201d \u201cHe routinely touts that he is a man of his word, but he can no longer say that. West Virginians, and the country, see clearly who he is,\u201d Jayapal said. But Democrats have been negotiating from a weakened hand, counting down the days until midterm elections that are likely to favor the GOP based on historical patterns and the President\u2019s low approval ratings. Republicans have relentlessly targeted the bill as the latest example of profligate spending by Democrats and Biden\u2019s shaky standing in the polls has raised questions about how broad a mandate he holds to make massive changes to the nation\u2019s social safety net. A Monmouth University poll from early December showed broad support for the Build Back Better plan \u2013 with 61% favoring the legislation. But polls have also shown that Americans are uneasy about how Biden\u2019s policies are affecting the economy. Three-quarters of Americans said they were worried about the state of the economy in their own community, according to a CNN poll released last week. 'A 50-50 Senate sucks': Dejected Democrats fret over agenda failure amid grim 2022 outlook Among the most concerning findings for the White House in CNN\u2019s poll was that only 30% of Americans said Biden\u2019s policies have had a positive impact on economic conditions; 45% said his policies have worsened the economy, and a quarter said they have had no impact. About 8 in 10 said the rising cost of food and other everyday problems were a major problem for the nation\u2019s economy. And consumer price inflation rose by 6.8% in November, a level not seen in 39 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Both White House officials and progressive Democrats have vigorously pushed back on claims from Manchin and Republicans that the bill would increase inflation. The White House on Sunday cited a recent Penn Wharton Budget Institute report that found the legislation would \u201chave virtually no impact on inflation in the short term, and, in the long run, the policies it includes will ease inflationary pressures.\u201d But that has not stopped Manchin from raising the issue \u2013 to the delight of Republicans who have hoped that inflation fears would torpedo the bill. \u201cChristmas has come early for all the hardworking Texas families that would have been saddled with higher taxes, child care costs, & prices at the pump if Build Back Bankrupt had passed,\u201d tweeted Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, reacting to Manchin\u2019s announcement. But Manchin\u2019s position led Goldman Sachs to revise its US economic outlook, with the Wall Street firm\u2019s economists stating in a research report that a failure to pass the Build Back Better legislation \u201chas negative growth implications.\u201d The firm now expects GDP to grow at an annualized pace of 2% in the first quarter, down from 3% previously, citing the \u201capparent demise\u201d of the legislation. As he announced his opposition to the Build Back Better bill on Sunday, Manchin said that leaders in Washington should be most focused on the arrival of the Omicron variant, arguing it\u2019s the thing \u201cwe should all be directing our attention towards.\u201d It was a grim reminder for a White House that had hoped to be through the worst of the pandemic by now that things are likely to get worse before they get better, further frustrating already weary Americans as they head into an election year. Noting how fast cases of the Omicron are doubling, Dr. Anthony Fauci warned on Sunday that the US is headed toward \u201ca tough few weeks to months as we get deeper into the winter.\u201d Only about 61.4% of Americans are fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And only about 29.5% of them are boosted, which experts say offers the best protection. Biden admin eyes a potentially stark shift in messaging around ending the pandemic The nation\u2019s top infectious disease specialist told Tapper that the rise in cases would significantly strain hospital systems, especially in places with low vaccination rates. He made another push for Americans to get vaccinated \u2013 and if they want to be \u201coptimally protected, get boosted,\u201d he said, while stressing that the nation \u201ccan\u2019t walk away\u201d from other mitigation measures like masking and testing. New CDC data published on Sunday showed that unvaccinated people face a 20-times greater risk of dying from Covid-19 than fully vaccinated people who have also received a booster dose. The data underscored the greater protection that boosters offer: unvaccinated people face a 14 times greater risk of dying from Covid-19 than fully vaccinated people do. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado all announced on Sunday they had tested positive for Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated and boosted. All three reported mild symptoms. Still, the rapid rise in Covid cases does not seem to be deterring Americans from their Christmas travel plans. TSA checkpoint data from the end of last week \u2013 including Thursday, Friday and Saturday \u2013 showed that more than 2 million passengers were screened each day at US airports, a threshold that is nearly double what those figures were a year ago, but still below 2019 pre-pandemic figures. Biden plans to meet Monday with advisers for a briefing on the latest developments related to the Omicron variant before a speech Tuesday where he plans to issue what the White House described as a \u201cstark warning of what the winter will look like for Americans who choose to remain unvaccinated.\u201d It will be yet another sobering message the President has to deliver after a year of disappointments for his administration as Americans head into the holiday season.",

The two Bluegrass State lawmakers spoke at length about the House GOP leader from California, who has broken with McConnell on a range of major issues over the last several months but who will be forced to work in tandem with him to govern if Republicans take back Congress next year. \u201cWe talked a lot about McCarthy there,\u201d Comer said, before adding of McConnell, \u201cHe speaks highly of McCarthy.\u201d With control of both chambers at stake in next year\u2019s midterms, the two top Republican leaders have increasingly taken sharply divergent positions on major issues dominating Congress, reflecting both the different institutions that they lead but also how they view the GOP\u2019s posture headed into a hugely consequential election season. With a 50-seat minority in a chamber where 60 votes are needed to get anything done, the GOP\u2019s longest-serving Senate leader has been forced to cut deals with Democrats and President Joe Biden \u2013 accords that have run into a buzzsaw of opposition from McCarthy and House Republicans. McConnell, more than 20 years McCarthy\u2019s senior, believes they can govern as the GOP fights tooth-and-nail to derail much of the Biden agenda. But in the House, where minority party votes are rarely needed by the majority, the 56-year-old McCarthy has positioned Republicans as steadfastly opposed to virtually anything backed by Biden \u2013 even if it means voting against legislation to fend off default, keep the government running or pour money into roads, bridges and broadband. Trump's influence looms over McCarthy's race to be next House speaker Looming over everything is former President Donald Trump, who has furiously attacked McConnell for months but whose support McCarthy views as essential to taking back the House and for his own chances to become the next speaker. And how the two men will work with a Biden White House in an all-GOP Congress if Republicans sweep the midterms has many on the Hill scratching their heads. \u201cGoverning in the majority is a lot harder,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican and former House member. \u201cThe thing about factions that I\u2019ve observed: They can be very effective in the minority, but they make governing very difficult.\u201d In recent months, their differences have become readily apparent, even as they have remained united against Biden\u2019s roughly $2 trillion proposed expansion of the social safety net. McConnell was one of 19 Senate Republicans who backed the sweeping infrastructure legislation, which McCarthy aggressively lobbied his members to reject. To avoid a government shutdown, McConnell backed a deal to keep the government open until mid-February, something that McCarthy and all but one House Republican voted against over concerns about Biden\u2019s vaccine mandates. And staring at the prospects of a calamitous debt default as soon as next week, McConnell worked behind the scenes with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to create a fast-track process that will allow the national borrowing limit to be increased on Democratic votes alone. The bill to create that new, temporary process was strongly opposed by McCarthy. House passes new debt ceiling plan after McConnell cuts deal with Democrats Asked about the fact that it was McConnell who cut that deal, McCarthy took a shot at Democrats. \u201cDemocrats had a long time to do it,\u201d McCarthy told CNN. \u201cWhy did they wait for the last minute to do it?\u201d But behind the scenes, McConnell tried to bring McCarthy into the fold. As he ventured across the Capitol last week, McConnell ducked into McCarthy\u2019s office for a meeting that lasted roughly 30 minutes. In the meeting, McConnell floated an idea to resolve the debt ceiling standoff by tying the issue to an annual defense policy bill, according to a source briefed on the meeting. McCarthy informed McConnell that the proposal wouldn\u2019t fly in the House and warned him that Republicans would \u201cbail\u201d on the defense legislation, according to a GOP lawmaker who later heard about the conversation. That idea was ultimately scrapped. McConnell left the meeting and continued to negotiate with Schumer. And ultimately, McConnell cut a deal \u2013 backed by Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2013 to fold the fast-track debt ceiling process into a more popular measure to stave off deep cuts to Medicare. House members were angry. Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican who is running for the Senate with a Trump endorsement, called McConnell a \u201cbig spender\u201d and said he would \u201cprefer someone more conservative\u201d as leader. \u201cBut he is who he is,\u201d Brooks added. \u201cIt\u2019s expected there will be disagreements from time to time.\u201d Rep. Billy Long, a Missouri Republican seeking Trump\u2019s endorsement in his Senate run, complained that McConnell\u2019s deal amounted to \u201cdysfunction.\u201d \u201cToday we find another way to be more dysfunctional,\u201d Long said. But when asked twice if he\u2019d back McConnell as leader if he becomes a senator, Long stayed quiet, appeared to shake his head and walked onto an elevator. Many Republicans in the Senate defended McConnell, saying the rules mean that 60 votes are needed to overcome a filibuster attempt \u2013 so 10 GOP votes would be needed to help avoid a default. And they said that the deal that was cut will ultimately hurt Democrats since they will be forced to specify a dollar amount that they\u2019d raise the debt limit to \u2013 likely north of $30 trillion \u2013 and pass that increase on their votes alone. \u201cIf they get the majority back and we do too, Republicans will be on this issue \u2013 and it\u2019ll be up to Republicans to deliver the votes,\u201d Senate Minority Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said of House Republicans and the debt limit. \u201cSo be careful sometimes what you wish for.\u201d Yet the disagreements have gone beyond the most recent policy disputes. In responding earlier this year to incendiary comments from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a hard-right Republican from Georgia, McConnell said her views were tantamount to \u201cloony lies and conspiracy theories\u201d and were a \u201ccancer\u201d to the GOP. But earlier this fall, McCarthy said he would reinstate Greene on her committees, potentially even \u201cbetter\u201d ones, if Republicans take the House after Democrats booted her from assignments in the wake of her controversial comments. And just a few weeks before McCarthy and his conference ousted Rep. Liz Cheney from his leadership team, McConnell told CNN that the Wyoming Republican was a leader of \u201cgreat convictions.\u201d McConnell's near-comic attempt to not talk about Donald Trump The divide in no small part has to do with Trump. While both McConnell and McCarthy voted against the Democratic-led impeachment effort charging Trump with inciting the January 6 insurrection, McConnell has stood by his criticism that the former President was \u201cpractically and morally responsible\u201d for the attack. McCarthy, however, walked back his criticism of Trump and found himself posing with the former President after a jaunt to Mar-a-Lago less than a month after the Capitol attack. And while McConnell now assiduously avoids discussing Trump \u2013 and even said \u201cnice try\u201d when asked at a recent Wall Street Journal event about whether they\u2019ve spoken since January 6 \u2013 McCarthy has no problem talking about his relationship with the former President. \u201cHe called up, he was on the golf course,\u201d McCarthy recently told reporters, when asked about the last time he spoke to Trump. \u201cCatching up. Wasn\u2019t even campaign [related] either.\u201d A House Republican familiar with the McCarthy-McConnell dynamic said the pair communicates well, even if they don\u2019t always move in lockstep or sometimes have different leadership styles. \u201cThey don\u2019t surprise each other,\u201d the GOP lawmaker said. The two leaders meet regularly whenever Congress is in session, another GOP source said. Still, other House Republicans have started to sound the alarm about the GOP leaders not always being publicly on the same page, directing much of their ire at McConnell. Kevin McCarthy has a huge challenge \u201cWe better stick together,\u201d said Rep. Brian Babin, a Texas Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that Republicans all march in one direction. \u2026 This is training for, hopefully, next session.\u201d But if Republicans manage to take back the Senate next year, GOP senators say much of the credit will belong to McConnell as he\u2019s navigated choppy waters. \u201cIf we end up in the majority, it\u2019s hard not to credit Mitch McConnell,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cEven if you have to take a bite of a crap sandwich every now and then, if it\u2019s engineered in a way that results in the majority, I think we have to acknowledge his role in that.\u201d But if Democrats keep the Senate, will McConnell hold onto the leadership post? \u201cThat\u2019d obviously make it more difficult,\u201d Cramer said.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden had hoped to return from the Thanksgiving holiday bearing good news about his moves to get the economy back on track, his administration\u2019s effort to fix the supply chain crisis and hopes for a holiday season where Americans could gather safely with families and friends. Instead, the President is stuck again in an uncomfortably familiar place: a zone of uncertainty. Elected by voters who believed he could create a new era of stability, Biden is facing volatile markets, Americans anxious about the health of their families and a vacuum of information about how well the current vaccines will protect against the new coronavirus variant known as Omicron \u2013 placing his administration in a \u201cwait and see\u201d mode that could last for at least a week, if not several more. About the only thing Biden can count on in this politically precarious moment is that he is still unlikely to get any help from Republicans in his effort to carve a path out of the pandemic by encouraging people to face down the new threat by getting vaccinated and getting their booster shots. Instead of greeting the Omicron threat as a moment for the nation to pull together and redouble mitigation measures to fight the virus, Republicans like Texas\u2019 Rep. Ronny Jackson, a doctor, leaped at the chance to gin up misinformation. Jackson sent a ludicrous tweet suggesting that Democrats had invented a new \u201cmidterm election variant\u201d so they could push \u201cunsolicited nationwide mail-in ballots\u201d as part of a conspiracy to rig the elections next year. Jackson was helped along in pushing that unfounded theory by Fox News personality Pete Hegseth, who told his audience to \u201ccount on a variant about every October, every two years.\u201d At this point, there has been no concerted effort by the GOP to push back on those dangerous claims. Omicron vs. Delta: More mutations don't necessarily make a meaner Covid-19 virus The President\u2019s difficult position was evident throughout his appearances Monday \u2013 from his pleas for calm, not chaos and confusion, as scientists try to learn more about the severity of Omicron to the lack of any firm pronouncements emerging from his meeting on supply chains with CEOs and leaders of major retailers in the afternoon. Both underscored that he is trying to lead through a time when there are more questions than answers about whether things will get better as Americans yearn for normalcy. Compared with last year\u2019s dismal Christmas season, Biden said during brief remarks at the roundtable that Americans now have \u201ca little more hope,\u201d adding that more are employed, fewer are worried about putting food on the table and that early estimates indicate Black Friday sales were up nearly a third since last year. But the White House abruptly postponed Biden\u2019s planned remarks about his attempts at untangling supply chain problems and Americans\u2019 frustrations with half-empty shelves after he heard from the leaders of companies like Best Buy, Food Lion, Etsy, Walmart and Mattel about how they were preparing for the holiday shopping season. His remarks were rescheduled for Wednesday, but he may not have much news to share, as many experts note that his proposed solutions \u2013 like building out infrastructure and increasing port capacity \u2013 will take time, even as he leans on leaders of industry to take extraordinary measures to get Americans\u2019 holiday presents to their doorsteps on time. \u201cA lot of what today was about was showing that he is responsive to the crises that he\u2019s facing, even if he doesn\u2019t have great answers right now,\u201d Democratic strategist David Axelrod told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Monday on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \u201cWe learned in the Obama administration that you can be doing a lot of things behind the scenes, but if people don\u2019t see you doing things \u2013 or at least talking about things \u2013 then they don\u2019t know that you\u2019re doing them, and I think that\u2019s why he was out there so visibly today.\u201d This is at least the third time in Biden\u2019s presidency when the unexpected twists and turns of the Covid-19 pandemic have upended his messaging strategy. US urges vaccination ahead of Omicron concerns, with experts warning even mild Covid infections risk stronger mutations Without much certainty on how well the US is equipped to deal with Omicron, Biden found himself delivering much the same message Monday that he has for months \u2013 begging the unvaccinated to get their shots while asserting that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, believes the current vaccines provide \u201cat least some protection\u201d against the new variant. Boosters, he added, \u201cstrengthen that protection significantly.\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019re tired of hearing me say this,\u201d Biden allowed Monday, but \u201cthe best protection against this new variant or any of the variants out there \u2013 the ones we\u2019ve been dealing with already \u2013 is getting fully vaccinated and getting a booster shot. Most Americans are fully vaccinated but not yet boosted.\u201d Given the political polarization around vaccines, however, there\u2019s not much reason to believe that Biden\u2019s entreaties will sway the more than 60 million eligible Americans who have refused to get vaccinated thus far. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation analysis showed that the political partisanship is a stronger predictor than other key demographic factors like age, race, level of education or insurance status \u2013 and unvaccinated adults were more than three times as likely to lean Republican as Democratic. Biden\u2019s more coercive efforts to boost the nation\u2019s vaccination rate through mandates were dealt another blow on Monday when a federal judge issued an order partially blocking the administration from implementing its vaccine requirement for certain health care workers in 10 states that challenged the rule. The mandate would have covered health care workers at facilities that receive funding through Medicare and Medicaid. While the case works its way through the courts, it will be blocked in Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. Cognizant of the partisan polarization around virtually all mitigation measures at this point, the President encouraged Americans to wear their masks in crowded indoor settings as they await more news about Omicron, but he said Monday that lockdowns are off the table \u201cfor now.\u201d \u201cIf people are vaccinated and wear their masks, there\u2019s no need for the lockdowns,\u201d he said. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued new guidance on Monday urging all adults to get boosted six months after the second dose of Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines or two months after the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Previously, the CDC had said only those 50 and older, or 18 and older and living in long-term care facilities, \u201cshould\u201d get a booster shot, while anyone 18 or older may do so. In its new guidance the word \u201cshould\u201d applies to everyone 18 and older. Though the White House did not offer a clear explanation for the postponement of the President\u2019s remarks on the economy and the supply chain issues exacerbated by the pandemic, it was clear Monday that Omicron has injected greater unpredictability into the economic outlook for the months ahead \u2013 another challenge for Biden as Americans worry about the price of everything from gas to groceries. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to testify Tuesday that the emergence of the Omicron variant poses risks to employment and economic activity as well as \u201cincreased uncertainty for inflation.\u201d \u201cGreater concerns about the virus could reduce people\u2019s willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions,\u201d Powell wrote in his testimony. Much of that will depend on the trajectory of the new variant and the severity of illness that it causes. Fauci told Tapper on Monday that US officials are in constant contact with their counterparts in South Africa, who first detected the variant. They assured public health officials in the US that they\u2019ll know within about a week or a week and a half whether \u201cwe\u2019re dealing with something that for the most part is more severe, equally as severe or less severe.\u201d \u201cRight now it does not look like there\u2019s a big signal of a high degree of severity,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s too early to tell.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. There\u2019s a new stage in the pandemic: Young children are eligible for Covid-19 vaccines, and the majority of American workers are being told to get them. These are steps toward getting out of the pandemic, which has now claimed more than 750,000 American lives. Average daily deaths have fallen to just over 1,000. One subtext of this week\u2019s election is that Americans are tired of Covid-19 restrictions in schools and elsewhere, concerned about pandemic-related supply chain issues and scared of inflation. Now, with nearly everyone eligible for a vaccine that is readily available and many being told to get it, patience with other protective measures and grace for those who ignore the science will wear thinner \u2013 even as fights over the vaccine continue to erupt. Long-awaited requirement for most American workers is here. The federal requirement, if it isn\u2019t stopped by courts, requires workers to be fully vaccinated by January 4. It affects the majority of American workers, specifically: How many workers is that? The requirement would apply to 84 million workers at large employers and 17 million health care workers, according to the rules from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Pushing the requirement to the new year is meant to avoid further stressing businesses dealing with labor shortages and supply chain issues heading into the holidays. Do workers have to get vaccinated? It depends. Health care workers must get the vaccine to comply with the rules. Employees at large companies do not. But if they don\u2019t, they must provide weekly negative Covid-19 tests and wear masks indoors. What about states that have outlawed vaccine requirements? The federal government argues OSHA\u2019s rule preempts state laws. This will likely be the subject of a battle in the courts. A Biden administration official quoted in CNN\u2019s report by Jason Hoffman cited emergency authority in the law that created OSHA, which gives the agency \u201cauthority to act quickly in an emergency where the agency finds that workers are projected to a grave danger and a new standard is necessary to protect them.\u201d RELATED: Fact check: Are Biden\u2019s vaccine mandates \u2018unlawful\u2019? How will the rules be enforced? That\u2019s less clear. Hoffman talked to an administration official who mentioned inspections of some workplaces but also said the government will rely on complaints from workers. What\u2019s the penalty for noncompliance? OSHA rule violations can include fines of up to nearly $14,000 per violation. Vaccine deception: \u201cYeah, I\u2019m immunized.\u201d Except he wasn\u2019t. You know who can afford $14,000? Aaron Rodgers. It\u2019s been confusing to watch professional athletes try to explain their immunization status. I was critical of Kyrie Irving in this space for suggesting he was sticking up for those who have no voice by avoiding the shot and sitting out the NBA season for now. But at least Irving owned up to it. And he\u2019s owning it with a one-man vaccine requirement protest. Rodgers, who should know how to answer questions after his turn hosting \u201cJeopardy!,\u201d slithered around the issue by saying he was \u201cimmunized.\u201d Whatever that meant to Rodgers \u2013 details are sketchy \u2013 it did not mean he had received the vaccine, according to multiple reports that a positive Covid-19 test and lack of vaccination have benched the quarterback. Go for it, Jordan Love. The backup quarterback, whose signing irked the golden boy in 2020, now gets a start because Rodgers wouldn\u2019t get the shot. This is fuel for the argument in favor of vaccine requirements. Very smart and motivated people don\u2019t want to get vaccinated despite all the evidence that it is safe for them and helps everyone else. The rest of us don\u2019t have backup quarterbacks or league protocols. Hopefully we all aren\u2019t out there deceiving people about our vaccination status either. Kids are getting vaccines! A new universe of 28 million Americans is now cleared to get a Covid-19 vaccine after the government gave the green light to a smaller dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use. There\u2019s now a crush of people snagging appointments at pharmacies and public health departments. To find the ones near you, head to the government\u2019s vaccines.gov portal. RELATED: How to get a Covid vaccine appointment for your child In my neighborhood, there are plenty of appointments available within a week. My kids are going on Saturday. Federal workers can take paid leave for appointments. But most parents won\u2019t get their young kids vaccinated immediately, according to an October Kaiser Family Foundation survey: How misinformation spreads. There\u2019s a viral fear that the vaccine affects fertility, although there\u2019s no evidence to support it. In January, 3% of adults surveyed by the Kaiser Family Foundation cited fears of infertility with regard to Covid-19 vaccines. In October, it was 66% who said they worried the vaccine could affect a child\u2019s future fertility. American medical groups, doctors and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all shot the claim down. Millions of people have been vaccinated, and it hasn\u2019t affected fertility or puberty. CNN published a fact check this week explaining how the rumor got started, how this mimics unfounded rumors about previous vaccines \u2013 which explains why it spread \u2013 and, sadly, why it\u2019s impossible to stamp out. Kids are less likely than adults to develop serious cases of Covid-19 that require hospitalization. But these cases do occur. Plus, vaccinating them will cut down on the spread of the disease.",

            "article_content": "There comes a point in every major legislative negotiation when a deal is in sight, but not close enough to be a sure thing. Significant portions are agreed to, even drafted into the text, but the outstanding issues are the most complex and in need of not just hardline negotiations, but often quite creative staff-driven legislative solutions. This is, for lack of a more eloquent term, the grind-it-out stage of the process. The vast majority of the time it reaches an outcome. But it\u2019s painful, arduous and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 time consuming. For President Joe Biden and Democratic leaders who are sprinting toward a deadline just days away, that\u2019s a real problem. The bottom line is Biden and Democratic leaders are still driving toward a framework agreement on a $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion economic and climate package \u2013 one substantive enough to clear the way for a vote on Biden\u2019s $1.2 trillion infrastructure proposal \u2013 this week. The goal of mid-week seems unlikely at best, impossible at worst. But don\u2019t expect leaders to ease the pressure at this point, making this a crucial day in the push toward a deal. White House officials and congressional Democrats involved in the talks are fairly clear-eyed on the moment they\u2019re in right now. They know they\u2019re on the cusp \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re five yards out, maybe two yards, from the end zone,\u201d one person directly involved in the talks said. But reconciling the outstanding issues in the next 24-36 hours is, in the words of that official, \u201cObviously a heavy lift.\u201d Yet the combination of momentum and a sense of inevitability are, to a degree, key negotiating tactics in and of themselves \u2013 and that\u2019s clearly the intent with Biden just 48 hours away from boarding Air Force One for Europe. There is one clear outcome targeted by the White House and Democratic leaders at this moment: They want a detailed framework agreement locked in by the back half of this week. That would allow them to pass the infrastructure bill by Sunday \u2013 the surface transportation funding patch deadline, the day before Biden arrives at the UN Climate Change Conference and a few days before Election Day in Virginia. Biden and his top negotiators had a clear strategy for a period of weeks: intensive talks with key holdout Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Beyond Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and their policy teams, those talks were shrouded in secrecy.   When a combination of progress and time pressure created the opening, Biden pivoted hard last week to open the door to the process to a wider range of congressional Democrats, with pretty clear success. But as critical programs and priorities are moving from scaled back to potentially out of the proposal all together, the need to ensure progressives stay on board is acute in this moment. The broader pitch \u2013 which progressive leaders have largely backed publicly \u2013 has been that the proposal, even scaled back, is transformational and more than anyone could have ever hoped for prior to now. Take it and call it a win. But the longer that things linger \u2013 and the more proposals that Manchin or Sinema chop away at, as leaders push to close the deal \u2013 the greater the risk becomes of defection or revolt. And to be clear here, it doesn\u2019t need to be the entire Congressional Progressive Caucus, and a chunk of progressives in the Senate. It can be just three and zero. Biden can afford to lose three Democrats in the House. He can afford to lose zero in the Senate. High wire. No net. It could take days to wrap this up. It could take weeks. The slim possibility this never happens is also still very much a concern and motivator right now. The expectation among more than a dozen Democratic senators and staffers on Monday night was that it\u2019s more likely to be the former than the later at this point, but anyone who is in the know right now is aware it\u2019s not entirely clear how this gets resolved over the next 72 hours before the President leaves for his foreign trip. It\u2019s a new week with renewed optimism, but the same problems are still there. Sinema\u2019s opposition to increasing the corporate tax rate and the top marginal rate on individuals was a major blow for the party as they sought to put this package together. But, Democrats are growing more confident that a collection of other taxes like a tax on billionaires paired with a corporate minimum tax could be a sufficient replacement. There also seems to be widespread support for the idea of billionaires\u2019 tax \u2013 at least in theory. The challenge will be unveiling this tax (Finance Committee staffers are confident they can do this by Wednesday) and then getting sign off from all 50 Democrats. There are so many outstanding questions about that proposal at the moment \u2013 and no clear sign they can be completely resolved in just a matter of days. Someone who has these questions? House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal. Asked if he believes the billionaires\u2019 tax would lead to a reliable amount of money to finance the proposal, he told reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s one of the challenges you have with it. We think it will be a challenge.\u201d He said he wasn\u2019t sure it would survive legal challenges, CNN\u2019s Manu Raju reported. To be clear, Wyden\u2019s team has been working on this for roughly two years \u2013 \u201chundreds, if not thousands of hours\u201d drafting the proposal, Ashley Schapitl, the committee spokeswoman, has said. To be even more clear, this is not a wealth tax, despite that being thrown around quite a bit these days. What it is, basically, is expanding an income tax to unrealized capital gains of a very specific subset of taxpayers. In this case, those with a $1 billion or more in assets or with reported income of over $100 million for three consecutive years. Politically, in the words of one Democrat, \u201cit\u2019s absolute gold\u201d \u2013 targeting roughly 700-800 billionaires and inviting Republicans to attack a policy that \u2026 explicitly targets billionaires. Policy wise \u2013 in the words of another Democrat \u2013 due to its lack of precedent, \u201cit could be transformative if we can make it work.\u201d It\u2019s the \u201cif we can make it work\u201d part that needs to be resolved right now, from enforcement, to implementation, to how to value more illiquid asset classes, to whether it\u2019s ripe for a challenge on constitutional grounds \u2013 all are open questions that will need to be answered before it can move anywhere. Prescription drug pricing Democrats are still not giving up on their efforts to try and overhaul how the government pays for prescription drugs. The original plan was a nonstarter for too many members, but a small group of senators is working on a proposal to index the price of a select number of drugs. The hope is that it could be a middle ground for people like Sinema and members who hail from states like New Jersey where the pharmaceutical industry is a top employer. Of all the issues up for discussion right now, this one is one of the trickiest for Democrats to navigate. Paid family leave The effort to convince Manchin that a robust leave policy is necessary? It\u2019s still firmly underway right now. The Democrats have launched a full court press on Manchin on this issue as CNN laid out last night, and it\u2019s part of a bigger effort here. But this is still a huge issue and one that would be a major blow to Democratic campaigns and messaging if it doesn\u2019t make it into this proposal. Climate One of the most important meetings Monday occurred between Manchin, Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Tom Carper, Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, Majority Leader Cnuck Schumer and Finance Chairman Ron Wyden. All of them are chairs in the Senate who deal with energy and climate, but only one of them is the hold out in these discussions. The senators huddled for roughly an hour on the Hill as they sought to reach an agreement on a series of provisions they could use to reduce emissions in the country. As one source described it, the meeting centered around two important aspects of the Democrats\u2019 climate debate. The first was what to do about $150 billion that was supposed to be used for a climate program that Manchin nixed a week ago. Manchin privately has suggested scrapping it from the bill altogether, but other Democrats have insisted that money needs to be used elsewhere. Carper, a Delaware Democrat, told reporters that it\u2019s his expectation the money will be used for some emissions reductions programs. A source familiar with the meeting told CNN that most of the time was spent trying to figure out what programs that money could actually be funneled to that would be OK for Manchin. \u201cWe can put runs on the scoreboard in a lot of different ways,\u201d the source said.  \u201cFor most us, we prefer to do the Clean Electricity Performance Program approach, but that ain\u2019t gonna happen. The question now is can we get the same impact through playing small ball.\u201d The health care sticking point (yes, there are a few) Medicare: It\u2019s not clear yet if hearing, vision and dental coverage will be included in this package. There has been talk of making dental a pilot program. There has been talk of making each entity a voucher program. It\u2019s not clear how or if this is expansion is going to make it at this point, despite the fact it is the signature issue for Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders. But it is clear that Democrats are searching for some kind of creative way to address it and keep some semblance of the idea into the package, officials and aides say. Medicaid expansion: There are serious reservations for some Democrats about expanding Medicaid by having the federal government foot the bill for states that didn\u2019t expand the program since Obamacare passed more than a decade ago. This has been a top concern for Sinema, but she\u2019s not the only one. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that is going to work quite frankly. I brought this up in lunch a month ago,\u201d Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana, said. \u201cPick a state: Wisconsin, Alabama doesn\u2019t have Medicaid expansion, but Montana does. Does that mean Montana goes and repeals its Medicaid expansion and has it paid for by the federal government?\u201d Yet this is an absolutely critical issue for several senators and the Congressional Black Caucus \u2013 so much so that Rep. Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat, privately called Manchin to try and persuade him on the issue. Georgia Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff is also pressing Manchin on the issue, CNN reported. To put it plainly, Democratic leaders have to find a resolution here \u2013 or they have a big problem. Under the special budget process in the Senate known as reconciliation, each committee is given instructions of how much they can actually spend in their committee\u2019s jurisdiction. Remember, the Senate already passed a budget that assumed a bill that was going to spend $3.5 trillion. But, now the Democrats are only going to spend between $1.5 and $2 trillion because of objections from Manchin and Sinema on the topline. That reduction has actually given committees a bit more wiggle room to shift programming around. So, for example, that means that some of the $150 billion that was going to go to the CEPP in Manchin\u2019s Energy and Natural Resources Committee could actually be used under the Finance Committee\u2019s jurisdiction for a series of tax incentives aimed and getting businesses to reduce emissions. This seems in-the-weeds or a bit off the path from the most important issues. But looming over everything that\u2019s happening right now are the reconciliation restrictions that will bite \u2013 and bite hard \u2013 if Democrats aren\u2019t paying close attention. By all accounts, they are keenly aware of it with every step they take, but anything that makes the process less complicated is a net positive at this point, aides say.",

            "article_content": "Listening mode is done. Informational meetings are over. Public posturing and private positioning are a thing of the past. Now \u2013 after what seems like roughly a dozen straight \u201ccritical weeks\u201d for President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping multi-trillion agenda \u2013 is the moment the rubber meets the road. Biden and Democratic leaders are driving toward a $1.75 trillion agreement that will unlock the votes for the separate infrastructure package \u2013 and arm Biden with two momentous legislative victories \u2013 as he departs for the world stage later this week. The reality remains there are a handful of significant \u2013 and thorny \u2013 policy disputes that still must be reconciled in a matter of days. But there is no question that in the minds of top White House officials and congressional Democrats, the time for busted deadlines or elongated policy deliberations have come to an end. The bottom line is that by the time Biden leaves for his foreign trip on Thursday, his $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill could be signed into law, with an agreement on a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package in hand. Biden told reporters on Monday, \u201cWith the grace of God and the goodwill of neighbors,\u201d a deal will be made before the trip, adding, \u201cIt\u2019d be very positive to get it done before the trip.\u201d But the former doesn\u2019t happen without the latter. And after a weekend of intensive negotiations from Wilmington, Delaware, to Washington, DC, the latter is still very much a work in progress. Still, with momentum and a clear (and attainable, officials say) goal, one source involved in the talks framed the moment like this: \u201cIt\u2019s time for an outcome. Period.\u201d Lawmakers have roughly six weeks until, short of action, the government runs out of funds and the US defaults on its debt. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju reported Manchin has told Democratic leaders he is open to $1.75 trillion as the topline for the economic and climate package \u2013 up from his long-held topline of $1.5. That is significant \u2013 and right around where White House officials and Democratic leaders have been trying to land things in the last several days. But Manchin hasn\u2019t explicitly agreed to that topline yet, two sources said, noting it\u2019s still a work in progress. Raju also reported that Democratic leaders are targeting a vote on the infrastructure proposal as soon as Wednesday. That will only be possible if a detailed agreement is reached on the climate and economic package. But, if accomplished, that vote would time out in a way that would give Biden a win the day before he departs for Rome for the Group of 20 conference. In terms of timeline, it\u2019s clear what Democratic leaders are driving toward, the intent of that timeline and the merits in hitting their target. But in negotiations like this, even over a detailed outline, here\u2019s a good rule of thumb: Always take the over. If there\u2019s a hard deadline for any infrastructure vote, to the extent any ever exists, it\u2019s Saturday, when the surface transportation funding patch expires (and the day before Biden arrives at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow). For the sake of accuracy, there\u2019s value to shorthanding here with the most overused adage on Capitol Hill: nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to. (It\u2019s basically the equivalent of someone saying \u201cit\u2019s all gonna come down to turnout\u201d in the lead up to the election. Yeah, no kidding.) So from housing to health care, climate to corporate taxes, things remain very fluid. But the key issues and thorniest holdups remain consistent: Medicare expansion It\u2019s clear dental coverage won\u2019t be in there, though the $800 voucher program is still in play, sources involved say. How they finesse hearing and vision, given independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has practically made it a redline, is hugely important in this moment. Paid leave White House officials thought they\u2019d figured out a way to thread the needle by dropping the duration of their proposal to four weeks from 12, and the overall price tag from roughly just shy of $500 billion to roughly $100 billion. But this is still subject of intense debate, sources said, and when asked about it on CNN, Pelosi didn\u2019t exactly give explicit assurances: \u201cThat\u2019s our hope, that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d Revenue This is now a negotiation between Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, White House officials and the chairs and staff of the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees. There are a number of options in play and on the table, according to people involved. They are listed below. There is still significant work to do on this front to fully flesh out and knit together the financing pieces of the package, people involved said. Climate The big question remains what happens to the $150 billion allocated for the Clean Energy Performance Program, which has been dead for several weeks. Biden said during the CNN town hall that Manchin was open to directing most, if not all, toward bolstering emissions-reducing tax credits and incentives. There are already $300 billion locked into the proposal. The shape of that final $150 billion is still an intense debate, people involved say. SALT Cap Critical for northeastern Democrats (including Schumer), this has been back and forth for several days. It\u2019s costly and primarily benefits the wealthy. But the reality here is without it, House Democratic leaders have made clear they won\u2019t have the votes \u2013 New York and New Jersey Democrats have been that explicit about the need for something on this front. It\u2019s still very fluid and a two-year delay in the cap is currently being pursued, people involved say. This is a good reminder that the topline here isn\u2019t all that White House officials have been working through with Manchin. The West Virginia senator\u2019s list of concerns straddles a large range of the Democratic programs this bill touches. The four weeks of paid family leave are still very much a concern for Manchin, who has strong ties to the business community. He\u2019s also continuing to push for means testing on a buffet of benefits that Democrats would offer to American families from child care to the child tax benefit. And then there is the energy provisions, which still are in flux. Biden told reporters on Monday that his meeting with Manchin and Schumer \u201cwent well. A few more things to work out, but it went well.\u201d Might as well put them here: taxes, taxes. taxes. Democrats spent much of the weekend working to formulate their billionaire\u2019s tax, a provision that is so complicated that the Finance Committee has been trying for two years to write it. Want to know how real Sinema\u2019s position that she won\u2019t raise the corporate tax rate? Look no further than the herculean effort that transpired over this weekend to finish up language on this billionaires tax and a corporate minimum tax. Her position is real and unmovable and, despite grumbling from House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, it appears that the tax provisions are going to move in her direction. Aides say they hope to have a proposal ready to unveil by mid-week. We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s not a great development to have a roughly $600 billion shortfall in your revenue proposals due to the opposition of one senator. Yet that\u2019s where Democrats have found themselves and the scramble has opened the door to potential tax proposals progressives could have only dreamed of just a few months ago. To be completely clear here: the process of vetting, scrubbing and including a proposal to tax the unrealized annual gains on the specific liquid assets of billionaires or those who report income of $100 million for three consecutive years is, in the words of one official, \u201ca real lift.\u201d Yet Pelosi told Tapper she expected it would be included in a final proposal and she expected to be publicly released Monday. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and his staff have worked on the proposal for several years, putting out the first white paper in September 2019, so it\u2019s not new by any means. But the questions of implementing a mark-to-market system ranging from the administrative to the enforcement to the valuing of illiquid assets remain very real at the moment, and not just from those who oppose the idea outright. If there\u2019s a positive to the slimmed-down proposal for Democrats, it\u2019s that it makes it does make it easier to finance. Still, losing the ability to increase marginal tax rates due to the opposition from Sinema is a big hit and his been one of the most urgent issues White House officials have been working on with their House and Senate tax-writing counterparts. Here are some of the top proposals in play, per people involved: An agreement on the outlines of the economic and climate package does not equal a done deal or a looming vote. While aides involved say significant pieces of what would make up the proposal are already written, the pieces that aren\u2019t, or remain only partially drafted, are the most complex and will be subject to significant debate (and negotiations) in the days and weeks ahead. This is often forgotten, the process of drafting legislative text is both time consuming and arduous, with ample opportunity for short-term breakdowns or potential deal implosions. If past is precedent, an agreement on the outlines will eventually lead to a final package and votes. But it\u2019s going to take significant time and negotiation to draft, even more to ensure virtually everyone in the respective Democratic caucuses is on board. A vote on the reconciliation bill is still a ways away, even if a framework agreement comes to be this week.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is tantalizingly close to fulfilling what supporters see as the historic promise of his presidency in the coming days, at a critical moment for his social policy transformation at home and his hopes of reclaiming US leadership overseas. After weeks of feuding between moderate and progressive Democrats and his agenda\u2019s several brushes with extinction, the President\u2019s double play of social spending and a bipartisan infrastructure program may finally come to fruition this week. Democrats hope to agree on a framework on a trimmed down package of social, health care and education programs in order to lift a House progressive blockade on a vote on the bipartisan bill fixing roads, bridges and railroads. Get up to speed: How the spending bill would change your life \u201cI think we\u2019re pretty much there now,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. A Democratic source told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju the goal is now for the House to have a vote on the infrastructure package on Wednesday or Thursday and send it to Biden\u2019s desk. The exact content of the final social spending bill is not yet known, since negotiations on paring back a more ambitious program to win moderate votes have been taking place behind closed doors. But Democrats still appear to be determined to provide free pre-kindergarten education, an extension of Medicare, home care for seniors and more affordable child care. Another uncertainty is the way the final package will play with the most progressive members of the House who had wanted a much larger spending blueprint and had held up the infrastructure bill as a result in prolonged standoffs within the Democratic Party. If Democrats finally agree on the makeup of the bills, and Biden manages to include billions of dollars in funding to slow global warming, he will get a huge boost on a foreign trip beginning Thursday that includes the G20 summit in Rome and the United Nations climate summit in Scotland. A strong environmental component of the bill is crucial to Biden\u2019s credibility as he seeks to put the US back at the front of the global campaign to save the planet \u2013 one of his top foreign policy goals \u2013 and would put pressure on other top polluting nations to follow suit. But Democrats are struggling to come up with replacement provisions after one of the moderate senators responsible for scaling back the package, Joe Manchin from coal-producing West Virginia, derailed a $150 billion incentive scheme designed to wean utilities onto renewable forms of electricity generation. In a further sign that Biden is driving the roller coaster drama over the bills toward a conclusion, he hosted Manchin at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, on Sunday. The two long-standing friends were joined at the breakfast meeting by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and continued to make progress, the White House said. Free community college is out of Biden's plan, but a bigger Pell grant could still help cut costs The social care package is expected to be far smaller than a previous $3.5 trillion proposal and the $6 trillion top-line number originally called for by Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who chairs the Senate Budget Committee. Sources told CNN Sunday that Manchin was on board for $1.75 trillion. The shrinking of the bill means it will be shorn of a number of popular proposals that Biden campaigned on \u2013 including free community college, which is a painful concession since first lady Jill Biden has long worked in the sector. But as Biden explained in a CNN town hall on Thursday evening, compromises must be made to pass the measure, even if there is not sufficient support among Democrats for all of the cherished programs. Even so, the passage of several huge infrastructure and social care bills would secure one of the most significant legislative legacies of any modern president. The programs could fulfill Biden\u2019s goal of using government power to tilt the balance of the economy back to working people. Original plans included funding for home care for sick and elderly Americans, paid family leave, free pre-kindergarten schooling and a flurry of other programs Democrats say will create jobs. And, if actually passed this week, the legislative victory might even give Virginia Democrat Terry McAuliffe a late boost in his gubernatorial campaign, which has been hit by lethargy among progressive voters, ahead of the November 2 content. \u201cIt is less than we had\u2026projected to begin with, but it\u2019s still bigger than anything we have ever done in terms of addressing the needs of America\u2019s working families,\u201d Pelosi told Tapper. The $1 trillion infrastructure bill, meanwhile, would honor Biden\u2019s inaugural call for national unity and for Republicans and Democrats to find areas to cooperate despite gaping ideological divides. One of the core principles of Biden\u2019s presidency and his effort to tame the populist anger that led to the Trump presidency is to show that government can be an effective force for good in the lives of working Americans denied the benefits of several decades of economic expansion. What Biden's sweeping social safety plan might include -- and what it likely won't Passing any large bill in an era when the country is bitterly polarized and operates on the basis of typically small congressional majorities is highly unusual. Yet Biden could walk away with nearly $3 trillion in infrastructure and social spending bills on top of an earlier $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue bill. Such a list of achievements may go some way to tempering Democratic angst after a brutal summer in which the President\u2019s stature took a pounding over the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, a surge in coronavirus infections, rising inflation, peaking gas prices, a mismatched labor market and a supply chain crunch. It would also allow him to argue to Americans that he and his party had made good on their campaign promises and leveraged a moment when they control power in Washington to make significant political change. Until now, there has been vast mistrust between House progressives and moderates in the Senate, including Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who is opposed to raising the corporate tax rate and the top marginal rate of income tax for individuals, CNN has reported. Such hikes were originally seen as critical to paying for the social spending plan. Pelosi told CNN Sunday that potential alternative financing for the bill could involve a billionaires\u2019 tax and IRS tax enforcement. How Biden's infrastructure bill could help prevent the next supply chain crisis The internal Democratic disconnect thwarted a previous attempt by the House to pass the infrastructure bill on the basis of a separate agreement by senators on the content of the spending plan. But there are signs that Biden\u2019s intense role in the negotiations in recent days may have eased that impasse. \u201cMy view is that the President\u2019s word, saying, \u2018I have the commitment of 50 senators, and those 50 senators are going to vote for this bill and here are the details, that that\u2019s good enough,\u2019\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna, a progressive Democrat from California, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think proceduralism will hold us back. If the President gives his word and has a clear commitment, that will be good enough.\u201d Biden\u2019s tough summer, which has taken a toll on his approval ratings, is one of a number of factors that suggest that even if he passes a multi-trillion dollar agenda, any political payoff may not arrive in time to save Democrats, who are facing historically treacherous midterm elections a year from now \u2013 not to mention a tight Virginia governor\u2019s race in just over a week. 'Tax the rich' plans at risk as Democrats' talks drag on To begin with, the bitter Democratic infighting over the packages, and particularly the top-line number, has overshadowed the transformation of social care that they contain. And given the secrecy surrounding the negotiations, no one outside the talks has a clear notion of what will be included in a final version. So the bill has so far been a hard sell politically. A compromise plan valued at around $1.75 trillion will also disappoint many progressive voters and could dampen their enthusiasm at the polls next year. It also remains to be shown whether embarking on a massive spending program truly reflects the will of voters, who, after all, produced a 50-50 Senate in the last election \u2013 in which Democrats can call on Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 deciding vote \u2013 and gave the party an advantage of a only handful of seats in the House. Such slim margins hardly represent a massive mandate for change in normal times. Republicans are already making such an argument the centerpiece of their campaigns for midterms in which they have high hopes of winning the House and the Senate and effectively preventing Biden from any other big legislative achievements for the remainder of his term ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cDemocrats are having an incredibly hard time getting where they\u2019d like to be,\u201d Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided that they\u2019ve got a mandate when there\u2019s clearly no mandate.\u201d   It may also be months or even years, before the spending included in the bills really filters through to regular Americans and begins to change their lives in a manner that is sufficiently tangible to shape their political decisions. It took years, for example, for the Affordable Care Act, passed by ex-President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president, to become popular and to embed itself in American society. In the short-term, passing that measure, which was easily portrayed by Republicans as a liberal spending and power grab \u2013 just as Biden\u2019s current plans are now cast \u2013 helped cost Democrats their edge in Congress. But in the modern era, with voters generally in a disgruntled mood and with power changing often between Democrats and Republicans in Washington, it is becoming even more vital for each party to maximize their achievement in the fleeting years when they are in control. Biden could go a long way toward realizing that goal in the next week.",

Nobody else can figure it out and she\u2019s not telling. This could scuttle President Joe Biden\u2019s entire legislative agenda. He\u2019ll be asked how to get things done in a 50-50 Senate when he can\u2019t marshal his own party during a CNN town hall Thursday night. What does Sinema NOT want to happen? There\u2019s a long list that\u2019s seeped out into the ether: Don\u2019t tax the wealthy. She doesn\u2019t want to increase the marginal income tax rate on the wealthiest individuals or roll back President Trump\u2019s permanent tax cuts for corporations \u2013 two Democratic priorities that share wide public appeal. That means Democrats don\u2019t have enough money to fund their promises for a more generous society. They\u2019re scrambling to find new options to pay for their plans. RELATED: Liberal backlash against Sinema grows on Capitol Hill as potential Arizona challenger emerges Don\u2019t end the filibuster. She opposes ending the filibuster, but Republicans refuse to work on Biden\u2019s priorities, which means the Democratic agenda is stuck unless she comes around. Don\u2019t necessarily expand the social safety net. Democrats\u2019 dreams of universal pre-K, subsidized community college, a poverty-erasing child tax credit and a climate change-fighting requirement for electricity providers now rest on her shoulders. She\u2019s said she won\u2019t vote for anything until a smaller, bipartisan infrastructure bill passes, too. It\u2019s stuck in the House, where leaders say they won\u2019t allow a vote on the smaller bill until the large one passes the Senate. Sinema\u2019s list of dislikes, without a constructive and public list of alternatives, is turning even some supporters off. Advisers resign in protest. When veterans who had been voluntarily advising her wrote a scathing letter accusing her of obstruction, she thanked them for their service, but didn\u2019t answer their gripe. Liberal turned moderate. The Arizona Democrat \u2013 a former Green Party anti-war activist turned stubborn moderate \u2013 has now been all over the American political map. In the 50-50 Senate, she holds incredible power. It\u2019s \u201cliving under the tyranny of Senator Sinema,\u201d according to Rep. Ritchie Torres, a progressive from New York. \u201cShe\u2019s all over the place and I\u2019m not sure she knows what she wants,\u201d said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat, during an appearance on CNN Thursday. \u201cNobody knows what she is thinking because she doesn\u2019t tell anybody anything. It\u2019s very sad to think that someone who you worked for that hard to get elected is not even willing to listen,\u201d Sylvia Gonz\u00e1lez Andersh, one of the veterans who resigned in protest as Sinema\u2019s adviser, told The New York Times. Joe Manchin\u2019s desires. I\u2019ve written more about Manchin in this space in part because he has been quite public about his desires. Manchin told Democrats to pick one of their social programs rather than push through three. He\u2019s opposed the climate change portion of their spending plan because he represents the coal state of West Virginia. He\u2019d like a work requirement for the big child tax credit that\u2019s meant to erase child poverty. \u201cDon\u2019t you think, if we\u2019re going to help the children, that the people should make some effort?\u201d he said in a September appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d RELATED: Joe Manchin wants to add a work requirement to the child tax credit. Here\u2019s what that would do. People can debate the merits of that position because they know what Manchin\u2019s position is. What could get Sinema\u2019s support for lower drug prices? A good example of the shroud around Sinema\u2019s thinking is the issue of prescription drug prices. Both parties want to lower them. Democrats want to do it by giving Medicare the power to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. Big Pharma says taking less money from Medicare would stifle innovation. Manchin is, improbably but incredibly, aligned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on the issue. But Sinema backs the pharmaceutical industry on this one. Why? It\u2019s not entirely clear. Rep. Scott Peters, the California Democrat, has become something of a champion of the pharmaceutical industry in opposing the Democrats\u2019 proposal. He argues that the government paying pharmaceutical companies less for drugs could stifle innovation at those companies. And he\u2019s up front that there are large numbers of pharmaceutical jobs in his San Diego area district. He also has a middle ground proposal to limit the number of drugs that could be negotiated and the amount prices could be dropped. Sinema, to my knowledge, hasn\u2019t made any arguments at all to justify her opposition, and in fact, she\u2019s argued in the past that she\u2019d work to lower drug prices. Her office told Politico she\u2019s \u201ccarefully reviewing various proposals.\u201d She has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from PACs and individuals tied to the pharmaceutical industry. That sounds like a lot, but it\u2019s less than many Democrats ready to vote for the plan. The other reason to lower prescription drug prices and raise taxes. Lowering the cost of prescription drugs is an important campaign promise by Democrats (Republicans have also failed to deliver on it), but it\u2019s also a key piece of their effort to enact new social programs. They need to save the government hundreds of billions in Medicare drug costs if they want to spend hundreds of billions on universal pre-K. Making matters worse for Democrats is that in addition to her opposition to giving Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices, she also opposes raising corporate tax rates that were permanently slashed by the Trump administration. Will Sinema back Democrats\u2019 voting bill? Democrats are also pushing a plan to protect voting rights by setting a baseline for state election laws. Manchin, who also opposes ending the filibuster, was instrumental in writing the voting rights proposal. His party hopes the obstruction by Republicans this week will convince him to make a filibuster exception in this one case.",

            "article_content": "Democrats aren\u2019t there yet on cracking a deal on a President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping, if now scaled back, economic and climate package. But the over the course of the next 36 hours, those involved in these talks think it is possible to get at least one of the two Senate moderates to sign off on a final and detailed framework. That wouldn\u2019t get them to the finish line, but it would be designed in a way that would secure backing of progressives and moderates in the party and \u2013 while more modest than once hoped\u2013 be defined by sweeping changes to the kind of benefits American families can depend on. It\u2019s not a secret who that one senator is: Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat. It\u2019s not a secret who that one senator isn\u2019t: Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. The Arizona Democrat \u201cis still very much a work in progress, and depending on the day we don\u2019t know what the work entails,\u201d one Democrat involved in the talks told CNN. But if Biden and Democrats can lock in an agreement with Manchin, there is a growing sense that it would be helpful in pressing Sinema to an agreement. At least in theory. The bottom line is that efforts to convince Manchin are and have been moving in the right direction for days now, with the senior senator engaged in a barrage of meetings around the clock on his outstanding concerns over Medicare expansion, means testing for various programs and of course, the very sticky issue of how to ensure the climate provisions in the bill will actually lead to the US\u2019 goal of reducing emissions. Democrats aren\u2019t there yet. The issues of what is actually included in this bill is still a work in progress and the very large and real problem of how to pay for it is rearing its ugly head. Aides on Capitol Hill are very cognizant of the President\u2019s CNN town hall on Thursday night, pointing out that pulling together a framework ahead of it would give Biden something to point to in terms of progress after weeks of stories and headlines about the bitter infighting within his own ranks. The forum isn\u2019t a hard deadline by any means, but as one aide put it to me, it does set up \u201ca nice opportunity for something\u201d even as no one knows exactly what that would be at this point. It should also be noted that final proclamations about a \u201cframework\u201d or \u201cagreement in principle\u201d at this moment should be looked at critically and carefully. Remember the agreement in principle on how to pay for the bill weeks ago? It was hardly an agreement at all. It\u2019s not to say that progress isn\u2019t happening, but the question is how to define it. To some degree the most tangible definition would be: Do progressives view it as enough to allow a vote on the infrastructure bill by next week? One thing that has shifted significantly \u2013 by design \u2013 in the last 72 hours has been Biden\u2019s approach. Through dozens of meetings and calls over the course of the last several months, he served as equal parts listener and explainer, cheerleader and extoller of the virtues of the package and its potential effect on districts, states or \u2013 most often \u2013 the fate of the country. There was sounding out of where members stood and clear efforts at times to nudge them toward a specific direction, but one thing he rarely did was reveal exactly where he stood. That has now changed, and it\u2019s not by accident. The combination of a closing time window, with progress made in the talks with Manchin, led to the decision this week to accelerate the process, officials said. It was a shift discussed and agreed upon with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who have continued to press their members to reach a framework agreement by the end of the week. Biden also communicated that he would be doing just that in private conversations with both Manchin and Sinema, one of the officials said. For all of the talk of Biden\u2019s congressional know-how, skill, savvy and innate sense of how members operate, this is the moment that makes or breaks his entire effort. This is the moment to close. For all of the momentum that came out of Tuesday, so did the reality that was long looming: Lawmakers\u2019 priorities were going to be cut. And they weren\u2019t going to appreciate it \u2013 at all. White House officials both knew this moment was coming and, in large part, think the problems are either solvable or just represent teeth gnashing before the inevitable acceptance. But this is a very tenuous moment -- any one member can send this effort spiraling. As one official put it: \u201cThis part of the process needs to be handled with care, and we know that.\u201d The question bouncing around more frequently at this moment, given the progress made with Manchin: \u201cWould Kyrsten Sinema single-handedly blow up Biden\u2019s entire domestic agenda?\u201d The calculation from most as they try to game that out is no. Sinema has made clear to the White House and to some colleagues that she wants to get to yes and will figure out a way to do so through her intensive talks with White House officials. But if she\u2019s not there yet, and everyone else is \u2013 what would she do if Democratic leaders move forward anyway? The biggest open-secret bombshell to blow into public view on Wednesday was the fact that Sinema is standing right in the middle of Democrats\u2019 long-held plans to pay for this bill. Fully paying for this wasn\u2019t a requirement early on, but moderates have pushed for it, the White House has obliged and tax writers have been working for months to find a way to deliver that. Sinema\u2019s position on taxes isn\u2019t new. The Arizona senator has quietly been digging in on her reluctance to increase the corporate tax rate and the individual rate for months. What has changed is the long-held belief that eventually Sinema would move off of that position and be amenable to some modest increases as talks intensified. She hasn\u2019t, and it has sparked deep concern within the Democratic ranks in recent days that it is quite possible Democrats will need to find entirely new avenues to pay for their bill. Biden nodded to this during his meeting with moderates Tuesday, according to one person familiar with the conversations, making it clear that this wasn\u2019t just a potential problem, it was a real and present one. It\u2019s possible that Sinema\u2019s position in the closing days of these negotiations could shift, although it\u2019s not likely she will ever support an increase of the corporate rate up to 25% as Manchin has signaled he\u2019d agree to. But waiting for Sinema to change her mind is a gamble when every Democratic vote in the US Senate is needed. As one Democratic aide put it on Wednesday, the scale and calamity of Sinema\u2019s position isn\u2019t fully appreciated yet within Democratic ranks. The options for paying for this legislation without raising the corporate tax rate \u2013 which has become a key tenet of Democratic messaging over the last several years \u2013 or a collection of taxes on wealthy individuals is limited. Right now, Democrats are leaning into proposals to increase taxes on companies that issue stock buybacks as wells as looking at ways to boost Internal Revenue Service enforcement, strengthen the international tax system, create a corporate minimum tax for businesses that operate overseas and increase taxes on billionaires by targeting their assets. But, aides point out that it is still not clear that collection of pay-fors can fully cover the cost of the Democratic bill right now even at its shrunken size.   At this point, Democratic members on the Capitol Hill are feeling that they are much closer to clinching Manchin\u2019s vote. White House officials involved are very much of the same view. That creates the potential for a new avenue to get Sinema on track \u2013 very clear pressure and isolation that could lead the Arizona Democrat to make some concessions and soon to get the bill finished. For weeks, many Democrats on Capitol Hill had made clear their preference in cutting back the Build Back Better plan was to shrink the number of programs included \u2013 not the funding, not how long they ran for, but simply to reduce the number of new programs created in the bill. \u201cDo a few things well\u201d is how it was summed up time and time again. It seemed the White House was attracted to that strategy too, according to multiple aides working closely with them. But the practicality of that idea has gone out the window as the scramble to get 50 Senate votes and almost all of the House Democratic caucus has intensified. Everyone likes the idea of doing a few things well until individual Democrats realize their thing may not make the cut. Now there is a new emerging fear from many Democrats who survived the roll out of Obamacare, or who watched the early issues with the Paycheck Protection Program, that debuting new government programs is risky and difficult especially in an election year. When you go through the list of what Democrats are proposing here, it is going to require massive amounts of implementation on top of what already was a scaled-up government effort to get relief money out the door from the Covid stimulus bills. Think about, from an implementation perspective, what Democrats are seriously considering doing right now:",

            "article_content": "Welcome to the end game. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to lay out the details of a significantly scaled back \u2013 and yet still sweeping in scale \u2013 roughly $1.9 trillion economic and climate package in a private meeting with nine progressive House Democrats was strategic, intentional and a signal that the talk of wrapping things up isn\u2019t just talk. There is still significant work to be done and the critical holdouts \u2013 Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona \u2013 still have not signed onto the plan, officials say. But, in the words of one lawmaker who met with Biden and short-handed the conversation: \u201cWe\u2019re not in listen and discuss mode anymore. We\u2019re in time to take action mode.\u201d Biden discusses $1.9 trillion top line for economic package and tells Democrats free community college is out The bottom line is that Biden and Democratic leaders engineered a clear pivot toward a resolution through a series of meetings and calls over the course of Tuesday. The next several days will be spent in the effort to agree to a framework on the multi-trillion economic and climate package by week\u2019s end. Deadlines have been set and blown by before. But this one may be different. In the words of one official, \u201cWe want it to stick, we need it to stick.\u201d House Democrats will hold a caucus meeting as the push to reach a framework agreement intensifies. President Joe Biden will travel to Scranton, Pennsylvania, to pitch his proposal to the public. Nothing is locked into place yet and everything remains fluid, but if progress continues to be made, a return visit to the Capitol by Biden is definitely on the table, multiple sources tell CNN. Here\u2019s what Biden laid out in the meetings, according to what multiple sources have passed along, with the caveat that the package remains very much subject to negotiation and that Biden\u2019s topline rundown wasn\u2019t, in the words of one official \u201ca full laundry list\u201d of what will be included. Senate Democrats, in their own two-hour meeting at the Capitol, appeared to emerge with consensus that a framework agreement should be in place by the end of this week. White House officials support that push.   But Biden laid out the timeline in his meeting with progressives and moderates, sources said. He can\u2019t show up to the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow empty handed. A lawmaker in the meeting called it \u201cthe most forceful case I\u2019ve heard him make on the need for an agreement on a specific timeline.\u201d \u201cHe needs something substantial to take to Glasgow, and if we don\u2019t get this done, it\u2019s going to be a huge dent to American credibility. He really believes that American leadership, American prestige, is on the line,\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said, noting that message delivered by Biden on Tuesday had made an impact on him. Biden\u2019s goal is to have a framework agreement on the economic and climate package in hand, which would clear the way for a House vote on the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill before he arrives in Glasgow, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Critically, sources tell CNN, he has made the same pitch to Manchin and Sinema. The stakes, in Biden\u2019s view, are clear \u2013 and that\u2019s become a, if not the, central part of his push moving now. There has been significant frustration from Democrats about the combination of being out of the loop on the talks between White House officials and the moderate senators, as well as the lack of concrete action. That was, as CNN reported Monday, intentional as the White House and congressional leaders spent the last several weeks intensively working to narrow down and reconcile the key concerns and differences. Sen. Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat who met with Biden as part of the group of moderates, put it best after the meeting: \u201cI think I told one of you nothing\u2019s happened the last 10 days. I think there\u2019s been a lot that\u2019s happened the last 10 days, I just wasn\u2019t aware of it.\u201d The most tangible development over the course of Tuesday was the subtle, yet very critical, shift in tone coming from the Democratic members who have held significant sway \u2013 or even control \u2013 over the state of play in the House. Red lines that had been drawn were blurred. Public spats that spilled into the open played out again behind closed doors. Yes, the details still need significant work. No, not all members are there yet. But, there was a recognition that something had to happen and fast before the President leaves for Scotland. It\u2019s a shift from where members were just before the recess, when Pelosi was forced to postpone a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill because factions could not come together. The impending deadline of Glasgow paired with the reality of a midterm election just a year away and the constant barrage of stories about Democratic infighting all coalesced and began chipping away at the resolve of folks who up until this point had demanded they get everything or give nothing at all. For example: Members of the progressive caucus started to say they may not need a full Senate vote on the Build Back Better package before they vote for the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Members in that meeting said that is because the President made it abundantly clear that any bill that he backed and said would have the Senate\u2019s support, would. Analysis: Gas prices are high. That could mess with Biden's climate agenda \u201cThe President said he is prepared to put his credibility on the line on a framework and guarantee that any framework he represents will have the votes, and I trust Joe Biden,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cIf there is more certainty in the process and more certainty in the legislation and commitment, I don\u2019t necessarily need a vote,\u201d Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat, said, noting he still needs more certainty than he has now. Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the progressive leader from Washington, also said that she may not need a vote if she has a real guarantee that moderates won\u2019t back out of voting for a bigger package. \u201cI have to see what the whole thing is, right, so we just can\u2019t say right now, but we\u2019re open to anything that moves these things along quickly, as long as we\u2019re really confident that it is actually agreed to in total,\u201d she said. In the last two days, Biden has met in person with Manchin and Sinema, and spoken to both by phone. White House and leadership officials have remained in a fairly real-time set of policy conversations with both. Biden's climate targets are possible without clean energy program, but will need tax credits and regulations At the moment, multiple Democratic members that have worked on this larger reconciliation package believe significant progress is being made with Manchin. White House officials share that view. The fact that the senior senator from West Virginia sat with his colleagues for two hours Tuesday in the private lunch wasn\u2019t insignificant. He voiced his views, he listened to others and while some of that may sound basic, it\u2019s an important component of helping colleagues understand just what Manchin will give and what he won\u2019t give on. A number of Democrats don\u2019t feel the same way about Sinema right now, who has similarly been a roller coaster for White House officials to work with at various points. Among Senate Democrats, there is general confusion about where she stands on a series of issues given the fact that colleagues point out she speaks directly with the White House and the President about her concerns. While Democrats were hashing out their differences in lunch Tuesday, Sinema wasn\u2019t there. Her office said she was in another meeting discussing the bill with White House officials. \u201cShe\u2019s been difficult,\u201d one Democrat told CNN. Manchin\u2019s continued opposition to a series of climate proposals including a carbon tax and the Clean Electricity Performance Program, which pays companies to convert to cleaner sources of power, isn\u2019t the end of including climate in this proposal. West Virginia's reliance on coal is getting more expensive, and Joe Manchin's constituents are footing the bill With Manchin\u2019s opposition crystallizing behind the scenes, an effort has been underway to use the tax code as a way to meet the US\u2019s climate goals with Finance Chairman Ron Wyden taking the lead in many of those tax programs. How that comes together is still not clear and members say the President was clear that this is still a work in progress, but Biden did make his commitment known on the climate front, something that has helped ease concerns for members who have vowed to vote against a reconciliation package if it does not include significant efforts to reduce emissions.

            "article_content": "The race is on to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania state Rep. Summer Lee, a leading progressive organizer and democratic socialist, formally entered the primary in the state\u2019s 18th Congressional District on Tuesday with the support of Justice Democrats, the group that launched New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s first run and has helped send a new generation of young leftist lawmakers to Capitol Hill. It became an open-seat race when Doyle announced on Monday that he would not seek reelection next year. But the precise challenge ahead for Lee is unclear, as redistricting is expected to re-write the borders of a district that currently encompasses Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs and as additional candidates consider entering the contest, which already includes law professor Jerry Dickinson. Despite the uncertainty, Lee is hopeful that the region will continue its recent trend of electing progressive outsiders \u2013 a run of success for the left in Western Pennsylvania that she and a close ally, state Rep. Sara Innamorato, were instrumental in sparking when they ousted a pair of longtime statehouse incumbents in 2018 primaries. In May, progressives scored another big win when state Rep. Ed Gainey, whom Lee endorsed early and organized behind, defeated two-term Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto for the city\u2019s Democratic mayoral nomination. Doyle, first elected in 1994 and the dean of the Pennsylvania House delegation, announced plans to retire at the end of his term less than 24 hours before Lee kicked off her campaign, which had been rumored for some time. Her Federal Election Commission paperwork came in before Doyle made official his plans to depart. His decision spares him a potentially competitive primary. In an interview, Lee called Doyle\u2019s announcement a \u201cpleasant surprise,\u201d but insisted her message would not change. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to believe in something ideologically, to understand the need for health care for all, to understand the need for a sustainable economy. It\u2019s another thing to live it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAnd I think that that\u2019s the thing that we need to see more in races like this \u2013 the lived experiences and the perspective that comes from living out these policy decisions.\u201d She also expressed some concern over the shape of the district she hopes to represent as its lines are redrawn. In his retirement speech, Doyle said he expected the process to \u201cpush part of it outside Allegheny County.\u201d There will be no incumbents running in either the 18th or neighboring 17th Districts next year, with Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb running for Senate instead of reelection to the House. Lee said she was worried that Pittsburgh might be sliced and diced. \u201cWhen you split the second largest population of Black and brown folks in the Commonwealth, when you split the second largest urban area, that\u2019s also a gerrymander,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will say that whichever way our district grows, we know our region. And I think that we are able to play in this region, whatever district or two districts come out of it.\u201d Doyle on Monday said he believed the time had come \u201cto pass the torch to the next generation\u201d of leaders, but only after pointedly insisting he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that he would have won another term if he sought it. The timing of his announcement, he added, was designed in part to broaden the field of potential replacements. \u201cThere are many people who might not consider running if they thought I was going to run,\u201d Doyle said, \u201cso I want to give them the time and opportunity to do so.\u201d Lee was not among those who, as Doyle suggested, might have been cowed by the specter of challenging a longtime incumbent. \u201cWe have a vast district where we\u2019ve had an incumbent who has rarely faced serious challenges until very recently,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what that does is it limits the opportunity for new perspectives to come forth and new ideas to be considered.\u201d If she succeeds, Lee told CNN, she is prepared to join forces with the House\u2019s increasingly influential Progressive Caucus, which is currently locked in a standoff with moderate and centrist Democrats over the size and scope of President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending package, which could include provisions like universal child care, the expansion of Medicare, lower drug prices and an ambitious plan to combat climate change. Lee said observing the fight from afar has been heartening \u2013 as progressives hold their ground \u2013 and \u201cdiscouraging,\u201d as she pointed to Democratic members who oppose or want to shrink some of the bill\u2019s most broadly popular pieces. \u201cWe were sent here to fight for those investments, sent here to fight like hell for our community, our people. We hope that we wouldn\u2019t have to, with the majority, fight that way, but it is good to see,\u201d Lee said of progressives on Capitol Hill. \u201cSome people say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just the Squad,\u2019 but this is not that instance. There are more folks in the Progressive Caucus that are fighting \u2026 that\u2019s what we need.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden\u2019s brand of crisis leadership is becoming rather familiar \u2013 and even a little stale. Whether it\u2019s over a grim turn in the coronavirus pandemic, yet another roadblock to his congressional agenda, the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan or a supply chain crunch that\u2019s strangling the economy, Biden\u2019s public response is often similar \u2013 and it\u2019s keeping him out of sight of everyday Americans whose support he needs to muster his agenda through Congress. He has fallen into a pattern of delivering short, televised speeches from one of the state rooms in the White House or elsewhere in the presidential complex. After his $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan and $3.5 trillion spending plan failed to make it through Congress earlier this month, Biden vowed to travel the country to sell Americans on his vision. He has made several recent trips \u2013 to Michigan to tout large-scale investment in the economy and to Illinois to push his spending plans and vaccine mandates \u2013 and he\u2019s off to Connecticut on Friday. But there\u2019s no sign of a barnstorming coast-to-coast presidential tour or a relentless daily coordinated messaging push to shake Democrats out of the schism over his agenda that is raising doubts about the party\u2019s capacity to lead. As he tries to coax two moderate Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, to deal with frustrated House progressives, the President has failed to do what would help him most: drum up popular support needed to make a deal.   Biden\u2019s lack of visibility worked better than anyone expected during the 2020 campaign, when he largely stuck to choreographed, virtual events during the first year of the Covid-19 crisis. His statesmanlike appearances contrasted with wild, super spreader rallies held by then-President Donald Trump that were key to alienating moderate, independent and suburban voters who helped decide the election. Early in Biden\u2019s presidency, the contrast with Trump and Biden\u2019s restrained leadership produced a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue plan to crown his first 100 days. But with the economy struggling to get Americans back to work after the Delta variant powered a resurgence of the virus, many Americans battling against inflation, and his own approval ratings ebbing after remaining consistently strong early on, it\u2019s fair to ask whether the President\u2019s method is beginning to wear thin. Biden made clear all along that after the tumult of Trump\u2019s term, he wanted to restore the dignity of his office. Unlike Trump, he feels little need to assault the American psyche 24 hours a day. If he manages to finally pass the spending bill and the infrastructure package, he will have twin pillars of what could be an impressive domestic legacy. If the economy finally shakes off the pandemic next year, his fortunes could rise. But there is a growing sense of drift, especially on the legislative agenda as progressives and moderate Democrats feuding over the make-up of the spending plan seem no closer to agreement. If the impasse lasts much past the end of the year, it would hamper Democratic candidates who need a strong record to present to voters in midterm elections that are historically brutal for first-term presidents. And warnings by key lawmakers \u2013 and a new poll by CNN \u2013 suggest that even after months of debate, many Americans don\u2019t know what is in the massive Biden congressional agenda. \u201cThere is a messaging problem and we keep trying to move it right back to, what are the elements that we are talking about?\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said on Wednesday. In an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom,\u201d the Washington state Democrat listed measures including universal child care, affordable housing, hearing and dental benefits for seniors and lower prescription drug prices. \u201cThe minute you tell somebody that that is what in there, they go, \u2018Oh, well that would make a transformational difference for me,\u2019\u201d she said. A new CNN/SSRS poll released on Wednesday found that only 25% of Americans believe their family would be better off with the passage of Biden\u2019s $3.5 trillion social spending bill and a $1 trillion infrastructure measure. Some 32% said they would be worse off and 43% say that they would be about the same. Majorities of key constituencies of the Democratic coalition \u2013 including independent women, Black people, Latinos, and those younger than 35 \u2013 say they would not be affected by these bills. Biden has played an intense behind-the-scenes role in trying to bring Democrats together to finally pass hugely ambitious bills to reshape the economy to favor working Americans. The bipartisan measure would mend roads, bridges and transportation systems. The bigger proposal, opposed by the GOP and likely to be scaled back to appease moderate Democrats, would provide universal Pre-K, improve home health care for sick and elderly Americans, add hearing and dental coverage to Medicare and transform the economy to battle global warming. Sense of urgency grips the White House with Biden facing crises on many fronts The White House often points out that key ingredients of Biden\u2019s plan, like expanding health care, overhauling infrastructure, and enhancing paid leave and access to college, are popular when they get their own turn in the spotlight. But so far, the go-big approach is not working. \u201cMost voters could not tell you what is in these bills,\u201d Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster and strategist, said on \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not because they are dumb. It\u2019s not because they are lazy. It\u2019s because Democrats have done a horrendous job of messaging about them.\u201d The difficulty Democrats have experienced in teasing out the purpose of the spending bill, especially, has focused the political fight in Washington on top-line costs. That has played into the hands of moderate Democratic senators like Manchin and Sinema. It has also offered an opening to Republicans who are already running a midterm election campaign partly rooted in their claims of out-of-control \u201csocialist\u201d spending by Democrats. That\u2019s why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stresses that it\u2019s time for her party to focus on the content of the spending bill and not its dollar figure. Confusion about the programs revealed by the CNN poll may also reflect the disinterest of voters in weeks of inside-the-Beltway haggling over the proposals. Some Democrats have blamed the media for focusing on the drama of the battle in Congress, pitting factions of the party against one another. Yet mainstream media outlets have carried plenty of information about the contents of the bills. At some point, it becomes incumbent on the political party trying to pass the bills to sell them. While some observers were shocked at the audacity of the Biden proposals when they were stacked up together, individual details were often touted in his 2020 campaign speeches and on his website. So he can argue that he built his presidency on passing them. But to get their priorities through, presidents have to spend the capital they won on the campaign trail and replenish it while in office \u2013 a much harder task. So far this month, Biden made that Michigan trip on October 5, visiting the district of vulnerable Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin. A later visit to Illinois was mainly to promote vaccine mandates. He has addressed the benefits of his programs from the White House in televised events. For instance, in a speech on Wednesday responding to the supply chain crunch that is spiking inflation and hurting the economy, Biden said: \u201cI\u2019m pushing for a once in a generation investment in our infrastructure and our people with my infrastructure bill and my Build Back Better Act.\u201d Biden's 'tough month' looms over Democratic campaigns in 2021 \u201cThese bills would transform our ports, there\u2019s \u2026 billions of dollars for ports, highways, rail systems that sorely need upgrading and would bring products faster with more efficiency from the factories to the store, to your house,\u201d Biden said. Biden is not the first president to be accused of falling short on the sales job. His former boss, President Barack Obama, faced similar criticism as he struggled to pass the Affordable Care Act and Democrats in Congress suffered a bloodbath soon after. But in subsequent years, that law became more popular as Americans began to experience its role in their lives. Many Democrats believe that something similar could happen to the Biden \u2013 if his agenda passes \u2013 and that it will prove so popular that future Republican Congresses will have no option but to keep many of its proposals. There is one notable bright spot for Biden in the CNN poll. His approval rating is still at 50% \u2013 higher than in some recent surveys after a tough summer that featured a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and a raging resurgence of the Delta variant of Covid-19. That\u2019s not great for an incumbent heading into a midterm election year. But it\u2019s not disastrous given the stark divides in the country. And it suggests that the President does have some political juice left to build support for plans that will define his legacy.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden won the 2020 election in large part because he was able to win the center. He emerged with a 13-point win with independent voters, a group that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lost by 4 points in 2016. (House Democratic candidates, for their part, took independents by 9 points in 2020.) That\u2019s why it should be alarming to Biden that the recent downturn in his approval rating has come disproportionately from independents, as the Washington Post\u2019s Henry Olsen first pointed out. This slide could have major electoral implications, if it holds. You can see this trend among independents in polls that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Biden\u2019s net approval rating (approve-disapprove) among independents in polls completed in September and October stands at -16 points. Not surprisingly, his net approval rating is significantly higher among Democrats (+79 points) and lower among Republicans (-84 points). Independents aren't a unified political bloc. Here's what they really think Biden\u2019s net approval rating was better among all groups in an average of polls back in June and July. His net approval rating stood at +88 points among Democrats, +3 points with independents and -72 points among Republicans. The key thing here though is that while the drop among Democrats (9 points) and Republicans (12 points) is evident, it\u2019s even larger among independents (19 points). In some ways Biden\u2019s disproportionate decline with independents shouldn\u2019t be surprising. If you are less attached to a political party (which independents are as a group), you\u2019re more likely to swing. Additionally, the 2020 results with independents may have been more a reflection of displeasure with then-President Donald Trump than admiration for Biden. A dig into the exit polls reveals that even though Biden beat Trump among independents by 13 points, his own net favorability rating (favorable - unfavorable) was just +6 points with them. Trump\u2019s, meanwhile, was -18 points. Biden\u2019s net approval is now basically where Trump\u2019s popularity was with independents on Election Day 2020. With Trump out of the picture, Biden\u2019s now standing on his own record \u2013 one that a lot of independents seem less than impressed with. According to an NBC News poll finished in the back half of August, just 32% of independents (including those who say they lean towards the Democratic or Republican party) and 38% of pure independents (those who don\u2019t lean) say Biden has accomplished a great or fair deal in office. The vast majority (64% among all independents and 59% among those who don\u2019t lean towards a party) say he\u2019s done only some to very little in office. Looking forward, Biden\u2019s standing with independents may be helped if two signature pieces of legislation become law. Independents \u2013 by a 57% to 27% margin \u2013 favor the $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal already passed by the Senate, according to an average of recent Pew Research Center and Quinnipiac University polls. They\u2019re more split (48% support vs. 37% opposed) on the $3.5 trillion package for social programs for child care and expanding medicare among other things. Still, even here support among independents vastly outstrips Biden\u2019s own standing with them. If Biden doesn\u2019t do something to change his numbers with independents, it\u2019s not out of the question that his party could suffer at the polls. An examination of history reveals that independents can change their mind pretty quickly on how they vote in-between presidential and midterm elections. We can see this in three of the biggest wave elections in recent memory: 1994, 2010 and 2018. From 1992 to 1994, independents switched from favoring House Democratic candidates by 8 points to voting for Republicans by 14 points. From 2008 to 2010, they went from going for Democrats by 8 points to Republicans by 18 points. From 2016 to 2018, they went the other way from voting for House Republican candidates by 6 points to backing Democrats by 12 points. The shift in independent voters in all these elections was larger than among members of either major party. Of course, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that Republicans don\u2019t need a massive shift in voter opinion to do well in the midterms. Democrats have only the slimmest of majorities in the House and Senate. Those majorities are very much in danger right now.",

            "article_content": "The story of the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive insurgency has, over the last five or six years, typically been told from the campaign trail. But this week, the battleground centered on Capitol Hill, and the outsiders \u2013 now greater in number and more comfortable in power \u2013 fought the moderates to a remarkable stalemate that upset long-held assumptions and doubts over the left\u2019s ability to impose its will in Washington. Progressives are a long way from victory in the ongoing fight over the size and scope of a social spending package that would mark the largest expansion of the social safety net in more than 50 years \u2013 one that President Joe Biden hopes will be his signature legislative achievement. But in withholding their support for another bill \u2013 a smaller, bipartisan physical infrastructure deal struck in the Senate and heartily supported by moderate House Democrats \u2013 the left maintained its leverage in those ongoing negotiations. 'It doesn't matter when': How Biden gave feuding House Democrats an off-ramp This latest Democratic intra-party clash might appear arcane to the point of absurdity. But the underlying dynamics are actually pretty straight-forward. Months ago, Democratic leadership made a decision: The two bills would be linked. Progressives would vote for the infrastructure legislation \u2013 which they don\u2019t particularly like \u2013 and moderates would support the social spending bill, which in its current form would cost $3.5 trillion over a decade. They would sink or swim together. The need to pass both, said Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the Congressional Progressive Caucus chair, was at the core of Biden\u2019s pep talk to Democratic House members during his visit to the Hill on Friday. But that procedural understanding was upset in August when a small, rebel group of centrist Democrats threatened to kneecap the process if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not schedule a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure deal. Pelosi and the lawmakers eventually compromised, agreeing to hold it by September 27 \u2013 this past Monday \u2013 in exchange for the group\u2019s support on a procedural vote to set the stage for the social spending bill. But the deal created a tight, self-imposed deadline that threatened to undermine the dual-track approach to passing the respective bills. And with the social spending legislation still unwritten, the situation came to a head this past week. With Pelosi seeking to pass the infrastructure bill, progressives had a decision to make: bow to pressure from leadership and accept, at best, a loose framework in return, or, as their outside allies put it, \u201chold the line\u201d and refuse their votes, effectively sinking \u2013 for now \u2013 an important piece of the Biden agenda. In the end, it was never especially close. Pelosi, knowing it lacked the votes to pass, never brought the infrastructure bill to the floor. The Congressional Progressive Caucus, led by Jayapal, never wavered \u2013 repeating, as they had for months, that because the two bills were initially held up as a package deal, any effort to de-couple them was a non-starter. The success of House progressives in effectively enforcing that early agreement and beating back an eleventh hour pressure campaign to vote \u2013 now \u2013 for the infrastructure bill was a departure from a sort of Capitol Hill tradition, in which the left is either overrun by some combination of moderate, centrist or conservative factions of its own party or shows up too disorganized to mount a meaningful stand in big-ticket legislative debate. The most obvious thing is the math. The count of progressives in the House Democratic caucus has been growing for years. (The CPC currently includes nearly 100 lawmakers but, more importantly, its core of committed members has expanded.) And with the Democratic majority so narrow, after Republicans picked up seats in the 2020 election, leadership needs near unanimity to pass anything along party lines. Progressives had strength in numbers, meaning even a late effort to pick off some fence-sitters was never going to yield enough votes to flip the dynamic. The political profile of the new generation of progressive lawmakers is also different from those who held office a decade ago, when many of the same senior party officials were cobbling together the votes to pass former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. But the new generation\u2019s willingness to publicly oppose leadership has also been amplified and solidified by an explosion of progressive outside groups. In the run-up to this past week\u2019s planned vote, those organizations encouraged progressive legislators to reject the infrastructure bill, bought up ad time to tout the roundly popular provisions in the social spending legislation \u2013 from universal pre-K and lower prescription drug prices to new funding for elder care, child care, Obamacare and an expansion to Medicare \u2013 and worked overtime to reverse a narrative, promoted by some moderates, that progressives were obstructing the Biden agenda. \u201cThe only things standing in the way of the infrastructure bill being signed into law are the conservative hold-outs, like Senators (Joe) Manchin and (Kyrsten) Sinema, who are offering only vague criticisms of the massively popular budget reconciliation bill,\u201d Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of the Indivisible Project, said in a statement late Thursday. \u201cIs lowering drug prices for the majority of Americans too much? Is expanding Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing too much? Which of their constituents are they willing to throw under the bus in order to get a win for their corporate sponsors?\u201d Whether attacks on Manchin and Sinema, whose votes will be required to pass the social spending bill, yields the ultimate desired results remains to be seen. But for now, the left\u2019s growing ability to reframe the debate to encourage a more critical look at powerful moderates marks a sea change in Washington politics \u2013 and provided a necessary backstop for any potentially wobbly progressive lawmakers. Inside the Capitol dome, a project to revamp the Congressional Progressive Caucus, led by Jayapal, and turn the three-decade-old group into a more hardened, effective and organized political force, finally paid off. For as much talk as there is about \u201cthe squad\u201d and some of the newest leftist lawmakers, the parallel ascendance of Jayapal and the CPC, which has Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar in its leadership, has transformed progressives into a more coherent legislative bloc. Its membership, beginning this year, adopted new rules designed for moments like these \u2013 when anything less than a hard line on contentious issues would spell certain defeat. Back in January, a senior aide to a CPC member acknowledged that the caucus had in the past functioned more like \u201can informal social group\u201d than an organization dedicated to \u201cwielding power as a bloc.\u201d Jayapal herself insisted the CPC wasn\u2019t looking to impose \u201cpurity tests\u201d on its members, but said, \u201cWe have to be able to say this is what the progressive caucus stands for, this is what we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d \u201cWe need to use the strength in numbers that we have wisely and strategically,\u201d New Mexico Rep. Teresa Leger Fern\u00e1ndez, a progressive freshman Democrat, told CNN at the time. \u201cWe have to make sure we cultivate unity and stay unified as a caucus as well.\u201d The question then, nearly nine months before this week\u2019s standoff, was whether the CPC could live up to those promises, especially after Democrats won control of the Senate by sweeping the Georgia Senate elections, meaning Biden entered office with unified control \u2013 albeit by the narrowest margins \u2013 of government. The answer, as it stands heading into a new round of negotiations over the Biden agenda, is yes. But even with all of those pieces falling into place, the progressive legislative renaissance has repeatedly benefited \u2013 and never more so than during the current clash \u2013 from the implicit backing of the President himself. Progressive leaders, especially Jayapal, have repeatedly invoked Biden\u2019s desires in explaining their position and making the case for a vote against a bill that he supports and wants to see passed. \u201cWe must deliver for American families. Our Progressive Caucus members will put our votes on the line to send the entirety of the Build Back Better agenda to President Biden\u2019s desk. As he said when he laid out this plan: \u201cWe can do this. We have to do this. We will do this,\u2019\u201d wrote Jayapal, California Rep. Katie Porter, the CPC deputy chair, and Omar, its whip, in a CNN op-ed published Monday morning. As a week of debate and negotiation ramped up, the White House, even as Biden became more involved by holding meetings with lawmakers and sending top aides to the Hill, never stepped out and took a side. A public pronouncement from Biden demanding, or even nudging, Democrats to vote immediately on the bipartisan infrastructure bill would have made the progressives\u2019 line infinitely more difficult to hold. Such a statement never came. And when Biden visited the Capitol on Friday afternoon, amid howls that his agenda \u2013 indeed, his presidency \u2013 was on the brink, he again refused to side with the moderates. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get this done,\u201d Biden said after meeting with House Democrats. Then, asked about a timeline, he said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter when. It doesn\u2019t whether it\u2019s in six minutes, six days, or six weeks \u2013 we\u2019re going to get it done.\u201d CNN\u2019s Clare Foran contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s presidency agenda is on the ropes. His approval rating is at the lowest point it\u2019s been, and now, there are real questions about whether Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan and a larger social agenda spending package will get through Congress. Biden must hope that something gets passed \u2013 his and his party\u2019s political fortunes could depend on it. Biden\u2019s approval rating has been sinking the last few months and is down to only about 45% in an average of polls. The decline can be linked to many things, including the pullout of troops from Afghanistan and a rise in coronavirus cases. But part of it may have to do with the fact that Americans don\u2019t think he and his administration have accomplished very much. An NBC News poll last month found that just 14% of Americans think Biden\u2019s done a great deal, compared to 40% who think he\u2019s accomplished very little. All told, 58% of Americans believe Biden has done very little or only some vs. 40% who think he\u2019s accomplished a great or fair deal. These percentages are far worse than they were for Biden back in April. Back then, more Americans (51%) thought Biden had done a great or fair amount than little or some (47%). These percentages are only slightly better than where former President Donald Trump was at a similar point during his term. Back then, 12% of Americans thought he had accomplished a great deal, compared to 46% who believed he had very little. The two bills before Congress provide a strong opportunity for Biden to be seen as doing something. There\u2019s the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package that has already passed the Senate, and the $3.5 trillion spending package that contains funding for universal pre-K, expansion of Medicare and clean energy. Issue polling isn\u2019t as cut and dry as polling about elections, but the bills seem more popular than not. The Pew Research Center polled both the infrastructure package and the reconciliation package. The infrastructure bill came out 51% favor vs. 20% oppose, while the spending bill was 49% favor to 25% oppose. About a quarter of the electorate remained undecided on both, but these polls generally follow what most of the public data has shown: voters are in favor of Biden and the Democrats passing something. These bills are certainly more popular than the Trump tax cuts that passed in the first year of his presidency. Opposition pretty much always outran support on that bill, and usually by double digit margins. Trump and the Republicans passed that bill, however. Trump\u2019s approval rating actually climbed from the mid 30s to the low 40s. The reason is that the tax cuts rallied Republicans, among whom the President became more popular. Now, there\u2019s no guarantee that these bills will make Biden more popular. The linkage between legislation passing and presidential popularity isn\u2019t one-to-one, and there still are plenty of Americans undecided on the bills. But either of these bills passing may not need to make Biden more popular in order to have a desirable outcome for Democrats. For one thing, there has been a steady beat of bad news cycles for Biden for over a month. Initially, it was rising coronavirus cases due to the Delta variant. Then it was the exit from Afghanistan. Now, it\u2019s a Democratic Party that can\u2019t seem to line up together to actually get something done. Merely showing that they can do something can\u2019t hurt \u2013 and likely helps \u2013 Democrats. Perhaps even more importantly, Democrats seem to be suffering from an enthusiasm problem. We\u2019ve seen the average Democratic performance in special elections fall off tremendously in recent months. Special elections are about voter preference (i.e. liking Democrats or Republicans), but they\u2019re about enthusiasm too (i.e. turning out to vote in an off-timed election). Additionally, our last CNN/SSRS poll suggested that Democrats may have an enthusiasm problem ahead of 2022. On the generic congressional ballot, those who were extremely or very enthusiastic about voting next year favored Republican candidates by 4 points. Those who were somewhat or not enthusiastic about voting next year favored Democratic candidates by 6 points. Part of the reason Democratic backers may not be enthusiastic is that Biden and his fellow Democrats haven\u2019t given them a lot of reason to turn out in 2022. One has to imagine that if an unpopular tax cut helped Trump rally his base, then a bill that is more popular has at least some chance of doing the same with Biden and his base.",

The US Covid situation is as dire as ever, with 1,500 people dying each day \u2013 an average of 150,000 new cases each day. With more than 100,000 hospitalized Americans, the number of deaths \u2013 almost certainly an undercount \u2013 will continue to rise above the 653,000 current total.

What\u2019s the plan? Biden has a new six-prong strategy to deal with the virus. If you\u2019re like me you\u2019ve lost track of the distinct government efforts and restarts. This is just the latest. Biden\u2019s plan (read a full summary here) includes these points: 1. Vaccinating the unvaccinated with mandates for workers, public and private. Biden directed the Labor Department to require all employers with more than 100 workers to require either the vaccine or regular testing. That\u2019s an effort sure to find its way to federal court. In addition, the White House will strengthen vaccination requirements for most federal workers, but remove the option for workers to get regular testing rather than the vaccination. He\u2019ll sign an executive order requiring the same standard from federal contractors. All told, that\u2019s 2.5 million workers. It\u2019s a step they hope will spur similar actions in the private sector. Biden last month signed an order requiring nursing homes that received Medicare and Medicaid funding to vaccinate their workers. I asked Ariel Edwards-Levy of CNN\u2019s polling and election team what we know about whether companies are requiring vaccines and how workers feel about them. She flagged two recent polls: 2. Further protecting the vaccinated through booster shots. There\u2019s been some confusion about this as the country moves closer to recommending boosters for the most at-risk Americans. Some recipients of the Pfizer vaccine could be ready for boosters as soon as September 20, although the FDA has not yet approved them. A key advisory board meets September 17 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would still have to set guidelines for who should get them. The CDC website suggests people should not get a booster until at least eight months after getting their second dose. Look for the emphasis to be on older Americans and first responders vaccinated early on. 3. Keeping schools open. Schools are the angriest flashpoint as people fight over mask requirements. Biden promised to make up the salary of any teacher or administrator whose pay was withheld by a state opposing mask requirements. He also said he will require that 300,000 educators in federal Head Start programs be vaccinated and will call on governors to require vaccinations for schoolteachers and staff. As the school year starts, schools around the country are dealing with quarantines for teachers and students disrupting what was supposed to be the great return. The Los Angeles Unified School district was set to open a new front in that fight when it moved toward becoming the first major US school district to require vaccination for kids over 12. Increased testing at schools in places there the virus is moving rapidly could cut down on spread. But so too will requiring the vaccine among students. Infections and hospitalizations among kids are rising, which worries experts, but they are still the least likely age group to get sick or die from the virus. Among recent infections, more than a quarter were children, but less than 3% of hospitalizations are for children. Some younger kids develop an inflammatory ailment \u2013 MISC-C \u2013 after contracting Covid-19. That can keep them hospitalized for weeks. Related: Read more about kids and the Delta variant 4. Increasing testing. The Defense Production Act will be used to accelerate the production of rapid tests, and the administration is planning to send 25-million free tests to US health clinics. Some retailers, like Amazon, Kroger and Walmart, will sell the at-home tests at cost for the next three months, Biden said. Regular and affordable testing, if done right, could not only diagnose people who feel sick, it could stop the spread of the pandemic by letting people know if they are contagious and need to stay home, even if they don\u2019t feel sick. Scientists have been pushing for this kind of testing \u2013 accessible, affordable and ideally, at home \u2013 since the start of the pandemic. 5. Economic recovery. The eviction moratorium and expanded unemployment insurance have expired. The government\u2019s toolkit to help those hurt by the pandemic is veering away from direct help. But Biden announced Thursday his administration would expand the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program to allow for small businesses to borrow up to $2 million \u2013 up from the current $500,000 \u2013 in low interest, long-term loans if their sales have been impacted by Covid-19. In July, the number of jobs available in the United States climbed to 10.9 million, a new record high, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday. 6. Improving care for those with Covid-19. The US will also increase the availability of new medicines \u201crecommended by real doctors, not conspiracy theorists,\u201d to help Covid-19 patients, Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already distributed 1.4 million courses of these treatments to save lives and reduce the strain on hospitals. Tonight, I\u2019m announcing will increase the average pace of shipment across the country, a free monoclonal antibody treatments by another 50%,\u201d the President said. Additionally, the Department of Defense will double the number of military health teams available to help overburdened hospitals around the country. The most important element is convincing people to get the vaccine. The vast majority of people who are hospitalized and the vast majority of those who die don\u2019t have the vaccine. That means the unvaccinated are draining the health care system. We talk mostly in this newsletter about large, macro efforts by the government and refer to people like \u201cthe unvaccinated\u201d in broad strokes. They\u2019re people too and if they\u2019re ever going to be convinced to get the shot and help stop this never-ending disaster, it\u2019s worth listening to what\u2019s motivating them. CNN\u2019s Elle Reeve did that with a stunning bit of video. It\u2019ll take ten minutes to watch her report. You should. She spent five days in Carter County, Missouri. It was her second trip there after first going in October of 2020. She went back now that Covid is surging again after hearing that a diner she visited last year had closed due to the virus. Just 27% of the population in the county is fully vaccinated. These are the points I took away. People did not see the new deadly Covid-19 surge coming. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how unvaccinated we were,\u201d Dr. Christopher Cochran of Ozarks Healthcare told Reeve. He said he thought more people in the area were vaccinated because earlier this year the virus was abating. \u201cIt came back like a brush fire,\u201d he said. The peer pressure in town, where people bristle at being told what to do, is against the vaccine and it\u2019s hard for people to break out of that. Jim Rodenbush told Reeve he\u2019s not vaccinated, but he will be soon. His wife Ruth fought cancer for 12 years, died eight days after learning she\u2019d gotten Covid-19. Her doctor told her not to get the vaccine because of her chemotherapy. There\u2019s a sort of pride in ignoring the experts. Rodenbush\u2019s friend Wayland Bland, who was in the hospital for seven days last Fall, said he doesn\u2019t want the shot now. \u201cI ain\u2019t taking that shit,\u201d he told Reeve. \u201cI don\u2019t like people trying to push a shot on me or something else because I\u2019m just as bullheaded a fellow as you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d When he was sick in the hospital he took steroids and other drugs like Regeneron, that helped former President Donald Trump recover from the virus. At the time, he said he would have taken anything. But he won\u2019t take the vaccine now in part, he said, because he feels like Trump was shafted by the vaccine makers and government to lose the election. \u201cYou shafted me out of my President. I ain\u2019t takin\u2019 your medicine,\u201d Bland said. Unaware that Trump has been vaccinated, Bland said he\u2019ll take what Trump got, but not the vaccine. When Reeve pointed out Trump had been vaccinated, Bland said he didn\u2019t know all the facts, but \u201cI ain\u2019t takin\u2019 it because I\u2019m that bullheaded.\u201d There\u2019s a religious element for some people. Tim Wilder is a Carter County commissioner. \u201cI\u2019ll get real deep with you,\u201d he told Reeve. \u201cI believe if the good Lord wants me right now it doesn\u2019t matter if I take a vaccine or I don\u2019t. And I know a lot of people would say well He also gave you common sense and you oughta go get the shot, but that\u2019s just, you know, that\u2019s the way I look at things.\u201d There\u2019s some hope that people, ultimately, will get the shot. She ends the story on an interesting note, however, after talking to a man named Brian Keathley, who was vehemently anti-mask last Fall. Vehemently. If he died from Covid, he said at the time, he\u2019d put on his tombstone that he was anti-mask. Now he says it\u2019s the government\u2019s fault people in Carter County haven\u2019t gotten the shot. \u201cNo one feels like they can trust our government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault no one\u2019s wearing a mask. It\u2019s not my fault no one\u2019s gotten the vaccine. It\u2019s the government\u2019s fault.\u201d But she pressed him, repeatedly, on whether he\u2019d gotten it. While arguing it doesn\u2019t matter if he did or didn\u2019t, he ultimately said: \u201cIf you get it, it can kill you. End of story. And I don\u2019t want my wife to have to wonder when they put you in a medical induced coma and stick a tube down your throat, is he going to come back out of there. That\u2019s why I got a vaccine.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Almost a year before Joe Biden was elected president, fellow Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez remarked in a New York Magazine profile that \u201cin any other country,\u201d she and Biden \u201cwould not be in the same party.\u201d \u201cBut in America,\u201d the New York Democrat added, with some resignation, \u201cwe are.\u201d More than a year-and-a-half later, the comment \u2013 which stirred up indignation at the time among some Democrats who viewed it as divisive \u2013 has been largely forgotten amid a continuing pandemic and now the unfolding situation in Afghanistan. But the truth in her words does a lot to explain the challenges now facing Democratic lawmakers, who successfully walked a tightrope to legislative achievement with their initial Covid-19 \u201crescue\u201d plan and are currently attempting another crossing as they negotiate the passage of a bipartisan infrastructure package alongside an even larger social spending bill. Bash asks Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez if she will challenge Schumer That the fates of the two bills, one championed by moderate Democrats and the other by progressives, are tied together is in itself a neat metaphor for the broader dynamic influencing the party\u2019s path in the Biden era, as it seeks to show it can deliver for the American people ahead of next year\u2019s midterms. Neither package has enough support to pass in the House of Representatives without disparate factions of Democrats agreeing to vote for legislation they would not, under other circumstances, be inclined to back. Democrats are, in sum, doing the work of a coalition government \u2013 the kind of fraught, patchwork majority more typically found in the parliamentary democracies of Western Europe. To advance any and all pieces of their shared agenda, Democrats need unanimity in their Senate ranks and can only afford to lose a handful of votes in the House. Those thin margins, and the fragility of leadership\u2019s best laid plans, came into stark focus these past few weeks during an eleventh hour revolt against what Washington insiders call the \u201ctwo-track strategy,\u201d which aims to put both bills on Biden\u2019s desk at about the same time \u2013 a legislative tactic of mutual assured destruction, with both sides empowered to scuttle the other\u2019s top priority. The political battlefield is complex, with overlapping incentives that mean primary season rivals can be allies on legislative matters. That dynamic was on display during the recent standoff over the timing of a House vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which has already passed in the Senate. A breakaway group of centrist House Democratic lawmakers demanded it come immediately to the floor, a move that could have potentially stranded the legislation sought by the left. Eventually, the group struck a deal with leadership allowing the both tracks of the process to move forward. But those few white knuckle days, full of tense private meetings, calls from the White House and the launch of pressure campaigns from outside groups underscored the tenuous nature of not only the legislation at hand, but the party\u2019s status quo. After the agreement was in place, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic Caucus Chairman, summed up the fundamental political incentives that carried the day. \u201cThe most important thing is, as Democrats, we remain united behind the objectives that have been set by President Biden,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cDemocracy is messy, and Democrats are not a cult, we\u2019re a coalition.\u201d The parameters of that coalition have evolved in recent years with the growth of the party\u2019s progressive wing, both on Capitol Hill and among a Democratic electorate increasingly supportive of more ambitious policies. \u201cThe power struggle between establishment or corporate Democrats versus progressive shows how far we\u2019ve come in a short amount of time. How far the progressive movement has come,\u201d said Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of Our Revolution, a progressive group founded in the aftermath of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from the outside, being locked out, being forced to take to the streets, to actually having a seat at the table and real power and leverage where leadership has to take us seriously.\u201d The oddsmakers\u2019 favorite to succeed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in leading the Democratic caucus if she retires in the coming years, Jeffries, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has often flown the moderate flag on the front lines of the intra-party electoral fights. Some have played out in parallel to Democrats\u2019 work in Washington. The special election to replace former Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, who gave up her seat in the 11th Congressional District to become Biden\u2019s Housing and Urban Development secretary, launched a proxy fight that pitted former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a staunch Sanders ally and surrogate, against the establishment backed-Shontel Brown, a councilmember and local party chair. Brown ended up defeating Turner by a comfortable margin, a result Jeffries and other moderates crowed over in the aftermath. Jeffries\u2019 pushback against the progressive primary apparatus, conducted simultaneously with his work to make and maintain a unified front in Washington, underscores the party\u2019s sometimes awkward internal political realities. In June, Jeffries \u2013 along with New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell \u2013 announced the formation of an organization designed to defend incumbent Democrats who might face primary challengers. In effect, the group was designed to match wits and dollars with Justice Democrats, the group that backed Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive outsiders, like Missouri Rep. Cori Bush and New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, both of whom defeated moderate longtime incumbents in 2020. But even as the left lines up its challengers and moderates prepare to launch a well-funded counteroffensive, they were ultimately pushing for the same legislative outcome on Capitol Hill, even if they used different methods and messages \u2013 including outside attacks against each other \u2013 to get there. During the standoff over the timing of the infrastructure vote, Organize for Justice, a sister organization of Justice Democrats, joined other progressive groups to buy television and digital ads attacking the members of the rebel lawmakers in their home districts. Gottheimer was among those targeted. \u201cConstituents deserve to know the truth about how these nine conservative Democrats are blocking urgent action on jobs, climate, and child care,\u201d Alexandra Rojas, of Organize for Justice and Justice Democrats, said in a statement last Monday morning. \u201cAmericans have been waiting for over a decade for action on many of these issues, it\u2019s time to deliver results.\u201d Despite Gottheimer\u2019s lead role in the drama over the timing of the infrastructure vote, which threatened to undermine House leadership \u2013 of which Jeffries is a member \u2013 the mission of the new PAC, called Team Blue, remains unchanged. \u201cTeam Blue PAC looks forward to supporting members of the House Democratic Caucus family,\u201d a source familiar with Jeffries\u2019 thinking told CNN, \u201cwith an emphasis on defending effective, progressive legislators like Carolyn Maloney, John Yarmuth and Danny Davis who are advancing the Build Back Better agenda.\u201d (Maloney, from New York\u2019s 12th Congressional District, and Davis, from Illinois\u2019 7th, are both facing primary challenges from Justice Democrats-backed candidates. Yarmuth, the longtime congressman from Kentucky\u2019s 3rd district, is facing a primary fight with a progressive state lawmaker.) The larger, partisan bill that will need to be passed through the budget reconciliation process, would \u2013 according to its early framework \u2013 create a universal pre-K program for 3- and 4-year-olds, offer new child care benefits to working families and, for the first time, eventually provide a federal guarantee of paid parental, family and personal illness leave. In addition to measures designed to curb climate change and invest in affordable housing, it would also increase subsidies for Obamacare and, after so many years of debate and advocacy, lower prescription drug prices and expand Medicare \u2013 lowering the eligibility age while beefing up the popular program to include dental, vision and hearing benefits. Taken together, the legislation would represent the largest and most consequential expansion of aid and protections to the social safety net in a generation. For many on the left, it also amounts to a marker of the movement\u2019s growing influence. Though progressives still lag other factions of the party in terms of representation in Congress, Biden and his team have, since he became the Democrats\u2019 presumptive presidential nominee in 2020, worked relentlessly to build a working relationship with the left and its energetic base. Sanders, his closest competitor and the final rival to fall on Biden\u2019s late surge to the nomination, has returned the favor. Ascending to the chair of the Senate Budget Committee after the Democrats, with whom he caucuses, won their Senate majority, Sanders has worked closely with the White House, even as some of his top campaign priorities, like \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d have been sidelined. The White House, in turn, has provided a backstop for progressives during the push to get both of the party\u2019s legislative priorities over the line. When the group of nine Democrats demanding an immediate House vote on the bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill said Biden shared their desire, the White House knocked them back. \u201c(Biden) has been clear that he wants both bills on his desk and that he looks forward to signing each,\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates told NBC News on Monday, adding that the President supported Pelosi\u2019s broader approach to steering the White House agenda. The insistence from Pelosi that the process move forward on two tracks along with the public lines from the White House, when silence might have upended the dynamic in the House, reinforced growing confidence among Hill progressives that Biden could be trusted. Both the President and his director of legislative affairs, Louisa Terrell, were among those working the phones to help end the stand-off. \u201cAll those pieces made me feel that we\u2019ve got the ammo that we need going into the next stage of negotiations,\u201d a senior aide involved in progressive Democrats\u2019 strategy told CNN, suggesting they view moderate Senate Democrats as the next big hurdle. \u201cAnd for whatever (West Virginia Sen. Joe) Manchin and (Arizona Sen. Kyrsten) Sinema\u2019s antics, they\u2019re not talking about allowing the reconciliation bill to be stranded.\u201d Democrats \u2013 whose majority is only as useful as their near unanimity \u2013 appear to be on a path to fulfilling Biden\u2019s ambitious framework. The party has shown, to date, that it can be both in \u201cdisarray\u201d and a functioning operation \u2013 and that the imperative to act, in coalition, appears to be winning the day. This story has been updated with Jeffries\u2019 membership in the Congressional Progressive Caucus.",

            "article_content": "A congressional primary in Ohio is revealing the generational and ideological fissures in the Democratic Party that have been largely hidden in the early months of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency \u2013 but could burst into full view as the midterm elections approach. Nina Turner, the former state senator and prominent surrogate for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaigns, is battling the establishment-backed Shontel Brown, the Cuyahoga County Democratic chairwoman and county council member, in a race that also features 11 other long-shot candidates bidding to represent the 11th District, which stretches from Cleveland south to Akron. The August 3 primary comes ahead of a special election to replace former Rep. Marcia Fudge, who left the seat to join Biden\u2019s Cabinet as secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The winner of the Democratic primary is all but certain to win the general election \u2013 a reality that has turned the contest into an intra-party struggle that could set the tone for more primary battles next year, as progressives target more veteran House members. At a campaign stop for Turner on Saturday, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told volunteers who were about to go door-knocking that the district represents a \u201cvery rare\u201d chance for Democrats to chart a course for the party nationally without any concerns about electability. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other districts that are much more competitive \u2013 they don\u2019t have the privilege or the luxury to say \u2018Yes, \u2018Medicare for All.\u201d \u2018Yes, a Green New Deal,\u2019\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many districts like these that can lead the country. And so you all have the responsibility for all of us to help us add one more member to lead that fight.\u201d At another event, Ocasio-Cortez was even more direct. \u201cI need Nina. Please send me Nina. Please,\u201d she said. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s visit Saturday came as leaders of the Democratic Party\u2019s younger, progressive wing have rushed to back Turner, one of the movement\u2019s founding members. Ocasio-Cortez described at one event how Turner had offered her advice on a Zoom call before her stunning 2018 primary ouster of then-Rep. Joe Crowley. Sanders will campaign for Turner next weekend. The Democratic establishment, meanwhile, is lining up behind Brown. Hillary Clinton and South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking Black member of the House, have endorsed her. The Congressional Black Caucus\u2019 political arm, a number of labor unions and a flood of local officials have also backed Brown. Clyburn and other veteran Black Democratic lawmakers \u2013 Reps. Joyce Beatty of Ohio, Gregory Meeks of New York, and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi \u2013 will visit the district next weekend, Brown said Saturday. The lineup of out-of-district visitors underscores the stakes in the race: Inspired by Ocasio-Cortez and other recent progressive victories, left-wing challengers have lined up against several other House Democratic incumbents, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus \u2013 threatening to shift the political balance in Washington toward the Squad, even after Clyburn\u2019s endorsement and older Black voters\u2019 support lifted Biden to the Democratic nomination and the presidency last year. Clyburn, as he announced his endorsement of Brown, criticized \u201csloganeering\u201d by the left \u2013 citing calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d from progressives as out of touch with voters. Turner entered the race with built-in advantages: As a leading surrogate for Sanders\u2019 presidential campaigns, she already had the profile and fundraising contacts of a nationally known progressive firebrand. But a late flood of money and endorsements to Brown in the race\u2019s final weeks has made Brown competitive. And if the primary is a low-turnout affair, she could benefit from her support from older, more reliable Democratic voters. Turner doesn\u2019t rely on her national profile or her ties to Sanders while campaigning in what is, politically, her own backyard. She talks about issues like Medicare for All and eradicating student debt in personal terms. As she did on the presidential campaign trail, Turner punctuates speeches with her signature catchphrase, \u201cHello, somebody!\u201d \u2013 one meant to convey that everyday people without titles or political power matter, too. But she hasn\u2019t been able to escape her former role as one of Sanders\u2019 most loyal backers \u2013 and one who was most resistant to the establishment-aligned nominees who defeated him. Brown has hammered Turner for comparing the choice between Biden and former President Donald Trump in 2020, in an interview with The Atlantic at the time, to eating half a bowl versus a full bowl of excrement. In an interview after a stop at a National Association of Letter Carriers union convention, Brown also brought up Turner\u2019s recent jabs at Brown. Turner has said repeatedly that she would be a \u201cpartner, and not a puppet.\u201d \u201cFor me, a partner is someone who comes to the table and negotiates and has difficult conversations,\u201d Brown said. \u201cA puppet is someone who entertains on a national stage and has catchphrases like \u2018hello, somebody\u2019 \u2013 with folks pulling their strings and giving them talking points.\u201d On the campaign trail, Turner says she\u2019s willing to cross party lines. She described working with then-Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich on police reforms in 2014, when she was a state senator. But she also describes the stakes as dire, telling supporters that universal health care, addressing a legal system that is \u201crotten to its core\u201d and more, require progressive wins. \u201cOnly all that we love is on the line, that\u2019s it \u2013 nothing too big,\u201d she said. Brown touts more modest accomplishments, such as helping secure 5,000 free WiFi hotspots for students studying at home during the pandemic and helping modernize the local 911 system so that hearing-impaired people, those escaping domestic violence and others can text rather than call. She said she would break with Biden on some issues \u2013 including the filibuster. She said she backs Clyburn\u2019s call for a carve-out for constitutional issues, which would allow the Senate to pass voting-rights legislation with just 51 votes rather than 60 votes. Fudge, as a member of Biden\u2019s Cabinet, is staying neutral in the primary to fill her former seat. But Brown has sought to align herself as closely as possible to the former congresswoman. Brown told a group of Black women at a backyard meet-and-greet in Cleveland Heights on Saturday evening that a phone call from Fudge is what led her to run to become Cuyahoga County Democratic Party chairwoman. She said Fudge \u201chas been a mentor and a friend to me.\u201d \u201cWe need someone who has those relationships in place, who can go to Congress on day one and make sure that we\u2019re getting the resources we need,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd I am that person.\u201d To drive the point home, Brown\u2019s campaign turned to its next best option \u2013 Fudge\u2019s mother \u2013 for a memorable 30-second television ad. In the ad, Fudge\u2019s mother says Brown is her daughter\u2019s protege. \u201cShe shares Marcia\u2019s values and will continue her legacy in Congress,\u201d she says.",

            "article_content": "A new book written by one of President Joe Biden\u2019s top coronavirus advisers suggests Dr. Deborah Birx hoped former President Donald Trump would lose the 2020 presidential election. In \u201cPreventable,\u201d his new book detailing the federal government\u2019s failures on mitigating the pandemic, Andy Slavitt writes that he met with Birx last August in Minnesota after she briefed local officials. Once a close adviser to Trump, she had been cast out of his inner circle by that time and replaced by Dr. Scott Atlas, a radiologist with no epidemiological experience whom Trump hired after watching him on Fox News. Sidelined from her once prominent role, Birx spent her days traveling the country and providing detailed data to government officials. It was one of those briefings in Minnesota that she invited Slavitt to attend. \u201cI wanted to get a sense for whether, in the event of a strained transition of government, she would help give Biden and his team the best chance to be effective,\u201d Slavitt writes in his new book, even though the outcome of the election was not yet known. \u201cAt one point, after a brief pause, she looked me in the eye and said, \u2018I hope the election turns out a certain way,\u2019\u201d Slavitt writes. \u201cI had the most important information I needed.\u201d CNN has reached out to Birx for comment. For the last six months, Slavitt has served as Biden\u2019s senior adviser on the Covid-19 response. That public-facing position included regular television appearances and weekly briefings with reporters. Slavitt stepped down from that role on Thursday, citing a 130-day limit on special government employees. His new book, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, comes out Tuesday. Before serving in the Biden administration, Slavitt played a quieter role in the pandemic response as he watched Trump downplay it from the outside. Slavitt advised several officials while Trump was in office, including in phone conversations with Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, where he urged them to take it more seriously and place greater emphasis on testing. During their conversation last August, Birx told Slavitt she had been \u201ccompletely silenced\u201d and was not allowed to make appearances on national media. It was a sharp turn from Birx\u2019s earlier proximity to Trump, which included regular briefings in front of reporters and private consultations in the Oval Office. \u201cFighting the virus and Scott Atlas together is the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to do,\u201d Birx said as she briefed officials with Slavitt in the room last August, he writes. When her TV appearances were still sanctioned by the White House, Birx once said Trump had been \u201cso attentive to the scientific literature and the details and the data\u201d and that his \u201cability to analyze and integrate data\u201d came from \u201chis long history in business.\u201d She sat quietly in the briefing room as Trump suggested using disinfectants to treat Covid-19. Those moves often elicited strong criticism from public health officials, who said Birx was papering over Trump\u2019s unscientific statements while providing him cover. Others defended Birx, pointing to the long hours she worked gathering data used to make critical decisions. In her conversation with Slavitt, Birx appeared to recognize the damage to her reputation. \u201cI have no illusions about my career in government,\u201d she told him. Birx: I always considered quitting Trump's White House Covid task force When Slavitt met with Birx in Minnesota, she was still in her role as the White House\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator. It would be months before Trump would test positive for coronavirus, as he maintained a robust travel schedule and held multiple large gatherings at the White House, where guests and staff were often maskless. Slavitt writes that when he met with Birx in August, \u201cher early optimism was long gone.\u201d According to him, \u201cat the end of October 2020, she was beyond all of that; she was downright scared.\u201d Although Birx had indicated she was open to serving in the Biden administration after he won the election, she quietly announced her retirement in December. Slavitt previously worked in the Obama administration on the healthcare.gov website and also served as the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. He did not work at the White House during the Trump presidency, but was able to provide an inside look at their handling of the pandemic because he had been in contact with Kushner since April 2020. He privately advised Kushner to push back Trump\u2019s self-imposed reopening deadline of Easter, and also pushed back when Kushner once told him states should be in charge of testing. \u201cSome of them clearly don\u2019t want to succeed,\u201d Slavitt says Kushner told him regarding governors in April 2020. \u201cBad incentives to keep blaming us.\u201d Slavitt writes that he had been in touch with several governors and told Kushner that wasn\u2019t true. Slavitt was also familiar with several of the most prominent health officials in the Trump administration, including then-US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who had reached out to Slavitt ahead of his Senate confirmation hearing in 2017. During that conversation, Slavitt asked Azar how he would be able push back on Trump if it became necessary. \u201cThe President and I talked about this. And he knows I\u2019m of strong will,\u201d Azar told Slavitt, according to the book. CNN has reached out to Azar for comment. Azar would go on to be one of the first health officials to warn Trump about Covid-19 in January 2020. But his tenure leading the department that would be critical to the federal government\u2019s response was marked by chaos and infighting. It also highlighted how little influence Azar had on the President. Slavitt writes that Azar oversaw \u201ca series of unforced errors,\u201d including the early troubles and restrictions within the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over tests, and quotes a former senior administration official who told him Azar was almost fired and replaced with CMS administrator Seema Verma. Slavitt also writes that Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s communications director, Katie Miller, had issued a directive around March 2020 that \u201cHHS was not permitted to issue any communication that raised concern among the public.\u201d After Azar had proposed talking points that the situation in the US was under control \u201cbut could change rapidly,\u201d Miller soundly rejected the suggested statement and pulled Azar from a planned appearance on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d the next morning. In February, Pence\u2019s staff attempted to tighten the messaging by directing all officials to coordinate statements through their office. Miller told CNN this policy was not specific to Azar. But Slavitt writes in his book that there was one directed at him. \u201cHe was prohibited from doing any media for 45 days,\u201d Slavitt writes, despite being the HHS secretary while a pandemic was spreading rapidly throughout the globe.",

            "article_content": "Gun violence prevention activist Kina Collins announced Tuesday that she is launching a new Democratic primary challenge to Rep. Danny Davis in Illinois\u2019 7th Congressional District. Davis has been a target of progressive insurgents in recent cycles, winning each time while seeing his vote total slip. He fended off three challengers in 2020, including Collins, who is now running with the support of Justice Democrats as she seeks to consolidate left-wing opposition to Davis. Collins joins a growing slate of Justice Democrats-backed primary challengers on the 2022 ticket, including Odessa Kelly in Tennessee and New York\u2019s Rana Abdelhamid. The group has also endorsed former state Sen. Nina Turner\u2019s Democratic primary bid in Ohio\u2019s 11th Congressional District, where there is a special election on tap this year to fill the seat of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, who left Congress to join the Biden administration. Despite House Democrats\u2019 poor overall showing in 2020, progressives grew their share of seats in the party\u2019s narrow majority, adding to the left\u2019s increasing influence on Capitol Hill. If Collins succeeds in denying Davis another term, it would mark the second consecutive primary cycle in which a Justice Democrats-endorsed candidate in Illinois ousted an incumbent on her second attempt \u2013 following Rep. Marie Newman\u2019s defeat of former Rep. Dan Lipinski in 2020. Collins took about a third of the anti-Davis vote last year, splitting it with Anthony Clark, who previously challenged Davis in 2018 with Justice Democrats support, and Kristine Schanbacher. \u201cFrom leading the gun violence prevention movement in Illinois, to fighting for Medicare for all and holding elected officials accountable after the murder of Laquan McDonald, Kina has already delivered results for her community,\u201d Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, said in a statement. \u201cThe people of this district are ready for a new generation of leadership who will show up everyday in Congress and fight for the change her community needs.\u201d In an interview, Collins mentioned the second-chance successes of Newman and Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, who defeated longtime Rep. William Lacy Clay in 2020 after failing on her first try in 2018. And like Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York, who won his primary last year by arguing that then-Rep. Eliot Engel had lost touch with the district he had represented for three decades, Collins said that Davis \u2013 despite the congressman\u2019s liberal voting record and progressive roots \u2013 has not been a forceful enough advocate for his constituents. \u201cI\u2019ve been at community meeting after community meeting on urgent issues like health care and gun violence, and Congressman Davis just doesn\u2019t show up,\u201d Collins told CNN. \u201cWe are in a watershed moment coming out of this pandemic, and in this recession we need someone who\u2019s been organizing on the front lines of the district. These urgent crises require urgent leadership.\u201d Collins\u2019 activist work was recognized by then President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s team when she was asked to join the transition\u2019s task force on gun violence. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on every single level on this issue, and it is one of the top issues in our district,\u201d Collins said. \u201cPeople in the city of Chicago, people in the western suburbs, they want solutions and they want to make sure that they\u2019re going to elect somebody who\u2019s going to fight for prevention and reaction.\u201d Collins also criticized Davis for his willingness to accept corporate PAC donations, which she has sworn off, and she expressed confidence that there would be no splintering of the progressive vote in 2022. \u201cI think that we are going to make it very apparent that I am the progressive challenger that progressive groups need to get behind,\u201d Collins said, pointing to Justice Democrats\u2019 decision and other early endorsers, including the Women\u2019s March Illinois. \u201cWe\u2019re building the rainbow coalition.\u201d Davis, who was first elected in 1996, is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, supports \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and signed on to New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s House version of the Green New Deal. He has also been a vocal proponent of new gun control legislation. His grandson, 15-year-old Javon Wilson, was shot and killed in 2016. Residents of Illinois\u2019 7th District, one of the bluest in Congress (a distinction that is unlikely to change in the coming redistricting process), have long faced high rates of gun violence, which has soared there and across the country over the past year. In 2019, Davis testified before the Oversight Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, on which he sits, about his firsthand knowledge of the \u201cpersonal cost\u201d of gun violence. \u201cI know what it feels like to have a loved one whose life was wiped out unnecessarily for no apparent reason,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI have attended the funeral of so many children in my communities whose wonderful lives were interrupted by gun violence. I feel the devastation.\u201d Collins, too, has come face-to-face with the gun-related bloodshed and trauma. \u201cNot only did I witness a child murdered in front of my house, where I was able to identify the shooter and the victim,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I went on after that incident, that changed the entire trajectory of my life, to organize on the local and national level around gun violence prevention.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge\u2019s name.",

            "article_content": "The US Postal Service on Friday proposed raising the cost of mailing a letter to 58 cents, an increase that\u2019s within the range of recent years and comes as Postmaster General Louis DeJoy pursues sweeping changes with an eye on the agency\u2019s finances. DeJoy, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, announced a 10-year plan for the agency in March that included longer first-class mail delivery times and cuts to post office hours across the country. The embattled postmaster general, who was also a donor to the former President, has faced criticism over the slowdown of mail delivery, specifically ahead of last year\u2019s election. \u201cFor the past 14 years, the Postal Service has had limited pricing authority to respond to changing market realities,\u201d DeJoy said in a statement Friday. \u201cAs part of our 10-year plan to achieve financial sustainability and service excellence, the Postal Service and the Board of Governors are committed to judiciously implementing a rational pricing approach that helps enable us to remain viable and competitive and offer reliable postal services that are among the most affordable in the world.\u201d Stamp prices have been steadily rising, with greater increases over the past several years. Mailing a letter cost 49 cents in 2017, 50 cents in 2018 and 55 cents in 2019, which is still the current price, according to USPS data. The price increase, which would take effect on August 29 if approved by the Postal Regulatory Commission, comes in response to lagging mail volume, according to an agency news release. \u201cFirst-Class Mail prices would increase by 6.8 percent to offset declining revenue due to First-Class Mail volume declines,\u201d the release states. \u201cIn the past 10 years, mail volume has declined by 46 billion pieces, or 28 percent, and is continuing to decline. Over the same period, First-Class Mail volume has dropped 32 percent, and single piece First-Class Mail volume \u2014 including letters bearing postage stamps \u2014 has declined 47 percent.\u201d Last week, a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation that would overhaul the USPS after the struggling agency made repeated requests to Congress to help its dire financial situation. The measure would eliminate a pre-funding requirement for Postal Service retirees that has hamstrung the financially strapped agency, as well as integrate retirees\u2019 health care with Medicare \u2013 measures that lawmakers argued would alone create more than $45 billion in savings for the Postal Service over the next 10 years. DeJoy has weathered backlash over his changes to the agency. Democrats linked him to Trump\u2019s anti-mail-in voting rhetoric and accused him of attempting to sabotage the Postal Service ahead of the 2020 election. Postal Service employees and unions had braced for the release of the plan after changes DeJoy made to the agency last summer slowed mail delivery. The sweeping 58-page plan, titled \u201cDelivering for America,\u201d promises to make the Postal Service more competitive and more modern \u2013 including a new energy-friendly fleet of delivery vehicles. It includes investments in \u201cadvanced package processing equipment,\u201d upgrades to post offices and uniforms, new technology such as mobile devices for letter carriers, and new employee training. It also calls for dialing down delivery time expectations, which it notes the system has been unable to meet \u201cover the past eight years.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes, Manu Raju, Liz Stark, Devan Cole and Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Budgets in Washington seem about as meaningful as budgets for regular people. You might have a budget in mind for yourself \u2013 a certain number of dollars per week for gas, food and lodging. But the budget, on its own, doesn\u2019t exactly stop you from buying a latte you didn\u2019t budget for. You don\u2019t need the latte. You may not be able to afford the latte. And yet a latte you shall have. Think of that, in the inverse and on steroids, when you read about President Joe Biden\u2019s $6 trillion budget proposal. Coffee drinkers might be blowing through their budgets on the back end, but Biden has made his budget for the US so massive that you can only imagine it shrinking as it approaches law. He needs the okay from Congress, which will have the opportunity in the coming months to write its own budget. It seems nearly impossible that Democrats have a majority in the Senate for anything close to what Biden is proposing \u2013 but it will be the starting point for negotiations. A massive investment in America. The President wants to build up roads and bridges, transition the country away from a fuel-based economy, granting kids more guaranteed education and helping parents pay for childcare. Unlike the latte, an unnecessary perk, Biden will say his priorities are investments in the future and the just rewards for Americans who work and pay the taxes that pay for these programs. This is how they\u2019ll benefit from the spending: A list of priorities that have little chance of happening. Biden\u2019s budget is important because it formally lays out his priorities, even though it has exactly zero chance of becoming law. Congress doesn\u2019t even vote on it, although lawmakers will apply it to the appropriations process and consider elements in separate pieces of legislation. It\u2019s an opening bid and will help put Democrats on Capitol Hill on the same page. Their argument is that a government working harder for more people is more important than keeping spending in check. The debt, in other words, is worth it. Massive. Trillions! There is not an appropriate word to describe the scale of this spending. Debt would eventually eclipse the size of the economy, which it hasn\u2019t done since World War II. Biden\u2019s budget is not the only budget. The House and Senate will pass and then reconcile their own budgets, which will still mostly be a notional document. The actual taxpayer money is spent through a different process, called appropriations. A first step toward budget reconciliation. The House and Senate budget process is important, however, because it is the first step in unlocking the budget reconciliation process, laid out in the 1974 Congressional Budget Act, which is really the only way today\u2019s lawmakers can get around the mutually assured obstruction that plagues Capitol Hill and pass legislation with a simple majority vote. Related: Here\u2019s what budget reconciliation is (and why it matters) If Democrats are to realize any of Biden\u2019s priorities in any form anywhere close to his vision, it\u2019ll almost certainly be through this budget reconciliation process, assuming they can get every Democrat in the Senate to agree to bypass Republicans. The process was created to help constrain government spending, but has mutated as the go-to method to get big things done. Budget reconciliation has been used to: In this way, Biden\u2019s budget is both relatively meaningless as something that won\u2019t be passed into law, but also a crucial element to the budget process \u2013 one that is essential to accomplishing anything at all. Political documents vs. policy proposals. A prime example of the political importance of budgets came in 2012, when Paul Ryan, then the GOP\u2019s vice presidential candidate, was attacked for his House budget proposal, which would have drastically pared back government spending, including on Medicare and Social Security. Scaring voters with elements of Ryan\u2019s budget proposal was a key (and successful) part of the Obama-Biden reelection strategy that year. Those days of peak fear about the national debt seem like a long time ago, long before Ryan, as House Speaker, helped blow the national debt up by passing Trump-era tax cuts. Republicans today are primed to use Biden\u2019s budget as exhibit number one in their argument that by giving Americans more from government, Democrats are pursuing socialism. New warning from the old GOP. Ryan, who left Washington for Wall Street when Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives under President Donald Trump in 2019, was back in the news this week, raising the alarm about Trump, although he barely used the former President\u2019s name. \u201cIf the conservative cause depends on the populist appeal of one personality, or on second-rate imitations, then we\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Ryan said in a speech at the Reagan library this week. His warning was drowned out by theater back in Washington, where Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is focused on regaining control of Capitol Hill in next year\u2019s midterms. He has been actively trying to kill a bipartisan review of the January 6 insurrection with a pressure campaign on fellow Republicans, hoping to move on from Trump and focus on opposing Democrats. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who supports a commission, offered a rare public and vocal rebuke of the party leaders. \u201cIs that really what this is about is everything is just one election cycle after another? Or are we going to acknowledge that as a country that is based on these principles of democracy that we hold so dear?\u201d she complained to reporters. Majorities up for grabs. The paradox here is that despite all the warnings from old-school Republicans worried about the party, Republicans stand a very good chance of retaking control of one or both chambers of Congress in November 2022. Democrats have a slim seven-seat advantage in the House and the Senate is evenly split. CNN\u2019s latest guide to which Senate seats are likely to flip in the coming 2022 midterm election was out this week and while Democrats have the opportunity to pick up seats in states Trump lost, like Pennsylvania, they face the prospect of defending seats in states Biden carried narrowly, like Georgia and Pennsylvania. Just eight of the 34 seats up for grabs are seen as competitive and four are currently held by each party. Nobody will have a very strong majority come 2023, but Biden will only be able to use budget reconciliation to accomplish anything if he can keep majorities, much less break a filibuster to pass one of the massive programs he envisions in his budget.",

            "article_content": "Louisiana voters are set to weigh in on the direction of the Democratic Party, choosing between a more moderate candidate who is aligned with President Joe Biden\u2019s White House and a more progressive contender who could make history as the first Black woman to represent the state in Congress, in a Saturday runoff election. Two state senators \u2013 Troy Carter and Karen Carter Peterson \u2013 are seeking to fill the 2nd District House seat of former Rep. Cedric Richmond, a one-time Congressional Black Caucus chairman who left for a job in Biden\u2019s White House and endorsed Carter. The election won\u2019t alter the balance of power in Congress \u2013 though it will fill a seat that\u2019s been vacant for months, giving majority Democrats slightly more breathing room. But it will serve as a gauge of the direction of the party more than three months into Biden\u2019s tenure, with voters in the largely Black congressional district choosing between two divergent approaches to politics and deciding how much gender is a factor. A debate Thursday night hosted by WWL-TV in New Orleans, in which candidates appeared virtually, showcased their different approaches, with Peterson criticizing Carter for seeking the endorsement of a Republican political action committee and pointing out that Louisiana Republicans have not accepted the legitimacy of Biden\u2019s victory against former President Donald Trump the November 2020 presidential election. \u201cThere will be times when I can work with Republicans, but I am not going to compromise my values on \u2018Medicare for All,\u2019 the Green New Deal, criminal justice reform, passing the George Floyd Act,\u201d Peterson said. Carter called Peterson\u2019s comments \u201cdivisive,\u201d and said he is willing to work with Republicans. \u201cI will stand for those Democratic ideals that I believe in. I will fight for them until the end. But I will also come to the table to compromise to make sure that I bring resources home for the people of Louisiana,\u201d he said. \u201cThis notion that we can\u2019t work together so we draw a line in the sand, and Democrats are devils to Republicans and Republicans are devils to Democrats \u2013 that\u2019s counterproductive.\u201d The winner will become the only Democrat in Louisiana\u2019s congressional delegation, representing a district that stretches from Baton Rouge to New Orleans. If she wins, Peterson would also become the first Black woman to represent Louisiana in Congress. Carter and Peterson were the top-two finishers in a 15-candidate March primary, with Carter receiving 36% of the vote and Peterson earning 23%. The third-place finisher, progressive activist Gary Chambers \u2013 the only other candidate with double-digit support, at 21% \u2013 endorsed Peterson, calling her \u201ca progressive fighter\u201d and touting her support for Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and a $15-and-hour minimum wage. Both are long-time veterans of Louisiana politics. Peterson is a veteran legislator who spent eight years as the state\u2019s Democratic Party chairwoman, while Carter is also a state lawmaker and former New Orleans city councilman. The race is the latest chapter in a political rivalry that has brewed for decades \u2013 and one that includes facing each other in a previous congressional election. In 2006, both ran against then-Rep. William Jefferson, a Democrat who at the time was under investigation for corruption and would later be convicted. Peterson finished second in the primary and Carter a distant fifth. In Louisiana, the top-two primary finishers advance to a runoff. Peterson lost to Jefferson in the general election. Carter has been more comfortable embracing the establishment banner, casting himself as an effective legislator and touting his endorsements from Richmond, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, Louisiana teachers\u2019 unions, and the Greater New Orleans AFL-CIO. Even before joining Biden\u2019s White House, Richmond was close to the President. He was a co-chair of his 2020 campaign and his transition team, and was a close adviser who was frequently on-hand for Biden events and served as a surrogate for his campaign. The race is a test of Richmond\u2019s own influence \u2013 he served in the seat for a decade \u2013 and of whether voters are persuaded by Carter having a direct line to the White House through the former congressman. But Peterson also has deep ties to leading establishment Democratic figures, including support from an influential group of veteran Black Democratic operatives: Donna Brazile, Minyon Moore, Leah Daughtry and Yolanda Caraway. She has also received a boost from leading progressive Democratic women, including Georgia voting rights activist Stacey Abrams, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as EMILY\u2019s List, which backs female Democratic candidates, and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Carter and Peterson have clashed in recent weeks over questions about policing and whether to defund police forces in the wake of a Minnesota jury\u2019s conviction of Derek Chauvin, the police officer who killed George Floyd last year. Peterson has criticized Carter\u2019s position on policing, pointing in a recent debate to a resolution he sponsored last year that expressed support for police and opposition to defunding the police as \u201ctone deaf.\u201d \u201cWe need to address the epidemic of police violence in our communities,\u201d Peterson said in an earlier debate. \u201cWe can\u2019t just reform the police. We need to reimagine public safety.\u201d Carter said that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t defund, we should smart-fund\u201d police, advocating for reforms such as de-escalation training, deeper background checks on potential officers and those already on police forces, camera vests and social media monitoring of officers. \u201cAll police officers are not bad. But the ones that are bad, we have to find and we have to get rid of them,\u201d Carter said. Peterson did not vote last year on the resolution she criticized, saying she was absent from the state Senate floor because majority Republicans were not enforcing mask mandates. \u201cIn the midst of the George Floyd killing, a resolution to address police and protecting the police, at a time when Black people are dying, was tone-deaf,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have the endorsement of Black Lives Matter. I\u2019m proud to support a complete restructuring of the public safety system. This system wasn\u2019t built to protect Black and brown people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday announced the launch of a new political advocacy group, \u201cAdvancing American Freedom,\u201d a move designed with an eye to his political future and his efforts to help shape the conversation around the Trump administration\u2019s legacy. The group\u2019s stated goal is to \u201cpromote the pro-freedom policies of the last four years that created unprecedented prosperity at home and restored respect for America abroad, to defend those policies from liberal attacks and media distortions, and to prevent the radical Left from enacting its policy agenda that would threaten America\u2019s freedoms,\u201d according to a statement from the group. Pence, who is widely reported to have presidential ambitions, has largely remained below the radar since leaving office in January after the last tumultuous month of the Trump administration. He penned an op-ed for the conservative publication The Daily Signal in March decrying a sweeping, Democratic-led voting rights bill that was later passed by the House but faces an uncertain path forward in the Senate. In the op-ed, Pence expressed concern about \u201cthe integrity of the 2020 election,\u201d citing \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201ctroubling\u201d voting irregularities. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would have changed the outcome of the 2020 election, and Pence did not make any specific claims in his op-ed. Rather, the former vice president continued to promote the misinformation pushed by former President Donald Trump that led Trump supporters to storm the US Capitol as Pence joined the Senate to certify the election\u2019s results. Pence is set to return to the speaking circuit with his first public appearance later this month in the early primary state of South Carolina, delivering remarks to the conservative \u201cPalmetto Family\u201d group at its annual gala in Columbia on April 29. The former vice president is expected to continue paid speaking engagements going forward. Worldwide Speakers Group announced last month that Pence was available for speech bookings, where, per the group, he \u201cplans to address leadership; policymaking; and faith, values, and service.\u201d With speculation that Pence could mount a presidential bid in 2024, the question remains whether Trump will consider running again himself. While the specter of another Trump run would freeze the 2024 Republican presidential field, Pence advisers say he could benefit. Unlike some other potential candidates, Pence does not need to get people familiar with his name nor would he need much time to put together a political operation. In the meantime, the creation of Advancing American Freedom will give Pence a vehicle to stay involved in the Republican political conversation as the midterm elections approach. The Wednesday announcement of the group included a lengthy list of allies and former administration officials, including his longtime pollster and Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway, former US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft, Newt and Callista Gingrich, who served as US Ambassador to the Holy See, Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow, former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, former Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Administrator Seema Verma, former Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, actor Kirk Cameron, and others. The statement also said that the group, which is based in Indianapolis, will target Biden-Harris policy: \u201cAdvancing American Freedom will oppose the expansion of government under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2019 radical Left policy agenda from Washington, D.C., into communities across the country.\u201d It comes as top Trump aide Stephen Miller has also launched a new legal advocacy group, America First Legal, which he described in an interview with the Wall Street Journal as \u201ca conservative answer to the ACLU.\u201d Trump personally praised Miller in a statement Wednesday, encouraging \u201call America First patriots (to) get behind America First Legal.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans have blasted Major League Baseball for moving its All-Star Game from Georgia to Colorado because of Georgia\u2019s controversial new elections law. Some of these Republicans are trying to convince Americans that baseball officials are not only wrong but hypocritical. On television and on social media, they have claimed or strongly suggested that the new Georgia law is no stricter than Colorado\u2019s elections law. That\u2019s not even close to true. MLB All-Star Game will move to Denver Colorado sends a mail ballot to every active registered voter. Because of this policy and others outlined below, experts say Colorado is one of the states that make it easiest to vote; David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit, said it is \u201carguably at the very top of the list of easiest states to vote.\u201d There is debate even among experts about where precisely Georgia ranks \u2013 but it is very obviously more restrictive than Colorado. The Republican attempts to portray Colorado as Georgia\u2019s equivalent have either been plain false or lacking in essential context. Yet they have quickly made their way around the right-wing media ecosystem. Echoing assertions uttered by others on Fox News, network reporter Peter Doocy asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday if the White House is concerned that Major League Baseball is moving the game to a state \u201cwhere voting regulations are very similar to Georgia.\u201d Doocy\u2019s premise was simply inaccurate. Here is a look at the many problems with some of the Republican claims about Colorado and Georgia. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, and various other Republicans have pointed out that Georgia\u2019s new law mandates 17 days of in-person early voting, while Colorado\u2019s in-person early voting begins 15 days prior to Election Day. This is true \u2013 but leaves out a critical piece of context: Colorado, unlike Georgia, sends out a mail ballot to every active registered voter. And the overwhelming majority of Colorado voters choose to vote by mail rather than in a voting booth. In the 2020 general election, 94% of Colorado ballots cast were mail ballots, the state Secretary of State\u2019s office says. In the 2016 general election, it was 93%. In Georgia, where voters have to request a mail ballot if they want one, about 26% of votes in the 2020 general election were mail-in votes. The new Georgia law also prohibits the state from moving in the direction of Colorado-style mail-dominated elections. The law says mail ballots can only be provided upon a specific request from a voter. And it prohibits the secretary of state and other government officials from sending even absentee ballot applications to every active registered voter, as Raffensperger, a Republican, did for the 2020 primaries on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. Scott claimed in his tweet that Atlanta \u201chas more day-of voting rights than CO.\u201d If he was talking about Election Day rights, he was wrong. Colorado keeps its ballot drop boxes open until the evening of Election Day. Georgia did the same in 2020 \u2013 but now, under its new law, cannot do so in the future. Under the new law, drop boxes can only be available during the early voting period, which closes on the Friday before Election Day. In addition, Colorado allows people to register to vote on Election Day and then cast a ballot. In Georgia, the registration deadline is the fifth Monday before Election Day. It\u2019s not just Election Day during which Colorado offers greater drop box access than Georgia does. Under Georgia\u2019s new law, each county has to have at least one drop box. But the law also says that each county can\u2019t have more than one additional drop box per early voting site or per 100,000 active registered voters, whichever number is smaller. This provision will mean that big Georgia counties will have far fewer drop boxes than big Colorado counties. Atlanta\u2019s Fulton County, with a population of over 1 million in 2019, says it would have to go from 38 drop boxes in the November election to eight in the future. Denver, with a population of about 727,000 in 2019, also had 38 drop boxes in November, and it is not being forced into a sharp reduction. In fact, Colorado\u2019s most populous counties are required to have a minimum of one drop box per 12,500 active voters. (The requirements get gradually smaller for counties of smaller sizes.) In 2020, Denver was required to have a minimum of 35 drop boxes. That\u2019s not all. The Georgia law requires drop boxes to be moved inside elections offices or early voting locations (except during emergencies declared by the governor), where they can only be available during early voting hours \u2013 at most, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Colorado\u2019s drop boxes will continue to be available outdoors 24 hours a day. Some Republicans have wrongly hinted that Colorado\u2019s voter identification requirements are equivalent to Georgia\u2019s. Others have been straight-up false, inaccurately claiming that Colorado requires photo identification in particular.   In one viral tweet, which was deleted after we fact-checked it on Twitter, Greg Price of the right-wing website The Daily Caller claimed that Colorado \u201crequires photo ID to vote in person.\u201d Kemp said on Fox News that, from what he has been told, \u201cthey also have a photo ID requirement.\u201d And Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said on Fox News: \u201cI got some shocking, in fact terrible news for all of your viewers, especially for all of the social justice warriors at Major League Baseball: Colorado appears to be require photo identification to vote in person.\u201d None of that is true. Colorado allows both photo ID and non-photo ID for in-person voting; the list of acceptable non-photo identification includes a recent utility bill, bank statement, government check, or paycheck; a Medicare card; or a copy of a birth certificate. (The full list is online for anyone to read.) Georgia, conversely, does require photo ID for in-person voting. So Scott\u2019s tweet that both states have \u201cvoter ID\u201d is correct, but the two states do not have the same voter ID requirements even for in-person voting. And under the new Georgia law, the states are even more different when it comes to mail voting. Under the previous Georgia law, elections officials validated voters\u2019 identities by checking the signatures attached to their mail-in ballots. Under the new law, voters have to provide a Georgia driver\u2019s license number, the number on their state identification card, or the last four digits of their Social Security number. If they don\u2019t have any of that, they can provide one of several alternative forms of identification, such as a copy of a utility bill, bank statement or government check. In Colorado, a signature is sufficient for mail voters other than first-time Colorado voters who have not previously provided their ID to elections officials in the state. Supporters of the Georgia law are entitled to argue that its ID provision for mail voting is not especially onerous given how many options it gives voters. But it\u2019s just wrong to suggest the Georgia provision is the same as Colorado\u2019s provision. The now-deleted viral tweet by Price, of The Daily Caller, noted that Colorado also has a restriction on people handing out food and drink to voters waiting in line. That\u2019s true. But the restriction is way narrower than the much-criticized food and water restriction in the new Georgia law. Colorado says campaign workers can hand out \u201cwater, snacks, and other items\u201d to voters in line. It just says that these people can\u2019t wear clothing or accessories with the name of a candidate or party if they are within 100 feet of the polling place. The Georgia, law, conversely, says that \u201cany person\u201d is banned from handing out any gift to voters, including food and drink, within either 25 feet of any voter in line or within 150 feet of the polling place. The only exception is for elections staff who set up unattended water stations. It\u2019s worth noting that the Republicans who are likening the Georgia law to Colorado law are not mentioning some of the most important provisions of the Georgia law. For example, the Georgia law allows the Republican-controlled state elections board to hand-pick someone to take temporary control of a county elections board that the state board has deemed to be in violation of elections law or state board policies. The state board is allowed to seize control of four county elections systems at a time.",

            "article_content": "The first congressional elections of the 2022 midterm cycle are set for Saturday, when Louisiana voters go to the polls to fill a pair of vacancies in the state\u2019s House delegation. A Democratic battle is brewing in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge-area 2nd District, pitting two of the state\u2019s top Democrats against each other. The seat opened when former Rep. Cedric Richmond left for a job in President Joe Biden\u2019s White House. Two state senators are the leading candidates: Troy Carter, the state Senate minority leader, has Richmond\u2019s endorsement, while Karen Carter Peterson is backed by Georgia voting rights activist Stacey Abrams and the Bernie Sanders-aligned Our Revolution. Republican Julia Letlow, the widow of former Congressman-elect Luke Letlow, is running against 11 rivals for the 5th District seat in northeastern Louisiana that her husband won in a December runoff but never got to fill. There is little doubt about which party will ultimately hold the two seats: the 2nd District is overwhelmingly Democratic, and the 5th District is heavily Republican. But it\u2019s less clear whether either will choose a winner Saturday, or if \u2013 under Louisiana\u2019s all-party primary system, in which the top two finishers advance to a one-on-one showdown if no candidate tops 50% of the vote \u2013 one or both races will head to a runoff in April. In the 2nd District, Carter and Peterson are the best-known candidates in the 15-person field. Peterson, a former state Democratic Party chairwoman, has run as a progressive by embracing policy positions like the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all. She has pointed out that Louisiana has never elected a Black woman to Congress. She also has deep ties to leading establishment Democratic figures, including support from an influential group of veteran Black Democratic operatives: Donna Brazile, Minyon Moore, Leah Daughtry and Yolanda Caraway. \u201cWhen women are not at the table and seated, we are typically on the menu,\u201d Carter Peterson told CNN in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t like that we\u2019ve never had an African American woman serve from Louisiana in our congressional delegation. That needs to end.\u201d Carter has been more comfortable embracing the establishment banner, casting himself as an effective legislator and touting his endorsement from Richmond, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, Louisiana teachers\u2019 unions, and the Greater New Orleans AFL-CIO. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s never been about issues that make the biggest headlines. It\u2019s about the issues that make the biggest difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said in an ad. Among the other 13 candidates is activist Gary Chambers Jr., who has also built a following in part stemming from his criticism in June of a Louisiana school board member who defended naming a school after Robert E. Lee \u2013 and who then appeared to be online shopping while at a hearing on the topic. \u201cYou sit your arrogant self in here and sit on there shopping while the pain and the hurt of the people of this community is on display because you don\u2019t give a damn and you should resign,\u201d Chambers told the school board member in the hearing. In the 5th District, national Republicans have worked hard to send the signal that Letlow is their preference. Her husband, Luke Letlow, was elected to the seat in December but never took office. He died on December 29 after being diagnosed with Covid-19. Two weeks later, Julia Letlow, an administrator at The University of Louisiana Monroe, said she would run for the seat in the special election to replace her late husband. Former Rep. Ralph Abraham \u2013 whose retirement opened the door for his former chief of staff Luke Letlow\u2019s victory in December \u2013 opted against running again for his old seat. State Rep. Lance Harris, the second-place finisher to Letlow last year, also stayed out. And Julia Letlow\u2019s entrance into the race effectively kept other major Republican names out. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the No. 2 House Republican, Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, backed Letlow. So did former President Donald Trump, who called her \u201ca wonderful and talented person.\u201d Former Vice President Mike Pence and the state GOP have also supported Letlow. Earlier this month, she told ABC that Luke had always encouraged her to run for office if the opportunity presented itself. She said spending so much time on the campaign trail with her late husband had prepared her for the run. \u201cListening to the people from every parish and listening to their dreams for their future and their ideas on how to make this region better,\u201d Letlow said. \u201cThey stole my heart as I campaigned right along with Luke and so I feel equipped and ready to carry that torch forward.\u201d The question in Letlow\u2019s race is whether she will be held under 50% of the vote. Sandra \u201cCandy\u201d Christophe is the only Democrat in the 12-person field, and could be in position to benefit if other Republicans siphon votes away from Letlow. Democrats in Louisiana\u2019s 5th District have gotten 30 to 35% support in recent congressional elections there, and matching those numbers against a split GOP field could position Christophe for a runoff. If Letlow wins, she would increase the record number of Republican women in the House to 31. CNN\u2019s Jasmine Wright, Annie Grayer and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On Saturday, Judith Whitmer won an election to be the next chair of the Nevada Democratic Party. She did so with the strong support of the liberal wing of the party aligned with Vermont democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and the backing of the local chapter pf the Democratic Socialists of America. The result led to the immediate resignation of the current state party staff \u2013 all of which were aligned with the establishment wing of the party long represented by former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. To understand what happened and what the democratic socialist takeover means for the 2022 Senate and governor\u2019s races in the state \u2013 as well as Nevada\u2019s hope to be the first-in-the-nation vote come 2024 \u2013 I reached out to the one and only Jon Ralston, founder of the Nevada Independent and the single best political reporter in the state. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: What exactly happened here? Ralston: So this was an election for state chairman, which is conducted by the few hundred people on what is known as the central committee. These are hardcore activists and party faithful. In this case, Judith Whitmer, who runs the largest county party in Clark (Las Vegas), was running on a progressive slate. But the elected officials, including US Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who is up this cycle, knew she was not as reliable as a good party soldier, and that she was supported by Bernie Sanders backers. Electeds want someone they can count on to help them win. So they took a shot and recruited the only person who would have had a chance in what are always messy internal conflicts and tapped Tick Segerblom to run against her. Segerblom, a former legislator and now on the powerful Clark County Commission, has been a huge Bernie supporter for years and may be the most liberal elected official in Nevada history. He had all the elected endorsements and party insiders pushing him. If anyone could beat Whitmer, he could. He didn\u2019t. He lost by 30 votes out of about 450 cast. Cillizza: Was this a surprise? Or had it been a long time coming? Ralston: Not a surprise. The establishment candidates rarely win these battles in either party. The activists feel beholden to no one and often are hostile to their own elected officials. It sounds nuts, but go to a central committee sometime and experience the yearlong celebration of Festivus. Whitmer was always the favorite. This was a long time coming, though. Sanders has had a foothold in Nevada since 2016. He lost the caucus to Hillary Clinton, but then his supporters took over county parties and were primed to take over the state convention and reverse the caucus result \u2013 don\u2019t ask, it\u2019s a crazy system \u2013 but they botched it and the convention had to be shut down by hotel security after the Bernie troops nearly rioted. This was a victory for the establishment and the vaunted [former Sen. Harry] Reid Machine, which saw Bernie as a weaker candidate than Clinton. But the Sanders supporters are ferocious and dedicated and they were better organized in 2020, and there was not the same enthusiasm for Joe Biden. Sanders crushed Biden 2-to-1 in the caucus here and that helped the Bernie folks populate the central committee. So the establishment/Reid machine knew it was an uphill struggle even with Segerblom, and they and the [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] made sure money was funneled out of the party ($450,000) before the vote in case they lost. Then, all of the staff resigned right afterward, and the Reid folks have vowed to set up a separate entity because they have no faith in the party to do what they have done successfully for more than a decade: Launder (legally) money through the party to pay for voter programs.

Cillizza: How much should we read into this in terms of the fight for control of the broader Democratic party nationally? Ralston: There is no question in the world of [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] and Bernie [Sanders] that the progressive wing is feeling its oats and demanding more from the party leaders. They want \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a $15 minimum wage, etc. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! But the real danger for the Democrats \u2013 here and nationally \u2013 is the mirror image of what it is for the Republicans: They can win primaries, but they will have a much tougher time in general elections. In Nevada, the electorate prefers moderates \u2013 be they Democrats or Republicans, and the machine knows that. It\u2019s why the establishment wanted Biden over Bernie \u2013 electability, or at least that was the argument. In Nevada, this so-called revolution was against an establishment that has won four straight presidential races, elected two Democratic senators, three of our House members, all but one of the state\u2019s six constitutional officers and both houses of the Legislature. But these folks who took over \u2013 and this goes for some of them nationally, too \u2013 want to push the party to the left and, as is often the case, enforce purity tests. They have always, though idealism and/or arrogance, believed they believe what most people believe, which is dissonant with what results have often shown. Cillizza: Nevada is a swing state \u2013 with a big Senate race in 2022, a governor\u2019s race in 2022 and then the 2024 presidential. Does what\u2019s happened jeopardize Democratic chances in any of these future contests? Ralston: It could. But too early to tell. The party machine will set up an entity as a workaround to the party, but this will be cumbersome and garner attention. I assume it will work because these folks know what they are doing. But it is far from optimal, and I am sure the Republicans are loving it. It\u2019s much simpler to have a party, not two potentially competing, even warring organs. It also could embolden lefties to run in primaries against the incumbents, which would not be helpful to the Democrats. But the Democrats have the benefit of two incumbents who have access to fundraising and the Republicans have no candidates yet and a very weak bench. As for 2024, candidates matter. And 2022 wills set the table for \u201924 \u2013 if the Republicans can win the governor\u2019s mansion, totally different ballgame. Cliche alert: Time will tell. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cThe big winner of this shakeup is __________.\u201d Now, explain. Ralston: The big winner is progressives in the short run. They are the David to the Reid Machine\u2019s Goliath. But this may be a Pyrrhic victory \u2013 if they can\u2019t put together a functioning party and they have no money. If they can find a Sugar Bernie and organize on the ground, they may win some primaries against incumbents. But will that cost them in the general? The big winner in the long run is the Republicans. They have long suffered with a dysfunctional apparatus run by a caricature of a party thug. Now they can watch as the other side suffers. Can they exploit it and win some major elections? Seven statewide offices are up in 2022, including governor and US Senate. If they can\u2019t do it this time\u2026 You didn\u2019t ask, but the big loser could be Nevada\u2019s bid to be the first-in-the-nation primary. We are going to switch from a caucus and push for being first. But if you are the powers that be in the Democratic National Committee and you saw this happen, how confident would you be? We matter now, but that is in jeopardy.",

            "article_content": "Republicans are already making moves toward the 2024 election, jockeying to succeed former President Donald Trump now that he has departed Washington, either by picking up his mantle or by trying to steer the party in a new direction. A handful of ambitious GOP politicians are positioning themselves against President Joe Biden and building the political operations that will allow them to travel and campaign with fellow Republicans. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the failed 2016 GOP presidential candidate who bolstered Trump\u2019s effort to throw out states\u2019 2020 votes, aimed for blue-collar workers this week with a message lambasting Biden\u2019s decision to re-enter the Paris climate accord, asking: \u201cParis or Pittsburgh?\u201d He is offering to send those who sign up for his email list \u201cPittsburgh > Paris\u201d bumper stickers.   Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the United Nations, last week launched a political action committee called \u201cStand for America\u201d that she told supporters in an email that she is focused on the 2022 midterms. \u201cThere is nothing \u2018normal\u2019 about an agenda focused on socialism, defunding the police, the Green New Deal, and Medicare for All,\u201d Haley wrote, characterizing the agenda of some progressive Democrats, which Biden does not share. And in what seemed to be a nod to his own ambitions, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo posted a countdown to Election Day 2024 Thursday morning on Twitter. \u201c1,384 days,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot having a Republican in the White House opens it up so that other people feel that they have an opportunity for 2024,\u201d said Jeff Kaufmann, the Republican chairman in Iowa, traditionally the first state to vote in the presidential nominating process. Kaufmann pointed out that, with a governor\u2019s race and a Senate contest on the ballot in Iowa in next year\u2019s midterms, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be opportunities for people to come into the state before 2022 to be helpful to some of our candidates, and those races will heat up very, very shortly.\u201d It\u2019s far too early to gauge the forces that will steer the 2024 Republican presidential primary, with Biden\u2019s presidency in its infancy and Trump\u2019s future clouded. Presidential primaries typically do not kick off until after the midterm elections. Still, potential candidates typically spend the two preceding years building political infrastructures and campaigning for potential allies. And on the Democratic side, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a close Biden ally, insisted over the weekend that the President will run for re-election in 2024. \u201cHe is planning to run again,\u201d Coons told Politico. \u201cHe knows that we are at the middle of an absolute turning point, a pivot point in American history. And he\u2019s up for the challenge.\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that Biden is not focused on politics at this point, and will \u201cwait until sometime into his first term to speak more about his political plans moving forward.\u201d For the GOP field, the Senate\u2019s upcoming impeachment trial is the first key milestone. If enough Republicans join Democrats to convict Trump, they could bar him from ever running for federal office again \u2013 staving off years of speculation about whether Trump would seek another term. But if Trump isn\u2019t convicted by the Senate, then he would loom large in the 2024 picture. That could force Republicans who worked in his administration \u2013 former Vice President Mike Pence, Pompeo and Haley among them \u2013 as well as Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill who are eyeing 2024 \u2013 to proceed cautiously. \u201cThe last thing they need to do is look like they\u2019re trying to cut the president off at the pass, if you will. They need to be seen as being helpful and being productive,\u201d said Drew McKissick, the South Carolina Republican Party chairman. Trump \u201cactually had coattails\u201d in Iowa, Kaufmann said, and any Republican considering a run in 2024 faces \u201ca lot of wait and see\u201d as Trump makes decisions about his own political future. Kaufmann said any Republican senator who votes to convict Trump in the Senate\u2019s upcoming impeachment trial, though, would \u201cbe DOA if they actually voted for that.\u201d Tied to questions about Trump\u2019s own future is whether Republican voters will look for someone who was a close ally over the last four years, or will seek a new direction after Trump became just the fifth president in the last 100 years to lose their bid for another term. The group of close Trump allies could include Cruz and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, the two Republicans who led the effort to reject the Electoral College votes that made Biden president, as well as Pompeo, and potentially even Trump\u2019s children. Pence faces a precarious path too, after a falling-out at the end of the Trump presidency over Pence\u2019s refusal to attempt to block the counting of Electoral College votes from states where Trump baselessly claimed there had been voter fraud. In his hometown of Columbus, Indiana, on Wednesday, in his first remarks after attending Biden\u2019s inauguration and departing Washington, Pence stuck to his familiar public approach of heaping praise on Trump. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether Republican voters would reward him as Trump\u2019s loyal lieutenant, or penalize him for their break in their final weeks in office. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and Florida Sen. Rick Scott both made highly unusual moves in 2020, paying for their own advertisements in swing states backing Trump. Those senators have signaled they\u2019ll make up a \u201cno caucus\u201d of sorts, along with Cruz and Hawley, positioning themselves against nearly everything that Biden proposes. Haley, meanwhile, has distanced herself from Trump in some ways. She called him \u201cbadly wrong\u201d for stoking the January 6 riot at the US Capitol during a speech earlier this month to the Republican National Committee, and said his actions were \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d \u201cHis actions since Election Day will be judged harshly by history,\u201d she said then. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, one of the fiercest GOP critics of Trump\u2019s actions, including his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, has also not ruled out a 2024 bid. \u201cI do want to be a part of the discussion about where we go as a party and where we go as a country so I\u2019m going to try and continue to be involved and speak up and let people know what I think we should do,\u201d Hogan said in a December interview aired on Bloomberg. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a longtime Trump ally, broke fiercely from Trump late last year. He aired television ads urging Americans to wear masks, and referred to Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election results as an \u201cabsurdity.\u201d \u201cRepublicans now need to say, thank you, Mr. President, for your service. Thank you for the good things you did while you\u2019re in office that we agree with, and we now need to move on to make sure that we\u2019re stating Republican principles that matter to the people in this country \u2026 and the fundamental challenge for Republicans is to move on,\u201d Christie said on ABC in December. \u201cMove on.\u201d",

After months of wrangling, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin took to Fox News on Sunday to announce he would not vote for the Build Back Better legislation, dealing a huge body blow to the Biden administration. As soon as Manchin made his announcement, there was instant Monday-morning quarterbacking about how the president should have been tougher on Manchin. And if there was a model for Biden to get Manchin on board, it would be President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose legislative record was built on his famous \u201cJohnson Treatment,\u201d his ability to seduce, threaten, and persuade members of Congress to vote the way he wanted. It\u2019s clear Biden needs to leverage his power and use all the tools at his disposal to achieve his agenda, but it\u2019s also imperative to grasp the limits of what a president can do and look to LBJ\u2019s presidency to draw a feasible roadmap forward for Biden and the Democrats. Donald Trump's influence is fading The quintessential image of LBJ is that of \u201cThe Treatment.\u201d Johnson, who was about 6\u20194\u201d, would invade the physical space of lawmakers and stand over them, with his face just inches away from theirs, until they gave him the answer he sought. \u201cThe Treatment\u201d was also captured in audio recordings of White House telephone conversations, with Johnson doing everything from trying to cajole politicians into voting his way to berating and threatening those who dared to defy him. As the great historian Robert Caro recounted, Johnson\u2019s ability to get what he wanted was \u201clegislative genius.\u201d Johnson dangled favors to get lawmakers on board, and often cobbled together coalitions by promising federal funds for pet projects that would help their standing at home. When someone wasn\u2019t being agreeable, Johnson could turn on them, isolating them from the Oval Office and refusing to support initiatives these lawmakers could show their constituents to win reelection. Johnson also worked with grassroots organizations to pressure obstinate members of Congress. He relied on the Civil Rights Movement, for instance, to pressure his opponents at the local level. The union movement, with its mass membership, was another crucial tool to lobby for programs like civil rights and health care. But Johnson was not a superhero. More than anyone, he understood Congress was an awesome force. If a president didn\u2019t have the votes to spare, there was sometimes nothing he could do to change things. Before 1965, Johnson was extraordinarily frustrated he was unable to convince Congress to pass a bill that would provide health care to the elderly\u2014Medicare. Even after Johnson took over as president in the wake of John F. Kennedy\u2019s tragic death, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Wilbur Mills, a conservative Democrat from Arkansas, refused to budge. He argued Medicare would be too expensive and threaten the viability of the Social Security system. Johnson tried everything he could, but nothing could convince Mills. The last thing Biden needs This changed after November 1964 \u2013 not because of Johnson but because of the new landscape created by the landslide election. Democrats had a 295-seat majority in the House and 68 seats in the Senate. Many of the new Democrats had run on campaigns promising to pass Medicare and Johnson\u2019s decisive defeat of Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater\u2014who staunchly opposed Medicare\u2014was seen as a clear mandate that voters wanted the bill. It was because of the election, not Johnson\u2019s cajoling, that Mills finally changed his stance and accepted the inevitability of Medicare. Rather than standing in the way of history, he worked with the administration to push for legislation that was bigger and bolder than anything the president had imagined. The final bill, with Mills playing the architect rather than obstructionist, included hospital care, coverage for doctor\u2019s visits, and a health care program for the poor called Medicaid. Today, Biden must use all the tools Johnson deployed if he wants a shot at passing some version of the Build Back Better bill next year. The largest coal mining union in the country has called for Manchin to reverse his position and Biden should work with them to build pressure against the Senator in his own state by making it clear just how much the Build Back Better bill would benefit West Virginians. Biden should also leverage his position and let Manchin know if he remains a no, the doors to the Oval Office won\u2019t be open to him for much longer. The President can also bite the bullet and accept a much smaller legislative package in January \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t include many of the climate change provisions Manchin opposes, to see if it makes a difference. The risk, of course, is that Biden gives up too much and ends up with nothing if other, more progressive Democrats refuse to accept this deal.  Perhaps the most effective strategy would be to appeal to Manchin\u2019s own ego. Johnson loved to do this to lawmakers, realizing there was no better means of persuasion than to let them wield their power and lap up the credit and adulation. With Manchin, Biden can remind the Senator a shift from decisive opposition to key architect\u2014the same role Mills had played with Medicare or Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen with the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2014would ensure his place in the history books. In the end, however, there are limits to what the President can achieve. If Manchin refuses to respond to any of these entreaties, there isn\u2019t much Biden can do. The legislation might very well be dead \u2013 unless Democrats can grow their majority in 2022 or 2024 and render Manchin\u2019s vote inconsequential. But regardless of how it all unfolds, Manchin\u2019s months-long opposition to the Build Back Better bill should be a reminder to Democrats the future of this presidency hinges on the composition of Congress. Given that partisanship is much stronger today than in 1964, Democrats now need to be strategic about growing their collective power if it comes down to outflanking Manchin, rather than changing him.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. President Joe Biden scored a major victory on Friday night. For months,\u00a0negotiations between different factions of the Democratic Party\u00a0have\u00a0threatened\u00a0 to tank his domestic agenda.\u00a0But after the\u00a0President stepped up the pressure and urged lawmakers to \u201cvote now,\u201d the House passed the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill with bipartisan support, sending it to Biden\u2019s desk for his signature. House Democrats also moved forward with the larger spending package to strengthen the social safety net and fund environmental programs, with a tentative deadline to pass the legislation by mid-November. The deal took place after a difficult week. Democrats have been scrambling for answers after the party suffered several resounding election losses, from the gubernatorial race in Virginia to local contests on Long Island.\u00a0Many Democrats, convinced they know exactly what went wrong, claim the party moved too far to the left. \u201cNobody elected [Biden] to be FDR, they elected him to be normal and to stop the chaos,\u201d said\u00a0Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. But Biden has chosen a more ambitious path. As a veteran legislator, he still believes when voters yearned for competence and normality in November 2020, it didn\u2019t just mean\u00a0they wanted a President\u00a0who\u00a0avoided\u00a0Twitter and refrained\u00a0from firing White House staff in dramatic, made for television announcements.\u00a0He understood Americans wanted a\u00a0President who could actually tackle the nation\u2019s biggest problems. And Biden is on to something important. Competence means governance and problem-solving.\u00a0It\u00a0means getting things done, so voters can see tangible results. The\u00a0New Deal was successful not because it offered voters some grand ideological vision of society, but because President Franklin Roosevelt addressed the problems Americans faced by providing public jobs, electrifying rural areas, building roads and bridges and creating unemployment insurance and Social Security. Biden's peacock moment In 1965, voters were excited about President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Medicare not because it shifted the debate over the American safety net, but because older Americans could afford the health care they needed. Part of what has made President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act\u00a0more\u00a0popular over time\u00a0is voters gradually experienced firsthand the benefits it provided. Biden also enjoyed high approval ratings early in his presidency in part due to the vaccine rollout and the American Rescue Plan, which provided financial support to families across the country. Our political standards have fallen so far we have forgotten what competence actually looks like. When Spanberger argues Americans voted for Biden because they wanted him to be \u201cnormal,\u201d she underestimates what the American electorate wants and needs. What made Biden so attractive to Americans was he came to office with decades of experience. In fact, he entered the White House as one of the most seasoned politicians since George H.W. Bush.\u00a0In the aftermath of the tumultuous Trump presidency, Biden seemed like the kind of person who could get things done and rely on the help of experts and political veterans who knew how to move the needle on public policy. To win, Democrats need to end the backroom dealing To be sure, President Biden would do well to spend his time wrestling over his rhetoric in the months ahead. Should the\u00a0President stick to his guns, continuing to offer a robust Rooseveltian defense of New Deal liberalism?\u00a0Or should he take a page from former President Bill Clinton, who in 1996 famously proclaimed in his State of the Union Address the \u201cera of big government is over\u201d? Ultimately, Biden needs to ensure\u00a0the reconciliation bill passes. And even then, he should continue to focus on the core issues that concern average Americans and make legislative, as well as executive progress on issues like stabilizing the economy. Though October\u2019s job report was promising, inflation and snags in the supply chain remain\u00a0key issues to address. The more\u00a0the President can ameliorate these problems through the levers of policy, the more\u00a0his numbers will likely improve. Addressing other perennial issues, such as drug costs, childcare, family leave policy and climate change will only boost his standing. Despite some Democrats\u00a0denouncing\u00a0progressive policies\u00a0in response to the party\u2019s election losses this week, Biden should continue to work in tandem with Democratic leaders to make progress on these issues, rather than getting mired in a conversation about procedural issues or costs.\u00a0Any success at addressing these longstanding problems would be good for Biden, good for the party and a huge benefit for the American people. And, finally, the pandemic remains front and center. Over the past few months, the administration has made significant progress with vaccines. By shifting to a more proactive approach with vaccine mandates, we have seen big jumps in the number of Americans receiving the jab. The more\u00a0the administration can do to reach unvaccinated populations in the US, control the spread of the virus at home and work with allies to boost supplies of the vaccine in other parts of the world, the better the prospects are for an economic rebound.  Passing the infrastructure bill counts as a significant victory for Biden. But there is still the reconciliation package \u2013 and plenty more to be done beyond that. If the Democrats cannot offer tangible progress on the economy, the pandemic and popular social policies like paid family leave, they will likely be looking at Republican congressional majorities in 2023 and a very competitive presidential election the year after.\u00a0But if they keep problem-solving, the party can beat the odds and pave the way\u00a0for a much brighter future.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. If the ongoing negotiations over President Joe Biden\u2019s Build Back Better agenda were a game show, it would not be called \u201cDeal or No Deal.\u201d Rather, it would be \u201cDeal or End American Democracy.\u201d The stakes are much more than an historic opportunity to cut child poverty, expand Medicare, lower the cost of childcare, prescription drugs and higher education, and more. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) seems to understand this. In remarks to warring Democratic moderates and progressives on Monday, Pelosi was clear that she\u2019s determined to land the plane, balancing both her centrist and liberal wings. Fortunately for the Democrats, Pelosi is the legislative equivalent of Capt. Sully Sullenberger, who famously landed US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River in 2009. I predict Pelosi will land her budget on the Potomac \u2013 but it\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride. Looming above all of those policy goals is an existential issue: If the Democrats fail, it could send our democracy into a death spiral. Republicans could take the House; Trump could take the GOP presidential nomination, and those two forces could combine to finish what the insurrectionists set out to do on January 6. Earlier this month, my sons and I went on a wilderness trip to Montana. No phones, no electricity, no modern amenities. No news was truly good news. In addition to reconnecting with nature \u2013 and my remarkable kids \u2013 I had the time and space to contemplate the bigger picture for our beloved country. When I returned, I saw two parties divided, but over very different things. The Democrats were arguing about tactics: when to vote on which bill; whether to alter or abolish the filibuster; how much to spend and where to spend it. In other words, the usual stuff. Republicans, though, are engaged in a very different debate: between the Trumpers and the Constitutionalists. Trumpers want to discredit our free and fair elections. They want to restrict voting rights and empower their henchmen and women to set aside electoral results they don\u2019t like. Andrew Yang: How to get our democracy working again Constitutionalists, led by the redoubtable Liz Cheney (R-WY) want to honor elections and enact their conservative policies the old-fashioned way \u2013 by earning more votes than the Democrats. The Democratic tussle is currently a standoff; the Republican fight is a rout. Nearly 60% of Republicans say believing the Big Lie \u2013 that the election was stolen from Donald Trump \u2013 is important to being Republican, according to a recent CNN poll. On Fox News Sunday this week, the second-ranking House Republican, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, refused to speak the simple truth that Biden won the election fair and square. Chuck Grassley, the senior-most Republican in the Senate who has long been known for his flinty independence, stunned some observers by praising Trump\u2019s role in the alleged January coup. We used to have a word for powerful, senior members of a political party: leaders. But some of the most powerful Republicans have become Trump sycophants, even as Trump undermines our democracy. As Robert Kagan has powerfully argued, we are not headed for a Constitutional crisis; we are in one right now. The constitutional arsonists are perilously close to taking over the fire department. Heading into the 2022 midterms, the GOP has two immutable advantages: history, and the district maps. History tells us, over the last 50 years, a newly-elected president\u2019s party loses an average of 28 seats in its first midterm. As if that weren\u2019t enough, Republicans control the post-Census ability to draw 187 congressional districts, while Democrats make the maps for just 84 House seats. Those GOP advantages are built in. There is nothing House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy or former President Donald Trump or anyone else can do to squander them. 'SNL' is right. Democrats are toast without a deal The Democrats, on the other hand, have a couple of potential advantages as well: the economy, and Biden\u2019s popularity. Neither, to put it mildly, are set in stone. Goldman Sachs this week issued a more pessimistic economic forecast than previous predictions, shaving growth projections for this year from 5.7% to 5.6%, and lowering its 2022 guesstimate from 4.4% to 4%. To be sure, growth in the 4-to-6% range is pretty robust. But happiness (and disappointment) is a function of expectations. If folks were expecting a rocket launch, a firecracker feels like a dud. Biden\u2019s popularity is even more uncertain. As I write this, a recent Gallup poll has Biden\u2019s approval underwater, with 43% of Americans supporting Joe and 53% opposing him.  To put it into perspective, his predecessor was also at 44% approval going into the 2018 midterms; he lost 40 House seats. Barack Obama\u2019s approval was 45% in 2010; he lost 63 seats. And my old boss Bill Clinton had 48% support in 1994; he lost 52 seats. But here\u2019s the thing, Democrats. You have the power to make the economy stronger. You also have the ability to make the President more popular. By passing his damn agenda. The latest CBS poll quantifies what all of us know: the content of Biden\u2019s agenda is wildly popular. Sixty-seven percent support universal pre-K. Sixty-one percent support free community college. Seventy-three percent support paid family and medical leave. Eighty-four percent support Medicare coverage for dental, vision, and hearing. And 88% support lowering prescription drug prices under Medicare \u2013 88%, people. Moderate Democrats were betrayed by their own party You can\u2019t get nine out of ten Americans to support almost anything in these divided, tribal, negative times. But Biden has done it. He has put together an agenda that is overwhelmingly popular \u2013 paid for by taxing the rich and big corporations (which garners the support of more than two-thirds of all Americans). Despite the stunning popularity of Biden\u2019s agenda, only one in ten Americans (in that same CBS poll) say they know a lot about what\u2019s in it. And, let\u2019s face it, that is high \u2013 a lot of folks probably said they knew what was in it when they really didn\u2019t. The infighting, the backbiting, the nail-biting on Capitol Hill \u2013 that gets all the attention. Democratic moderates whine about wanting to pass the infrastructure bill right away and put off the health, education and childcare package for later. Whatever. Leftists complain moderates are trimming the price tag. But even the supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d $2 trillion social spending bill would, when combined with the already-enacted American Rescue Plan and the infrastructure bill, amount to $5 trillion in spending. Five. Trillion. To put that into perspective, $5 trillion was the entire American Gross Domestic Product in 1987. When you\u2019re talking about spending an amount equal to the totality of the American economy under President Reagan, you\u2019re talking real money. So, make the deal. Take the deal. Moderates should stop defending the indefensible filibuster. Leftists should replace the moronic \u201cDefund the Police\u201d mantra with a new slogan: \u201cFund the Family.\u201d  The Biden agenda would help lift millions out of poverty. It would help make human life on earth more sustainable by combating carbon pollution. It would make raising children easier, getting an education cheaper, taking life-saving medicine more affordable. It would also boost both the economy and Biden\u2019s anemic approval ratings, the only two things that can stave off an electoral disaster in 2022 and perhaps worse in 2024. Pass the damn bills.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In January 1980, Mary McCarthy appeared on Dick Cavett\u2019s talk show to promote her latest novel. When the conversation drifted to \u201coverpraised\u201d writers, McCarthy trained her fire on playwright Lillian Hellman, whom she had disliked for at least three decades. \u201cEvery word she writes is a lie, including \u2018and\u2019 and \u2018the,\u2019\u201d McCarthy said, repeating a claim she had made in an earlier interview. This time Hellman fired back, suing McCarthy for $2.25 million, but died before the case could come to trial. McCarthy\u2019s quip might have been the most devastating line ever said questioning a celebrity\u2019s honesty \u2013 at least until the Washington Post cataloged the falsehoods told by former President Donald Trump: \u201cBy the end of his term, Trump had accumulated 30,573 untruths during his presidency \u2014 averaging about 21 erroneous claims a day.\u201d (New York City\u2019s former deputy mayor, Alair Townsend, once said, after tangling with Trump, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe Donald Trump if his tongue were notarized.\u201d) But even tens of thousands of lies are a drop in the bucket on social media, where misinformation is weaponized to drive engagement and achieve political ends. In a new series on \u201cthe poisoned public square,\u201d CNN Opinion is putting a spotlight on the menace of deliberate falsehoods. As Nicole Hemmer wrote, the latest flood of misinformation stems from the rise of the Delta variant: \u201cThe near-total breakdown of hope for a return to normal has also highlighted and fueled a wave of misinformation about the pandemic and the vaccines designed to end it. From groundless conspiracy theories that the vaccines contain microchips or alter people\u2019s DNA to deliberate falsehoods about vaccine deaths and mask side effects, the pandemic misinformation industry is thriving in the US, more than a year and a half after the pandemic began.\u201d The business of lying about medicine, Hemmer noted, goes back to the medicine shows of the 19th Century: \u201cKickapoo Indian Sagwa could do it all: heal the blood, the liver, the stomach and even the kidneys. Purportedly based on a proprietary blend of ingredients developed by Indigenous healers \u2013 and patented by White salesmen \u2013 sagwa was sold in the late 19th Century as a panacea: you drank it to cure whatever ailed you.\u201d In 1905, an investigation by a writer for Collier\u2019s magazine revealed the truth about patent medicines \u2013 they were full of \u201calcohol, an appalling amount of opiates and narcotics\u2026 and in excess of all other ingredients, undiluted fraud.\u201d Lies about the 2020 election are flourishing, even though every single piece of legitimate evidence affirms Joe Biden\u2019s victory over Trump. The former president is so exercised about Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s refusal to try to overturn Biden\u2019s narrow victory in his state that he suggested Democrat Stacey Abrams would make a better governor. Trump\u2019s startling words had Dean Obeidallah marveling that he for once agreed with him. \u201cHas hell frozen over? Are pigs now airborne?\u201d wrote Obeidallah. \u201cTrump is 100% correct about Abrams. But his comments \u2026 weren\u2019t about the truth that the political powerhouse, who\u2019s the former minority leader for the Georgia House of Representatives, would be excellent in Kemp\u2019s position. It was all about his anger at Kemp \u2013 which reveals so much about how dangerous the GOP is to our democracy under Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201d Geoff Duncan, the Republican lieutenant governor of Georgia, pointed out that \u201cTrump did not lose because of voter fraud or his conservative policies. Biden is sitting in the White House today because voters grew tired of Trump\u2019s erratic behavior, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d For Republicans, \u201cthe upcoming elections cannot be a discussion about the past, unless we want to continue losing.\u201d In a book publishing this week, former Trump spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham says, \u201cCasual dishonesty filtered through the White House as if it were in the air conditioning system.\u201d In other words, wrote Frida Ghitis, it was a \u201cculture of lies and deceit.\u201d The shelf full of Trump tell-all books carries \u201cenormous weight today as we see Trump and his acolytes laying the groundwork to try to capture the presidency in 2024, apparently at any cost. Viewed in this context, they are dark portents.\u201d Sen. Mitch McConnell is trying to win back GOP control of the Senate in next year\u2019s midterm elections. Former Vice President Mike Pence is traveling the country, possibly in preparation for a 2024 presidential run. Yet, as Michael D\u2019Antonio noted, it \u201cseems like no one has told them that Donald Trump owns the GOP\u2026 a recent CNN poll found that a majority of Republicans say that supporting Trump and his Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him are important aspects of being a member of the party.\u201d At 12:01 am Friday, the US government did not shut down. That was one crisis averted, but another looms later this month when the government could run out of its authority to borrow money. If the debt limit isn\u2019t raised, catastrophe lurks. Economist Dean Baker wrote that the US wouldn\u2019t be able to \u201ccover its normal expenses, including Social Security payments, salaries for government workers and interest payments on the debt,\u201d with incalculable harm to America\u2019s global standing. \u201cThis is a game of chicken,\u201d Baker argued. \u201cMitch McConnell wants the Biden administration to pay a big price to get him on board on increasing the debt ceiling.\u201d The standoff is \u201cridiculous\u201d and so is one potential solution Biden could adopt: \u201cDue to a technicality in the law, the Treasury Department can print a platinum coin and assign a huge value to it \u2013 say, $1 trillion \u2013 and sell it to the Federal Reserve Board. This would get around the need to borrow.\u201d As Jamelle Bouie wrote in the New York Times, \u201cthere are 51 votes\u201d in the 100-member Senate to raise the debt limit, secure voting rights and reform policing in America. \u201cOf course, the Senate does not run on 51 votes. Instead, members must assemble a supermajority to do anything other than appoint judges, confirm nominees and pass certain spending bills. Pretty much everything else must go through a protracted and convoluted process that makes a mockery of the Senate\u2019s reputation for debate and deliberation.\u201d In the long run, the most significant battle in Washington this week might have been within one party, rather than between Democrats and Republicans. Speaker Nancy Pelosi contended with strains among Democrats over Biden\u2019s twin priorities \u2013 a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and a $3.5 trillion social spending package. Progressives are holding the bipartisan bill hostage in return for a commitment from all Democratic senators to pass the bigger bill. Three prominent progressives, Pramila Jayapal, Katie Porter and Ilhan Omar, argued that \u201cthe infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better Act are two parts of a whole, so they must be passed together.\u201d They wrote, \u201cThe Build Back Better Act provides childcare to women who have been pushed out of the workforce. It funds free community college and affordable housing. It finally expands Medicare to cover dental, vision and hearing benefits for our seniors. And it takes meaningful action on climate change \u2013 funding millions of green jobs to build our energy future.\u201d  West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema have been the two Democrats holding out against the $3.5 trillion plan, which would raise taxes on corporations and high-income earners. Three Rockefeller heirs who are the children of former West Virginia Gov. and US Sen. Jay Rockefeller wrote that Manchin is hurting his own state\u2019s interests. But \u201cby supporting the reconciliation bill, he can help unlock economic opportunities, more resilient infrastructure and a more sustainable future for our state and our country.\u201d In the Washington Post, Henry Olsen praised Manchin for seeing that \u201cthe nation\u2019s fiscal situation is too dire to unnecessarily add to the country\u2019s debt burden.\u201d Olsen argued that Manchin also correctly disapproves of the sweeping social impact the legislation would have. \u201cReengineering the fabric of American life is modern progressivism\u2019s whole point. Its adherents believe that the nation is in crisis \u2014 a climate crisis, a systemic racism crisis, an economic inequality crisis.\u201d But can they convince the nation of that? Democrats, Olsen wrote,  \u201cexpected a landslide\u201d in the 2020 elections, but emerged with a thinner majority in the House and the slimmest possible one in the Senate. \u201cA 50-50 election never augurs radical change.\u201d The heat is on Sinema, with her state\u2019s Democratic party threatening a no-confidence vote if she opposes Biden\u2019s spending bill. SE Cupp said that\u2019s a mistake: \u201cWhen a party villainizes its moderates, questions a lawmaker\u2019s loyalty for not voting in lockstep, threatens their future, trust me \u2013 bad things happen.\u201d A lot is riding on the decisions of Manchin and Sinema, Lincoln Mitchell pointed out. \u201cFailure to pass this legislation will damage an already vulnerable President Biden and deprive the Democratic Party of a major accomplishment it can present to the voters in both the 2022 and 2024 elections. In other words, any Democrat who does not support this deal, protestations about fiscal responsibility or pressing the pause button notwithstanding, is playing directly into GOP hands.\u201d For more: Julian Zelizer: Democrats are fighting for their political lives For once, the Covid-19 news was mostly positive this week \u2013 infections and hospitalizations are trending lower in the US, vaccine mandates are working and there was hopeful news Friday about an experimental pill that pharma giant Merck says could cut the risk of hospitalization or death in half. \u201cIf the results hold up to scientific scrutiny, this is very big news indeed,\u201d wrote Dr. Kent Sepkowitz. \u201cEffective pills given to outpatients could make a large difference for several distinct groups: for people with mild illness, it could prevent progression to more severe, even life-threatening illness, as the study apparently shows; provide an alternative approach to prevent severe disease in vaccine-refuseniks and vaccine-non-responders (those with severely weakened immune systems); and potentially protect those with recent close exposure to an active case (studies already are underway to examine this last possible use). Still, there are issues that could limit the use of the pill: \u201ccost, side effects, drug resistance, use in pregnancy and, most of all, practicality.\u201d The lingering social costs of the pandemic can\u2019t be ignored, wrote Jill Filipovic. \u201cA new survey of 65,000 US workers from McKinsey and LeanIn.org found that a whopping one-third of women said they were considering quitting their jobs or reducing their hours. Female workers were more likely to say that they were burned out. And more of them were discouraged now than they were in the early, shocking months of the pandemic,\u201d Filipovic noted. \u201cThe survey reveals that the US has utterly failed its female workers. And that too many men have also failed women \u2013 as bosses, colleagues, partners and co-parents.\u201d For more: Ashish Prashar: This group has a lot to lose when the Covid emergency ends CNN senior political analyst Kirsten Powers joined the ranks of our regular columnists this week with a look at a \u201cremarkable and soul-baring new book.\u201d \u201cAt the age of 35, Kate Bowler was diagnosed with stage IV cancer. Doctors predicted that at best she had two years to live \u2013 essentially handing the Duke Divinity School professor a death sentence,\u201d Powers wrote. \u201cSince then, she\u2019s been on the receiving end of a maddening collection of cringey cliches presumably meant to encourage her, but which have only made her already terrifying situation more difficult.\u201d Six years later, Bowler\u2019s new book \u2013 \u201cNo Cure for Being Human\u201d \u2013 raises questions about how we view other people. \u201cBowler, a historian of self-help, is fed up with \u2018toxic positivity,\u2019 which she defines as \u2018an overemphasis on the idea that our mindsets determine our reality.\u2019\u201d As Powers noted, \u201cIt\u2019s nearly impossible to live in America and avoid the trite admonishments to \u2018think positive!\u2019 when you lose your job or that \u2018everything happens for a reason\u2019 when you go bankrupt from medical bills, even though you have health insurance.\u201d Congressional testimony by military leaders cast a harsh light on the ending of America\u2019s longest war. Peter Bergen wrote, \u201cTop American generals warned President Joe Biden that the Afghan military would collapse. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said in essence on Tuesday that both former President Donald Trump and Biden had botched negotiations with the Taliban \u2013 and the net result of the US actions was a \u2018logistical success but a strategic failure.\u2019\u201d \u201cEven the most senior US generals couldn\u2019t defend the debacle that has unfolded in Afghanistan during the past several weeks, a disaster owned by President Biden, even if it was teed up by President Trump\u2019s ill-fated \u2018peace\u2019 negotiations with the Taliban that culminated in the Doha agreement.\u201d When R. Kelly was convicted Monday of racketeering and sex trafficking, Treva B. Lindsey thought of the degrading 20-year-old sex tape \u201cthat in my view, featured the rape of a teenage girl.\u201d Kelly denied allegations related to the tape, but Lindsey wrote that, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but think back to how the world reacted in 2001 when the tape surfaced and in 2002 when it was copied and sold. The way the Black girl on the tape was erased from her own story never left me. In fact, it was a defining moment in my journey to understand the multitude of ways Black girls are devalued.\u201d \u201cIt incenses me that it took nearly three decades\u2019 worth of allegations for the criminal legal system to offer some semblance of accountability for the harm this man caused,\u201d wrote Lindsey, who expressed hope that this \u201ccan be a galvanizing moment for those who want to join the fight to end sexual violence against Black women and girls.\u201d Erwin Chemerinsky: Justice Sotomayor tells the truth about the Supreme Court Nicole Hemmer: Britney Spears\u2019 bid for freedom comes at a crucial moment David Love: What Congress\u2019 total failure on police reform means for communities Isha Sesay, Masai Ujiri, Gbenga Akinnagbe and Liz Agbor-Tabi: Where is the outrage for Ethiopia?

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Charlie Dent, a CNN political commentator, is a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who served as chair of the House Ethics Committee from 2015 until 2017 and of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies from 2015 until 2018. He\u2019s a member of the board of directors of CARE USA, a nongovernmental organization that works to fight poverty and aid vulnerable populations around the world. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Back in July I pointed out that the Democrats\u2019 massive $3.5 trillion reconciliation spending plan put their fragile congressional majorities at risk. Since then, and to make matters worse, House Democratic leaders tied passage of this partisan reconciliation spending to the painstakingly negotiated bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by the Senate last month, which now awaits consideration by the House. In other words, the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which is desperately needed and has broad bipartisan support, is being held hostage until the votes are secured to pass the partisan $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. Democrats in the House Problem Solvers Caucus, made up of 29 members from the GOP and 29 from the Democratic Party, have forced their leadership to commit to bringing the infrastructure bill to the House floor by September 27. This explains the Democratic leadership\u2019s panicked sprint to pass the reconciliation bill, come hell or high water, by that date in the House in order to appease their fiery progressive wing who demand a package deal. Further complicating matters, West Virginia moderate Sen. Joe Manchin prudently called for a \u201cstrategic pause\u201d on the reconciliation bill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rebuffed Manchin\u2019s demand and made clear she\u2019s unwilling to pare back the massive $3.5 trillion plan. So much of this new spending will occur on a recurring basis \u2013 universal Pre-K, free community college, expanded Medicare services \u2013 unlike most Covid-19 relief spending that is non-recurring. Remember that the proposed reconciliation spending is in addition to the nearly $6 trillion previously spent for Covid-19 relief, most of which was essential to assist working families and businesses devastated by the pandemic through no fault of their own. House Democrats last Monday revealed legislation to raise taxes by more than $2 trillion that would pay for some, but not all, of their new spending under reconciliation. While taxing the rich may have a populist appeal in the abstract, it remains to be seen how popular taxing small businesses will be on Main Street. I\u2019m betting Main Street won\u2019t like what\u2019s in this tax stew. Pretending that raising taxes on American corporations and small businesses will not harm workers and the broader economy is wishful thinking. House Democrats are proposing to raise the corporate tax rate from the current 21% to 26.5% for companies with a taxable income of more than $5 million, which is still lower than the 35% that was in effect before the 2017 GOP tax cuts that I voted for. If this corporate tax rate increase were the only change on the table, Democrats might be able to sell it \u2013 but it\u2019s not. This legislation has several provisions, like limits on deductions and a surtax on small businesses making over $5 million, that could be the making of a tax revolt against the Democrats. For President Joe Biden to suggest that none of this will harm people making under $400,000 a year is pure fantasy. The president has pledged that individuals earning less than $400,000 won\u2019t face any higher taxes. Biden is not living up to his promises Down here on planet earth, it is known that costs imposed on businesses are passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices and to workers in lost or lower wages. Not to nitpick but, while most non-smokers feel no pain by popular tax increases on cigarettes and other tobacco products as the House Democrats have proposed, many smokers will notice as a number of them earn considerably less than $400,000 a year. The longer this massive tax and spending proposal sits out in the open the more it will smell like a rotten mackerel in the moonlight. Let\u2019s be clear about one thing: Neither the $3.5 trillion in spending nor the over $2 trillion in higher taxes are likely to become law. These inflated numbers will come down as centrist and pragmatic Congressional Democrats get hammered by business owners at home about profligate spending and a gargantuan tax increase. While it\u2019s fashionable for progressives to attack Manchin for wanting to tap the brakes, he is sure to be joined by many more members gobsmacked by sticker shock. They, too, will be urging restraint. It is always worth reminding Congressional Democrats they need the West Virginia Democrat far more than he needs them. Nervous House Democrats now face the prospect of going on record voting on the bloated reconciliation package at $3.5 trillion in spending combined with a more than $2 trillion tax hike with the knowledge that the bill will never pass the Senate. House Republicans know their pain as the draconian Obamacare repeal and replace bill in 2017 never had a chance of passing the Republican Senate back then. Perhaps a more apt comparison is the controversial 1993 BTU tax that aimed to tax fossil fuel companies\u2019 sources of heat and that House Democrats were forced to vote for, while knowing full well the Democratic controlled Senate wouldn\u2019t pass it. Many House Democrats were later BTU\u2019d in the 1994 midterm election wipeout, just as Republicans were in 2018. History has an uncanny way of repeating itself when congressional hubris strikes at the most inopportune times. Will House Democratic leaders force their centrist members in 2021 to walk a BTU-like plank in order to satisfy the progressives? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.  What is so remarkable about all of this is that Biden and centrist Democrats did not campaign in 2020 on turning America into a cradle-to-grave entitlement state, similar to Scandinavian countries. Yes, Sen. Bernie Sanders told us this was his agenda \u2013 but he lost. In 2022, swing voters might express their displeasure at the polls against those members who seem to have forgotten this important detail.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday rejected Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, two Republican members who Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had recommended for the select committee on the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. She argued that those members, who not only voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election but also spread conspiracies about the vote-counting process, threatened \u201cthe integrity of the investigation.\u201d McCarthy responded by pulling all of his people from the committee. When the committee holds a hearing next week (a spokesman told CNN it will not be delayed), it will contain no allies of former President Donald Trump. Pelosi was right to reject Jordan and Banks, who, as blood was still drying on the floor of the Capitol, voted to give the insurrectionists what so many of them wanted. At a deeper level, Pelosi\u2019s actions here also constitute a crucial development: the rejection of bipartisanship as a positive force in US politics. The select committee will still be bipartisan \u2013 GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump for fomenting the insurrection, will still serve on it \u2013 but the notion that Democratic leaders must work with Republican leaders in order to have political legitimacy is well and truly dead. As it should be. The fetish for bipartisanship has dominated Washington for at least 80 years. In that time, bipartisanship acquired a rosy glow: to label a policy bipartisan was to deem it both representative and virtuous, the byproduct of opposing sides compromising their way to the best possible solution. But on its own, bipartisanship has never been a virtue. It has been, at best, virtue-signaling \u2013 a legislative both-sidesism that has infected US politics for far too long. Rep. McCarthy blasts Pelosi: She has 'broken this institution' For much of US history, bipartisanship was not lionized. It was only in the mid-20th century that bipartisan compromise began to confer a golden sheen on legislation. That\u2019s in part because it was more attainable, and because at times, the results were profoundly beneficial. The two major parties had become a mishmash of ideologies: there were liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, and on the major issues of the day, bipartisanship made life-changing legislation possible. The Social Security Act, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, Medicare, Medicaid \u2014 all bipartisan. In the 1940s and 1950s, with the threat of totalitarianism looming large in the American imagination, there was something particularly beneficial to politicians about championing bipartisanship. It showed voters (along with foreign leaders and allies abroad) that American lawmakers followed a standard higher than simple party interests. Compromise elevated them to the ranks of technocratic statesmen (they were nearly all men) who were unencumbered by devotion to party, who were instead dedicated to higher ideals and first principles. That turned out to be an attractive talking point for politicians well into the 21st century. But it papered over all the things bipartisanship had sanctified. Bipartisanship had accompanied US entry into WWII, but also Vietnam, Iraq (twice), and Afghanistan. It had ratified civil rights but also rampant discrimination. \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was bipartisan, as was the Defense of Marriage Act. In theory, bipartisanship can help ensure that crucial landmark legislation has a future, even if and when the opposing party takes Congress or the White House. But on its own, bipartisanship was not good or bad; it had no moral valence at all. See what Liz Cheney had to say about McCarthy But that didn\u2019t stop bipartisanship from being touted by politicians as a virtue. And as parties became more ideologically sorted, bipartisanship became both rarer and more sought after, a sign that a policy had more inherent value beyond accomplishing its stated goals. In an era of growing partisanship in the 1990s, both President Bill Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich sought bipartisan legislation, even as they battled over government shutdowns and impeachment. The idea that all those ills could be healed with a bipartisan vote on welfare reform or social security privatization was appealing to both men. By the time President Barack Obama entered office, bipartisanship had become both a prize and a weapon: the Obama administration dragged its feet on landmark legislation, waiting \u2014 fruitlessly \u2014 for a handful of Republican votes so they could claim the legitimacy of bipartisanship. Republicans, well aware how much Obama wanted that, made it their mission to deny it. As Congressman Tom Cole, a member of Republican House leadership, put it, \u201cWe wanted the talking point: \u2018The only thing bipartisan was the opposition.\u2019\u201d If Republicans had discovered the power of withholding bipartisanship during the Obama era, Democrats slowly began to understand the limits of working with Republicans in the Trump era, a time when both the President and the party\u2019s leadership in Congress proved unreliable dealmakers and craven partisans. But it was the insurrection that made it most clear: even though a handful of Republicans did cross the aisle to ratify the election, denounce the insurrection and impeach Trump a second time, the vast majority did not. How, then, could bipartisanship be a marker of good governance, if most of one party had just voted to overturn democracy?  The continued efforts by the GOP to prevent investigations into the insurrection only confirm that bipartisanship is a useless metric. Senate Republicans blocked an independent commission, and McCarthy has now made clear that the price of Republicans playing ball on the select committee was accepting some of the insurrectionists\u2019 biggest supporters as members. Pelosi, who has grokked the new rules of politics far better than most Democrats, did the right thing by saying no. The point here is not that politics has changed so dramatically that bipartisanship no longer matters. It\u2019s that bipartisanship was never a metric for good politics, and by rejecting the Republican leaders\u2019 conditions, Pelosi has acknowledged that, and opened the door for a franker assessment of political goods and political harms \u2013 while safeguarding the select committee from those who, with their votes against the election, supported the insurrection.",

Gehl is a former CEO and the originator of \u201cPolitics Industry Theory,\u201d which applies the lens of industry competition to the American political system. She is the designer of \u201cFinal-Five Voting,\u201d an electoral reform that combines open, top-five primaries with instant-runoff voting in general elections, and the co-author of \u201cThe Politics Industry: How Political Innovation Can Break Partisan Gridlock and Save Our Democracy.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. Congress just passed another enormously consequential piece of legislation \u2013 the American Rescue Plan Act \u2013 and, yet again, they did so along party lines. This time it was done by the Democrats, with a Covid-19 recovery package constructed with limited input from the opposition and fast-tracked thanks to an arcane procedural process. In 2017, it was the Republicans who did the same thing with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In today\u2019s political reality, the alternatives to hyper-partisan lawmaking are not negotiation or compromise, but rather gridlock and inaction. It wasn\u2019t always like this. Monumental reforms like the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and The Medicare and Medicaid Act in 1965 were passed with significant support from members of both parties. But strong, sustainable bipartisan legislation is mostly a thing of the past. The problem is not that there are too many conservatives or too many progressives or too few moderates in Congress. The problem is the incentives that drive members of Congress, and those incentives often boil down to one imperative: winning their party\u2019s next primary election. Since so many seats in Congress are \u201csafe\u201d for one party or the other \u2013 approximately 86% of House districts are solidly Democratic or Republican \u2013  the primary has, in most cases, become the determinative election (and the subsequent general election has become little more than a rubber stamp). And because these primaries have devolved into low-turnout affairs dominated by highly ideological voters, they become tests of fealty to these small bands of gatekeepers, not the broader electorate. This may be the most powerful structural determinant of legislator behavior \u2013 and not in a good way. Once just a noun, \u201cprimary\u201d has become the most powerful verb in American politics. The threat of getting \u201cprimaried\u201d is wielded early and often by party leaders to keep their conferences in line. Republicans who have challenged the GOP\u2019s new orthodoxy are racking up primary threats as fast as you can refresh Twitter. Across the aisle, the progressive left attacks fellow Democrats who seek compromise. Biden's tricky tango with Congress And the truth is it doesn\u2019t even take threats, much less verified primary challengers, to effectively pressure congressional Republicans and Democrats further to the right and left \u2013 so far apart that they can\u2019t risk working together. The pressure of the primary is baked into the calculus of almost every decision they make. Imagine you\u2019re a member of Congress. In front of you sits a bipartisan bill on an important national issue. You inspect the fundamentals and weigh them against the objective needs of your constituents and the country at large, right? Wrong. Instead, you likely ask yourself: Could I lose my next party primary if I vote for this cross-party effort? The answer, for Democrats and Republicans alike, is often yes. Party primaries create a proverbial \u201ceye of the needle\u201d through which few problem-solving politicians can pass. This dilemma has resulted in some states experimenting with alternatives to party primaries. For example, in 2010, after a successful ballot measure, California abandoned party primaries for all congressional races, and for all other elections except for president, county central committees and local offices. This reform substituted open, nonpartisan primaries in which the top two candidates advance to the general election. While California offers evidence that reform is possible, its model has fallen short of many of its goals. Allowing for only two candidates in the general election still limits voter choice and creates little opportunity for new challengers, especially if they come from outside the established parties. This system can also lead to enough vote splitting on either side that, for example, two Republicans can end up competing for a primarily Democratic Congressional district, as happened in California\u2019s 31st district election in 2012, or vice versa. Why 'negative partisanship' explains so many of America's political problems The better, cross-partisan solution is what I call \u201cFinal-Five Voting\u201d (FFV), which involves two targeted innovations in our elections for Congress. First, we get rid of those party primaries in which you vote only in the Democratic primary or the Republican primary. Instead, when you vote in the primary, there\u2019s only one ballot, which includes all the candidates running \u2013 regardless of party status. When the votes are counted, the top five finishers advance to the general election \u2013 again, regardless of party. This change eliminates the eye-of-the-needle party primary problem and allows legislators more leeway to legislate in the public interest. Second, we replace plurality voting (i.e., whoever gets the most votes, wins) with instant runoff voting in the general election. Having the healthy competition of five candidates is ideal, but we wouldn\u2019t want to inadvertently elect one of the five candidates with only 21% of the vote if, for example, the vote split almost equally five ways. Instant runoff voting eliminates that possibility by allowing voters to rank their candidates in order of preference. In each round of vote tallying, the last-place candidate is eliminated and their first-choice votes are transferred to their voters\u2019 second-choice candidates, and so on until one candidate secures more than 50% of the vote. The most important benefit of instant runoff voting is that it opens the possibility of new competition. By eliminating the possibility that a vote for certain candidates could be wasted or could spoil the race, it opens the system to new, dynamic competitors. Polarization is poisoning America. Here's an antidote The purpose of FFV is not necessarily to change who wins, but to change what the winners are incentivized to do. The message to Congress is do your job or lose your job. Innovate, reach across the aisle whenever it\u2019s helpful and come up with real solutions to our problems. Represent a broader swath of your district \u2013 not just the thin layer of polarized party-primary voters \u2013 or you can expect healthy competition in your next general election. And given that nearly 30% of registered voters in states that require registration are now independents, the candidate who can successfully run on practical accomplishments rather than just their party label will be at an advantage in many states and districts. And the best part? FFV is as achievable as it is powerful \u2013 and we\u2019re starting to see proof. In 2017, I published a Harvard Business School report with Professor Michael Porter that addressed the unhealthy competition in politics created by party primaries and plurality voting, and first proposed this combination of open primaries and instant runoff general elections. The report made its way to Alaska and to Republican political operative Scott Kendall, who had worked for both Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski and independent former Gov. Bill Walker. Inspired, Kendall wrote a bold ballot initiative around Final-Four Voting, a close sibling to Final-Five. It passed. No more party primaries in Alaska. The effect is already evident. As one of only two US senators in the country with virtual immunity against getting primaried, Murkowski has been empowered to chart an independent course, speak out early and forcefully against the Capitol building insurrection and vote to convict former President Donald Trump in his Senate impeachment trial. One does not have to agree with Murkowski\u2019s politics to see the benefits of eliminating the party primary \u2013 among them freedom from the tyranny of the extreme wings of both parties.  Murkowski doesn\u2019t need to be alone for long. If just four more states rid themselves of party primaries and plurality voting \u2013 through legislation or ballot measures \u2013 and send delegations to Washington, DC, who are elected through FFV, we\u2019d immediately have 10 senators and dozens of representatives who could serve as a new, vital fulcrum bucking the binary, zero-sum stranglehold on governing. To paraphrase James Carville\u2019s admonition to former President Bill Clinton campaign\u2019s in 1992, \u201cIt\u2019s the primary, stupid!\u201d Once we fix this systemic problem, Congress will be incentivized to address our common challenges \u2013 together. While there may be no guarantee Congress solves our problems, FFV ends the guarantee they won\u2019t.",
