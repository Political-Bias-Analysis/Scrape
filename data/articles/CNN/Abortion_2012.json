            "article_content": "Court resumes work three months after politically charged healthcare ruling Affirmative action, voting rights, same-sex marriage on judicial horizon Issues will test John Roberts leadership of shaky 5-4 conservative majority A day after the Supreme Court upheld the health care law, Chief Justice John Roberts joked that he would spend some time at \u201can impregnable island fortress\u201d to escape the torrent of vitriol and praise heaped on the bench. The nation is now focused on the presidential election, but attention will likely shift back to the court after the November vote. A new term opens on Monday and the nine justices will address another potentially historic docket. Affirmative action, same-sex marriage, voting rights, and abortion could be taken up. \u201cThe justices are moving from the frying pan right into the fire, having moved up with the big healthcare case,\u201d said Thomas Goldstein, a leading Washington lawyer and publisher of SCOTUSblog.com. \u201cThey are tackling some of the most difficult legal questions of today. Across the board, probably the biggest term in at least a decade.\u201d Interactive: Big cases await Supreme Court\u2019s new term A range of explosive issues will test Roberts\u2019 leadership of a shaky 5-4 conservative majority: \u2013Affirmative action and whether universities may continue to use race as one factor in student admissions to maintain a diverse campus. \u2013Same-sex marriage and the constitutional \u201cequal protection\u201d rights of gay and lesbian couples to wed. \u2013Voting rights challenges to rigorous federal oversight of state and local elections, and to voter identification laws. \u2013\u201cPersonhood\u201d laws that say life begins at conception, a push by some states and anti-abortion opponents to perhaps revisit the Roe v. Wade ruling. These issues and several other important criminal, business, and international cases could change the social political landscape in coming years. Supreme Court possibilities if Romney wins election \u201cA lot of progressives are concerned that this might mean that Chief Justice Roberts has built up some capital, some good will, and will now push the conservative agenda just as, if not more, strongly in other important cases that limit the national government\u2019s ability to solve national problems, or go into areas of social policy like marriage, like abortion, and push a conservative agenda,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel with the Constitutional Accountability Center. But some conservative legal scholars play down the idea of an activist, agenda-driven court. \u201cI think that\u2019s absurd. I mean, if, certainly this is not a crusading conservative court, it\u2019s really a court in equipoise,\u201d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network. \u201cJustice [Anthony] Kennedy has certain issues which he tends to vote conservative on and certain issues he tends to vote more liberal on, and that\u2019s where we stand until we have a shift I think in the membership of the court, it\u2019s impossible to call it a court that leans more to the left or to the right,\u201d Severino said. Opinion: Why are candidates silent on Supreme Court? A political magnet Roberts\u2019 lead role in the health care ruling has made him a hero and a traitor, a sign the Supreme Court remains powerful but subject to political arrows. Kennedy may be the court\u2019s noted \u201cswing vote,\u201d but it is Roberts and his leadership skills that will be viewed with greater scrutiny this term. His narrow opinion upholding the core of the Affordable Care Act gave President Barack Obama a huge election-year boost, but raised questions from both the left and the right about his motives. Roberts viewed the law\u2019s central part \u2013 the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d requiring most Americans to purchase some form of health insurance or pay a penalty \u2013 as a tax, and therefore within congressional authority. It was a constitutional interpretation that none of his colleagues embraced. But the four mostly liberal justices were happy to endorse the end result \u2013 the mandate was upheld. Court sources privately, but strongly dismiss suggestions it was a case of political expediency, an effort by Roberts to insulate the court from charges of partisanship and activism in a landmark case decided in a presidential election year. Those sources say the Roberts\u2019 opinion was just that, what he really believed was the right legal answer to an admittedly complex, divisive issue. Election raises stakes for possible Supreme Court vacancies But moving ahead, some legal analysts suggest the health care decision could pay unexpected dividends to the reputation and prestige of the court. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that it\u2019s going to be much harder to paint him as an ideologue, after he cast the vote to save the president\u2019s signature achievement,\u201d said Goldstein. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that activists on one side or the other will criticize justices they disagree with. But in terms of the center of the country, he certainly has the reputation of being bipartisan and absolutely fair.\u201d Sixty-seven percent of Americans surveyed in a recent Gallup poll say they trust the judiciary, far more than the legislative or executive branches of government. A CNN/ORC poll conducted just after the June 28 health care ruling found the public evenly divided, 50-49, over whether they agreed with the decision. And by a 53-46 margin, a majority of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing. Hard feelings over healthcare But hard feelings linger on the right over Roberts\u2019 role in the health care ruling. \u201cIt was a decision that appears to have been taken for ultimately political reasons,\u201d said Severino. \u201cSo unfortunately, that emphasizes the risks of a politicized court. But it does remind us all that these justices are all individual human beings and none of them is necessarily going to fit the mold you predict.\u201d Nonetheless, most court watchers expect Roberts to continue being a reliable conservative, along with Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and in most cases, Kennedy. \u201cThe chief is just as conservative this term as he was when President (George W.) Bush nominated him and as he was at the beginning of last term,\u201d said Wydra. \u201cAnd I think that his conservative leanings will probably come to bear when the court considers these issues about affirmative action, and perhaps same-sex marriage.\u201d Supreme Court possibilities if Obama is reelected",

            "article_content": "FBI says domestic terrorism is Americans attacking Americans based on extremist ideologies Report: Counterterrorism efforts shaped largely in response to foreign terrorism Resources devoted to domestic counterterrorism have been cut 2008 election riled up some right-wing groups,  ex-DHS counterterrorism expert said Americans watched this week as U.S. interests abroad became targets of Muslims enraged over a film mocking their religion. It was a storyline featuring familiar characters in the so-called war on terror, but some experts say the narrative may be overplayed. Though radical Islam and Western interests are commonly the primary subjects of stateside conversation when it comes to terror, domestic terrorists pose significant threats to the homeland, experts say, and the U.S. needs to do more to safeguard itself from the threat within. A handful of recent events \u2013 including the deadly rampages at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and an Aurora, Colorado, theater \u2013 have left communities in grief and raised additional questions about whether we\u2019re paying enough attention to domestic terrorism following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Bergen: Who incites violent protests? \u201c9/11 has set the threshold for what terrorism is in the minds of many Americans, and if domestic terrorism lacks the magnitude, it must not be terrorism,\u201d said Daryl Johnson, a former counterterrorism expert at the Department of Homeland Security. Johnson says he left DHS in 2010 out of frustration. According to Johnson, many in the government have taken a myopic view based on the severity and magnitude of 9/11, leaving them unable to move beyond the threat posed by jihadist groups. Heidi Beirich, director of the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group, claims the domestic threat cannot be overlooked after the shootings at the Sikh temple. \u201cDomestic terrorism is as much a threat as foreign terrorism. The government needs to get serious about this,\u201d she said. While the feds have said that the Aurora incident was not a terrorist act and the FBI continues to investigate whether the shooting at the Sikh temple was an act of domestic terrorism, these incidents have drawn attention to domestic threats. The FBI\u2019s shorthand definition of domestic terrorism is \u201cAmericans attacking Americans based on U.S.-based extremist ideologies.\u201d Far right domestic terrorism on par with foreign threat, experts say According to a May 2012 congressional research service report, counterterrorism efforts have been shaped largely in response to acts of foreign terrorism. The emphasis of counterterrorism policy since 9/11 has been on jihadist terrorism, despite the fact that domestic terrorists have been responsible for more than two-dozen incidents since 9/11, the report states. The congressional report points to data collected by the National Counterterrorism Center\u2019s Worldwide Incidents Tracking System, which publicly lists 35 terrorist incidents occurring in the United States between the beginning of 2004 and September 2011. Of those, 25 were linked to domestic terrorists. Experts say the domestic threat can no longer be pushed to the background. A September 2011 survey by the New America Foundation and Syracuse University\u2019s Maxwell School of Public Policy examined 114 cases of non-jihadist terrorist acts in the 10 years following 9/11. In comparison, they found 188 cases of Islamist terrorism in the U.S. for the same period. Some of the cases examined involved plots that were foiled and unsuccessful. Examples of domestic terror cases since 9/11 include a 2001 plot by Earl Krugel, a member of the Jewish Defense League, to blow up the office of Arab-American congressman Darrell Issa and the King Fahd mosque in Culver City, California and the February 2010 suicide attack by Andrew Joseph Stack III, where he flew his airplane into the IRS building in Austin, Texas killing one other person and injuring many more. Domestic terror threat 'accelerating' 3 charged in NATO domestic terror plot According to the survey, the 114 cases of domestic terrorism do not represent a complete survey of non-Islamist terrorist cases. Keeping track of domestic terrorism incidents is far more difficult than tracking incidents of jihadist terrorism. Jihadist terror cases are nearly all tried under anti-terrorism laws or statutes dealing with \u201cmaterial support\u201d to terrorist groups. Domestic terrorism cases on the other hand are often tried under an array of other statutes, from weapons and explosives violations, property destruction and arson to \u201cseditious conspiracy,\u201d the survey stated. These ideologies behind the domestic attacks encompass a wide range of groups. On the left, you have anarchists and some Communist factions. On the right, there are white supremacists and sovereign citizens, participants of which do not recognize U.S. currency, taxation or city, state or federal laws. There are also more single-minded groups that include some animal rights, environmental and anti-abortion outfits. While left-wing groups have frequently vandalized property and committed arson, right-wing groups present a more deadly threat given their affinity for hoarding weapons and explosives, according to Johnson, who now runs a private security consulting firm. Understanding America\u2019s domestic extremist threat \u201cWhat worries me is the fact that our country is under attack from within, from our own radical citizenry,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYet our leaders don\u2019t appear too concerned about this. So, my greatest fear is that domestic extremists in this country will somehow become emboldened to the point of carrying out a mass-casualty attack because they perceive that no one is being vigilant about the threat from within.\u201d Despite the threat right-wing groups pose, intelligence-collection efforts have not received the same attention as foreign threats, according to the congressional report. The Southern Poverty Law Center has documented a dramatic growth in the number of militias and hate groups operating in the U.S. over the past decade. Currently, there are more than 1,000 hate groups in the United States, according to the center, which says it was monitoring the alleged Sikh temple gunman for years before the attack. \u201cThey are like little sitting time bombs,\u201d Johnson said. In the aftermath of the Wisconsin shooting, online forums among radical right-wing hate groups have ignited with vitriolic messages. \u201cTake your dead and go back to India and dump their ashes in the Ganges, Sikhs,\u201d Alex Linder, a neo-Nazi who operates the racist website Vanguard News Network, wrote on his forum. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here in the country my ancestors fought to found, and deeded to me and mine, their posterity. Even if you came here legally, and even if you haven\u2019t done anything wrong personally. Go home, Sikhs. Go home to India where you belong. This is not your country, it belongs to white men.\u201d According to Johnson, there are certain poisonous belief systems in this country that have a history of violence. \u201cThey have the capability and the intent. All they\u2019re lacking is the catalyst. And there lies the problem,\u201d he explained, adding he believes the government needs to look closer at whether a group is on a trajectory to violence. Any counterterrorism efforts should be proactive rather than reactive. But Johnson claims the current approach is a hands-off one unless the group is engaging in some criminal activity. \u201cThese groups proliferate like mushrooms after the spring rain,\u201d he said. \u201cCriminal activity will certainly follow.\u201d He explained that the election of President Barack Obama has been a huge factor in the proliferation of extremist groups at home. \u201cIt\u2019s their worst nightmare come true,\u201d he said. The election of the first black president sent shockwaves through many of these right-wing groups who feel threatened by the changing demographics of the nation. Johnson predicts that if Obama wins a second term, there will be more violent attacks by these domestic groups. Yet there remain massive gaps in domestic counterterrorism efforts, according to Johnson. Following a 2009 Department of Homeland Security report authored by Johnson on the growing threat posed by right-wing extremist groups, the domestic terrorism unit under the DHS was disbanded because of pressure from the political right-wing, claims Johnson. Bergen: Right-wing extremist terrorism as deadly a threat as al Qaeda? Conservative media political analysts like Michelle Malkin, Sean Hannity, Lou Dobbs and Rush Limbaugh criticized the report as an attempt to demonize the right. It also drew criticism from some members of the military because the report claimed right-wing extremist groups recruited veterans and soldiers. After the release of the report, a number of draft reports were put on hold or canceled entirely,according to Johnson. Products that concerned domestic terror were subject to greater scrutiny and stalled in an effort to kill the work, said Johnson. \u201cThese restrictions were selectively applied to work on domestic terrorism than to jihadi terrorism,\u201d he said, adding that his frustration led him to quit a year later. Resources devoted to domestic counterterrorism have been cut, and there is now only one intelligence analyst at the DHS looking at domestic terrorism. That\u2019s compared to five after 9/11, according to Johnson. There is also a void in training officials to recognize these threats, Johnson claims. While the DHS has implemented some training in the last year \u2013 nine sessions so far \u2013 they have not been sufficient, Johnson explained. In his time there, the DHS ran up to 10 sessions per month. Training sessions by other agencies remain limited in scope, Johnson explained. The FBI, for example, focuses mainly on the sovereign citizens groups, he said. In a 2008 meeting between the counterterrorism units of the FBI and DHS, it was apparent the FBI did not have the proper information to investigate, according to Johnson. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even appear aware of the resurgence of militias and extremist groups,\u201d Johnson said. \u2018Swimming upstream,\u2019 white supremacist groups still strong DHS spokesman Peter Boogaard said he could not comment on these assertions as they involve classified information. But in a written statement he said the DHS \u201cprotects our country from all threats, whether foreign or homegrown, and we know that violent extremism is neither constrained by international borders, nor limited to any single ideology. \u201cAs such, DHS continues to work with its state, local, tribal and territorial partners to prevent violence that is motivated by any extreme ideological beliefs. This includes training law enforcement to recognize behaviors and other indicators associated with violent criminal activity as well as briefings, products, case studies, and information sharing on violent extremist threats,\u201d the statement said. In an April 2005 report titled \u201c10 Years After the Oklahoma City Bombing: the Department of Homeland Security Must Do More to Fight Right-Wing Terrorists,\u201d Rep. Bennie Thompson, then-head of the House Committee on Homeland Security,  called for a renewed effort to catalog the risks posed by right-wing domestic terrorists. In the report, he slammed the DHS for omitting the threat of right-wing terror threats in a long-range planning document. \u201cDemocratic members of the House Committee on Homeland Security are very concerned that this oversight demonstrates DHS administrators are not adequately considering right-wing domestic terrorist groups that are focused on attacking America in order to further their political beliefs,\u201d he wrote. The government is also inconsistent in how it categorizes domestic extremist groups. While the federal government lists groups such as al Qaeda and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations, there is no such practice of designating any domestic groups as terrorist organizations. According to the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Counterterrorism, the secretary of state had designated 49 foreign terrorist organizations as of January 2012. The FBI and Department of Justice do not generate an official list of domestic terrorist organizations. The lack of such a list may make it difficult to assess the scope of domestic terrorism and evaluate trends and counterterrorism efforts. It also creates the misconception that terrorism comes only from abroad. However, advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union object to such categorizations, arguing that labeling some domestic groups as such would discourage free speech and expression. Michael German, an expert at the ACLU who has also worked as an FBI agent for 16 years, argued that any characterization of groups that are not engaged in criminal activity is problematic. The listing of foreign terrorists has already been problematic, and the replication of such a methodology would not be the correct approach. A sound approach should target individuals, not groups, he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the label,\u201d German said. Regardless of whether extremists groups are put on watch lists, the need for certain data is critical for effective counterterrorism efforts. The congressional research service report claims that until 2005, the FBI used to regularly release a report that cataloged annual terrorist plots and in Mafraq, Jordan,incidents in the United States. Arguably, the discontinuation of such reporting makes it difficult for policymakers to forge effective policies because it becomes more difficult to compare the levels of domestic terrorist activity against jihadist activity. Experts including Johnson and Beirich say it may be time to take a more informed approach and look more closely at current security gaps.",

By Maria Cardona, CNN Contributor (CNN) \u2013 President Obama is indeed a profile in courage. He has made history yet again with his announcement that he supports full marriage equality for gay and lesbian Americans. Bravo, Mr. President. Now comes all the warnings and predictions of what this will mean for the election in November. One of those dire warnings is that this will hurt him with his supporters among Latino communities. This will not be the case and here\u2019s why: For so long, Republicans have loved to push the meme, famously touted by Ronald Reagan, that Latinos are, by their nature, more conservative on religious and social issues and therefore will be open to the Republican point of view. While it is true that Latinos are more conservative on these issues \u2013 Republicans love to use gay marriage and abortion as the key examples \u2013 they historically do not base their vote on these issues. That is why no GOP presidential candidate in history has ever been able to attract a majority of Latino voters. Read Maria Cardona\u2019s full column",

            "article_content": "At least $4.2 billion spent in 2012 election Analysis shows in House, Senate races, those who spent most won Obama campaign rasied almost twice as much as Romney camp Between the presidential candidates and congressional races, at least $4.2 billion may have been spent on an election that ultimately ended up preserving the status quo in Washington. Voters elected the same president and the same political parties \u2013 the Republicans in the House and the Democrats in the Senate \u2013 will run Congress. Did all that record spending really matter? At the presidential level, maybe not so much. Partial totals of what was spent so far show that between the candidate, his party and well-heeled outside groups, the \u201cRed Team\u201d spent more money on the effort to elect Republican Mitt Romney than the \u201cBlue Team\u201d did to re-elect President Barack Obama, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that monitors the influence of money on politics. Combined, the candidate, the national party, and outside spending groups, like conservative issue-oriented nonprofits and super PACs, had spent more than $1 billion on Romney\u2019s effort. The liberal version of that combination of groups spent about $96 million less on the Obama re-election. That number will change once the final accounting is completed. There was a ton of last-minute spending on attack ads and get-out-the-vote efforts. However, the Obama campaign raised almost twice as much as the Romney camp. Business group blows $29 million on election losers \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if he left anything in the bank,\u201d said Bill Allison, editorial director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for greater government transparency. No matter who spent more, Allison worries that the amount of money involved in this election will dramatically change politics. \u201cI think the most worrisome thing is that this is the first billion dollar-plus presidential campaign, so what this means is this amount will become the benchmark,\u201d Allison said. \u201cIf you want to be a serious contender in the future, you will have to have those kind of resources and it gives an outsized role then to the outside groups who are able to raise unlimited funds.\u201d Difference seen in congressional races Allison believes money may have made the most difference in congressional races. It seemed to have played a particularly big role when interests outside of a candidate\u2019s state got involved. The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that outside groups spent some $1.3 billion and counting on the election. In 2008, they only spent $262.7 million. The difference this time was mainly due to a landmark court ruling two years ago that effectively permitted a sharp increase in outside spending, especially by corporations and unions. \u201cAt the presidential level, candidates are able to raise enough money to get their message out and drive their own narrative,\u201d Allison said. \u201cDown the ballot though, where you\u2019ve got outside groups dumping $500,000 into a race and the opposition doesn\u2019t have the cash on hand to compete, that could make a real difference.\u201d In a CNN analysis of spending in a dozen key Senate races, most of the candidates who won spent the most money. One Senate race that saw record amounts of outside money was in Wisconsin. Senator Herb Kohl, a Democrat who had held his seat since 1989, decided to retire this year. Both candidates who ran for his seat had strong name recognition in Wisconsin. American Crossroads defends campaign spending to donors Democrat Tammy Baldwin served seven terms in the U.S. House. She is well known nationally as the first publicly-out lesbian to be elected to federal office. Her Republican opponent, Tommy Thompson, was a popular Wisconsin governor before becoming Health Secretary in the administration of George W. Bush. After winning a bruising Republican primary, Thompson was seen as an early favorite \u2013 partly because Wisconsin has recently leaned much more \u2018red.\u2019 In August, Thompson had a nine-point lead in the polls, but Baldwin had fully turned the tables by the end of September. Thompson rallied and by Election Day, the race was too close to call. The primary had left Thompson cash poor while Baldwin was able to outpace him in fundraising. She spent virtually all of it \u2013 $11.6 million \u2013 as of the October reporting deadline. Thompson raised $7.36 million and spent $6.04 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Outside groups, super PACs spent more Outside groups spent even more on the race than did the campaigns. Super PACs and special interest groups spent some $18.9 million on efforts opposing Thompson and only $2.6 million in support of him. The groups spent $15.5 million against Baldwin, $1.2 million for her. The biggest outside group that tried to hurt Baldwin\u2019s chances created a slew of negative ads. In them, Republican operative Karl Rove\u2019s group, Crossroads GPS, called Baldwin a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the president, who was \u201ctoo extreme\u201d for the state. Crossroads GPS spent more than $6 million on this race, but lost. \u201cYou have to keep in mind though candidates don\u2019t win elections just because they spend more,\u201d Allison said. \u201cA win is also based on how effectively a candidate spends their money and on just how effective a campaigner the candidate is.\u201d Analysis: It\u2019s never too early to talk about 2016 In the Senate race in Indiana, for instance, Republican Richard Mourdock outspent Democratic opponent Joe Donnelley by about $7 million. But Mourdock lost. Mourdock ran a strong race, but took a hit in the polls when, at a debate, he made a controversial remark about rape and abortion. In Wisconsin, Thompson\u2019s campaign also hit a few bumps along the way. A low point may have been when Thompson\u2019s son told an audience, \u201cWe have the opportunity to send President Obama back to Chicago, or Kenya.\u201d He later apologized for the remarks. While the race remained tight throughout election night, Baldwin defeated Thompson 51% to 46%. Baldwin will become the first female Senator to represent Wisconsin and the nation\u2019s first openly gay person to win a Senate seat. \u201cI didn\u2019t run to make history,\u201d Baldwin said in her acceptance speech. \u201cI ran to make a difference.\u201d It looks like the money she spent on the race may have made a difference, too.",

            "article_content": "Women were seen as the key to the election this week President Barack Obama got 55% of the female vote on Tuesday The U.S. Senate will see a record 20 women take seats next term In many ways, the 2012 election was the year of the woman. Women \u2014 who have historically formed one of President Barack Obama\u2019s key constituencies \u2014 once again united behind him in large numbers and helped fend off defections from white male and independent supporters. A record 20 women will hold U.S. Senate seats next year\u2014including newly-elected Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, the first openly lesbian senator. The New Hampshire congressional delegation will be all female and, in Obama\u2019s home state of Hawaii, Democrat Mazie Hirono will represent the islands in the Senate. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it was as much a coincidence as a perfect storm,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cThe conditions were right and the Republican nominee gave women pause.\u201d Baldwin: Change will move us forward McCaskill victorious in Senate race Warren: You taught me how to win Obama speaks on love of wife, kids McDonnell: We got to do better According to CNN\u2019s exit polls, 55% of women and 45% of men voted for Obama and 44% of women and 52% of men voted for Romney. That level of female support for the president made an especially big impact in swing states like Ohio where the gender breakdown mirrored the national figures. Big gains for women in 2012 It is a gender advantage Obama clinched even as early as mid October when data showed that among white women, the president led 52%-46%. Back in 2008 when Obama carried Ohio, he received 47% of votes from white women in that state. Nationally, Obama received 56% of the female vote in 2008. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the things Republicans have to look at,\u201d Duffy said. \u201c\u2018Why are we the party of white men.\u2019\u201d Political experts also say Romney, who saw an early October surge of support among female voters, may have undone those gains during the second presidential debate when he said he used \u201cwhole binders full of women\u201d as a hiring tool as governor, whiffed on an equal pay question, and alluded to helping women get home to cook dinner. \u201cThat a presidential candidate in 2012 can utter such superficial answers to a serious question about women\u2019s economic equity and autonomy reveals a lack of serious thought about issues of substantive importance to women,\u201d Kathleen Dolan, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, and Jennifer L. Lawless, an associate professor of government and director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University, wrote recently for CNN. \u201cIt also demonstrates a lack of commitment to the change necessary to allow women and men to lead fully integrated professional and personal lives,\u201d they said. But Republican woes with women cannot be blamed solely on Romney. Opinion: Women gain wider access to power Verbal gaffes from down-ballot candidates such as Rep. Todd Akin, whose comments about a woman\u2019s body preventing pregnancy after \u201clegitimate rape\u201d may have cost him the election, also reinforced for some voters concerns that the GOP is out of touch with women. \u201cPart of the reason Democrats had a good day was some conservative Republicans said some stupid things and it made some issues more salient than they usually are,\u201d said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. \u201cWhen people are making comments about legitimate rape \u2026 it scares women who might not have thought about it. Even the conversation about contraception \u2026 this was a way to make women\u2019s health issues very, very personal,\u201d  Gillespie said. The first portion of this year\u2019s political season saw a heated partisan showdown over a federal mandate requiring religious institutions to offer contraception insurance coverage to employees. The ensuing back and forth sparked a \u201cwar on women\u201d fight between Democrats and Republicans that bled into congressional hearings, the campaigns and talk radio and re-ignited the gender wars. Democrats were able to use the rhetoric to suggest that Republicans would threaten the right to contraception\u2014something studies indicate the majority of the public supports, said Michele Swers, a Georgetown University American government professor. Move over boys, New Hampshire goes to the women \u201cThe debate can be more framed on the aspects of the debate that were more popular with the general public,\u201d Swers said, adding that Democrats were also able to connect other GOP positions on abortion as extreme. There are some indications that social issues directly impacting women might have helped sway votes in some states. Tuesday\u2019s early exit polls showed 51% of Missouri voters said they believed abortion should be legal all or most of the time. Of those voters, exit polls showed 76% supported Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill, who won Tuesday night, while 19% voted for Akin. Forty-seven percent of Missouri\u2019s voters said abortion should be illegal. Exit polls showed Akin netted 67% of this group\u2019s votes while 27% of people who think abortion should be illegal supported McCaskill. But much more than social issues, pocketbook economic issues most concerned women voters, exit polling showed. \u201cWomen like all voters felt the economics were most important,\u201d Swers said. \u201cWomen tend to be more supportive of government spending (such as cutting things as Medicaid, and food stamps) than men are \u2026 so they were less responsive to Romney in that way and more responsive to Obama\u2019s message on empathy and helping the middle class.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tom Cohen, Joe Van Kanel and John King contributed to this report",

Everything doesn\u2019t have to be a fight.\u201d The last votes were still being counted Wednesday in some Western states. CNN now projects Democrat Heidi Heitkamp will beat Republican Rick Berg in North Dakota\u2019s Senate race, keeping that seat in Democratic hands after the retirement of longtime Sen. Kent Conrad. Baldwin elected first openly gay senator McCaskill victorious in Senate race Brown: Stand strong in disappointment Akin: God makes no mistakes In addition, Montana Sen. Jon Tester was projected to hold off a challenge from Republican congressman Denny Rehberg to win a second term there. GOP retains grip on House Reid spoke as the outgoing Congress is under pressure to head off a looming combination of tax increases and across-the-board cuts to federal agencies slated to kick in the first week of January. His deputy, Sen. Dick Durbin, said Tuesday\u2019s results are hugely important when it comes to that \u201cfiscal cliff.\u201d \u201cWe need a more positive outlook to solve our problems,\u201d said Durbin, of Illinois. \u201cA stalemate is impossible.\u201d Republicans captured a seat held by retiring Democrat Ben Nelson in Nebraska, where tea party-backed Republican Deb Fischer beat Bob Kerrey, a former Democratic governor and senator. But Democrats will be replacing Republicans in Massaschusetts, where Sen. Scott Brown lost his bid for a full term to former White House adviser and bailout watchdog Elizabeth Warren; and in Indiana, where GOP veteran Richard Lugar lost a Republican primary to Richard Mourdock, who was beaten by Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly. The national spotlight shone on Mourdock in the waning weeks of the campaign when he discussed his views on abortion during a debate. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God. And even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\u201d Mourdock was teary-eyed during his concession speech. \u201cI was attacked for standing on my principles,\u201d he said. A Democrat also replaces one of the Senate\u2019s two independents, both of whom align themselves with the Democratic caucus, when Connecticut\u2019s Pat Murphy takes over the seat now held by Sen. Joe Lieberman. That leaves a Senate with 53 Democrats and one independent, Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders \u2013 up from the 51 Democrats and two independents in the current chamber. And voters in Maine sent another independent to Washington on Tuesday, with former Gov. Angus King taking the place of retiring Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe. King has studiously refused to say which caucus he\u2019ll join. Though both parties say they expect him to align with the Democrats, he says he\u2019ll meet with Reid and with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, before making a decision. \u201cI hope I can be a bit of a bridge between the two parties,\u201d King told CNN. \u201cWhen I was governor, I was an independent and worked with both sides and was able to achieve quite a bit. There were times when I agreed more with the Democrats and times I agreed more with the Republicans.\u201d Democrats also held onto seats in Virginia and Ohio and saw several firsts. Rep. Tammy Baldwin\u2019s victory in Wisconsin will make her the first openly gay senator, in addition to being the state\u2019s first female senator.  Hawaii also elected its first female senator when Democratic Rep. Mazie Hirono won, CNN projects. There will be a record number of women in the new Senate class \u2013 at least 19, based on CNN projections and current members. Two years ago, Republicans had every reason to believe they could take back the Senate this year, after major midterm election gains. Going into Tuesday\u2019s vote, Republicans were protecting only 10 seats, while Democrats were defending 23 \u2013 many in narrowly divided swing states. But Republicans fell short of winning the seats they would need to tip the balance of power in the Senate, as controversy clouded the final days of campaigning in several races. In August, the campaign of Rep. Todd Akin nearly collapsed after the Missouri Republican\u2019s comments about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and his suggestion that women could biologically prevent pregnancy if they are raped. Until then, Republicans believed Akin would defeat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, who polls showed was not very popular after just one term. McCaskill defeated Akin at the polls Tuesday, CNN projects. Voters approve same-sex marriage for the first time Key Senate race snapshots Arizona: Rep. Jeff Flake (R) vs. Richard Carmona (D) Final result: Rep. Jeff Flake wins Flake, a vocal fiscal conservative, will take the seat now held by retiring GOP Sen. Jon Kyl. Carmona, a Hispanic Vietnam veteran and surgeon general under President George W. Bush, proved to be a formidable opponent for Flake, a six-term congressman who had to fight his way through a tough August primary.  Tight general election polls caused both campaigns to go negative. Among other things, Flake accused Carmona of having anger management problems, while Carmona argued Flake failed to adequately support veterans while in the House. No Democrat has won a U.S. Senate seat in Republican-leaning Arizona since 1988. Connecticut: Rep. Chris Murphy (D) vs. Linda McMahon (R) Final result: Rep. Chris Murphy wins In the closely watched senate race in Connecticut, Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy defeated Republican nominee and professional wrestling executive Linda McMahon, according to a CNN projection. Murphy will take over the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Lieberman, an Independent who sided with Democrats. His win preserves a seat for Democrats who feared losing it to the wealthy McMahon, who spent over $90 million in the last two elections to try to win a Senate seat. The race was marked by heavy negative advertising. Indiana: Richard Mourdock (R) vs. Rep. Joe Donnelly (D) Final result: Rep. Joe Donnelly wins Democrats scored a major upset in the Indiana Senate race, scooping up a seat in the deeply red state Republicans had expected to hold. The campaign appeared to turn for the Democrats after the GOP candidate made controversial comments about rape during a televised debate. Mourdock, the State Treasurer, was backed by both tea party supporters and the Republican establishment when he defeated in the primary longtime GOP moderate Sen. Richard Lugar.  When that happened, Democrats thought Donnelly, who is conservative and pro-life, had an outside chance of winning the seat. Mourdock gave Donnelly an opening when during a debate he defended his opposition to abortion even in the case of rape because, \u201cI think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that is something God intended to happen.\u201d Top Democrats and Republicans criticized the remark and within days, Donnelly took a substantial lead in one respected Indiana poll. Maine: Charlie Summers (R) vs. Cynthia Dill (D) vs. former Gov. Angus King (I) Final result: Former Gov. Angus King wins Former Gov. Angus King, an Independent, steadfastly has refused to say if he will organize with Democrats or Republicans when he gets to Washington. If the Senate is narrowly divided after Tuesday\u2019s election, he could determine which party gets majority control. King will replace Sen. Olympia Snowe, herself an independent-minded Republican who stunned her colleagues this year when she announced she would retire from the Senate, which she complained has become increasingly partisan. Democrats are convinced King will side with them. As evidence, they point to King\u2019s support for Obama and many of his policies. In a sign of that confidence, national Democrats ignored the Democratic candidate Dill and spent heavily against Summers in order to help King. Republicans also believe that King will caucus with Democrats, so they spent millions to defeat him. But an aide told CNN last week that King still has not made up his mind and won\u2019t until he gets to Washington to see the state of play. Massachusetts: Sen. Scott Brown (R) vs. Elizabeth Warren (D) Final result: Elizabeth Warren wins In a key pick-up of a Republican Senate seat, Warren defeated Brown Tuesday, according to a CNN projection. Warren, a Harvard University law professor and former Obama administration financial consumer advocate, beat the freshman senator who was seeking a full term to the seat he won two years after the death of Democratic senator Ted Kennedy.  Brown, the first GOP Senator from deep blue Massachusetts in decades, billed himself as an independent who voted for the needs of Massachusetts, not the demands of either party. The Warren-Brown race was one of the costliest and nastiest campaigns this cycle. It was marked by Brown\u2019s repeated accusations that Warren claimed to be a minority in order to advance her career.  She denied that was her motive for listing her ancestry as Native American, saying she was told about her heritage by her family. Montana: Sen. Jon Tester (D) vs. Rep. Dennis Rehberg (R) Final result: CNN projects Tester wins Democrat Jon Tester knew he\u2019d have an uphill battle to a second term against six-term Rep. Denny Rehberg. Both are known quantities with high favorables in the state, though neither was able to crack 50% in the polls. Both campaigns went negative in the fight over Social Security, and both said the other is distorting their views. Nebraska: Former Sen. Bob Kerrey (D) vs. Deb Fischer (R) Final result: Deb Fischer wins Republicans argued that Kerrey, once a popular governor and two-term senator, lost touch with the conservative state after spending years living in liberal New York City, where he worked as president of the New School. The conservative super PAC American Crossroads began running ads against Kerrey even before he launched his campaign. For his part, Kerrey tried to overcome the state\u2019s GOP tilt in a presidential election year by stressing his commitment to entitlement reform, a balanced budget, and other conservative fiscal issues. He also won a surprise late endorsement from former Nebraska Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel, considered by many to be a GOP renegade. Republicans began eyeing Nelson\u2019s seat even before he announced his retirement. Fischer surprised GOP leaders by squeezing out a primary win over two opponents considered stronger at the start of the year. Nevada: Sen. Dean Heller (R) vs. Rep. Shelley Berkley (D) Final result:  Dean Heller wins Democrats\u2019 strength in Nevada was being put to the test once again in a Senate election. With voter registration numbers on their side, seven-term Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley hoped to deny Republican Sen. Dean Heller a full Senate term (Heller was appointed to the seat after Republican John Ensign resigned). A House ethics investigation and a lackluster debate performance kept Berkley below Heller in the most recent polls. Heller\u2019s strong fundraising ability also helped him keep the advantage in a state with a heavy Latino population that overwhelmingly votes Democratic. Turnout for the presidential race could have the largest impact on the outcome of this race. North Dakota: Heidi Heitkamp (D) vs. Rep. Rick Berg (R) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Kent Conrad (D) is retiring Former state Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp gave Democrats their best opportunity to keep the seat of retiring five-term Sen. Kent Conrad. Republicans hoped first-term Rep. Rick Berg will repeat the party\u2019s success of 2010, when they took over retiring Democrat Byron Dorgan\u2019s seat. The state has a history of split-ticket voting, giving Heitkamp an opportunity to show her independence from national Democrats. She\u2019s publicly disagreed with Barack Obama on issues like energy, which she points to as evidence she won\u2019t be a rubber stamp. She enjoyed high favorables and solid support from Republican ticket-splitters and has hammered Berg for his connection to a controversial real estate company. Ohio: Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) vs. Josh Mandel (R) Final result: Sen. Sherrod Brown wins Primarily because of those frequent trips from President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney, the contest between Brown and Mandel played out in Ohio against the backdrop of the presidential election. Fueled by Super PAC money and advertising, the race got nasty at times. In total, $67 million dollars was spent in the election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Much of that \u2013 $34 million \u2013 was sent by outside groups advocacy groups. At the three debate, Mandel and Brown battled over the auto bailout, abortion and each other\u2019s record. The testiness of the race spilled out on the debate stage \u2013 at one debate Mandel told Brown to \u201ccalm down\u201d and called him \u201ca liar.\u201d Brown was first elected to the Senate in 2006, during a wave of Democratic victories in the Senate and House. Throughout most of the 2012 race, especially in September and October, Brown led Mandel by around 10 percentage points in independent poling. Pennsylvania: Sen. Bob Casey (D) vs. Tom Smith (R) CNN projection: Sen. Bob Casey wins Though recent polls gave Republicans hope where they previously had little, freshman Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania was re-elected Tuesday. GOP candidate Tom Smith, a wealthy business executive, lagged far behind Casey for much of the race. In the last few weeks, he spent heavily on advertising and was able to narrow the polls. But he never took the lead Virginia: Former Gov. Tim Kaine (D) vs. former Gov./Sen. George Allen (R) Final result: Gov. Tim Kaine wins Allen conceded in a Tuesday night speech and pledged his support to Kaine. \u201cI congratulated him and pledged my support and cooperation as he undertakes the solemn vows of representing the people of Virginia during very difficult times in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t succeeded my friends in winning this election.\u201d The race pitted two former Virginia governors against one another and each pulled from their experience in the state house throughout the race. Though, Kaine linked himself to Obama and the president\u2019s campaigning in Virginia, he also painted himself as someone who had worked with both Democrats and Republicans. Allen, however, tried to turn that link against Kaine \u2013 tying him to Obama and the Democratic Party, where the former Democratic governor served as chairman. Making that case was costly. When outside and candidate spending was added together, the Kaine-Allen race was the most expensive race in the country. Outside groups, on their own totaled over $50 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Wisconsin: Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D) vs. former Gov. Tommy Thompson (R) Final result: Rep. Tammy Baldwin wins Baldwin, along with outside groups, spent a lot of advertising dollars painting Thompson as someone who left politics to cash in on lobbying. Both Democrats and Republicans officials acknowledge that the attacks drove Thompson\u2019s negatives up \u2013 and led to a testy campaign tone. The Wisconsin Senate seat opened up when Sen. Herb Kohl retired after four terms in the Senate. Thompson, who won a four-way primary for the Republican nomination, was Baldwin\u2019s first competition in the race \u2013 she ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. The election win makes Baldwin the first openly gay member of the Senate. CNN\u2019s Alan Silverleib, Dana Bash, Dan Merica, Adam Levy and Robert Yoon contributed to this report.",

Voters in Maine approved for the first time in history a measure that gives the right to same-sex couples to marry, while in Maryland voters also made history by upholding a new law allowing same-sex couples to marry in the state, according to CNN projections. A couple of percentage points were all that separated similar measures in Minnesota and Washington, initial returns showed. Colorado and Washington, meanwhile, voted to approve state initiatives legalizing marijuana, while Oregon voters turned away a similar initiative, projections show.

This will be a complicated process, but we intend to follow through,\u201d Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said in a statement released late Tuesday. \u201cThat said, federal law still says marijuana is an illegal drug, so don\u2019t break out the Cheetos or Goldfish too quickly.\u201d Even as voters returned President Barack Obama to office for a second term, according to CNN projections, a key component of his signature health care reform law was on the line in a number of states. In Alabama and Wyoming, voters approved measures to amend their state constitution to prohibit people from being compelled to participate in Obamacare, while early returns in Montana showed voters approving similar measures. Same-sex marriage wins first-ever ballot box approval The one exception appears to be Florida, where voters turned back a measure that would have prohibited people and businesses from participating in Obamacare. \u201cThese laws may promise more than they can deliver,\u201d said Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School. \u201cWhat the laws certainly do is to give state officials more of a basis to go to court and challenge the national health care law.\u201d Voters nationwide were deciding the outcome of nearly 180 ballot measures in 38 states. That\u2019s up from 159 in 2010, but down from 204 in 2008. Opinion: Five things Obama must do Voters in Florida, meanwhile, nixed a constitutional amendment that would have banned the use of public funds for abortions, according to a CNN projection. The campaign pitted the Protect Florida Taxpayers and Parental Rights, which was primarily funded by a large collection of Catholic archdioceses across Florida, against Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood spent $3.2 million on ads to defeat the measure in Florida during the week heading into the election. \u201cThe people of Florida have sent a clear message that politicians have no place in a woman\u2019s deeply personal and private medical decisions,\u201d said Jennifer Dalven, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. Election campaign ends with chess match in swing states Results for key ballot initiatives: Alabama Obamacare A measure that would amend the state constitution to prohibit individuals and businesses from being compelled to participate in any health care system passed.

See how Arkansas voted California Propostion 30: Jerry Brown tax Increase More than 4.3 million voters said \u201cYes\u201d to the temporary tax to fund education, with 53.4% of voters casting ballots in the affirmative, according to the unofficial results on the California secretary of state\u2019s website. The measure sponsored by Gov. Jerry Brown will increase personal income tax for seven years for those making more than $250,000 a year. It also increases the sales tax by 0.25% for four years. Proposition 34: Death penalty By roughly the same margin \u2013 53.1% to 46.9% \u2013 voters decided against a measure to abolish capital punishment in California and make life imprisonment without the possibility of parole the maximum punishment for murder. The measure would have applied retroactively to all death row inmates. Proposition 38: Other tax increase A measure that would raise income taxes for almost all income levels for 12 years resoundingly failed, according to unofficial results on the California secretary of state website. Almost 5.7 million voters, or 72.6% of ballots cast, disapproved of the measure that would dedicate revenue to K-12 education, debt reduction and early childhood programs. This measure was in competition with Brown\u2019s Proposition 30.

Under Florida state law, the measure required 60% of the vote to pass.

            "article_content": "NEW: President Barack Obama says best times for America still ahead Mitt Romney concedes, calling for an end to political bickering Obama overtakes Romney in popular vote as turnout heavy Republicans retain control of U.S. House; Democrats hold Senate President Barack Obama rode a wave of broad support from moderates, women and minorities to win re-election Tuesday by defeating Republican challenger Mitt Romney in Democratic strongholds and key battleground states. According to CNN projections, Obama surpassed the decisive 270-vote threshold in the Electoral College with victory in Ohio. That and a later projected victory in another swing state \u2013 Virginia \u2013 gave him 303 electoral votes to 206 for Romney, according to the CNN call based on unofficial returns. Joyful supporters danced and cheered at Obama\u2019s victory party in Chicago, and the president thanked them for ensuring the nation will continue to move forward while warning the battle for change they seek will continue to be difficult. \u201cTonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come,\u201d Obama said to prolonged cheers. He emphasized his main campaign theme of fighting for equal opportunity for all, saying the political arguments that come with democracy in America were a necessary part of the process. Obama's path to victory Romney: Election over, principles endure Kaine stops speech to announce Obama win Asian media reacts to Obama win \u201cWe will disagree, sometimes fiercely,\u201d Obama said, noting that \u201cprogress will come in fits and starts\u201d and the victory Tuesday night \u201cwon\u2019t end all the gridlock.\u201d Foreshadowing hard decisions ahead, the president said blind optimism and wishful idealism \u201ccan\u2019t substitute for the need to make difficult compromises to move forward.\u201d When he finished, the first family and Vice President Joe Biden and his family joined him onstage in a celebration of waves, hugs amid a blizzard of confetti. In Boston, Romney supporters hugged and wept in a somber vigil while waiting for their candidate to concede. Opinion:  Five things Obama must do In a brief speech he delivered alone, Romney congratulated and said his prayers would be with the president at such a challenging time for the country. \u201cAt a time like this we can\u2019t risk partisan bickering and political posturing,\u201d Romney said, later adding that he wished he had \u201cfulfilled your wishes to lead this great country in a different direction.\u201d Romney\u2019s wife, Ann, and most of his family, as well as running mate Rep. Paul Ryan and his family then came on the stage for a few minutes in what was a subdued farewell. Late push by Romney falls short Obama withstood a late push by Romney in Pennsylvania and won battleground states of Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and Colorado, according to CNN projections. One other battleground, Florida, remained too close to call early on Wednesday. He also easily won traditional Democratic strongholds of California, New York and other populous states such as Michigan, the state where Romney was born and his father served as governor. Exit polls showed Obama received strong support, as expected, from women voters as well as overwhelming support from African Americans and strong backing from Hispanic voters, similar to the coalition that carried him to victory four years earlier to make him the nation\u2019s first African American president. Meanwhile, CNN projected that Democrats will retain their majority in the Senate, ensuring another divided Congress after Republicans earlier were projected to hold their majority in the U.S. House. Share your response to the election outcome The result showed Republicans need to recalibrate their approach to broaden their appeal to a nation of changing demographics, analysts said. Exit polls indicated that white voters made up 72% of the electorate, with African Americans, Latinos and other minorities comprising a growing share. \u201cIt\u2019s not about geography anymore with the Republican Party,\u201d said Margaret Hoover, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. \u201cIt\u2019s about demographics, and we\u2019ve got to start thinking about growing the party.\u201d David Gergen, CNN\u2019s senior political analyst, said the Grand Old Party must move its foundation back toward the political center from the increasingly right-wing positions pushed by tea party conservatives. \u201cIt seems to me that the lesson has to be clear to Republicans that they have to adjust,\u201d Gergen said. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten too far out.\u201d Race was dead even in final polls Obama and Romney ran dead even in final polls that hinted at a result rivaling some of the closest presidential elections in history, reflecting the deep political chasm in the country. A heavy turnout was reported in much of the nation, and both campaigns expressed confidence that they would prevail in what was expected to be a long night awaiting results from the eight states still up for grabs that will determine the victor. Opinion: Obama\u2019s victory won\u2019t transform America As predicted, the election was decided in the battleground states, and as the returns emerged, it became clear that Romney was failing to win them. Overall, Obama led by more than one million votes in the popular tally. The president won his home state of Illinois as well as Romney\u2019 s home state of Massachusetts \u2013 where the Republican previously served as governor. He also won Romney\u2019s birth state of Michigan, along with Colorado, Nevada, California, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Maine, Rhode Island, Hawaii and the District of Columbia, according to the CNN projections. Romney won North Carolina, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wyoming, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Utah, Missouri and Georgia, CNN projects. According to early exit polls, 60% of voters said the economy was the most important issue, 59% thought abortion should be legal and 50% wanted Obama\u2019s health care reform law repealed while 43% wanted it to remain in place or be expanded. The breakdown of voters, according to the early exit polls, was 73% white, 13% African American, 10% Latino and 3% Asian. Pre-election polls showed Romney holding an advantage among white men while Obama had the edge with white women, and Obama receiving overwhelming support among minorities. With the victory, Obama will face the challenge of leading a country facing chronic federal deficits and debt as well as sluggish economic growth in the wake of a devastating recession and financial industry collapse that confronted Obama when he took office in January 2009. Around the country, voters formed long lines at polling places after record numbers participated in early balloting, indicating a strong turnout. Sporadic reports of irregularities included malfunctioning voting machines and other problems, including electoral hardships for some struggling to recover from the devastation of Superstorm Sandy in states in the country\u2019s northeast. A judge in Philadelphia, a heavily Democratic city, ordered election officials to cover a mural of Obama at one school used as a polling location after Republicans complained the painting violated election laws. Elsewhere in the city, GOP poll monitors were being escorted into precincts by sheriff\u2019s deputies after some observers had been denied access earlier in the day, said Tasha Jamerson, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office. In New Jersey, which permitted electronic balloting in the aftermath of last week\u2019s storm, the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union headed to court on Tuesday on behalf of voters who said their requests for an electronic ballot weren\u2019t being acknowledged. Candidates usually take Election Day off, but both sides continued to make public appearances even as voting was under way. Obama visited a local Democratic election center in the Chicago area, while Vice President Joe Biden made \u201can unannounced but long-scheduled\u201d stop in the key battleground state of Ohio. Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, also arrived separately in Ohio, with Romney\u2019s campaign plane and Air Force Two, which carries the vice president, crossing paths at Cleveland\u2019s airport. Earlier Tuesday, Romney cast his ballot outside of Boston on Tuesday, while Obama previously became the first sitting president to vote early when he did so in Chicago last month. New pressure for deficit deal With the election over, the White House and Congress will face fresh pressure to legislate a comprehensive deficit reduction deal that has been stymied so far by intransigence on the issue of tax reform, with Republicans refusing to consider any kind of tax increase while Obama and Democrats insist on at least the wealthy paying a higher income tax rate. Despite the building drama toward Election Day in the campaign expected to cost $2.6 billion, much of the outcome already was known. Popular, electoral vote split? It\u2019s happened before Only a handful of states were considered up for grabs and both candidates and their campaigns concluded an exhausting final sprint through them over the weekend and on Monday. The barnstorming amounted to a montage of Americana electioneering, with Obama and Romney shouting themselves hoarse before boisterous crowds, joined by top surrogates and star power such as Bruce Springsteen singing for Obama and Kid Rock for Romney. In their final speeches, the candidates and their running mates blended inspirational visions for a better future with well-honed attacks in hopes of ensuring their committed supporters actually cast ballots while trying to coax votes from anyone still undecided. Obama briefly waxed nostalgic at his first event on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, referring to Springsteen when he said: \u201cI get to fly around with him on the last day that I will ever campaign, so that\u2019s not a bad way to end things.\u201d He cited accomplishments of his first term, including ending the war in Iraq, winding down the war in Afghanistan, passing health insurance and Wall Street reforms, and ending the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy that banned openly gay and lesbian personnel from the military. Emotion overtook the president at the end of the day. His eyes welled with tears as he thanked the people \u201cwho\u2019ve given so much to this campaign over the years,\u201d during a stop in Des Moines, Iowa \u2013 a place where his first campaign gained an early foothold in his first run for the White House. Republicans pick up key seat in governors\u2019 races For his part, Romney called Obama\u2019s record one of underachievement and failure, telling a cheering Virginia crowd at his second stop of the day that \u201calmost every measure he took hurt the economy, hurt fellow Americans.\u201d At an earlier event in Florida, Romney asked if people wanted four more years like the last four, raising the specter of continuing gridlock in Washington and adding that \u201cunless we change course, we may be looking at another recession.\u201d He had promised to repeal the health care and Wall Street reforms of the Obama presidency and to \u201climit government rather than limiting the dreams\u201d of Americans. As the challenger, Romney sought to frame the election as a referendum on Obama\u2019s presidency and to capitalize on his own background as multimillionaire businessman by depicting himself as better able to handle economic issues identified by voters as their biggest concern. His campaign stump speech hammered Obama over high unemployment and what he called excessive taxes and regulations that Romney said stifled faster growth. Obama and his team attacked Romney\u2019s politics and his background as a venture capitalist, saying he would back policies favoring the wealthy over the middle class and exacerbate the already widening income and opportunity disparity in the country. The president wanted the race to come down to competing visions for the future and his oft-repeated goal of restoring the promise of the American dream of equal opportunity for all. In particular, Obama repeatedly noted he backed a taxpayer bailout that helped restore General Motors and Chrysler while Romney opposed it. The issue resonated in auto industry states like Michigan and Ohio, which was considered the most significant of the battlegrounds in the final days of the race. Opinion: Obama will get little time to celebrate Campaign chess match Aside from the policy differences, the election amounted to a campaign chess match targeting specific states and demographic groups as part of plan to create a path to electoral success. Polling portrayed a race that hinged on the social and democratic divides in American society, with Obama supported most strongly by women, minorities and young respondents, while Romney did better among wealthy and middle class white men, from senior citizens down to 30-year-olds. In response, Obama emphasized the anti-choice positions of Romney and conservatives on abortion, their stance against gay rights and their opposition to providing a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Re-election offered Obama, 51, the chance to secure a two-term legacy and seek further reforms he promised in his historic campaign of 2008 but was unable to deliver in the first four years. In particular, he has made comprehensive immigration reform a top target, as well as a deficit reduction plan that ends tax breaks for income over $250,000. However, the wave of optimism that carried to him to victory four years ago seemed muted during the campaign this time, with former supporters angered by the failure to achieve the kind of change in Washington they believed Obama had promised but failed to deliver. For Romney, a multimillionaire businessman who sought to become the nation\u2019s first Mormon president, the election concluded a six-year quest for the White House. Romney also failed in his first bid for the Republican nomination in 2008, then spent the next two years preparing for a second run that began in 2011 with a grueling primary campaign featuring a record 20 debates. Romney, 65, shifted to the right for the primary race to overcome a broad field. Romney declared himself \u201cseverely\u201d conservative and adopted stances against abortion, gay marriage and a path to legal residency for undocumented immigrants while also opposing higher tax rates as part of a deficit reduction plan. His support remained steady \u2013 though well below a majority \u2013 throughout the primary campaign while opponents dropped out one by one until Romney emerged as the winner and claimed the nomination at the GOP convention in late August. However, his campaign endured a tough September, due in part to some unforced errors. A secretly recorded video from a May fundraiser became public, showing Romney referring to 47% of the country as dependent on government handouts and therefore unreachable to him as a candidate. When U.S. diplomatic compounds came under attack on September 11, including an assault that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya, Romney quickly issued a statement that was criticized for mistaken information and seeking to politicize a sensitive national security issue. Then, in the first presidential debate on October 3, Romney began an energetic shift back to the political center and scored a clear victory over Obama by presenting himself as more moderate than the right-wing zealot portrayed by the president. Obama\u2019s lackluster showing in the first debate contributed to an overwhelming consensus among analysts and poll results that Romney carried the night, and he began rising in the polls to erase what had been a consistent Obama lead since the conventions a month earlier. Stronger performances by Obama in the second and third debates began to slow Romney\u2019s momentum, though the Romney team claimed a surge put states like Michigan and Pennsylvania back in play. They were previously thought safe for the president. With polls tightening in the final weeks, Romney or his surrogates heightened their attacks on key issues, including a campaign ad that implied the auto bailout led to shifting the production of iconic Chrysler Jeeps to China. The automaker joined the Obama campaign in complaining that the ad was misleading, and the president said it was intended to scare workers for political gain. 21 moments that defined the campaign and America Superstorm Sandy However, the biggest impact on the end of the campaign was Superstorm Sandy, which blasted the East Coast from Maryland to Connecticut just over a week before Election Day. Obama and Romney canceled campaign events, and the president shifted to full emergency response mode as the storm and its devastation dominated the national focus for much of the final full week of campaigning. On the ground, record numbers of voters cast early ballots as both sides boasted of ramped-up organizations to identify and contact supporters. Overall, the total cost of the election for president and Congress could top a record-breaking $6 billion, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The figure covers spending from January 2011 through whatever totals emerge after Tuesday\u2019s election. Outside groups accounted for the biggest boost in spending, with independent organizations dropping more than $970 million. The increase was largely related to the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that paved the way for super PACs to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money as long as they did not coordinate with the campaigns. Could close race produced a popular/electoral vote split?

            "article_content": "Democratic wins make it impossible for Republicans to regain Senate control GOP source: \"We have (a) real possibility of going backwards\" Democrats pickup Republican seats in Massachusetts and Indiana, CNN projects Maine voters hand a victory to independent candidate, CNN projects Democrats will retain their control of the Senate after winning several closely contested races on Tuesday. While poll results were still trickling in for some races, the Democratic victories make a Republican majority impossible. \u201cNo chance we get there,\u201d a top GOP source told CNN Tuesday night. \u201cWe have (a) real possibility of going backwards.\u201d Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren defeated incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts and Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly scored a major upset in the Indiana Senate race when he won against tea party candidate Richard Mourdock. Akin: God makes no mistakes Both wins are pickups of key Republican seats. Democrats also scored notable victories in Virginia, Ohio and Connecticut. Baldwin elected first openly gay senator McCaskill victorious in Senate race Brown: Stand strong in disappointment U.S. Senate: Full results Republicans will maintain the majority in the House of Representatives, according to CNN projections. That means, with President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection victory, there appears to be no change in the balance of power in Washington. The Democrats\u2019 Senate majority gives them the ability to influence much of the Washington agenda during the next two years. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday night\u2019s Senate election results showed it was time for a change in how lawmakers do business. Democrats and Republicans must work together, the Nevada Democrat said. \u201cThe strategy of obstruction, gridlock and delay was soundly rejected by the American people,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNow, they are looking to us for solutions.\u201d In addition to solidifying Democrats\u2019 Senate stronghold, Tuesday\u2019s races marked several firsts.  Rep. Tammy Baldwin\u2019s victory in Wisconsin will make her the first openly gay senator, in addition to being the state\u2019s first female senator.  Hawaii also elected its first female senator when Democratic Rep. Mazie Hirono won, CNN projects. There will be a record number of women in the new Senate class \u2013 at least 19, based on CNN projections and current members. Brown defeats Mandel in contentious Ohio Senate race Two years ago, Republicans had every reason to believe they could take back the Senate this year, after major midterm election gains. Going into Tuesday\u2019s vote, Republicans were protecting only 10 seats, while Democrats were defending 23, many in narrowly divided swing states. But Republicans fell short of winning the seats they would need to tip the balance of power in the Senate. Controversy clouded the final days of campaigning in several races. In August, the campaign of Rep. Todd Akin nearly collapsed after the Missouri Republican\u2019s comments about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and his suggestion that women could biologically prevent pregnancy if they are raped. Until then, Republicans believed Akin would defeat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, who polls showed was not very popular after just one term. McCaskill defeated Akin at the polls Tuesday, CNN projects. Indiana\u2019s Mourdock sparked a similar controversy during a debate last month when he defended his opposition to abortion even in the case of rape because, \u201cI think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something God intended to happen.\u201d Opinion: Mourdock\u2019s rape remark and extremism Within days, his opponent took a substantial lead in one respected Indiana poll. And Tuesday night, Mourdock failed to secure a victory in a state Republicans had expected to win. Former Gov. Angus King\u2019s victory in Maine\u2019s Senate race was another blow to Republicans. King, an independent who quickly rose to frontrunner status, won the seat vacated by retired moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe. King hasn\u2019t said which party he would caucus with in the Senate, but he is widely assumed to align with Democrats. Considered a shoo-in for re-election, Snowe shocked her colleagues earlier this year when she suddenly announced that she would leave the Senate, which she described as hopelessly partisan. Key Senate race snapshots Arizona: Rep. Jeff Flake (R) vs. Richard Carmona (D) Final result: Rep. Jeff Flake wins Flake, a vocal fiscal conservative, will take the seat now held by retiring GOP Sen. Jon Kyl. Carmona, a Hispanic Vietnam veteran and surgeon general under President George W. Bush, proved to be a formidable opponent for Flake, a six-term congressman who had to fight his way through a tough August primary.  Tight general election polls caused both campaigns to go negative. Among other things, Flake accused Carmona of having anger management problems, while Carmona argued Flake failed to adequately support veterans while in the House. No Democrat has won a U.S. Senate seat in Republican-leaning Arizona since 1988. Connecticut: Rep. Chris Murphy (D) vs. Linda McMahon (R) Final result: Rep. Chris Murphy wins In the closely watched senate race in Connecticut, Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy defeated Republican nominee and professional wrestling executive Linda McMahon, according to a CNN projection. Murphy will take over the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Lieberman, an Independent who sided with Democrats. His win preserves a seat for Democrats who feared losing it to the wealthy McMahon, who spent over $90 million in the last two elections to try to win a Senate seat. The race was marked by heavy negative advertising. Murphy defeats McMahon Indiana: Richard Mourdock (R) vs. Rep. Joe Donnelly (D) Final result: Rep. Joe Donnelly wins Democrats scored a major upset in the Indiana Senate race, scooping up a seat in the deeply red state Republicans had expected to hold. The campaign appeared to turn for the Democrats after the GOP candidate made controversial comments about rape during a televised debate. Mourdock, the State Treasurer, was backed by both tea party supporters and the Republican establishment when he defeated in the primary longtime GOP moderate Sen. Richard Lugar.  When that happened, Democrats thought Donnelly, who is conservative and pro-life, had an outside chance of winning the seat. Mourdock gave Donnelly an opening when during a debate he defended his opposition to abortion even in the case of rape because, \u201cI think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that is something God intended to happen.\u201d Top Democrats and Republicans criticized the remark and within days, Donnelly took a substantial lead in one respected Indiana poll. Democrats win GOP Senate seat in Indiana Maine: Charlie Summers (R) vs. Cynthia Dill (D) vs. former Gov. Angus King (I) Final result: Former Gov. Angus King wins Former Gov. Angus King, an Independent, steadfastly has refused to say if he will organize with Democrats or Republicans when he gets to Washington. If the Senate is narrowly divided after Tuesday\u2019s election, he could determine which party gets majority control. King will replace Sen. Olympia Snowe, herself an independent-minded Republican who stunned her colleagues this year when she announced she would retire from the Senate, which she complained has become increasingly partisan. Democrats are convinced King will side with them. As evidence, they point to King\u2019s support for Obama and many of his policies. In a sign of that confidence, national Democrats ignored the Democratic candidate Dill and spent heavily against Summers in order to help King. Republicans also believe that King will caucus with Democrats, so they spent millions to defeat him. But an aide told CNN last week that King still has not made up his mind and won\u2019t until he gets to Washington to see the state of play. Maine elects an independent King Massachusetts: Sen. Scott Brown (R) vs. Elizabeth Warren (D) Final result: Elizabeth Warren wins In a key pick-up of a Republican Senate seat, Warren defeated Brown Tuesday, according to a CNN projection. Warren, a Harvard University law professor and former Obama administration financial consumer advocate, beat the freshman senator who was seeking a full term to the seat he won two years after the death of Democratic senator Ted Kennedy.  Brown, the first GOP Senator from deep blue Massachusetts in decades, billed himself as an independent who voted for the needs of Massachusetts, not the demands of either party. The Warren-Brown race was one of the costliest and nastiest campaigns this cycle. It was marked by Brown\u2019s repeated accusations that Warren claimed to be a minority in order to advance her career.  She denied that was her motive for listing her ancestry as Native American, saying she was told about her heritage by her family. Warren beats Brown for Senate seat in Massachusetts Montana: Sen. Jon Tester (D) vs. Rep. Dennis Rehberg (R) Democrat Jon Tester knew he\u2019d have an uphill battle to a second term against six-term Rep. Denny Rehberg. Both are known quantities with high favorables in the state, though neither was able to crack 50% in the polls. Both campaigns went negative in the fight over Social Security, and both said the other is distorting their views. Like the Massachusetts race, there were few undecideds left, except here Republicans were hoping that worked in their favor. Nebraska: Former Sen. Bob Kerrey (D) vs. Deb Fischer (R) Final result: Deb Fischer wins Republicans argued that Kerrey, once a popular governor and two-term senator, lost touch with the conservative state after spending years living in liberal New York City, where he worked as president of the New School. The conservative super PAC American Crossroads began running ads against Kerrey even before he launched his campaign. For his part, Kerrey tried to overcome the state\u2019s GOP tilt in a presidential election year by stressing his commitment to entitlement reform, a balanced budget, and other conservative fiscal issues. He also won a surprise late endorsement from former Nebraska Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel, considered by many to be a GOP renegade. Republicans began eyeing Nelson\u2019s seat even before he announced his retirement. Fischer surprised GOP leaders by squeezing out a primary win over two opponents considered stronger at the start of the year. Nevada: Sen. Dean Heller (R) vs. Rep. Shelley Berkley (D) Democrats\u2019 strength in Nevada was being put to the test once again in a Senate election. With voter registration numbers on their side, seven-term Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley hoped to deny Republican Sen. Dean Heller a full Senate term (Heller was appointed to the seat after Republican John Ensign resigned). A House ethics investigation and a lackluster debate performance kept Berkley below Heller in the most recent polls. Heller\u2019s strong fundraising ability also helped him keep the advantage in a state with a heavy Latino population that overwhelmingly votes Democratic. Turnout for the presidential race could have the largest impact on the outcome of this race. North Dakota: Heidi Heitkamp (D) vs. Rep. Rick Berg (R) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Kent Conrad (D) is retiring Former state Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp gave Democrats their best opportunity to keep the seat of retiring five-term Sen. Kent Conrad. Republicans hoped first-term Rep. Rick Berg will repeat the party\u2019s success of 2010, when they took over retiring Democrat Byron Dorgan\u2019s seat. The state has a history of split-ticket voting, giving Heitkamp an opportunity to show her independence from national Democrats. She\u2019s publicly disagreed with Barack Obama on issues like energy, which she points to as evidence she won\u2019t be a rubber stamp. She enjoyed high favorables and solid support from Republican ticket-splitters and has hammered Berg for his connection to a controversial real estate company. With the lowest unemployment rate in the country, North Dakotans had their choice between two candidates with strong statewide appeal. Ohio: Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) vs. Josh Mandel (R) Final result: Sen. Sherrod Brown wins Primarily because of those frequent trips from President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney, the contest between Brown and Mandel played out in Ohio against the backdrop of the presidential election. Fueled by Super PAC money and advertising, the race got nasty at times. In total, $67 million dollars was spent in the election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Much of that \u2013 $34 million \u2013 was sent by outside groups advocacy groups. At the three debate, Mandel and Brown battled over the auto bailout, abortion and each other\u2019s record. The testiness of the race spilled out on the debate stage \u2013 at one debate Mandel told Brown to \u201ccalm down\u201d and called him \u201ca liar.\u201d Brown was first elected to the Senate in 2006, during a wave of Democratic victories in the Senate and House. Throughout most of the 2012 race, especially in September and October, Brown led Mandel by around 10 percentage points in independent poling. Pennsylvania: Sen. Bob Casey (D) vs. Tom Smith (R) CNN projection: Sen. Bob Casey wins Though recent polls gave Republicans hope where they previously had little, freshman Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania was re-elected Tuesday. GOP candidate Tom Smith, a wealthy business executive, lagged far behind Casey for much of the race. In the last few weeks, he spent heavily on advertising and was able to narrow the polls. But he never took the lead Virginia: Former Gov. Tim Kaine (D) vs. former Gov./Sen. George Allen (R) Final result: Gov. Tim Kaine wins Allen conceded in a Tuesday night speech and pledged his support to Kaine. \u201cI congratulated him and pledged my support and cooperation as he undertakes the solemn vows of representing the people of Virginia during very difficult times in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t succeeded my friends in winning this election.\u201d The race pitted two former Virginia governors against one another and each pulled from their experience in the state house throughout the race. Though, Kaine linked himself to Obama and the president\u2019s campaigning in Virginia, he also painted himself as someone who had worked with both Democrats and Republicans. Allen, however, tried to turn that link against Kaine \u2013 tying him to Obama and the Democratic Party, where the former Democratic governor served as chairman. Making that case was costly. When outside and candidate spending was added together, the Kaine-Allen race was the most expensive race in the country. Outside groups, on their own totaled over $50 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Wisconsin: Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D) vs. former Gov. Tommy Thompson (R) Final result: Rep. Tammy Baldwin wins Baldwin, along with outside groups, spent a lot of advertising dollars painting Thompson as someone who left politics to cash in on lobbying. Both Democrats and Republicans officials acknowledge that the attacks drove Thompson\u2019s negatives up \u2013 and led to a testy campaign tone. The Wisconsin Senate seat opened up when Sen. Herb Kohl retired after four terms in the Senate. Thompson, who won a four-way primary for the Republican nomination, was Baldwin\u2019s first competition in the race \u2013 she ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. The election win makes Baldwin the first openly gay member of the Senate. Obama wins: What do you think?

            "article_content": "GOP may not be poised to take the Senate majority in 2012 Democratic strategist: Republicans are spending millions playing defense Republican strategist: GOP is polling within margin of error in 10 of 12 key races Outside groups have spend $190 million in Senate races as of October 23 Even before a second Republican Senate candidate tripped over incendiary comments about rape, GOP leaders in Washington knew that their once promising chances of winning control of the Senate had diminished. Whether Richard Mourdock of Indiana can move past his controversial remarks and stabilize his campaign remains to be seen. Either way, once confident Republicans across the country now face the nail-biting final days of campaigning and a highly uncertain outcome on Election Day. That\u2019s a big change from two years ago when Republicans made major gains in the midterm election and had reason to believe they could take back the Senate this year.  But, in fact, Democrats now appear well-positioned to retain their slim majority and with it the ability to influence much of the Washington agenda during the next two years whether President Barack Obama is re-elected or former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney succeeds him. Political operatives in each party caution that there are more toss-up races this year than in recent memory, so it\u2019s very hard to predict the outcome which they agree could be influenced heavily by the presidential ballot. \u201cWe are cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll keep the majority this year,\u201d said Matt Canter of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which coordinates Democratic campaigns.  He pointed to Democratic Senate candidates who are doing unexpectedly well in several red states, which is forcing Republicans to focus their energies and resources where they didn\u2019t expect to have to. Brown defeats Mandel in contentious Ohio Senate race \u201cRepublicans are spending millions of dollars playing defense in five of the 10 Republican-held seats on the map,\u201d Canter said. \u201cPundits didn\u2019t predict that.\u201d Republicans, who acknowledge they faced a number of setbacks, have been buoyed recently by the resurgence of Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential bid and are hopeful his momentum will carry over to Senate races. Romney recently cut ads for two GOP Senate candidates, which will test that theory. Obama: Rape is rape Florida's ugly Senate race Poll position in Mass. Senate race \u201cWhat the first (presidential) debate did was clarify the choice between the two visions of the parties and that helped us,\u201d said Rob Jesmer of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which spearheads the GOP election effort. Jesmer said that of the 10 to 12 races that are polling within the margin of error, Republicans believe they are actually ahead by a couple of points in most of them.  The Republican senatorial committee and GOP super PACS plan to spend heavily in Indiana, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Montana, Nevada, Arizona, and Virginia between now and the election. Opinion: Mourdock\u2019s rape remark and extremism \u201cThe races are close and millions of dollars will be spent\u201d in the coming days, Jesmer said.  \u201cSo we have to run to the tape.\u201d Two years ago, Republicans were upbeat about their prospects because they only needed four seats to win the chamber outright and just three if a Republican were to win the White House and a GOP vice president could break tie votes. Republicans had the advantage of having to protect only 10 seats while Democrats had to defend 23, many in narrowly divided swing states. In addition, several veteran Democratic incumbents, mostly moderates, announced they would retire, making it potentially even easier for Republicans to win those seats. Republicans encountered their own problems, though. A frustrated Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, who was considered a shoo-in for re-election, shocked her colleagues when she suddenly announced that she would leave the Senate, which she described as hopelessly partisan. In Missouri, the campaign of Rep. Todd Akin nearly collapsed after the Republican\u2019s comments about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and his suggestion that women could biologically prevent pregnancy if they are raped. Until then, Republicans believed Akin would defeat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, who polls showed was not very popular after just one term. Now, Republicans are grappling with the controversy over Mourdock, the tea party-backed state treasurer.  He had already riled the Republican establishment by defeating in the primary longtime moderate Sen. Richard Lugar, who otherwise likely would have won a seventh term. During a televised debate with his opponent, conservative Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly, Mourdock defended his opposition to abortion even in the case of rape because, \u201cI think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something God intended to happen.\u201d Democrats pounced on his remarks and several key Republicans denounced them, too. Romney, who had just appeared in a TV ad for Mourdock, said he disagreed with the comment but didn\u2019t pull his endorsement. Democrats, who this week pumped an additional $1.6 million into the race, say their internal polling shows Donnelly up by two points.  However, Republicans say they are confident that the heavily GOP and pro-life voters in Indiana will rally behind Mourdock. Strong Democratic candidates also have put several GOP seats into play. Clinton appearance signals hope for Arizona Democrats in Senate In Arizona, former President George W. Bush\u2019s Surgeon General Richard Carmona, a Democrat who is Hispanic, is neck and neck with veteran GOP Rep. Jeff Flake. In Massachusetts, former Obama administration consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren appears to be slightly ahead of Sen. Scott Brown, the Republican who won the Senate seat that for decades belonged to Ted Kennedy. And in Nevada, many polls indicate Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley narrowly trails Sen. Dean Heller, the Republican. When \u2018God\u2019s will,\u2019 rape and pregnancy collide In three of the states where moderate Democratic incumbents retired this year and Republicans were early favorites to win, polls now show tight races. In Wisconsin, Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin is neck and neck with former GOP Gov. Tommy Thompson. In North Dakota, Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is slightly behind Republican Rep. Rick Berg and in New Mexico, Democratic Rep. Martin Heinrich is holding a small but steady lead of former Republican Rep. Heather Wilson. But Republicans point to their own prospects, including seats they hope to pick up across the aisle. At the top of their list is in Nebraska where Republican Deb Fischer has a solid lead over former Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey and is likely to win the open Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Ben Nelson. In Democratic-leaning Connecticut, Republican Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive, hopes to win the seat of retiring Sen. Joe Lieberman, the independent who caucuses with Democrats. Her opponent is Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy, who has struggled to maintain a lead over McMahon.  The race has been notably caustic with negative advertising flooding the airwaves.  Democrats have had to spend heavily to shore up Murphy\u2019s campaign. Connecticut race tight with in final stretch Polls are also very close in Montana where incumbent Democrat Jon Tester is locked in a slugfest with Republican Rep. Denny Rehberg and in Virginia where former Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine is trying to hold onto a Democratic seat over former Republican Sen. George Allen. Democratic seats in Florida and Ohio are also in play although currently the Republican challengers appear to be behind. Sen. Bob Casey, the Democratic incumbent from Pennsylvania who has led comfortably for most of the race, is trying to stave off a late surge from his opponent, business executive Tom Smith. Republicans point to heavy spending by Democrats in blue sates like Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Maine as evidence they have a chance to win enough seats to win the majority.  Democrats point to heavy spending by Republicans in red states like Indiana and Montana as evidence they can\u2019t. Operatives from both parties agree that many of these races could be determined by which presidential candidate carries the state, particularly in key battleground states like Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Nevada. As a sign of the high stakes over control of the Senate, a report out this week by the Sunlight Foundation says that outside groups spent a whopping $190 million on Senate races as of October 23. Key senate race snapshots Compiled by Adam Levy and Robert Yoon, CNN Political Research Arizona: Rep. Jeff Flake (R) vs. Richard Carmona (D) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Jon Kyl (R) is retiring This race has turned more competitive than originally expected. Democratic nominee Dr. Richard Carmona, a Vietnam veteran and a former U.S. Surgeon General under President George W. Bush, has proven a formidable opponent to six-term Rep. Jeff Flake, whose tough August primary for the GOP nomination left him bruised as he began the general election. Tightening polls caused both campaigns to go negative with Flake accusing Carmona of having anger issues over an incident in which a former HHS official accused him of banging on her door in the middle of the night and scaring her family (Carmona denies the incident ever occurred). Carmona accuses Flake of not supporting veterans as a congressman (Flake says Carmona is cherry-picking votes and not looking at his entire record). Democrats think their candidate\u2019s strengths and the state\u2019s growing Hispanic population will lead to their party\u2019s first successful Senate election since 1988. But Republicans point to no significant changes in Hispanic voting records, Flake\u2019s endorsements from Sens. Kyl and John McCain, and the state\u2019s traditional GOP support as reasons for a Flake victory. California: Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) vs. Elizabeth Emken (R) Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein should easily win a fourth full term this November. Her GOP opponent is Elizabeth Emken, a former vice president for government relations at Autism Speaks. Connecticut: Rep. Chris Murphy (D) vs. Linda McMahon (R) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I) is retiring After waging a competitive but ultimately unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate in 2010, former wrestling executive Linda McMahon is making a strong comeback this year. Buoyed by the millions of her own money she invested in the campaign, McMahon\u2019s made an effort to soften her image with ads about her personal life and combat attacks from third-term Rep. Chris Murphy. Despite McMahon\u2019s significant financial advantage, Murphy is polling even or ahead of his opponent. In a state where President Barack Obama won by more than 20 points in 2008, a tie in the polls going into Election Day could mean a Murphy win on the president\u2019s coattails. This is a tough state for Republicans in federal office. The last Connecticut Republican to hold a U.S. Senate seat left office in 1989. Delaware: Sen. Tom Carper (D) vs. Kevin Wade (R) Democrat Tom Carper has a clear path to winning a third term in November. He faces Republican businessman Kevin Wade. Florida: Sen. Bill Nelson (D) vs. Rep. Connie Mack IV (R) Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson\u2019s bid for a third term hasn\u2019t generated the competitive buzz originally expected in one of the most important presidential battleground states. Nelson\u2019s lead over four-term Rep. Connie Mack IV held steady throughout most of the campaign, though recent polls show Mack closing the gap. TV ads from the candidates and outside groups have driven the race heavily, with less campaigning than usually seen in a U.S. Senate race in the Sunshine State on both sides. There was just one hour-long debate. Mack\u2019s poll numbers have improved as Romney\u2019s numbers have gone up in the state. Hawaii:Rep. Mazie Hirono (D) vs. Former Gov. Linda Lingle (R) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Daniel Akaka (D) is retiring Republicans fielded their best possible candidate in former Gov. Linda Lingle, but their hopes of upsetting third-term Rep. Mazie Hirono in this heavily Democratic state are fading. Lingle, a popular former governor and formidable fundraiser, beat Hirono in the 2002 gubernatorial race, but in a presidential year the state\u2019s Democratic tilt and presence of a native son president heading the other party\u2019s ticket may be too much to overcome. Regardless of who wins, the state will elect its first female U.S. senator. If Hirono wins, she\u2019ll become the first Asian-American woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Indiana: Richard Mourdock (R) vs. Rep. Joe Donnelly (D) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Richard Lugar (R) was defeated in the primary When six-term Republican Sen. Richard Lugar lost a bitter primary race to state treasurer Richard Mourdock, Democrats gained an unexpected opportunity to take over the seat with three-term Rep. Joe Donnelly. Though Indiana is a Republican-leaning state, the polls have been close and some longtime Lugar supporters still haven\u2019t rallied behind the GOP nominee. Democrats pounded Mourdock for his comment at a debate two weeks before Election Day that \u201ceven when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, it is something that God intended.\u201d Mourdock the next day clarified his comment and added, \u201cRape is a horrible thing, and for anyone to twist my words otherwise is absurd and sick.\u201d The full impact of the flap remains to be seen. Donnelly, a relatively conservative Democrat who opposes abortion rights, was one of few red-state Democrats to survive the Republican onslaught of 2010. He has kept the race competitive, but even with the Mourdock comments, Donnelly faces a Republican-friendly electorate and won\u2019t get much help from the top of the ticket. Maine: Charlie Summers (R) vs. Cynthia Dill (D) vs. former Gov. Angus King (I) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Olympia Snowe (R) is retiring The unexpected retirement of three-term Sen. Olympia Snowe has set the stage for a three-way contest between Democratic state senator Cynthia Dill, Republican Secretary of State Charlie Summers and former Gov. Angus King, an independent. King, who quickly rose to frontrunner status, has declined to state until after the election which party he would caucus with in the Senate, though he is widely assumed to align with Democrats. The former governor has endorsements from the Human Rights Campaign, environmental groups and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s new super PAC, which supports gay rights, gun restrictions, and education reform. The national Democratic party has not actively supported Dill but instead has run ads hammering Summers. The national Republicans focused much of their ad fire on King, with the hope that he and Dill will split enough of the anti-Republican vote to ensure a Summers victory. King was at 50% in a poll in mid-September. Maryland: Sen. Ben Cardin (D) vs. Daniel Bongino (R) Democrat Ben Cardin should easily beat former Secret Service agent Daniel Bongino for a second term in the U.S. Senate. Massachusetts: Sen. Scott Brown (R) vs. Elizabeth Warren (D) Massachusetts is perhaps the one race that has lived up to all its hype and more. As Republican Sen. Scott Brown competes for a full term against Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, the race for the state\u2019s few remaining undecided voters has taken a sharp tone. Brown launched harsh attacks questioning Warren\u2019s claims of Native-American heritage while also highlighting his own bipartisanship in the Senate. Warren continues to attack Brown for protecting millionaires and for vowing to repeal Obamacare while highlighting her advocacy for the middle class and women\u2019s issues. Democrats hope the president\u2019s popularity and expected wide margin of victory in Romney\u2019s home state will counter Brown\u2019s popularity to make Warren the first woman to represent Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate. Michigan: Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D) vs. Former Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R) Though Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow appeared vulnerable at the beginning of the year in her bid for a third term, her fundraising and poll numbers quickly rose while Republicans searched for a candidate. Winning a four-way primary was former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, who lost a 2010 primary bid for governor. President Barack Obama\u2019s popularity, in part due to the auto bailout along with the declining unemployment rate (above the national average, but down about 2 points from January 2009) gives Democrats reason to breathe easier in the Wolverine State. Minnesota: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D) vs. Kurt Bills (R) Democrat Amy Klobuchar is expected to sail to a second term in November. She faces Republican state representative Kurt Bills. Mississippi: Sen. Roger Wicker (R) vs. Albert N. Gore, Jr. (D) Republican Roger Wicker should easily win his bid for a full term. He was appointed in 2007 and won a special election in 2008 to finish out the remainder of Trent Lott\u2019s term. He faces Democrat Albert N. Gore Jr., who is not a former vice president \u2013 he\u2019s an octogenarian retired minister and ex-Green Beret. Missouri: Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) vs. Rep. Todd Akin (R) Plagued by scandals and a conservative electorate, Democrat Claire McCaskill seemed likely to become a one-term senator. That was until her opponent, six-term Republican Rep. Todd Akin, said in a local news interview that women have biological ways to avoid pregnancy after a \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d With a second wind to her campaign, McCaskill pounced as her poll numbers rose and Akin\u2019s dropped. Akin refused to drop out of the race despite requests from the GOP establishment. Some conservatives, including Jim DeMint, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, rallied behind him. Other Republicans kept their distance, though some have come back around out of strong desire to unseat McCaskill. With a lead over Akin, McCaskill sought to solidify her candidacy for a second term by running ads with female Republican rape survivors planning to vote for her because of Akin\u2019s comments. Missouri is still a competitive state for any Democrat, but unless local Republicans come back to Akin in droves, McCaskill appears headed to win a second term. Montana: Sen. Jon Tester (D) vs. Rep. Dennis Rehberg (R) Democrat Jon Tester knew he\u2019d have an uphill battle to a second term against six-term Rep. Denny Rehberg. Both are known quantities with high favorables in the state, though neither has been able to crack 50% in the polls. Both campaigns have gone negative in the fight over Social Security, and both say the other is distorting their views. Like the Massachusetts race, there are few undecideds left, except here Republicans are hoping that works in their favor. Though the state has a history of voting for Democrats statewide along with a Republican for president, Barack Obama\u2019s disapproval ratings could drive the strong GOP turnout Rehberg needs to move up a chamber in Congress. Nebraska: Former Sen. Bob Kerrey (D) vs. Deb Fischer (R) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Ben Nelson (D) is retiring Republicans began eyeing two-term Democrat Ben Nelson\u2019s seat even before he announced his retirement. With Nelson out, Democrats pinned their hopes on Bob Kerrey, the former governor and two-term senator. Although a well-known figure in Nebraska, Kerrey spent most of his post-Senate career outside of the state, primarily in New York City where he served as president of The New School. The conservative super PAC American Crossroads began running ads against Kerrey before he even declared his candidacy. The Republican nominee is state Rep. Deb Fischer, who scored a surprising win in a crowded GOP primary. Kerrey has an uphill battle to keep the seat blue; Fischer has been leading with at least 50% in both independent and partisan polls. Nevada: Sen. Dean Heller (R) vs. Rep. Shelley Berkley (D) Democrats\u2019 strength in Nevada is being put to the test once again in a Senate election. With voter registration numbers on their side, seven-term Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley hopes to deny Republican Sen. Dean Heller a full Senate term (Heller was appointed to the seat after Republican John Ensign resigned). A House ethics investigation and a lackluster debate performance have kept Berkley below Heller in the most recent polls. Heller\u2019s strong fundraising ability also helped him keep the advantage in a state with a heavy Latino population that overwhelmingly votes Democratic. Both parties are hoping for a win here, though the race should remain close through Election Day.  Turnout for the presidential race could have the largest impact on the outcome of this race. New Jersey: Sen. Robert Menendez (D) vs. Joe Kyrillos (R) Democrat Bob Menendez is expected to win a second term easily. He faces Republican state Sen. Joe Kyrillos. New Mexico: Rep. Martin Heinrich (D) vs. former Rep. Heather Wilson (R) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D) is retiring Republicans were initially hopeful that Democratic incumbent Jeff Bingaman\u2019s decision to retire presented a pickup opportunity. Their nominee, former Rep. Heather Wilson, has a reputation for being a moderate in this increasingly Democratic-leaning state, but she lost a bruising Senate primary four years ago and has had difficulty getting her footing against Democratic nominee Martin Heinrich, a two-term congressman. The two have been evenly matched in both fundraising and candidate-sponsored TV ads. However, according to ad spending data from the Campaign Media Analysis Group, the Democratic party and outside groups began pulling their ads in this race three months ago and most Republican groups have since followed suit, a sign that race was becoming less competitive.  Both independent and partisan polling since the summer has shown Wilson stuck in the low 40s, with Heinrich leading by various margins. Wilson also cannot rely on a competitive presidential race at the top of the ticket to help boost turnout in her favor. Heinrich enters the final stretch with a clear advantage. New York: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D) vs. Wendy Long (R) Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand should easily win her first full term to the Senate. She faces attorney Wendy Long, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. North Dakota: Heidi Heitkamp (D) vs. Rep. Rick Berg (R) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Kent Conrad (D) is retiring Former state Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp gives Democrats their best opportunity to keep the seat of retiring five-term Sen. Kent Conrad. Republicans hope first-term Rep. Rick Berg will repeat the party\u2019s success of 2010, when they took over retiring Democrat Byron Dorgan\u2019s seat. The state has a history of split-ticket voting, giving Heitkamp an opportunity to show her independence from national Democrats. She\u2019s publicly disagreed with Barack Obama on issues like energy, which she points to as evidence she won\u2019t be a rubber stamp. She enjoys high favorables and solid support from Republican ticket-splitters and has hammered Berg for his connection to a controversial real estate company. With the lowest unemployment rate in the country, North Dakotans have their choice between two candidates with strong statewide appeal. This race will remain close until Election Day. Ohio: Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) vs. Josh Mandel (R) Amid the backdrop of what is arguably the nation\u2019s most competitive presidential battleground contest, first-term Senate incumbent Sherrod Brown hopes to prove that the Democratic wave that helped carry him into office in 2006 wasn\u2019t a fluke. Brown, who has a voting record the National Journal classified as one of the most liberal in the Senate, made a ripe target for Republicans looking for a pickup opportunity. But in the home stretch of the 2012 campaign, Ohio remains conspicuously off the list of the most vulnerable Democratic-held seats. The Republican nominee is Josh Mandel, the 35-year-old state treasurer and Marine Corps veteran. Mandel has kept pace with Brown in terms of fundraising, but he continues to trail the incumbent by around 10 points in several independent polls from September and October. Brown is far from having the race sewn up, especially with the daily volatility at the top of the ticket, but he has a leg up as the race enters its final days. Pennsylvania: Sen. Bob Casey (D) vs. Tom Smith (R) Recent polls have given Republicans hope where they previously had little. As Democratic Sen. Bob Casey\u2019s lead over Republican businessman Tom Smith began to tighten, the incumbent began actively campaigning across the state \u2013 something he previously hadn\u2019t been doing. Though Republicans have an opening now, Casey still enters the final stretch with the advantage. The state has not emerged as a contested presidential battleground and a strong showing by Barack Obama here could help Casey beat back this unexpected and late-breaking challenge. Rhode Island: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D) vs. Barry Hinckley (R) Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse is a safe bet to win a second term in November. He faces Republican businessman Barry Hinckley. Tennessee: Sen. Bob Corker (R) vs. Mark Clayton (D) Unlike the tough battle he had in 2006 to take the seat, Republican Bob Corker should easily win a second term in November. He faces Democrat Mark Clayton, whose candidacy has been disavowed by the Tennessee Democratic Party for his involvement with an anti-gay rights group. Texas: Ted Cruz (R) vs. Paul Sadler (D) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R) is retiring After a tough primary victory over the candidate endorsed by Gov. Rick Perry and the state party establishment, Republican nominee Ted Cruz, the former state solicitor general, is now heavily favored this November in his race against Democratic nominee Paul Sadler, a former state representative. Utah: Sen. Orrin Hatch (R) vs. Scott Howell (D) Republican Orrin Hatch learned an important lesson from his former colleague Sen. Bob Bennett in 2010 \u2013 don\u2019t take the Republican nomination for granted. Hatch campaigned early and hard to win the GOP nomination over tea party favorite Dan Liljenquist, a former state senator. Hatch now is the overwhelming favorite to win a seventh term in November. A Democrat hasn\u2019t represented Utah in the U.S. Senate in 36 years. Vermont: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) vs. John MacGovern (R) Independent Bernie Sanders, the Senate\u2019s only self-described socialist, is expected to sail to a second term over Republican John MacGovern, a former Massachusetts state representative and unsuccessful congressional candidate. Virgina: Former Gov. Tim Kaine (D) vs. former Gov./Sen. George Allen (R) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Jim Webb (D) is retiring Republican George Allen is fighting hard to win back the seat he lost six years ago to now-retiring Democratic Sen. Jim Webb. A strong Democratic wave, along with a gaffe caught on tape that became infamous on YouTube, stripped Allen of what was expected to be his second term (and perhaps a launching pad to the 2008 GOP presidential nomination). He now faces Democratic nominee Tim Kaine, another former governor, in one of the marquee Senate races of 2012. Polls remain close. Barack Obama\u2019s win in Virginia in 2008 and the strong play he\u2019s making for the state in 2012 have given Kaine organizational support. Allen has run ads linking Kaine, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee at the start of the Obama administration, to the president and to looming budget  cuts. Kaine, in turn, has run ads tying Allen to George W. Bush\u2019s economic policies and that he\u2019s wrong on women\u2019s issues. Both candidates have seen their leads grow and shrink with the presidential candidates. It\u2019s very likely the winner of the Senate seat will be a member of the same party of the presidential candidate who wins Virginia\u2019s 13 electoral votes. Washington: Sen. Maria Cantwell (D) vs. Michael Baumgartner (R) Democrat Maria Cantwell is expected to win a third term in November. She faces Republican state Sen. Michael Baumgartner. West Virginia: Sen. Joe Manchin (D) vs. John Raese (R) No, we did not forget to update this section from 2010. Democrat Joe Manchin once again faces Republican businessman John Raese in the contest to win his first full term. Manchin has proven his independence from the president and faces a much easier race this time to win in November. Wisconsin: Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D) vs. former Gov. Tommy Thompson (R) Open seat \u2013 Sen. Herb Kohl (D) is retiring Former Gov. Tommy Thompson won a tough Republican primary to take on seven-term Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin for retiring incumbent Herb Kohl\u2019s Senate seat. Thompson\u2019s attacks on Baldwin as being too liberal haven\u2019t had the impact he was hoping. The polls are very close, but Baldwin has pulled slightly ahead recently, though not outside the margin of error. Unless vice presidential candidate and native son Paul Ryan brings out strong turnout for the party, the state\u2019s historic Democratic tilt in presidential elections could help Baldwin succeed to becoming the first openly gay senator. Wyoming: Sen. John Barrasso (R) vs. Tim Chesnut (D) Republican John Barrasso is expected to win a second term in November. He faces Democratic nominee Tim Chesnut, an Albany County commissioner. ",

Right after the winner is announced, somebody somewhere in America will fall on their knees and pray, \u201cThank you Jesus.\u201d And somebody somewhere else will moan, \u201cHelp us Jesus.\u201d But what Jesus will they be praying to: a red state Jesus or a blue state Jesus? If elections are about choices, so is faith. And in Christianity, liberals and conservatives choose to see Jesus in different ways. Some liberals see Jesus as a champion of the poor who would support raising taxes on the wealthy, while some conservatives think Jesus would be more concerned with opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. Good luck to anyone who tries reconciling their Jesus with the biblical accounts of his life. Even Jesus\u2019 earliest followers clashed over who he was and what he meant. \u201cJesus didn\u2019t leave clear instructions,\u201d says Molly Worthern, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who specializes in religious history. \u201cHe was a man who said many things that were quite cryptic.

            "article_content": "A battleground state, Iowa with its six electoral votes may be key in the presidential election One in three Iowans call themselves Catholics or evangelicals Mitt Romney has had challenges in Iowa because of his history on social issues President Barack Obama, who won Iowa in 2008, may have a tough time doing it again From church pews to cheeseburger joints, Iowa\u2019s faithful are a major prize in the political ground war raging between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Of the roughly 3 million Iowans, about 30% call themselves evangelical or Catholic. Fifty-seven percent of Iowans who voted in the caucuses this year were evangelical Christians. Evangelicals overwhelmingly supported Rick Santorum over Romney in the Iowa caucuses, helping Santorum squeeze out a slight victory in the final count. In Des Moines, evangelical Christians flock to Grace Church, affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, to talk faith, family and the presidential election. The evangelical voters we met strongly supported Romney, but they also expressed a general unease about his moderate history on social issues such as abortion. Iowans worry about the bigger picture Battleground Iowa: Can Obama swing it? Starting where Obama's presidency began Campaign attacks still fly after storm Obama, Romney paths to victory cross in Iowa \u201cHis (Romney\u2019s) past positions in terms of abortion or in terms of his record in Massachusetts \u2013 it\u2019s not been an easy choice to make either way,\u201d Mwasi Mwamba said. Mwamba said he has no party affiliation and voted early. His wife, Dawn, plans to vote for Romney but said her religious beliefs don\u2019t align with either candidate. \u201cI have to look at it, though I hate saying it this way, as the lesser of two evils if you will.\u201d The Undecided Evangelical: Radical for Jesus, dubious of Romney Sheri Hess described herself as having a \u201cbiblical worldview.\u201d Hess plans to vote for Romney this year but admitted his record on social issues concerns her. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely not a Christian in my view,\u201d she said when asked if Romney\u2019s Mormon faith plays into her vote. But she said she thinks he supports the Christian beliefs she holds dear. One evangelical voter not supporting Romney is Mike Pike. He won\u2019t vote for either candidate \u2013 he\u2019s not casting a ballot in a presidential election for the first time in his life. Pike said the two non-negotiable issues for him are abortion and the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman. Ohio: Overwhelmed by ads Obama and Romney, he said, have \u201cfailed on both of those.\u201d \u201cWhat a person says and what they do, when they\u2019re two different things, I have to go by what they\u2019ve done so therefore I can\u2019t support either candidate in this election.\u201d In December, ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Steve Scheffler, president of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, said the Romney campaign \u201chas a very deliberate plan to snub social conservatives.\u201d But this week in Des Moines, he had changed his tune, saying Romney has \u201cproved that he has tried to make that outreach to social conservatives and economic conservatives and he\u2019s done a good job in Iowa.\u201d For Catholic voters, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve had a choice between two tickets \u2013 each with a Catholic on it. Battleground Blog: A deeper look inside the swing states In traditionally democratic Dubuque, some Catholic voters are split over issues such as abortion, funding for contraception and same-sex marriage. They disagree on how best to help the poor \u2013 through government-run social programs or private charity. \u201c(There are) the life issues which most Catholics hold dear and central to their faith, but then there\u2019s this belief that remains that the Democratic Party somehow cares for the poor better. I think it somehow comes down to that tension,\u201d said Dawn Luekin, a Catholic voter and member of St. Joseph the Worker parish in Dubuque. She\u2019s a fervid opponent of abortion, as is her mother, Ellen Markham, who said the top issues for her in this election are \u201clife and sanctity of marriage.\u201d Both support Romney. Quiz: Which Jesus do you believe in? At the Village Inn restaurant in Dubuque, Jenni, a Catholic voter and Obama supporter who didn\u2019t want to share her last name, said she was concerned about backlash from co-workers. She cast an early vote for Obama this year. She\u2019s pro-abortion rights and calls it one of the top issues for her in this election but maintains her religion does not affect her vote. 10 things you didn\u2019t know about Iowa Sue, a practicing Catholic who also declined to give her last name, was eating a cheeseburger when we chatted with her at the Village Inn. She said it is hard to reconcile abortion with her religious beliefs but said she is supporting Obama. \u201cI can\u2019t bring myself to just vote on that one issue.\u201d But for Caroline Koppes, who is Catholic and an Obama campaign volunteer in Dubuque, it\u2019s clear-cut. \u201cI just think we have got to get out of the bedrooms, and if we\u2019re against big government and we are knocking on the doors of every bedroom that is ridiculous.\u201d Romney\u2019s vision for America Then there are the coveted undecided voters, such as retiree Lois Nilles. She\u2019s fed up with the partisan bickering in Washington. She said she thinks Obama has done a \u201cfairly good job\u201d considering tough opposition from Republicans in Congress, but as a practicing Catholic she is bothered by his abortion-rights stance. Obama\u2019s vision for America Complicating the president\u2019s relationship with Catholics in an election year, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has been vocal in its opposition of the Obama administration\u2019s rule requiring health insurers to provide free contraceptive coverage. Catholic teaching opposes contraception and considers some methods of contraception to be tantamount to abortion. Nationwide, Obama won 54% of the Catholic vote in 2008 and 26% of the evangelical vote, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. Those religious votes are key in Iowa \u2013 a battleground state with six electoral votes \u2013 or as folks here call it, a \u201cpurple state.\u201d Election campaign ends with chess match in swing states",

            "article_content": "Iowa is small in electoral votes but could be huge in determining election Obama campaign turns rallies into turn-out-the-vote manpower drives Both campaigns outpacing 2008 early voting efforts Both Romney and Obama will campaign in the state three days before election As the presidential race enters its final days, Iowa stands out as a question mark on the electoral map. Strategists in both parties express confidence about winning the state and its six electoral votes, but few on either side are willing to guarantee a victory. President Barack Obama won Iowa by almost 10 percentage points in 2008. But there is agreement here that the outcome is likely to be decided by just a few thousand votes, as it was in 2004, when President George W. Bush won the state, and 2000, when Al Gore won. Battleground Iowa: Evangelical, Catholic voters may swing state A new Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist poll out Thursday showed Obama leading Mitt Romney by six points, but even Democrats admit that spread seems a bit optimistic. That the Iowa race is coming down to a game of inches befits a state known for its intensely local brand of politics. In Iowa, a state with just over 2 million registered voters, the little things still matter: small-town newspaper ads, person-to-person contact, radio spots that can be heard inside the cab of a John Deere. In some ways, the Iowa race is a microcosm of the national one, a test of whether the fearsome Obama political operation can cobble together the votes to blunt a late-breaking spurt of enthusiasm for Romney heading into Election Day. Getting religion in Iowa Connecting past elections with present The Heartland important for election Polls show an Obama edge in Iowa, New Hampshire and Wisconsin First lady Michelle Obama punctuated the tightness of the Iowa campaign on Monday at a campaign rally in Iowa City as she delivered a lengthy get-out-the-vote plea to about 800 denizens of the liberal college town. Her husband\u2019s 140,000-vote margin of victory in 2008, she explained, was the equivalent of roughly 87 votes per precinct. \u201cSo 87 votes,\u201d the first lady said. \u201cThat could mean just one vote on a block, just a couple votes in a neighborhood, just a single vote in an apartment building or a dorm room. \u201cSo I want you to think about just a few more evenings on a phone bank, just a few more hours talking on doors,\u201d she urged the crowd. \u201cYou in this room alone can swing an entire precinct for Barack Obama. And if we win enough precincts we will win this state.\u201d Mining crowds for votes and manpower At the rally\u2019s conclusion, campaign volunteers marched a modest-sized group of audience members across the street to an early voting location inside the Iowa City Public Library, where they could register on the spot and cast their ballot. The tactic of mining crowds for votes and manpower is an Obama campaign maneuver that dates back to the 2008 campaign, and staffers continue to use it to great effect. A last-minute President Bill Clinton appearance in Council Bluffs on Wednesday drew 600 supporters, and the campaign promptly signed up 150 of them to work get-out-the-vote shifts on Election Day. Campaign officials say their organizational presence around the state, with neighborhood teams embedded in tiny rural communities like Cresco (population 3,868) and Clarinda (population 5,572), gives them the power to hunt down low propensity voters in a way Romney\u2019s ad hoc field operation cannot. Inside the polls: Obama\u2019s slim lead comes from women, cities As in other key states, the Romney campaign in Iowa is relying on the Republican National Committee to manage its get-out-the-vote program. \u201cAll along we\u2019ve believed having one-on-one conversations with voters will have an impact, because they do cut through the clutter,\u201d said Brad Anderson, the Obama campaign\u2019s state director in Iowa. \u201cIn the last couple weeks, the television airwaves are a mess, the mailboxes are full. It\u2019s these conversations that we have with voters in every part of the state, in rural Iowa, that the Romney campaign does not have the capacity to do.\u201d Democrats in Des Moines also snickered at a Politico item this week that quoted a Romney official boasting that the \u201cBranstad operation\u201d \u2013 that would be Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad \u2013 would help propel them to victory. Branstad\u2019s circle of advisers is well-regarded inside the Capitol building, and his approval rating is north of 50%, but the Republican governor does not have any kind of vaunted political machine at his disposal. \u201cThis mythical operation can\u2019t even organize his own state party,\u201d cracked one senior Iowa Democrat. \u201cRomney better have a plan B.\u201d Back on stump, Romney aims for right tone Democrats point to early voting advantage Obama field organizers point to early voting returns as a clear sign of their political prowess. Early voting started in Iowa on September 27. So far, Democrats have banked more early votes than at this point in 2008. And through Tuesday, Democrats had cast roughly 60,000 more in-person and absentee ballots than Republicans. That\u2019s the same margin Democrats had at this time four years ago. Even though Sen. John McCain defeated Obama among voters who cast ballots on Election Day, a third of Iowans had already voted by the time the polls opened \u2013 and most of them had voted for Obama. Obama\u2019s vision for America Republicans claim that Democrats need to rack up an even bigger early vote tally this year because Election Day voters and independents are likely to break for Romney in greater numbers than they did for McCain. Like Democrats, Republicans are outperforming their 2008 early vote totals, and Romney officials in Boston and Washington point out that more Republicans have voted early this year than in 2004, when Bush had a famously mobilized conservative base behind him. But Republicans in Iowa wave off squabbles about vote tallies and make a simpler argument: Organization is no match for enthusiasm, and the currents have been moving in Romney\u2019s direction for weeks. Republicans working on other state races say their internal polling shows movement toward Romney that began after the first debate on October 3 and has climbed steadily ever since. Kraig Paulsen, the Iowa House Republican leader, said Romney\u2019s poll numbers have perked up in almost every one of the competitive statehouse districts he is monitoring. Obama takes in damage with Christie \u2018I\u2019m seeing Gov. Romney picking up speed\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m seeing Gov. Romney picking up speed in these races I am watching,\u201d said Paulsen, who is presiding over the GOP effort to recapture control of the lower chamber. \u201cThe low point in my data was somewhere around the start of the month, but since then it\u2019s just been a solid trajectory coming up.\u201d The turnaround in Romney\u2019s fortunes is eye-opening. After sewing up the Republican nomination last spring following a trying primary battle, Romney was in dismal shape in Iowa. Most surveys showed Obama maintaining a comfortable lead over his rival throughout the spring and summer. By late summer and early fall, Republicans here were settling in for an all-but-certain defeat and looking to refocus their efforts on a slate of down-ballot campaigns, particularly the two competitive House races in Iowa\u2019s newly drawn third and fourth Congressional districts. Romney\u2019s vision for America A Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist poll released September 20 painted a grim portrait for the Republican nominee. Half of the state\u2019s likely voters had an unfavorable opinion of Romney, and more than a third of evangelicals viewed him negatively. He trailed Obama by 10 points among independents, and by a staggering 18-point margin among women. The dynamic changed dramatically, as it did in every battleground state, after Romney\u2019s shining debate performance in Denver. Bob Vander Plaats, one of the state\u2019s leading evangelical voices who has often feuded with Iowa\u2019s Republican establishment, said he finally cast an early vote for Romney sometime after the second presidential debate. Vander Plaats, who sided with Rick Santorum in the Iowa caucuses, said it took several months for Romney and his campaign advisers to soothe conservative Christian anxieties about the candidate\u2019s convictions on the issues of abortion and same-sex marriage. Vander Plaats had a July conference call with three Romney officials in Boston to talk through some of his concerns. \u201cThey said they were taking our issues seriously,\u201d he said. Michigan poll: Obama 48% \u2013 Romney 42% Ryan selection helps with state\u2019s evangelicals Romney\u2019s selection of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, a fervent abortion opponent, as his running mate helped stir support among evangelicals in the western part of the state and conservatives Catholics in the east. The debate finally crystallized the choice for grassroots conservatives, who will show up without hesitation on Election Day, Vander Plaats said. \u201cThere is no doubt that I wasn\u2019t the biggest Romney fan, but campaigns come down to choices, and I believe he is the much better choice in this campaign than Barack Obama,\u201d he said. Republicans expect to lose the early vote but are planning to run up the score next Tuesday in the new fourth congressional district, where conservative icon Steve King has organized a dedicated network of volunteers in his race against Democrat Christie Vilsack. Romney also hopes to cut into Obama\u2019s natural base of support in the working class counties and cities along the Mississippi River, where the president sailed to victory four years ago. Yard signs are an imprecise way to measure enthusiasm, and some campaign operatives consider them a waste of money. But it is possible to make the drive from Des Moines to Dubuque, a 200-mile stretch of farmland along interstate 80 and highway 151 that was painted Obama-blue in the 2008 election, without seeing a single Obama sign or poster. Romney signs, meanwhile, frequently dot the landscape. In his two Republican caucus campaigns, Romney concentrated much of his efforts on these eastern counties, where pocketbook concerns often outweigh social issues. The battle for those votes will come into full view on Saturday, when both Romney and Obama are set to campaign in Dubuque, a predominantly Catholic city perched on the banks of the Mississippi where an old reliance on manufacturing has given way to thriving health care and financial services sectors. Obama clobbered McCain in Dubuque County in 2008, but like everywhere else in Iowa, the path to victory next Tuesday will be much narrower. Poll: Obama leads in Wisconsin",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Barack Obama tours New Jersey storm damage NEW: Mitt Romney tones down rhetoric at campaign events in Florida Surrogates and supporters of Obama and Romney continue attacks The November 6 election is considered too close to call Will the devastation of Superstorm Sandy tone down the hostile rhetoric of the presidential campaign? The answer Wednesday was yes, at least by President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney, who left it to surrogates and others to do the political dirty work. Obama avoided any overt political statements when he toured storm damage in New Jersey with Republican Gov. Chris Christie, a frequent critic who has praised the president\u2019s response to the disaster. His comments at the end of the trip focused on the federal response, but concluded with a theme from Obama\u2019s campaign stump speech about Americans working together to help each other. \u201cWe go through tough times, but we bounce back,\u201d the president said at the North Point Marina in Brigantine. \u201cWe bounce back because we look out for one another, and we don\u2019 t leave anybody behind.\u201d Is it too soon to restart campaigns? Obama also made sure his role in the federal response to the disaster was well publicized. How Romney, Obama adjust to storm Romney: Storm will be a 'difficult time' Before heading to New Jersey, he visited the Federal Emergency Management Agency to meet with officials coordinating federal efforts. After his tour, Obama spoke of a 15-minute rule he imposed that requires federal relief officials to respond for calls for help from local authorities within that time period, adding that \u201cif they need something, you figure out a way to say yes.\u201d Romney campaigns in Florida At his first bona fide campaign events since Sandy blasted the East Coast earlier this week, Romney focused his remarks on his oft-repeated five-point plan to increase domestic energy, expand trade, improve education and training, balance the budget and help small businesses. He included some muted zingers, telling crowds in Tampa and Coral Gables that \u201cI don\u2019t just talk about change,\u201d a reference to what he has previously called Obama\u2019s failure to deliver on the \u201chope and change\u201d theme from 2008. Romney\u2019s main message was the need to change the direction of the country from the chronic deficits and mounting debt of past years, saying the country required leaders who worked \u201cin the interests of people\u201d instead of seeking political gain. A Romney spokesman told reporters the more positive stance by the former Massachusetts governor was planned. \u201cOur focus today is going to continue to be to strike a positive tone about what the governor would do on Day One of a Romney presidency,\u201d said campaign adviser Kevin Madden. While Romney never mentioned Obama by name, some backers who spoke before him in Coral Gables were less reticent to attack. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush asked if  \u201cyou honestly think that this president is capable of bringing people together,\u201d then said Obama\u2019s campaign strategy \u201cis to blame others, starting with my brother\u201d \u2013 former President George W. Bush, who preceded Obama in the White House. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida raised the issue of a terrorist attack in Libya on September 11 that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, complaining Obama was \u201cnowhere to be found\u201d to answer questions about what happened. Conservative commentators allege a White House cover-up because some top officials, including U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, initially indicated a protest over an anti-Islam film spawned the deadly attack. The Obama administration denies any attempt to mislead, saying initial intelligence reports were conflicting, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has appointed a panel to review what happened. On the Democratic side, Vice President Joe Biden kept up his steady political attacks on the Republican ticket. At an event in Sarasota, Florida, Biden called Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, \u201cshameless\u201d and accused them of running \u201cone of the most flagrantly dishonest ads I can ever remember in my political career\u201d in reference to a television spot that claims Chrysler was shifting Jeep manufacturing from the United States to China. Officials of the company have declared the Romney ad incorrect, saying manufacturing abroad was an expansion of operations in the United States, rather than outsourcing. \u201cIt\u2019s an outrageous lie,\u201d Biden said, adding the Romney ad caused U.S. autoworkers to call their union offices asking if it was true manufacturing jobs were transferred abroad.  \u201cWhat a cynical, cynical thing to do \u2026 to go out and try to scare these people for electoral reasons at the end, to say something that\u2019s so untrue.\u201d When asked about Biden\u2019s comment, Madden of the Romney campaign said the ad \u201cmakes the case for why Gov. Romney would be stronger for the auto industry and why the auto industry\u2019s an important part of a strong economy.\u201d Ryan also addressed the issue at an appearance in Wisconsin, noting that the federal bailout of the auto industry resulted in plants shutting down \u2013 including some in the state. \u201cAmerican taxpayers are on track to lose $25 billion as a result of President Obama\u2019s handling of the auto bailout, and GM and Chrysler are expanding their production overseas,\u201d Ryan said in an earlier statement. Obama will return to full campaign mode on Thursday with events in Wisconsin, Colorado and Nevada \u2013 all still up for grabs and therefore crucial to both candidates. His intention Wednesday was to project the image of a president focused on the well-being of fellow citizens in need. After flying over parts of the Jersey shoreline and other areas, Obama and Christie met with displaced people in a shelter and later walked through damaged neighborhoods in an entourage that included the state\u2019s two Democratic senators - Frank Lautenberg and Bob Menendez. On Tuesday, Christie praised Obama as \u201coutstanding\u201d and \u201cincredibly supportive\u201d in responding to Sandy, a radical change from the political attacks the Republican usually launches in his role as a top surrogate for Romney. The governor repeated his complimentary tone while with Obama on  Wednesday, saying: \u201cI cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and the people of our state.\u201d Hard-hitting attacks from candidate supporters Meanwhile, supporters of the candidates continued hard-hitting attacks. Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing Obama, announced a new ad accusing Romney and former Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a fellow Republican, of benefiting from Medicare fraud. \u201cWhile Romney served as a director of the Damon Corporation, the company stole $25 million from Medicare,\u201d said a release by Priorities USA Action, attributing the information to a Boston Globe report from 2002. \u201cRomney made half a million dollars - some of the profit generated by the fraud. Rick Scott was CEO of the company that committed what was the largest Medicare fraud in history.\u201d The group also said Romney plans to cut funding for Medicare and change it to a voucher system that would increase costs for senior citizens. Romney rejects that characterization of a proposal to partially privatize the government-run health care system for elderly Americans. There was no immediate response from the Romney campaign to the super-PAC ad. Florida, with 29 electoral votes, is the biggest haul available from the battleground states still contested, and Medicare is a major issue there because of the large number of senior citizens who live there. For its part, the Romney campaign revived a widely-discredited welfare claim in a new television ad that cited the \u201cgutting\u201d of the work requirement in welfare by Obama. An earlier string of ads making a similar claim was rated as \u201cPants on Fire\u201d \u2013 or completely false \u2013 by the independent and non-partisan fact-checking organization PolitiFact. Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith responded that the welfare ad showed desperation by the Romney campaign. Meanwhile, Focus on the Family, the Colorado-based social conservative organization founded by evangelical author and radio host James Dobson, sent a mailing in Iowa that quotes Obama as saying \u201cwe are no longer a Christian nation.\u201d The fold-out brochure, which landed in Iowa mailboxes last week and was provided to CNN by a Des Moines-area voter, drew contrasts between Obama and Romney on the issues of abortion, same-sex marriage and insurance coverage for contraception. \u201cWhatever we once were, we are no longer a Christian nation,\u201d Obama is quoted as saying in the mailer, which does not explicitly endorse Romney. The quote is from a speech Obama delivered in 2006, more than two years before he became president, at the Call to Renewal conference in Washington. In 2008, during Obama\u2019s first national campaign, the same out-of-context remark was circulated online as sinister evidence that the Democrat intended to curtail religious freedom in America. At the time, the spurious Internet chatter was debunked by FactCheck.org, another independent monitoring group. Big ad buys in final week The Obama and Romney campaigns bought $40 million worth of commercials to run this week and into Election Day in key battleground states, according to a source tracking media buys, as spending records continue to be shattered. For ad time running from Monday through the November 6 election, the Obama campaign bought $22.6 million compared to $17.4 million for Romney, according to the media-tracking source. Both campaigns are continuing to purchase additional commercial time as they jockey for any last-minute advantage. In addition, two of the key super PACs backing Romney launched multi million-dollar battleground ad campaigns this week, with many of their ads targeting the president\u2019s economic record. In total the Republican outside groups will have spent more than $310 million in the general election. At Romney\u2019s event in Tampa, Bush sought to downplay Obama\u2019s role in the disaster relief effort, saying \u201cmy experience in all this emergency response business is that it is the local level and the state level that really matters.\u201d \u201cIf they do their job right, the federal government part works out pretty good,\u201d he said. Romney, meanwhile, urged supporters to donate to the Red Cross to help victims of the superstorm without addressing the federal response or Obama\u2019s role. Democratic critics of Romney and Ryan argue their proposals to cut government spending and provide broad tax cuts without generating more government revenue will end up harming the economy and increasing the federal deficit. In particular, the Obama campaign challenges Romney\u2019s contention that increased economic growth from the tax cuts combined with shifting current federal responsibilities to states, the private sector and humanitarian agencies and charities can balance the budget. Last year, Romney argued at a Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire that cutting federal spending should be based on prioritizing what is absolutely necessary and shedding the rest. Asked then by moderator John King of CNN if disaster relief efforts should be turned over to states, Romney said that \u201cevery time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that\u2019s the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that\u2019s even better.\u201d \u201cInstead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut \u2013 we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep?\u201d Romney added. \u201cWe should take all of what we\u2019re doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we\u2019re doing that we don\u2019t have to do? And those things we\u2019ve got to stop doing, because we\u2019re borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we\u2019re taking in.\u201d King cut in to ask if Romney was referring specifically to disaster relief, a topic in the news at the time following a deadly Joplin, Missouri, tornado, and Romney continued: \u201cWe cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we\u2019ll all be dead and gone before it\u2019s paid off. It makes no sense at all.\u201d Sandy response With then-Hurricane Sandy bearing down on the East Coast on Monday, Romney\u2019s debate comments from 16 months earlier became a topic of political discussion. Madden commented on the matter Wednesday, offering a similar statement to what the Romney campaign previously issued. \u201cGov. Romney believes in a very efficient, effective disaster relief response and he believes one of the ways to do that is to put a premium on the states and their efforts to respond to these disasters,\u201d Madden said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they call them first responders. They\u2019re the first to respond in states. So traditionally they\u2019ve been the best at responding to these disasters.  \u2026 But he does believe that FEMA has a really important role there and that being a partner for the states is the best approach.\u201d Obama and the White House have emphasized the cooperation between federal, state and local authorities in responding to Sandy, with the president praising Christie on Wednesday for planning ahead and working with FEMA.. \u201cI thank him for his extraordinary leadership and partnership,\u201d Obama said.. Romney has made political dysfunction in Washington a target of his campaign, blaming Obama for what he calls failed leadership in being unable to forge a deficit reduction deal with Republicans. Democrats blame Republicans for what they contend has been an unwillingness to compromise, and the focus on cooperation by Obama and Biden appeared to be aimed in part at demonstrating the administration\u2019s ability to get things done.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama weighs in on comment by GOP Senate candidate Richard Mourdock: Even when life starts with rape, it is a \"gift from God\" Comments fuel fight to gain women voters in close  presidential race Democrats want Mitt Romney to stop endorsing Mourdock It\u2019s simple, President Obama said. Rape is a crime, and politicians \u2013 especially male politicians \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be \u201cmaking decisions about women\u2019s health care.\u201d Appearing Wednesday on NBC\u2019s \u201cTonight\u201d show, Obama responded to questions by host Jay Leno about a comment about rape by Indiana\u2019s GOP candidate for Senate, Richard Mourdock. Pregnancies occurring after a rape, Mourdock said, were intended by God.\u201cI don\u2019t know how these guys come up with these ideas,\u201d Obama told Leno. \u201cLet me make a very simple proposition: Rape is rape. It is a crime. And so these various distinctions about rape don\u2019t make too much sense to me \u2013 don\u2019t make any sense to me.\u201d Mourdock has apologized for offending anyone. But his words have fueled the national fight to gain women voters in a very close  presidential election. Related: Women voters by the numbers Uproar over Mourdock abortion remarks Santorum defends Mourdock rape comments DNC chair: Women should be concerned Obama: 'Rape is rape' During his chat with Leno, Obama used the Mourdock controversy to say that the next president likely would appoint a new Supreme Court justice who could potentially change federal abortion laws. Obama on Mourdock: Male politicians shouldn\u2019t make abortion decisions Obama\u2019s GOP presidential rival, Mitt Romney, has said he would appoint justices who would support overturning Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 court decision affirming a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion. \u201cRoe vs. Wade is probably hanging in the balance,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWomen are capable of making these decisions in consultation with their partners, with their doctors,\u201d said the president. \u201cAnd for politicians to want to intrude in this stuff often times without any information is a huge problem.\u201d The Obama campaign released a new television ad reinforcing those points, highlighting Romney comments on Roe vs. Wade and his plan to try and cut funding for Planned Parenthood. Related: When \u2018God\u2019s will,\u2019 rape and pregnancy collide GOP distancing Reaction within Mourdock\u2019s own party has been deafening. Romney had endorsed him in a TV ad before the controversy. Afterward, Romney said through a campaign spokeswoman that he did not agree with Mourdock\u2019s comments, but the ad would continue to run. Other powerful Republicans distancing themselves from Mourdock include  2008 GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a top GOP Senate fundraiser.  Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, canceled plans to campaign with Mourdock on Wednesday. And in a sharp rebuke, a fellow Republican running for Indiana\u2019s governor seat, former Rep. Mike Pence, issued a statement saying, \u201cI strongly disagree with the statement made by Richard Mourdock during last night\u2019s Senate debate. I urge him to apologize.\u201d After apology, McCain does support Mourdock, spokesman clarifiesMourdock said Wednesday he\u2019s sorry for any offense, but Democrats have twisted his comments for \u201cpolitical gain.\u201d  The whole controversy, he said, exemplifies \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with Washington these days.\u201d \u201cI spoke from my heart; I spoke with my principle; I spoke from my faith,\u201d Mourdock said. A senior Republican strategist said Mourdock may not face as much push-back from GOP leaders for two reasons:  Republicans very much want to hold on to that Indiana Senate seat.  That \u2013 with less than two weeks remaining before Election Day.What Mourdock saidHere are Mourdock\u2019s comments saying he supports banning abortions in cases of rape, word-for-word:\u201cI struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize life is a gift from God, and I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen,\u201d said Mourdock, who now serves as Indiana\u2019s state treasurer. He also said he would allow for exceptions to an abortion ban when a mother\u2019s life was in danger. I absolutely abhor any kind of sexual violence. I abhor rape. Richard Mourdock, GOP U.S. Senate candidate GOP Senate candidate: Pregnancies from rape God\u2019s will On Wednesday, Mourdock tried to clarify his comments, saying, \u201cI absolutely abhor violence. I absolutely abhor any kind of sexual violence. I abhor rape, and I am absolutely confident that, as I stand here, the God that I worship abhors violence, abhors sexual violence and abhors rape. The God that I worship would never, ever want to see evil done.\u201d Sounds familiarIt\u2019s not the first time rape and abortion have dominated the campaign. In August, Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri, who\u2019s also a Republican running for Senate, ignited a firestorm when he said \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely resulted in pregnancy. And last week, GOP Rep. Joe Walsh, who\u2019s running for re-election in Illinois, questioned the necessity of allowing abortions if a mother\u2019s life is at risk. He said such an exemption to an abortion ban was simply a political tool used by pro-choice activists. Doctors strongly disputed Rep. Walsh\u00b9s contention that doctors rarely, if ever, perform abortions to save the life of the mother. McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN on Wednesday that his support for Mourdock was dependent on an apology. \u201cIt depends on what he does,\u201d McCain said on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d Thursday, after hearing of Mourdock\u2019s apology, McCain said that he \u201cis glad\u201d Mourdock apologized and \u201chopes the people of Indiana will elect Mr. Mourdock.\u201d Former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum offered words of support for Mourdock Wednesday \u2013 accusing opponents of \u201cgotcha politics.\u201d Mourdock\u2019s comments resulted in a misunderstanding, Santorum told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d \u201cWhat the Senate candidate said is the child is a gift from God, whether it\u2019s conceived from rape or not, it\u2019s still \u2013 the gift of human life is a gift from God,\u201d Santorum explained. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say rape was a gift from God. You\u2019d have to contort words beyond meaning to get that understanding of it.\u201d Santorum: Mourdock criticism \u2018gotcha politics\u2019 It was \u201cgotcha politics,\u201d Santorum said, because Mourdock was \u201ctalking about the baby in the womb as something that is precious,\u201d even though it was conceived through \u201chorrible circumstances.\u201d The whole thing is \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cdemeaning to women,\u201d said Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a statement. Party leaders called on Romney to stop airing his TV ad endorsing Mourdock. \u201cAs Mourdock\u2019s most prominent booster and star of Mourdock\u2019s current campaign ads, Mitt Romney should denounce these comments more strongly than he has,\u201d DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse said. \u201cHe should go further and demand that the ad featuring him speaking directly to the camera on Mourdock\u2019s behalf be taken off the air, and Mitt Romney should withdraw his endorsement of Mourdock immediately.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Newspaper backs Mourdock's opponent as \"the only rational choice\" Mourdock says Democrats are twisting his comments \"I spoke from my heart; I spoke with my principle; I spoke from my faith,\" he says Democrats call for Romney to pull an ad endorsing Mourdock U.S. Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said Wednesday that he is sorry if he offended anyone by saying that pregnancies from rape are \u201csomething that God intended to happen\u201d but accused Democrats of distorting his comments for political gain. \u201cFor those who want to kind of twist the comments and use them for partisan, political gain, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with Washington these days,\u201d the Indiana candidate said. \u201cI spoke from my heart; I spoke with my principle; I spoke from my faith. And if others want to somehow turn those words and use them against me, again, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with Washington today. \u201cIt is win at any costs. Let\u2019s make up issues when we can\u2019t find real ones. Let\u2019s twist, let\u2019s distort, let\u2019s deceive. And I think that\u2019s a sad process.\u201d His initial comments came during a debate Tuesday with Democratic congressman Joe Donnelly, and they prompted outrage among liberals who accuse the GOP of seeking to undermine women\u2019s rights. \u201cMr. Mourdock\u2019s lack of compassion for rape survivors is callous, insulting and completely out of touch,\u201d said Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. Mourdock became the Republican Senate nominee after toppling longtime incumbent Richard Lugar in a bitter primary fight. The Louisville (Kentucky) Courier-Journal, which had endorsed Lugar, announced Wednesday that it was endorsing Donnelly in part because of Mourdock\u2019s pregnancy comment. The newspaper, which has readers in southern Indiana, wrote that Mourdock\u2019s statement \u201cexceeded extreme\u201d and that Donnelly represented \u201cthe only rational choice for voters.\u201d The flap erupted after Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney endorsed Mourdock in a television commercial this week. In a statement issued Wednesday, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said the presidential hopeful \u201cdisagrees with Richard Mourdock, and Mr. Mourdock\u2019s comments do not reflect Gov. Romney\u2019s views\u201d \u2013 but Romney still supports him, she said. The head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, stood behind Mourdock as well. \u201cRichard and I, along with millions of Americans \u2013 including even Joe Donnelly \u2013 believe that life is a gift from God,\u201d Cornyn said in a written statement. \u201cTo try and construe his words as anything other than a restatement of that belief is irresponsible and ridiculous.  In fact, rather than condemning him for his position, as some in his party have when it\u2019s come to Republicans, I commend Congressman Donnelly for his support of life.\u201d Donnelly has said he opposes abortion but would allow exceptions for rape and incest and when the life of the mother is endangered. The controversy comes two months after Rep. Todd Akin, the GOP Senate nominee in Missouri, touched off a firestorm over the same issue when he said \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely results in pregnancy. Akin faced a backlash from most of his own party as well as Democrats but defied calls to step aside from numerous GOP leaders, including Romney. A senior GOP strategist said Mourdock may not face as much pushback from Republican leaders, given the limited time remaining before Election Day and the importance of holding the Indiana seat. But Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, canceled plans to campaign with Mourdock on Wednesday. Ayotte spokesman Jeff Grappone said in a statement, \u201cShe disagrees with Treasurer Mourdock\u2019s comments, which do not represent her views.\u201d And the GOP candidate for governor in Indiana, Rep. Mike Pence, said in a statement issued Wednesday, \u201cI strongly disagree with the statement made by Richard Mourdock during last night\u2019s Senate debate. I urge him to apologize.\u201d And Democrats swiftly pounced on the remark. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued a statement describing the comment as \u201coutrageous and demeaning to women\u201d and called on Romney to take down his ad. Democratic groups and their allies put out web videos Wednesday morning to highlight Mourdock\u2019s comments. \u201cAs Mourdock\u2019s most prominent booster and star of Mourdock\u2019s current campaign ads, Mitt Romney should denounce these comments more strongly than he has,\u201d DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse said. \u201cHe should go further and demand that the ad featuring him speaking directly to the camera on Mourdock\u2019s behalf be taken off the air, and Mitt Romney should withdraw his endorsement of Mourdock immediately.\u201d Mourdock was explaining his opposition to abortion in cases of rape or incest when he made his remark. \u201cI struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize life is a gift from God, and I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen,\u201d said Mourdock, the Indiana state treasurer.

            "article_content": "Because of intel briefings, Romney more informed about foreign policy than he's letting on Drones aren't a key issue, but they do present problems for Obama with his party Debate format won't allow for candidates to talk about some of the things they want to Setting won't lend itself to the kind of fireworks that lit up last week's debate President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney meet Monday night in the last of their three debates, this one focused on foreign policy. Unlike last week\u2019s contentious town hall-style debate in which the candidates ambled around the stage and parried with each other, Obama and Romney will be seated at a table with moderator Bob Schieffer, who told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram what he hopes comes out of the debate: \u201cPeople are watching to judge character. I don\u2019t think it matters what the questions are about \u2013 what matters is how candidates answer. Do they seem in control? \u2026 I\u2019m just there to help the viewers get a better understanding of who these people are.\u201d Here are five things to watch tonight: Get instant updates on CNN\u2019s live blog 1. How much does Romney know about Libya? Romney will undoubtedly raise a lot questions about Obama\u2019s handling of the terror attack in Libya, but there\u2019s a good chance he already has some answers. Don\u2019t forget: Romney has been receiving briefings from the U.S. intelligence community since September 17, as is customary for a presidential challenger in the final stages of a campaign. 13 reasons to watch the last debate on CNN\u2019s platforms and nowhere else His first briefing came a week after the breach of the Benghazi mission that left four Americans dead. His second briefing took place at the CIA, on September 27. Previewing the presidential debate Fareed's Take: 2nd presidential debate Candidates prepare for final debate China: U.S. election scapegoat? Was Romney briefed on the Benghazi attack? Did he specifically request a briefing about Libya? And crucially, has Romney seen any intelligence suggesting a different version of events than the one outlined by the president? Citing the sensitivity of such things, the Romney campaign declined to comment. \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss his intelligence briefings, sorry,\u201d Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in an e-mail. It\u2019s a safe bet Romney won\u2019t discuss them tonight either. So it\u2019s impossible to know whether Romney\u2019s understanding of the Libya attack squares with what White House officials have said publicly in the wake of the incident. But with pre-debate chatter focusing on Romney\u2019s relative lack of knowledge in the foreign policy arena, it\u2019s worth remembering that Romney is actually more informed on these issues than he lets on. Romney switching debate strategy 2. Drones put Obama at odds with his liberal base Obama was described in a recent Frontline documentary as \u201cthe first Nobel Peace Prize winner with a kill list.\u201d Hawkish Republicans warned in 2008 that the man who built his campaign on ending the war in Iraq, closing the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay and strengthening civil liberties in the face of Bush-era surveillance procedures would usher in a new era of American weakness abroad. Instead, the president has fiercely pursued al Qaeda terrorists abroad, with the killing of Osama bin Laden gleaming as the crown jewel of his national security resume. The administration\u2019s emphasis on CIA-operated predator drone attacks against terrorists in Pakistan has aggravated liberals who say the strikes cause civilian casualties and are carried out under a dubious legal framework.  Obama has authorized six times more than the number green-lighted by George W. Bush, according to author and CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. CNN/Google Campaign Explorer: Ads, money and travel The administration has been reluctant to discuss drone strikes, but top intelligence officials have defended the actions as legal, meticulously plotted and designed to avoid innocent casualties. Voters probably won\u2019t go to the polls with visions of unmanned aircraft hovering above the Pakistan wilderness in their heads, but like Obama\u2019s embrace of natural gas drilling in the previous debate, it\u2019s a reminder that the president has strayed from the liberal base that helped elect him in the first place. How he handles questions about the secret air war against al Qaeda \u2013 if those questions arise \u2013 are sure to be carefully scrutinized by Democratic activists he needs to turn out on Election Day. CNN poll: All tied up just before final faceoff 3. The other stuff Conventional wisdom suggests that a debate about foreign policy would work in Obama\u2019s favor. He is, after all, the guy who got bin Laden. And for most of the year, polls have shown Obama leading Romney on the question of which candidate is more trusted on foreign policy and national security matters. Indeed, the image of Obama turning to Romney and scolding him for trying to politicize the Benghazi attack stands out as one of the president\u2019s strongest moments from the last debate. But as perceptions harden in the final two weeks of the campaign, it\u2019s clear the president would rather talk about women\u2019s issues and Romney\u2019s \u201csketchy\u201d tax plan in an effort to recover some breathing room in Ohio, Virginia and a handful of other states where polls show the race tightening. CNN Electoral Map: The Race to 270 It won\u2019t be easy to bring up abortion or contraception on a night devoted to Chinese currency manipulation, troop drawdowns in Afghanistan and \u201cred lines\u201d for Israel and Iran \u2013 but you can be sure the president will try. Certainly the same dynamic holds true for Romney, who would probably rather talk about taxes, the federal debt and Obama\u2019s lack of a vision for a second term \u2013 a new-ish argument from his campaign that appears to be getting some traction. But there is some potential for Romney here. He has a longstanding friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Hi, Florida!) dating back to their days as young business consultants in Boston. And his campaign clearly sees opportunity in the Libya situation. If Romney\u2019s internal polling didn\u2019t show the Libya mess chipping away at Obama\u2019s edge on the commander-in-chief question, he would have stopped talking about a long time ago. Obama avoided answering a question about security failings at the Benghazi mission in the previous debate. He will almost certainly have to on Monday. Campaigning on foreign policy: World looks different from Oval Office 4. The art of the pivot But even in a debate focusing on foreign policy, the two presidential candidates will find moments to try to swing the discussion to issue No. 1 with American voters \u2013 the economy. Obama and Romney are good at pivoting when answering debate questions. Last week, the president used a question from a college student concerned about finding a job in the work force when he graduates to tout the rescue of the domestic auto giants. And Romney pivoted a number of times to criticize Obama over his record in the White House these past four years. We\u2019ll be looking to see how much both men master the pivot at Monday night\u2019s final face-off. The rise of China came up at last week\u2019s town hall showdown, and both candidates quickly brought the conversation back to jobs. What questions would you ask the candidates? \u201cI think they will pivot to the economy when they can. The most obvious places to do that are China\u2019s holding of American debt and Washington\u2019s trade showdowns with Beijing,\u201d says CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, who moderated last week\u2019s debate. The format will also allow both men to pivot. There will be six 15-minute segments. Each segment will start with a question followed by two-minute answers from each candidate. Schieffer can then use the balance of time in each segment to continue discussion of the topic. That\u2019s a lot more time to continue the conversation than at last week\u2019s debate, giving Obama and Romney plenty of time to shift the conversation. But while there will be easy pivots to the economy, \u201cdon\u2019t underestimate the pull of safety and security in the minds of American voters,\u201d added Crowley, host of CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThere is no issue closer to home and hearth than the safety and security of your family. That is the most basic question the federal government has to answer.\u201d Checking the candidates\u2019 facts on foreign policy 5. Will there be fireworks? Last week\u2019s debate was extremely combative. It seemed at times that the two candidates came close to clashing physically. But neither man will have the ability to move this time around, seated with moderator Schieffer at a small table. So will it be a more civil discussion at this final face-off? \u201cThe combination of the candidates seated at a table very close together and the extended discussion phase will really enable an opportunity for the candidates to have a deep discussion on the six topics, and we think it will be a great opportunity for exchange between the candidates,\u201d said Peter Eyre, a senior adviser to the Commission on Presidential Debates. The problem with presidential debates Translation: Things could get testy but don\u2019t count on the kind of clashes we saw last week. There was plenty of heated rhetoric at the vice presidential debate, where Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan, Romney\u2019s running mate, also sat around a table. \u201cYou saw some flashes from Ryan, but really the fireworks were from the vice president. That\u2019s Biden being Biden. But Obama\u2019s not Biden,\u201d Crowley said. And the subject matter may also temper the discussion a bit. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be as frequently combative as the last debate because what people want from their commander in chief is clear-eyed determination,\u201d Crowley added. \u201cThe subject matter along with the optics of sitting around a table in a kind of chummier situation lends itself to fewer fireworks than we saw at previous debate.\u201d Hawaii: The state that doesn\u2019t vote",

            "article_content": "Millionaire hotel magnate Jim Graves challenging Michele Bachmann for her seat Democrats believe political newcomer poses best challenge yet to tea party darling Former GOP presidential candidate seeking fourth term representing Minnesota district Jim Graves strolled down Main Street in his pressed shirt with French cuffs and skinny jeans, a dapper enigma in a land of flannels and Wranglers. He stuck out his hand to introduce himself to a ruffian in a wheelchair scooter. The two talked politics before the stranger confessed he\u2019s an anarchist who believes Americans should be allowed to kill three people a day. \u201cThat would take care of the idiots REALLLLLL fast,\u201d the man said with a chuckle. Not the typical conversation for a millionaire hotel magnate, who\u2019s more prone to discuss bed-sheet thread count than shooting folks. But when people know you\u2019re running for Congress, apparently no topic is off limits. A bit exasperated, Graves wished the man well and quickly departed. Graves isn\u2019t gunning for just any seat. He\u2019s the Democratic challenger to Michele Bachmann, the firebrand darling of the tea party running for a fourth term. New to the political scene, Graves doesn\u2019t mince words. Bachmann is running scared, he told me, avoiding him at all costs and refusing to debate him until a week before the November election. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fact she doesn\u2019t want to meet,\u201d Graves said. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked her to come on with us, anywhere, anytime, and we\u2019ll be there.\u201d Asked about this, Bachmann responded, \u201cWell, phooey. \u2026 I\u2019m not afraid at all.\u201d If America is polarized like never before, few congressional races represent this divide more than the battle going on here. I don\u2019t typically cover politics, but this one was too good to resist: a businessman who made millions by accommodating guests at his hotels versus a politician who Fox News host Sean Hannity has described as one of the women most feared by liberals in America. I traveled to the 6th District of Minnesota to meet both candidates and take the pulse of the race. Bible verses course through the veins of most residents, from the evangelical base in suburban Blaine \u2013 just north of the Twin Cities \u2013 through the rural countryside on northward to the Catholics of St. Cloud, a city anchored by several colleges. The biggest issue here, like the rest of the nation, is the economy. The district\u2019s unemployment rate hovers around 6%, well below the national average of nearly 8%, but it also has the highest foreclosure rate in Minnesota \u2013 a sign there aren\u2019t enough high-paying jobs and that residents are struggling to pay their bills. The district also is highly Republican, very conservative and nearly all white. But even in her home base, there\u2019s no shortage of opinion of Bachmann. Defender of the Constitution. Nut job. Saint. Ol\u2019 Miss Crazy Eyes. You hear it all. \u201cI hope she gets her ass kicked,\u201d said one Minnesotan, one of the few dissenters who met Bachmann during one of her campaign stops. Few people stoke the ire of liberals like the three-term congresswoman, who last year was a GOP presidential favorite for her anti-tax, political-correctness-be-damned approach. She took on President Bush over his Wall Street bailout. She blasted President Obama when he asked for more bailout money. And she\u2019s been one of the most vocal critics of Obamacare, saying it will bankrupt the middle class if it\u2019s not repealed. This summer, Bachmann angered Democrats \u2013 and even some Republicans \u2013 when she suggested the Muslim Brotherhood had infiltrated the U.S. government under Obama. She\u2019s unabashed and unapologetic, saying the recent unrest in Libya, Egypt and the Mideast only underscores her conviction. \u201cI\u2019ve been proven right in the tragic events of this last month. The Muslim Brotherhood is not the Lutheran Brotherhood,\u201d she told Minnesota Public Radio reporter Conrad Wilson during a stop at Buffalo Wild Wings in St. Cloud. \u201cPolitical correctness,\u201d she told me later, \u201cis a problem. \u2026 We cannot subordinate national security to abide by political correctness. But also political correctness is killing the economy, and it\u2019s hurting job creation and innovation. The rest of the world isn\u2019t standing still while we\u2019re being politically correct.\u201d Democrats believe Graves, 59, poses the best challenge yet to Bachmann, especially because there is no independent in the race. In Bachmann\u2019s closest race, in 2008, she won 46% to 43% against her Democratic rival, with an independent getting 10% of the vote. In 2010, Bachmann stomped her Democratic opponent by 13 percentage points. If Bachmann has alienated independents and socially liberal Republicans while seeking higher office, Democrats hope those voters will gravitate toward Graves. He sounds Republican on many fiscal issues, and because he\u2019s never held public office he doesn\u2019t have a voting record that could be skewered by conservatives. That hasn\u2019t stopped an avalanche of spin. Bachmann ads have dubbed him Big Spending Jim in lockstep with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, whose name here is treated with lips curled, like the dirtiest of words. The Bachmann camp has even launched a website, www.bigspendingjim.com. \u201cI don\u2019t care what Michele Bachmann calls me,\u201d Graves said. \u201cIn business there\u2019s a term for smoke and mirrors: It\u2019s called bankruptcy. You don\u2019t play around with budgets. You\u2019re serious about them. \u2026 The last thing we want in a salesperson is somebody who goes and divides and separates and antagonizes and lacks civility and throws verbal grenades at different people, because that doesn\u2019t help get the thing done. You\u2019ve got to bring people together. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve always done it in business. \u201cI think that Rep. Bachmann is just inexperienced. In deference to her, she doesn\u2019t understand business. She doesn\u2019t understand budgeting, but then again: Why should she?\u201d He smiled from beneath his Ray Bans. In nonpolitically correct terms, he just dished out a verbal can of whoop-ass. During one campaign stop, he handed out buttons: \u201cI dig Graves.\u201d We know the best way to bring an enemy into our camp is to make them our friends. -- Jim Graves Just whose political grave will be dug will be determined by voters in November. Bachmann, 56, described Graves as a liberal whose support of abortion rights and same-sex marriage run counter to the views of the district. \u201cThis race will offer a clear, stark choice between what my opponent stands for and what I stand for,\u201d Bachmann said. She\u2019s proud to carry the mantle of chairwoman of the Tea Party Caucus and said she\u2019ll go to bat for the policies that have kept her in office the last six years. The tea party \u201creally does represent the views of mainstream America, certainly this district, because there are three things the tea party stands for: We believe we\u2019re taxed enough already; we believe the government shouldn\u2019t spend more money than it takes in; and we believe the government should follow the Constitution.\u201d She added, \u201cLiberals are liberals. That\u2019s just who they are. They\u2019d love to see my voice silenced.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to know just how close the race is, though apparently it\u2019s tightening. Two non-partisan political handicappers \u2013 the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg Political Report \u2013 have moved their ranking of the contest from likely Republican earlier this year to now lean Republican. Polling from the Graves campaign last month showed Bachmann with a 2-percentage point lead, 48%-46%, a statistical dead heat because it\u2019s within the margin of error. The Bachmann campaign refused to disclose its polling; the congresswoman acknowledged it\u2019s a tough race, but one she expects to win. \u201cDemocrats are salivating at the idea of taking out Michele Bachmann,\u201d said Kathryn Pearson, associate professor of political science at the University of Minnesota. \u201cOn the other hand, she\u2019s a fundraising machine. If she needs any money, it won\u2019t be hard to raise it. So it\u2019s an interesting race, but it\u2019s an uphill battle for Graves.\u201d What is clear, the race for the 6th District has the Bachmann camp in overdrive. Her campaign raised about $1.1 million in July alone, and expects to spend well over $10 million for the course of the campaign. By comparison, the Graves campaign has raised about $1.5 million for the entire race, including $520,000 of his own money. About 20 Bachmann supporters \u2013 ranging in age from College Republicans to retirees \u2013 crowd an office in Blaine to place about 1,100 calls around the district every night, Monday through Thursday. They fill out bubble sheets that are then fed through a computer for instant voter analysis. Every time a Bachmann supporter is reached, volunteers ring a bell. Ding. Ding. Ding. \u201cI honestly believe this woman\u2019s a saint,\u201d said Pamela Larson, a Bachmann volunteer with the Christian Motorcycle Association. \u201cI just think she\u2019s the most wonderful, selfless servant as far as working for the government and taking our concerns to Washington.\u201d More bells ring. Another supporter reached. From math teacher to hotel magnate When you\u2019re challenging a political heavyweight, your every move is followed. Literally. The Graves campaign has dubbed their stalker \u201cTracker Mike,\u201d a fresh-faced college grad and Bachmann supporter who stands about 5 feet away from Graves at events with a handheld video camera. Anything to catch him in a gotcha moment \u2013 a slip of the tongue, a frown on his face, picking his nose. \u201cYou got a busy day today?\u201d Graves asked Tracker Mike during a festival at Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge. \u201cIt depends on your day,\u201d Tracker Mike responded. \u201cWhen you stick to what you believe in,\u201d Graves said later, \u201cit isn\u2019t stressful at all as far as somebody having a camera in your face. It doesn\u2019t bother me. I just ignore it. \u201cThe primary issue is that the 6th District needs good, quality, on-the-ground representation,\u201d Graves said, \u201cand it just hasn\u2019t been there during her tenure in Congress. She isn\u2019t representing the people. She\u2019s representing her own ideologies and own platforms that don\u2019t resonate and don\u2019t directly correlate with the needs of the district. We think it\u2019s very important for somebody to be from the 6th District and get things done.\u201d Graves doesn\u2019t just criticize Bachmann; he\u2019s equally harsh on President Obama for using what he calls class warfare to divide the nation. Since when was it such a bad thing, the millionaire pondered, to work hard and become successful in this nation? \u201cWhere I differ most with Obama is on the tenor of his approach at times. An example: discussion on the Buffett Rule. I would never approach that as a class warfare issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI come from business, so I approach it from that perspective: We know the best way to bring an enemy into our camp is to make them our friends. \u201cI think the president could\u2019ve gotten a little more done if he had reached across the aisle and worked a little bit more. Again, I\u2019m being very candid. People may not want to hear that, but that\u2019s what I believe.\u201d On other key issues, he believes the Wall Street bailouts were necessary, contrary to Bachmann. \u201cThe whole system could\u2019ve rolled down, and the whole world was looking at us, at America, to hold it up,\u201d Graves said. He also supports portions of Obamacare, namely the pre-existing conditions provision and allowing children to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until the age of 26. \u201cPeople ask me all the time: \u2018Would you ever vote against it?\u2019 What I say is: \u2018Well, sure I would if there was something better.\u2019\u201d Liberals are liberals. That\u2019s just who they are. They\u2019d love to see my voice silenced. -- Michele Bachmann Graves\u2019 narrative is the apple-pie American success story. He worked in a factory grinding and polishing lenses at age 15 to pay for his tuition at Cathedral High School in St. Cloud, then labored as a janitor before classes at St. Cloud State University. He met his future wife, Julie, while rehearsing for the musical \u201cHello Dolly\u201d in high school; they\u2019ve been married nearly 40 years. He and Julie played music in bars to help make ends meet during college. He strummed the guitar; she sang. His first full-time job was at a Catholic elementary school in St. Cloud, where he taught for two years. \u201cWhat I remember most,\u201d said Sandy Oltz, one of his former students, \u201cis he wasn\u2019t strictly by the book. He taught us math and arithmetic and reading and the Bible, but he also wanted us to know what the world was really like.\u201d Graves got his big break when the father of one of his students asked if he would join him in a business development. He and Julie had two young sons, with a third boy on the way, and $2,000 in the bank. On a hunch, he quit teaching. The first project went well, and Graves began taking risks on his own. He found investors, started with three restaurants, then dabbled in the agricultural business before starting the Midwest hotel chain AmericInn, a name he chose for patriotic loyalty after the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. The chain flourished, and Graves soon owned more than 60 hotels across the Midwest. It wasn\u2019t an overnight success. There were many Christmas Eves early on, he said, when he wondered if he\u2019d make payroll.  He sold out for millions in 1993 and moved into the luxury hotel and condo development business. His Graves 601 Hotel is one of the signature hotels in downtown Minneapolis, frequented by NBA stars and socialites. His net worth stands between $22 million and $111 million, according to his House financial disclosure form, which allows for wide ranges in reporting one\u2019s wealth. When Graves decided to expand his luxury business into Chicago and New York, some questioned his business acumen. \u201cThe barriers are one step below insurmountable,\u201d hotel consultant Kirby Payne told the Star Tribune in 2005. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why he wants to do this. Is it ego?\u201d Many have wondered the same thing now: Why would a guy who has everything throw his hat into the political ring against a juggernaut like Bachmann? He wasn\u2019t even thinking of running for Congress in January. But he said he was watching a cable news show this spring when the host asked why \u201cgood people\u201d weren\u2019t going into public office. \u201cMy wife and I looked at each other, and I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we try to help make a change?\u2019\u201d There were two other Democrats in the race already. After meeting with both, he decided to join the race and the other two quickly bowed out. If the Bachmann campaign is a well-oiled, well-financed machine, the Graves\u2019 camp is very much a family affair, largely run out of their hybrid vehicles, which overflow with buttons and other campaign material. His son, Adam, took a sabbatical from teaching religious thought at Metropolitan State University of Denver to run his father\u2019s campaign. He has begun calling his dad \u201cJim\u201d to sound more professional, but admits it\u2019s weird. On a recent Saturday, the family traversed more than 100 miles across the district to try to meet voters. They hit a festival at the wildlife refuge, an Alzheimer\u2019s walk in St. Cloud (Graves\u2019 mother suffers from the debilitating disease), a stroll through downtown Annandale and a visit to Minnesota Pioneer Park \u2013 where about two dozen old folks, some in bonnets, gathered for a celebration. \u201cI hope he wins,\u201d said Doris Ashwill, 91. \u201cI just shake my head at her. Radical isn\u2019t the word. What do they call the ones who go backwards?  \u2026 Reactionary, that\u2019s what she is.\u201d The night ended with a fundraiser for the Paramount Theatre in downtown St. Cloud. More than 700 people jammed inside the theater, dancing and swaying as local bands played classic rock. Graves, his wife and close friends took in the scene. Campaign treasurer Peter Donohue pointed out the festive mood of the largely Democratic crowd in the land of Bachmann. \u201cThese are the people Michele Bachmann represents,\u201d he said facetiously. On stage, the bass kicked in and a woman crooned, \u201cBarracuda.\u201d Disappointed by Democrats Long before Michele Bachmann became a political rock star \u2013 the first Republican woman to represent Minnesota in Congress \u2013 she and her then-boyfriend Marcus campaigned for Jimmy Carter when he was running for president in 1976. She was a senior in college at Winona State. The two were captivated by Carter\u2019s status as a born-again Christian and his selection of Minnesota\u2019s Walter Mondale as his running mate. \u201cWe were very proud that our favorite son, Walter Mondale, was chosen as vice president,\u201d Bachmann said. \u201cAnd so we volunteered to work on the presidential campaign. It was my first presidential election. \u2026 So I was proud to go and work for him. (Marcus) and I did. We danced at the inaugural ball.\u201d But the enthusiasm for Carter quickly dissipated amid an energy crisis, the Iran hostage taking and a floundering economy. \u201cWe just decided we couldn\u2019t support him any more. And we voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and never looked back.\u201d In hindsight, she said, she\u2019s not shocked at her younger self. That college senior was \u201cvery reflective of Minnesota,\u201d she said, a person who believed the Democratic Party \u201cwas the party of the little guy.\u201d In business there\u2019s a term for smoke and mirrors: It\u2019s called bankruptcy. -- Jim Graves \u201cI think it was at one time, but it isn\u2019t any more,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd today, I think the party of the little guy is the Republican Party \u2013 because it\u2019s really about traditional values, it\u2019s about a strong military presence and it\u2019s also about the economy and making sure that there truly is competition. You can have free markets. That\u2019s what the Republican Party stands for. That\u2019s what we thought the Democrat Party used to stand for.\u201d Bachmann\u2019s parents were Democrats. They divorced in 1970 when she was about 14. After the split she was raised by her mother, who struggled to pay bills.  The young Bachmann babysat for 50 cents an hour to help make ends meet. (One of the girls she babysat, Gretchen Carlson, went on to become Miss America in 1989 and later the co-host of \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d) The lessons instilled by her mother \u2013 of working hard, saving money and believing in God\u2019s loving hand \u2013 have never left her. \u201cSo many of the things that have happened in the last four years really hurt people in this district,\u201d she said. \u201cI care about them, because I came from a family where I had a single mom; we were below poverty. I don\u2019t want anybody to have to live like that. It\u2019s no fun. I\u2019ve been there, and I want to make sure people have opportunities.\u201d The former Miss Congeniality of Anoka swept into state politics in 2000, quickly becoming known as one of the most conservative state legislators for her stances against abortion and homosexuality \u2013 positions she has defended in the halls of Congress to the ire of Democrats, independents and socially liberal Republicans. The mother of five children has created countless enemies along the way. Her anti-gay stance has caused a divide within her family; one of her stepsisters is a lesbian. Bachmann once hid behind bushes at a gay rights rally, her opponents contend, and her husband\u2019s counseling clinic has been vilified by gay rights activists as a place where they try to \u201cpray the gay away.\u201d While liberals are licking their chops at the prospect of Graves etching her political epitaph, Bachmann has no plans of going anywhere. \u201cI\u2019m a very consistent person. I don\u2019t run for popularity contests. What you see is what you get,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t promise one thing here in the district and then go differently to vote in Washington.\u201d Running for the Republican presidential nomination, she said, was the \u201chardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d but she was buoyed by supporters and her conviction to overturn Obamacare. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it because the country is so magnificent. It\u2019s worth fighting for. That\u2019s why I ran. Because I want to make sure that it\u2019s everything it was when I was growing up.\u201d Bachmann rose to the front of the GOP presidential pack in  August 2011 after winning a straw poll in Iowa. Months later, she dropped out after a poor finish in the Iowa caucuses. Now, back home, she\u2019s basking in the district\u2019s anti-establishment beliefs. The more she\u2019s mocked by Jon Stewart, the more New York Times op-eds condemn her beliefs, the more her base rallies. \u201cThe roaring 1990s are over, unfortunately. We now need to concentrate on saving this nation, and Michele is a wonderful individual that cares very much about doing that,\u201d said Matthew Coombes, a volunteer who drove from Massachusetts to pitch in. In the 6th District, it\u2019s easy to see why she\u2019s loved by many. She\u2019s charismatic, engaging, even charming to complete strangers. When she walks into a room, all eyes turn toward her. She sticks out her hand and introduces herself: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Michele.\u201d Bachmann dished up a round of chicken wings to Kim Saatzer\u2019s table during a stop at Buffalo Wild Wings in St. Cloud. \u201cShe\u2019s just fighting for our freedom,\u201d the 49-year-old Saatzer said. \u201cIf you take God out of this country, this country is going under.\u201d From there, she met with workers at J-Berd Mechanical Contractors, who told her of being audited three times in three years, which they said was a sign of an overzealous government cracking down on small businesses. That\u2019s the No. 1 complaint among business owners: regulatory burdens stifling job growth, Bachmann told the employees. \u201cDon\u2019t you think they could find somebody else they could go and look at once in a while?\u201d she asked. She spun through St. Cloud for a quick hit on a conservative radio show, \u201cOx in the Afternoon,\u201d where she picked up the endorsement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. While at the radio station, she criticized the administration for underestimating the turmoil in the Mideast, for spending \u201cbillions and billions more staying in a lost cause\u201d in Afghanistan, and for budgetary overspending. I don\u2019t run for popularity contests. What you see is what you get. -- Michele Bachmann \u201cThat\u2019s the real problem in America right now,\u201d she told the radio audience. \u201cGovernment has no interest or willingness to balance its books. \u2026 All of us have to. Only the federal government keeps trying to figure out ways to print money it doesn\u2019t have, and that puts all of us at risk.\u201d She then toured a high-tech business and hobnobbed with powerful Republicans before settling in with supporters to watch the first presidential debate at a call center in the town of St. Michael. There were hisses and gasps when Obama spoke, cheers when Romney offered up his beat-down. That same night, her opponent hosted Rep. Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat despised by Bachmann. She\u2019s seeking to repeal Dodd-Frank, the set of banking reforms that Obama pushed for and Congress passed in the wake of the nation\u2019s financial crisis. \u201cSo, this is my opponent\u2019s new mentor in Congress,\u201d Bachmann said, working her supporters into a frenzy of \u201cWowwwwwwws.\u201d \u201cThank God, Barney Frank is timing out,\u201d she said, referring to Frank\u2019s decision not to run for re-election. The crowd clung to her every word, ready for her looming showdown with Graves. She loved the moment, said it was inspiring to be home. \u201cJust remember,\u201d Bachmann said, \u201cthe only way we repeal Obamacare is this year.\u201d \u201cWe have to!\u201d one woman shouted. \u201cHey, that\u2019s a great option,\u201d Bachmann said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful we got it, because the Supreme Court completely let us down. They upheld this completely unconstitutional bill, unfortunately. But now, it\u2019s up to the American people. Now, we\u2019ve got a chance.\u201d She urged them to hit the call centers in droves, tell their friends, neighbors, relatives the importance of this election. \u201cCall your little heart out between now and election night, because it\u2019s that important,\u201d she said. \u201cWe only have one chance at this.\u201d \u201cCount me in,\u201d another woman shouted. Before leaving, Bachmann said she was more energized than ever for an election. Graves and Bachmann are on a collision course for their first of three debates, beginning October 30. \u201cI have to confess,\u201d Graves told me, \u201cover the years, I\u2019ve said I wish I could sit down and debate that woman.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she\u2019d avoid him yet again. \u201cHopefully, she\u2019ll show up,\u201d he said. Bachmann said she\u2019s sticking to the script she\u2019s followed in previous races, with debates waiting until the end \u2013 a point that has driven Democrats crazy. \u201cThese are the debates we\u2019ve always set up; these are the debates we always do,\u201d she said. \u201cI look forward to that.\u201d Game on.",

            "article_content": "Questions arise over Mitt Romney's account of hiring women in Massachusetts Women voters are a key demographic in the November election President Obama focuses on abortion and equal pay to appeal to women voters Romney and Republicans say Obama's economic record hurts women Mitt Romney is in a bind over binders. The Republican presidential nominee is being challenged about the details of hiring women for top government positions when he won election as governor of Massachusetts in 2002, giving a possible late boost to efforts by President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign to strengthen its support among female voters. Less than three weeks before Election Day, the battle for the women\u2019s vote \u2013 a demographic Obama won easily in 2008 and needs again this year to secure re-election \u2013 appeared to be tightening. Then comments by Romney in Tuesday\u2019s second of three presidential debates raised questions about what actually happened when he was governor and provided an opening for Obama\u2019s team to challenge whether he understands the role of women in the workplace and the economy. Did Romney lose ground with women? Photos: From the campaign trail The debate over 'binders full of women' Crowley: 'Binders' line didn't strike me 'Binders full of women' instant web meme \u201cI had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men,\u201d Romney said at the debate in answer to a question about equal pay for women. \u201cAnd I went to my staff, and I said, \u2018How come all the people for these jobs are all men?\u2019 They said, \u2018Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, gosh, can\u2019t we find some women that are also qualified?\u2019\u201d That led to a \u201cconcerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members\u201d of his cabinet, he continued, saying: \u201cI went to a number of women\u2019s groups and said, \u2018Can you help us find folks?\u2019 And they brought us whole binders full of women.\u201d Romney added that a university study later concluded that Massachusetts under his leadership \u201chad more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.\u201d The \u201cbinders full of women\u201d reference prompted a huge response on social media, becoming the third-fastest rising Google search during the debate and getting a Twitter hashtag, a series of memes on Tumblr and a Facebook page with more than 8,000 members by Thursday morning. Healey: Dems distracting from issues With the attention came attempts by Obama and other Democrats to gain political advantage. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to order up some binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women who can learn and excel,\u201d Obama told a campaign event Thursday in New Hampshire. He quickly pivoted to the first bill he signed into law \u2013 the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \u2013 by saying he wanted new women graduates \u201cto receive equal pay for equal work.\u201d On Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden characterized Romney\u2019s perspective on women as a \u201c1950s time warp\u201d in keeping with the Obama campaign\u2019s efforts to focus the debate on women\u2019s issues to topics involving personal choice, such as abortion and contraceptives, as well as equal opportunity. At a campaign stop on Thursday in Nevada, Biden repeated his warning that a Romney presidency was certain to bring more conservative Supreme Court justices who would overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion. A USA Today/Gallup poll of registered voters in 12 swing states found that more women considered abortion the most important election issue over jobs and the economy. Romney\u2019s team frames its pitch to women voters as an economic choice, arguing that high unemployment and sluggish growth under Obama particularly hurt women and families. \u201cThis president has failed America\u2019s women,\u201d Romney told a campaign event Wednesday in Virginia. \u201cAs I go across the country and ask women what can I do to help, what they speak about day in and day out is help me find a good job, or a good job for my spouse. And help my kid, make sure my children have a bright future, better schools and better job opportunities. That\u2019s what the women of America are concerned about and the answers are coming from us and not from Barack Obama.\u201d Asked Thursday about boosting jobs for women, Romney\u2019s running mate \u2013 conservative House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin \u2013 launched a lengthy response with a succinct summation: \u201cGet the economy growing.\u201d Obama \u201ctook his eye off the ball of growing the economy, and as a result, the poverty rate among women is at a 17-year high,\u201d Ryan told a campaign event in Florida. \u201cOver 5 million women have just left the work force.  Fewer women are working today than when he took office. And so of the people who have been hit the hardest, it\u2019s women.\u201d Hillary Clinton says no to another run Meanwhile, disputes arose about Romney\u2019s account of what he did in Massachusetts. Jesse Mermell, a Democratic local official in Brookline, Massachusetts, who was executive director of the Massachusetts Women\u2019s Political Caucus from 2004 to 2008, took exception to Romney\u2019s statement that he initiated the search for qualified women for his cabinet. A program her group oversaw provided Romney\u2019s transition team in 2002 with resumes of qualified women, Mermell told a conference call with reporters Wednesday. \u201cMitt Romney did not request those,\u201d Mermell said, explaining that the program called MassGAP approached Romney and his Democratic opponent before the election to get their commitment for hiring women to state positions in proportion to the female population. \u201cThen after the election, our group approached the Romney transition team with the resumes, or the so-called binders full of women.\u201d She also cited a study that showed Romney initially hired 14 women among 33 appointments to his cabinet \u2013 42% of the total \u2013 but by the end of his four-year term, the number of women in his administration was 25%, lower than the previous or subsequent governors. \u201cAt the time Romney paid lip service to the public about hiring more women in senior positions, and treated it like a quota,\u201d Mermell said. \u201cBut like with so many other things that are Mitt Romney, the facts did not match the rhetoric.\u201d Mermell and Ledbetter, the woman for whom the equal pay legislation was named, told reporters that Ryan voted against the measure and Romney also opposes it. Romney has yet to clearly state his position on the law that strengthens the ability of women to sue employers over unequal pay. David S. Bernstein, a staff writer for the Phoenix in Boston, told CNN on Wednesday that Romney also had issues involving judicial appointees, noting 17 of the first 19 judges he appointed were men. \u201cAfter some unfavorable press about that, he began appointing more women,\u201d Bernstein said. By comparison, the Obama White House had women holding just under 40% of jobs paying $75,000 or more in 2011. Obama also chose women for his two Supreme Court justice appointments \u2013 Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 and made the fair pay act named for Ledbetter his administration\u2019s first new law. Ledbetter said the law bearing her name \u201chas caused a lot of employers, a lot of large employers, to look at their procedures and their process, and to look at all employees and their staffers to see if everybody\u2019s being treated equitably and fairly.\u201d Republican surrogates for Romney sought to play down the magnitude of the flap over his debate comments. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell told CNN on Thursday that the \u201cbinders full of women\u201d response was good for \u201ca laugh or two,\u201d but wasn\u2019t the main issue of what he called \u201ca serious campaign.\u201d \u201cDespite all the rhetoric and all the attempts of the Obama administration to separate men from women over social issues \u2013 largely contrived, I think \u2013 what men and women care about in this election is the economy, getting us back to work and getting us out of debt,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cMitt Romney\u2019s point was that he actually affirmatively went out to make sure that he had great, competent, qualified women in his cabinet.\u201d Citing a Gallup poll that showed Romney catching up with Obama among women voters in an aberration from other polling so far, McDonnell said: \u201cI\u2019m glad the Obama administration is having fun with it, but the point is that this race is now clearly going in the way of Mitt Romney because he\u2019s a serious candidate.\u201d CNN\u2019s Shawna Shepherd, Rachel Streitfeld, Dana Davidsen and Shannon Travis contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Barack Obama, Joe Biden take on Mitt Romney's 'binders' comments on campaign trail; Romney responds on Twitter Romney's comments on using \"binders full of women\" in hiring; contraception could hurt his standing with some women Obama and Democrats rush to paint Romney as someone who doesn't have the best interests of women in mind Romney will now have to score messaging points on the economy while clarifying stance on women's health issues Before Tuesday night\u2019s debate, polls showed Mitt Romney had gained ground with women voters. But his comments about using \u201cwhole binders full of women\u201d as a hiring aid while governor, whiffing on an equal pay law question, and alluding to helping women get home to cook dinner has landed the GOP presidential hopeful in verbal quicksand with some female voters. He\u2019ll have to do some serious repair to regain traction, political experts say. Online erupts over \u2018Binders full of women\u2019 Romney talks about 'binders full of women\" 'Binders of  women' buzzing on Facebook The debate: Taxes, jobs, misperceptions Undecided voter: Obama had slight edge That\u2019s because Tuesday night\u2019s debate made clear that both presidential campaigns are focusing on female voters \u2014 a group that makes up the majority of the electorate. The second presidential debate Some of the spiciest exchanges between the candidates in their second debate were over so-called \u201cwomen\u2019s issues.\u201d \u201cRomney\u2019s discussion of his promotion of women in his gubernatorial administration was \u2026 problematic,\u201d said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. \u201cFirst, Romney\u2019s description of how he found female appointees sounded an awful lot like affirmative action, and someone will bring this up again. Accusations, interruptions define bruising debate Also, the Twitterverse exploded with links to articles about how Bain Capital under Romney\u2019s leadership didn\u2019t have a female partner.\u201d The highest-ranking woman in his gubernatorial administration was his No. 2, Lieutenant Gov. Kerry Healey. Beth Myers has long held senior positions in Romney\u2019s political campaign. President Barack Obama was quick to use the \u201cbinders\u201d line against Romney on the campaign trail Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women ready to learn and teach in these fields right now,\u201d Obama told supporters in Mount Vernon, Iowa. Vice President Joe Biden at a campaign event Wednesday in Greeley, Colorado, questioned where Romney\u2019s comments were coming from. \u201cWhat I can\u2019t understand is how he has gotten in this sort of 1950s time warp in terms of women,\u201d he said. Romney responded on Twitter: @MittRomney \u201cI understand the challenges women face and want to make it easier for them in the workplace.\u201d \u2018Romney just can\u2019t connect with working women\u2019 During the debate at Hofstra University in New York, Romney, who worked in business before serving as governor of Massachusetts, said he \u201clearned a great deal\u201d about the inequalities between men and women in the workplace when leading his state. When he and his staff ran into problems finding qualified female applicants to fill cabinet posts, Romney said he \u201cwent to a number of women\u2019s groups and said, \u2018Can you help us find folks,\u2019 and they brought us whole binders full of women.\u201d Undecided women voters who were watching the debate and participating in a focus group in Ohio reacted positively to Romney\u2019s anecdote during dial-testing for CNN. The responses from the women jumped sharply on-screen when Romney spoke about workplace flexibility. 25 funniest debate tweets The tweets, posts and pictures quickly exploded on the internet. Before the debate ended, there were Twitter hashtags and handles, a series of memes on Tumblr, and a Facebook page with over 100,000 fans. The \u201cbinders full of women\u201d phrase was the third-fastest rising search on Google during the debate. Romney\u2019s comments \u2018extremely offensive to women\u2019 Not to be outdone or out-messaged, the Romney campaign put out an ad as the debate wrapped up, clarifying the GOP nominee\u2019s support for contraception and belief that in some cases abortion should be legal. But there is a lingering perception behind the comedic Internet takes on Romney\u2019s \u201cbinders full of women\u201d response and pre-emptive advertising aimed at women that he is disconnected from the day-to-day issues facing that critical group of voters.  And in a close election, that type of narrative could be a problem for Romney as he fights to woo a narrow pool of voters. 5 things we learned from the debate \u201cThe gap between Obama and Romney was declining and I\u2019m not sure \u2026 if the governor made significant headway (with women voters),\u201d said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra. A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted last week showed Romney had closed the gap with women and was within one point among women who are likely voters, 48% for Romney and 49% for Obama. Throughout the debate, Obama and Democrats sought to reverse that trend and widen that gap. Obama tried to draw a distinction between himself and Romney on a number of women\u2019s issues, tying equal pay, contraceptives and health care to the economy. Obama said his administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act gives insured women free contraception coverage and asserted that Romney \u201cfeels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.\u201d Romney reacts to frenzy over \u2018binders\u2019 comment Romney pushed back, calling the president\u2019s statement \u201ccompletely and totally wrong.\u201d While not opposing the availability of contraception, Romney opposes the contraception rule, arguing it forces some religious institutions to go against their faith. After the debate, Democratic pundits criticized Romney\u2019s efforts to hire women. \u201cWhat it demonstrates here and why these debates are important because they\u2019re a window into what people are really thinking and how they operate,\u201d former Clinton adviser and Democratic analyst Richard Socarides said on CNN\u2019s Early Start. \u201cHere\u2019s a situation where, you know, it should have been readily apparent to anyone that there were plenty of qualified women but they had to make this special effort.\u201d Socarides gave Romney points for trying to hire women but said in doing so, \u201cRomney demonstrates that he\u2019s living in another world.\u201d\u201cQualified women should be apparent to everyone,\u201d added Socarides. He said he didn\u2019t understand why Romney \u201chas to go out and make this special effort to find women.\u201d And though Romney sought to highlight his support of flexible work schedules for women, his reference to women who need such schedules to race home to make dinner for their families may have ruffled some female voters the wrong way. Opinion: Romney\u2019s empty \u2018binders full of women\u2019 \u201cHis discussion of work-life balance appeared condescending to some because of the reference to women cooking dinner,\u201d Gillespie said. Romney will now have to rebuff the Obama campaign\u2019s attempts to define him as someone who is anti-woman, political experts say. Romney campaign surrogate Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said one reason more women may be looking to vote for Romney is because of his economic message. \u201cThe Number One issue with women is jobs and the economy,\u201d Blackburn said on CNN\u2019s Early Start recently. The former governor will have to do more of this type of messaging if he wants to sway this group, Bose said. Romney, she said, will have to hammer home the message \u201cwhat\u2019s good for women is good for the country.\u201d Roundup: 10 takes on the second presidential debate CNN\u2019s wire staff, political unit and Emily Smith contributed.",

How well candidates connect with audience members could affect outcome Obama must overcome passive first performance without overdoing it Women's issues are one area Obama must exploit if he wants to maintain their support Strong debate will result in flood of contributions, much needed in stretch run ad blitz President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney face off Tuesday in the second of their three debates, this one in a town hall-style setting in which they\u2019ll take questions from likely voters. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: Obama must get his campaign back on track after a poor performance in the first debate that left Democrats demoralized and Obama\u2019s lead evaporating both in national polls and those in key battleground states. For Romney, who polls among voters showed won the first debate overwhelmingly, a second strong performance would boost his momentum going into the third debate next Monday and the final two weeks before Election Day. Here are five things to watch for on Tuesday: 1. Connecting with the audience The second presidential deabte Past town hall debate moments Unlike the first presidential showdown in Denver two weeks ago, this debate will include a town hall audience of approximately 80 undecided voters, some of whom will get the chance to ask questions to the two candidates. It\u2019s a completely different dynamic than the first face-off between the president and the Republican nominee. \u201cThe challenge is that they\u2019ve got to connect, not just with the people that are looking into the television and watching them, but to the people that are on the stage with them,\u201d the debate\u2019s moderator, CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, said. Get instant updates on CNN\u2019s live blog \u201cThey have to keep those folks in mind. It\u2019s a much more intimate and up close adventure with voters. The candidate that makes a connection with the person asking the question is also making a better connection with the person back at home,\u201d added Crowley, who\u2019s also the host of CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d With no podium to hide behind in Tuesday\u2019s debate, the candidates\u2019 style and body language will be in the spotlight. If you don\u2019t think this matters, flash back 20 years to the first town hall-style presidential debate when then-President George H.W. Bush repeatedly checked his watch. It was a sign, some thought, that the incumbent would rather have been anywhere else than debating Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. The Arkansas governor highlighted his ability to connect to voters by walking towards the town hall audience when answering a question about the recession. Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala, who was chief strategist for Clinton\u2019s campaign, agrees with Crowley on the importance of connecting with the audience. \u201cIf you do that \u2013 with empathy, compassion, understanding and cool strength \u2013 you will win the debate and the election,\u201d said Begala, who\u2019s a senior adviser for a pro-Obama super PAC. John King: Stakes enormous in second debate 2. Find a warm place After a lackluster performance in the first debate, it\u2019s obvious the president needs to step it up in Round 2. Even Obama himself admits he was flat in the face-off in Denver, telling ABC News, \u201cI had a bad night.\u201d The big question is how aggressive will the president be in this second showdown? Obama needs to look like a fighter. The normally cool president needs to heat it up, but he can\u2019t come off looking overly aggressive or negative. That might smack of desperation. \u201cDon\u2019t over-correct. Don\u2019t go from being too passive in the first debate to too aggressive in the second,\u201d Begala cautioned. \u201cYou need the Goldilocks Strategy: Not as cool as the first debate, not as hot as Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d Crowley: 'Town hall' may limit attacks Stage secrets for a debate win McKinnon: 'Bar is really low' for Obama Crowley as moderator: 'Career highlight' Poll: Debate-watchers split on who won VP debate Making Obama\u2019s task even tougher is the debate format. Many of the questions from the audience of undecided voters may focus on the president\u2019s record the past four years, forcing Obama to defend himself in front of the crowd, before attempting to pivot to criticizing his GOP challenger. It\u2019s a delicate dance. But Begala says Obama can learn from Biden\u2019s performance at last week\u2019s vice presidential debate by emulating \u201cBiden\u2019s combination of facts with common sense.\u201d And we\u2019re also going to watch to see if the president plays the empathy card. \u201cObama needs to connect the struggles and sacrifices his family made to the struggles families in the town hall audience are going through. Romney can\u2019t do that,\u201d Begala added. Opinion: Do facts matter? 3. Getting women\u2019s issues into the conversation Obama pollster Joel Benenson released a harshly worded memo on Monday attacking the Gallup organization over a new poll, released in tandem with USA Today, that showed Romney now tied with Obama among women voters. You read that right. After months of leading Romney by double digits among women, his lead among female voters has effectively vanished, if you believe that poll. Benenson savaged Gallup\u2019s methodology and dismissed the poll as an outlier. He\u2019s correct that no other survey has shown Romney performing that well among women. But for Chicago\u2019s sake, he better be right. Along with his impenetrable lead among Hispanics and a near total hold on African-American voters, Obama has led Romney all year thanks to his robust support among women. If that disappears, so do the president\u2019s re-election hopes. What does this mean for Tuesday night? Women-specific issues \u2013 topics like abortion, contraception, child care, education \u2013 did not come up at length in the first Obama-Romney showdown. Obama ad\u2019s Planned Parenthood focus They did in the vice presidential debate, however, and Romney running mate Paul Ryan scored poorly among women in debate-watching focus groups when he explained Romney\u2019s opposition to abortion rights. If Obama hopes to lock in his lead among women, he must find a way to get issues like abortion and contraception in the spotlight in order to draw a sharp contrast with Romney. 4. Strong performance pays off \u2013 literally A strong debate showing doesn\u2019t just move numbers, it raises money. Romney\u2019s energetic performance in Denver \u2013 which voters judged as a clear win, polls showed \u2013 accomplished something very important for the Republican nominee. In short, his supporters now like him. Test yourself: Debate trivia Before the debate, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll out Monday, fewer than half of Romney supporters said they were \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about his candidacy. Today, the \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d number is up to 62% among likely voters. That\u2019s crucial for Romney, who needs a fired-up base of supporters to show up on Election Day. But the more immediate post-debate impact was financial: Romney raised more than $12 million online in the 48 hours after Denver, his campaign announced just a few days after the debate. And if a campaign is rolling out fundraising data before the federal deadline for financial reports, you know they\u2019re feeling good. On top of that, the campaign said it raised $27 million online from low-dollar contributors in the first two weeks of October. Strong debate leads to fund-raising windfall for Romney That\u2019s good money for a campaign currently engaged in an all-out television ad blitz in key swing states. Both campaigns are in the process of emptying their war chests for the final three-week push before Election Day. A burst of online donations means an extra TV ad here and a final volley of mail pieces there. In a race this tight, every little bit counts. 5. Watch out for the wild card The economy is still issue No. 1 for voters in this election. Foreign policy and national security have also crept into the discussion, with tensions in the Middle East slightly eroding Obama\u2019s edge over Romney on the commander-in-chief question. But unlike in the previous two debates, when editorial control rested in the hands of the moderator, Monday\u2019s debate is a town-hall style forum, in which the audience, about 80 undecided voters from Nassau County, will be the ones generating questions for the candidates. That means there\u2019s a real chance Obama and Romney will have to talk about something that might not have come up in their exhaustive debate prep sessions. A question on affirmative action?

            "article_content": "Joe Biden and Paul Ryan tangled in debate, which experts called a draw Both scored on policy points and set up presidential candidates to continue arguments Unanswered was why Obama deserves second term; trust on women's issues for Romney-Ryan Libya security, economy, Medicare drove vice presidential debate Vice President Joe Biden and Republican vice presidential contender Paul Ryan plowed fertile ground in terms of policy and politics during their debate \u2013 now the question is whether the presidential candidates can reap what was sown. Biden aggressively pressed Ryan on Thursday to defend his ticket\u2019s positions on everything from Medicare to trimming the nation\u2019s debt to the way forward in dealing with Iran. Biden tried to frame the election as a choice between different directions for the country by contending policies of the Mitt Romney-Ryan ticket would hurt the middle class and move the nation backward on social issues, like gay rights and abortion. In doing so, Biden helped set up President Barack Obama to further those arguments during the second presidential debate on Tuesday in New York, political experts say. For his part, Ryan was equally hard-charging and vigorously put forth the ticket\u2019s domestic and foreign policy proposals in exchanges that were at times sharp and pointed. Photos: The Vice Presidential Debate Watch the full vice presidential debate A clear winner in VP debate? Fiery Biden goes on the attack Burton: Ryan's 'facts didn't add up' Ryan repeatedly sought to focus the debate on the Obama-Biden record of the last four years, arguing the administration\u2019s policies hindered economic recovery and weakened the nation\u2019s standing and influence in the world. Five things we learned from Thursday\u2019s vice presidential debate Romney is now well-primed to drive that message home. A CNN-ORC International poll released after the debate suggested voters who watched narrowly favored Ryan over Biden by 48%-44%, a statistically even result. That followed an overwhelming Romney victory in their first of three debates. \u201cI think they both accomplished the kinds of things they wanted to accomplish,\u201d said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University\u2019s political science department. Political analysts say Biden also helped re-energize Democrats, whose spirits might have flagged after Obama\u2019s lackluster performance in last week\u2019s debate. 5 Independent perspectives on the VP debate \u201cThe most important job Biden did for Obama is reawakening the depressed Democratic base,\u201d said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cBiden has primed them for a better performance from Obama.\u201d What Biden failed to do, some political analysts say, is make the case that Obama deserves another four years. That\u2019s up to the president when he takes the stage next week. Debate aftermath: Romney hammers Biden on Libya remark Ron Brownstein, a CNN senior political analyst and editorial director of the National Journal, said \u201cas strong as Biden was,\u201d there was almost nothing on what a second Obama term would mean for America, especially on the economy. \u201cThat is still the big missing piece in their argument,\u201d Brownstein said. Ryan was able to capitalize on Romney\u2019s momentum from his well-received debate performance. The Wisconsin congressman\u2019s performance further smooths Romney\u2019s path to charge ahead, political experts say. \u201cRyan was a steady, unflappable presence onstage who made an articulate set of arguments in favor of conservative principles while also seeming sensitive and reasonable to many moderates,\u201d David Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN, wrote Friday. \u201cRyan was also surprisingly strong on foreign policy, holding his own against a man far more schooled in the subject.\u201d However, some political watchers said Ryan\u2019s response on women\u2019s health issues could prove problematic for Romney during the next two debates. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the untalked about thing this morning \u2013 raised a bunch of issues for the campaigns to be talking about over the next couple of weeks,\u201d Hilary Rosen, a Democratic pundit and CNN contributor, said. \u201cYes, the economy is important, but when women have to worry about their health care and the economy, that\u2019s just an extra burden.\u201d But CNN contributor and RedState blogger Erick Erickson, appearing on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d with Rosen, said most women agree with the Romney-Ryan position. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hilary, but you\u2019re just wrong on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the Gallup poll, the Pew poll, Mason Dixon poll, you name it, they show that the majority of women in this country, they are pro-life. They consider themselves for pro-life, with the exceptions Paul Ryan named (in the debate).\u201d CNN\u2019s Tom Cohen contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "NEW: Vice President Joe Biden doesn't mention Libya at a Wisconsin campaign stop NEW: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defends U.S. policies in Libya and northern Africa Mitt Romney says Biden contradicted the State Department on the Libyan attack Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan battle to a draw in their only debate Mitt Romney led fresh Republican attacks on Friday over Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s debate remark about security concerns at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya where four Americans - including Ambassador Christopher Stevens \u2013 were killed in a terrorist attack. The GOP presidential challenger accused Biden of contradicting State Department officials when he said at Thursday\u2019s debate against Romney\u2019s running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, that \u201cwe weren\u2019t told they wanted more security\u201d at the diplomatic facility in Benghazi. The mission came under attack by armed militants on the 11th anniversary of the September 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington. However, State Department officials told a congressional hearing on Wednesday that they requested more security but were turned down by headquarters in Washington. \u201cWhen the vice president directly contradicts the sworn testimony of state department officials \u2026 the American people deserve to know what happened,\u201d Romney told a campaign event in the battleground state of Virginia. Biden made no mention of Libya in his lone campaign appearance on Friday in Wisconsin, instead focusing on his main campaign themes that Romney and Republicans favor protecting the wealthy over helping the middle class. The vice president\u2019s comment in the feisty debate with Ryan provided an opening for Romney\u2019s campaign to continue its criticism of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy, a topic on which polls show voters favor the president over his Republican opponent ahead of the November 6 election. Ryan referred three times during the debate to television images from Libya and elsewhere in the Arab world in recent weeks that he said showed an unraveling of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney responded Friday by saying Biden\u2019s remarks on Libya correctly reflected that any requests for diplomatic security are handled by the State Department. According to Carney, Obama and Biden were unaware of the specific requests mentioned at the House Oversight Committee hearing. Biden \u201ccertainly was aware\u201d of the congressional testimony when he responded to questions at the debate, which showed that the vice president was referring to himself and Obama in saying that they didn\u2019t know about the request for more security, Carney said. The White House spokesman also repeated earlier assertions that there was no \u201cactual intelligence\u201d beforehand indicating that a terrorist attack on the Benghazi compound was imminent, and noted a formal State Department review was underway. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in a speech on democratic changes in northern Africa, promised the United States would work to bring the Benghazi attackers to justice and that the review she ordered would get to the bottom of what happened. At the same time, Clinton noted no one expected democratic change in the Arab world to happen quickly or easily. She said the United States must keep up its work promoting democracy, even if that puts diplomats in dangerous and volatile places. \u201cWe will never prevent every act of violence or terrorism or achieve perfect security,\u201d Clinton said in the speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cOur people cannot live in bunkers and do their jobs.  But it is our solemn responsibility to constantly improve, to reduce the risks our people face and make sure they have the resources they need to do those jobs we expect from them.\u201d At Thursday\u2019s debate, Ryan focused on the Libya incident. The conservative House Budget Chairman accused the administration of failing to properly secure the compound, then giving an incorrect initial explanation for what happened by describing the attack as an anti-American protest, instead of a planned terrorist assault. Biden smiled and shook his head as Ryan delivered his criticism, then responded that \u201cnot a single thing he said was accurate.\u201d However, Biden then denied any knowledge of requests to increase security at the Benghazi compound, saying: \u201cWe weren\u2019t told they wanted more security there. We did not know they wanted more security.\u201d The Romney campaign blasted Biden for the remark after the debate, releasing a statement that listed a string of media reports pointing out Biden\u2019s apparent mistake. Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland told CNN on Friday that any information about requests for more security in Benghazi never reached the White House. \u201cWhat the vice president is saying is that he and the president didn\u2019t know,\u201d said Van Hollen, who helped Biden prepare for the debate. \u201cThis information had been communicated, at least according to the hearings, to the diplomatic security folks at the State Department and some others. But it wasn\u2019t communicated to the president.\u201d Biden headed for Wisconsin on Friday for a campaign event, while Romney and Ryan planned to team up later in the day for a rally in Ohio. With less than four weeks until Election Day, the candidates are focusing on the battleground states still considered up for grabs and vital to each side\u2019s chances for victory. At their lone debate, Biden and Ryan challenged each other\u2019s facts and claims while offering starkly different visions for the direction the country should follow. Biden achieved his goal of bringing the fight to his GOP foe in battling Ryan to a draw, boosting the spirits of Democrats disheartened by Obama\u2019s lackluster performance in the first presidential debate last week. Ryan, meanwhile, made a positive impression with his command of both domestic and foreign policy issues that showed him to be a formidable national candidate after a career of local congressional races in his native Wisconsin. Five things we learned from the VP debate A snap CNN-ORC International poll showed voters who watched the debate narrowly favored Ryan over Biden by 48%-44%, a statistically even result after Romney scored a clear victory over Obama last week in their first of three debates. Vice presidential debate: A recap Best zingers from VP debate Biden, Ryan debate Benghazi attack Obama responds to VP debate Martha Raddatz of ABC News aggressively moderated the debate, challenging both candidates on some claims and moving on to various topics covering both domestic and foreign policy. Ryan repeatedly said the Obama administration has taken the nation in the wrong direction, asserting it has hindered economic recovery and weakened U.S. influence around the world. \u201cThe choice is clear: a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cMitt Romney and I will not duck the tough issues, and we will not blame others for the next four years.\u201d 25 funniest tweets about the VP debate Biden called several of Ryan\u2019s remarks \u201cmalarkey\u201d and challenged Americans to trust their common sense when judging proposals by the Republican challengers. The tax and entitlement reforms proposed by Romney and Ryan would harm the middle class and favor the wealthy, Biden said in seeking to depict Republicans as protectors of the privileged. \u201cYou think these guys are going to go out there and cut those loopholes?\u201d Biden asked about unspecified moves promised by Romney and Ryan to balance broad tax cuts they propose. On the topic of reforming the Medicare program for senior citizens, which Romney and Ryan seek to partially privatize, Biden referred to a Ryan proposal to provide partial government payment for seniors in the future to buy private health care. \u201cFolks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?\u201d Biden asked, saying Ryan\u2019s plan would increase Medicare costs to recipients by $6,000 a year. Ryan disputed the claim, which was based on a proposal that he has since altered. The debate pitted Biden, 69, and his almost four decades of experience in national politics against the 42-year-old Ryan, a 14-year congressional veteran. Privately, senior Democrats told CNN they believed a strong showing by Biden could help the Democratic ticket, but wouldn\u2019t be enough to erase problems created by Obama\u2019s self-admitted bad debate performance against Romney. First two debates couldn\u2019t be more different Obama and Romney will square off again Tuesday in New York and October 22 in Florida. Polling after the first presidential debate showed Romney tightening the race nationally and in some of the nine battleground states considered vital to either candidate\u2019s chances of garnering the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. \u201cI do think Joe Biden did his boss a lot of good tonight,\u201d CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said after Thursday\u2019s debate. CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger said Biden\u2019s job \u201cwas to right the ship, and he did it.\u201d Both analysts criticized Biden for his tendency to smile and roll his eyes in response to some of Ryan\u2019s comments, especially early in the debate, with Gergen saying Ryan won on style but the debate was even with regard to substance. Biden also was more aggressive in his demeanor, repeatedly cutting off Ryan and sometimes talking at the same time as his rival to challenge specific comments. At one point, Ryan told Biden that \u201cI know you\u2019re under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don\u2019t keep interrupting each other.\u201d Biden responded: \u201cWell, don\u2019t take all the four minutes then\u201d in reference to how much time the candidates had to respond to a particular question. Overall, Biden spoke for about a minute more than Ryan during the 90-minute-debate at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. Who won the debate? Martha Raddatz Ryan repeatedly sought to focus the debate on the Obama-Biden record of the last four years, arguing the administration\u2019s policies hindered economic recovery and weakened the nation\u2019s standing and influence in the world. For his part, Biden tried to frame the election as a choice between differing directions for the country by contending policies of the Romney-Ryan ticket would hurt the middle class and move the nation backward on social issues such as gay rights and abortion. Unlike Obama last week, Biden made sure to mention Romney\u2019s controversial comments secretly recorded at a May fundraiser in which the former Massachusetts governor spoke dismissively of 47% of Americans who he said depend on government benefits and don\u2019t pay taxes. In one of his most effective moments, he gave a passionate defense of Americans who participate in the social safety net of entitlement programs and other benefits. \u201cThese people are my mom and dad \u2013 the people I grew up with, my neighbors.\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in his federal income tax. They are elderly people who in fact are living off of Social Security. They are veterans and people fighting in Afghanistan right now who are, quote, \u2018not paying any tax.\u2019\u201d In the biggest laugh line of the night, Ryan conceded Romney didn\u2019t express the thought exactly as he wanted at the fundraiser, then needled the gaffe-prone Biden by saying: \u201cI think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don\u2019t come out of your mouth the right way.\u201d Biden immediately responded \u201cbut I always say what I mean.\u201d Opinion: Sports bar Biden vs. seminar Ryan On Iran, widely backed international sanctions pushed by Obama have devastated that country\u2019s economy, Biden said. He rejected assertions that Obama failed to work closely with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and that the United States lacked commitment to a possible military strike to prevent Iran from becoming capable of developing a nuclear weapon. \u201cThis president doesn\u2019t bluff,\u201d Biden said. Ryan, however, insisted that Iran was closer now to having a nuclear weapon than it was four years ago, blaming the administration for allowing that to happen. He bluntly said that Tehran must not be allowed to  become a nuclear power. \u201cThis is the world\u2019s largest sponsor of terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they get nuclear weapons, other people in the neighborhood will pursue nuclear weapons as well. We can\u2019t live with that.\u201d Read a transcript of the debate or watch it online CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.",

Most experts believe that nine swing states will determine the next president. Video: #Malarkey is trending",

The event\u2019s speakers spoke about using faith in decision-making but largely stayed away from the controversial issues the court will face in the coming months. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Elena Kagan all attended the 60th annual Mass. This was Kagan\u2019s first Red Mass. Having six justices in attendance ties a record set in 2009. The only justices to not attend this year were Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito, both of whom are Catholic, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is Jewish. Kagan and Breyer, both of whom were in attendance, are also Jewish. Election raise stakes for possible court vacancies The annual Mass is an event put on by the Archdiocese of Washington and the John Carroll Society and aims to bring people together to pray for the members of the judiciary before the court begins hearing cases each year. It\u2019s called the Red Mass because of the color of the garments worn by clergy. In the past, presidents, vice presidents and many members of Congress and the judiciary have attended the event.

Broglio, archbishop for members of the U.S. military, delivered this year\u2019s homily, expressing a commitment to the poor and to education while also strongly emphasizing the idea that people should strive to live their faith and become \u201cinstruments of a new evangelization.\u201d \u201cThe faith we hold in our hearts must motivate the decisions, the words and the commitment of our everyday existence,\u201d said Broglio. \u201cOur society must also rest on stable, clear foundations. Otherwise, we run the risk of sinking into the mire of one popular soundbite after another.\u201d Possible Romney court nominees Has 'Obamacare' changed the court? Jeff Toobin talks Supreme Court Speaking about the need to shed clearer light on the \u201cjoy and renewed enthusiasm\u201d of the church, Broglio stressed the idea of living one\u2019s faith outside of church and in everyday life. \u201cWe are instruments in the hands of the Lord, and so we pray to be ever open to his presence,\u201d said Broglio. \u201cThe message is filled with hope: not only for eternal life, but also for the graces necessary so that our lives are truly noble of God and of the vocation he has given us.\u201d While the Red Mass follows the traditional structure of a Catholic service, it also includes a few additions. In particular, the congregants sang \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d at the start and end of the Mass. Others attending the event included Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, Virginia attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Ken Cuccinelli, and U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Dan Rooney. Possible Obama court nominees The court\u2019s current religious makeup \u2013 six Catholics and three Jews \u2013 marks the first time there has been no Protestant justice on the highest court in the land. In 2010, Kagan replaced Justice John Paul Stevens, who was the lone Protestant at the time of his retirement. This is unique for a country in which every president has been Protestant except for John F. Kennedy, a Catholic. The mix of religion and government at the Red Mass has raised some eyebrows in the past. Ginsburg no longer attends the Mass because she said she grew tired of being lectured by Catholic officials. \u201cI went one year, and I will never go again, because this sermon was outrageously anti-abortion,\u201d Ginsburg said in the book \u201cStar of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish.\u201d \u201cEven the Scalias - although they\u2019re much of that persuasion \u2014 were embarrassed for me.\u201d Court opens possibly contentious new term Critics of the service find the attendance of leading decision-makers to be inappropriate. \u201cThere is one purpose to have this. It is to make clear \u2026 just what the church hierarchy feels about some of the very issues that are to come before the court,\u201d said Rev. Barry Lynn, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. \u201cThat is just wrong. And it is wrong for members to go \u2014 not illegal \u2014 but wrong for the archdiocese to promote and encourage this event.\u201d While previous Masses have included political references \u2014 in 2009, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo made an unspecified reference to the rights of the unborn \u2014 this year\u2019s Mass was largely void of any hot-button political issues that the court might be addressing, like affirmative action, same-sex marriage, voting rights or abortion laws. The origins of the Red Mass date back to early Catholic times in cities like Rome, Paris and London. In Paris, La Sainte Chappelle was built and designated as a chapel specifically for Red Mass. In the United States, the tradition began in New York City in 1928, when a group of Catholic lawyers gathered in St. Andrew\u2019s Cathedral. CNN\u2019s Bill Mears contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Both the Republican and Democratic conventions were ritzy pep rallies Political experts say there were stark differences in the diversity level, overall vibe Both parties worked to ensure national television audiences picked up on campaign messages For Democrats who gathered at their convention in the swing state of North Carolina, the high glitz extravaganza watched by millions on television was a partisan infomercial that has paid off, for the moment, in energizing their voters. For Republicans who convened in the battleground state of Florida, the impact on the party faithful of their event has waned. The Democratic convention in Charlotte last week revved up the base as a CNN/ORC International poll released Monday showed more Democrats than Republicans were enthusiastic about voting. Although the difference between them is narrow at 59% to 57%, Republicans commanded a six-point edge, 62% to 56%, coming out of their convention. \u201cThe Democratic convention was fairly well-received, particularly in comparison to the GOP meeting the previous week in Tampa,\u201d  CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said about the latest figures. Moreover, Democrats have gained substantially since a March survey when only 46% of respondents said they were enthusiastic about voting compared to 52% for Republicans. The changes in voter enthusiasm within the parties also came as new polls showed shifting sentiment in the presidential race toward Democratic President Barack Obama. The CNN poll showed Obama opening up a lead over his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, after weeks of running even \u2013 52% of likely voters nationwide backed Obama, compared to 46% for Romney. A Gallup survey released on Sunday also showed Obama with a wider lead. But a Washington Post-ABC News poll of likely voters also released Monday showed the race still neck-and-neck with Obama at 49% and Romney at 48%. Stronger messaging Until the presidential debates beginning on October 3, any new momentum depends on the ability of both campaigns to drive home their message, political experts say. Democrats say: Give Obama another four years to move the country forward. Republicans say: Fire the president and replace him with Romney, a proven business leader. The work of taking those messages to a broader national audience began at the carfefully crafted conventions. Diversity disparity at the conventions Berman finds out why conventions matter Republicans showed sepia toned images of unemployed workers as speakers roundly criticized what the party sees as Obama\u2019s failures on the economy. The Democrats projected brightly colored photos of happy entrepreneurs on stage and warned that this Technicolor vision could fade if the nation returned to the policies of previous Republican administrations. Both sought to suggest an answer to the question: \u201cAre you better off now than you were four years ago?\u201d Are you better off? \u201cThere are many layers of the performance going on,\u201d said Daniel Kreiss, an assistant professor of political communications at the University of North Carolina, noting images, speeches and biographies. \u201cThe political performance and political theater is a good thing for democracy. It\u2019s one of the few ways the parties get a chance to make their unmitigated case for that hour,\u201d Kreiss said. Watch Eva Longoria at the DNC Clint Eastwood's entire RNC speech Marco Rubio introduces Romney at RNC Watch full speech of Julian Castro Both conventions featured movie-quality videos of voters talking about either their economic woes or triumphs. Staffers moved quickly among crowds to ensure the signs held by delegates had exactly the right messages when flashed across television screens back home. Powerful images Both conventions played up patriotism with plenty of flag waving and the parties promoted American-themed images, said Kreiss, who wrote the book, \u201cTaking Our Country Back: The Crafting of Networked Politics from Howard Dean to Barack Obama.\u201d At the Republican convention, many of the supplied signs read \u201cWe Built It\u201d in red, white, and blue writing. At the Democratic event, similar signs read \u201cEconomy Built to Last.\u201d One thing that stood out in Tampa was Romney\u2019s biopic, which Kreiss said \u201chad powerful images of the candidate\u201d turning things around. Images at the Democratic convention included people who would be small business owners and signs indicating they were open for business. \u201cThe idea is that these people are looking forward on the jobs issue,\u201d he said. Mark Anthony Neal, a cultural and Black studies professor at Duke University, said Democrats have been careful in touting what they see as Obama\u2019s other policy successes as a way of suggesting different ways in which his administration has improved American lives. Democratic convention organizers were charged with addressing the challenge of how to talk about other successes. \u201cHow do you take this question, are you better off than you were four years ago? For some folks economics is a reality and when you\u2019re struggling there are other ways you can feel good about yourself,\u201d Neal said. He added that other messages included the administration\u2019s support for gay marriage and the DREAM Act \u2014 an election-year policy change that, in certain circumstances, halted the deportation of young illegal immigrants who came to the United States as kids Obama must make case against change Aiming at broader electorate There was also the battle over optics aimed at women, minorities, middle class workers, veterans and voters and the effort to showcase inclusiveness to the broader electorate watching the events unfold on television, political experts say. \u201cAt the GOP convention the crowd seemed calmer older and whiter and much less enthusiastic. They seemed more passive,\u201d said Trevor Parry-Giles, an associate professor of political communication at the University of Maryland. \u201cWhen they pan the faces of the crowd in Charlotte it\u2019s such a diverse bunch, it\u2019s a real stark contrast with the overwhelmingly whiteness of the Republican convention,\u201d he said. Both conventions featured a cavalcade of high profile female speakers, including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at the Republican convention and Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at the Democratic event, in an attempt to capture that highly coveted demographic. The Republican effort to feature Rice and a parade of other female speakers, like Mia Love of Utah, Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Gov Nikki Haley of South Carolina, further underscored what  CNN contributor and Republican strategist Alex Castellanos called  \u201cthe softer side of the GOP.\u201d In Charlotte, the lineup heavily targeted the liberal base with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Nancy Keenan, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League - Pro-Choice America, addressing the gathering. Both conventions featured the presidential candidates\u2019 spouses vouching for the moral goodness of their husbands. Ann Romney, wife of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, made a telegenic appeal to both middle class voters and moms when she talked about eating tuna fish as newlyweds and late night homework check, political experts say. First lady Michelle Obama, a veteran of the media circuit, wove a narrative of what senior campaign officials called the Barack Obama that few people know. Both conventions also put forth a number of young, rising star Latino speakers\u2014notably Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at the RNC and San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro at the DNC. \u201cPolitics is image these days because a lot of Americans don\u2019t know the ins and outs of policy,\u201d Neal said. \u201cThe conventions are a week long infomercial.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democrats kicked off convention with a lineup heavy on women Democrats and Republicans are locked in a fight for the female vote Obama leads Romney by double digits among female voters Women make up more than half of the electorate When first lady Michelle Obama took the stage Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention, she told the kind of tale about President Barack Obama that only a wife can. She told of the profound impact of watching his grandmother and single mother\u2019s efforts to work and raise children in a system that often didn\u2019t value their efforts. \u201cBarack\u2019s grandmother started out as a secretary at a community bank, and she moved quickly up the ranks. But like so many women, she hit a glass ceiling,\u201d Michelle Obama said. \u201cAnd for years, men no more qualified than she was, men she had actually trained, were promoted up the ladder ahead of her, earning more and more money while Barack\u2019s family continued to scrape by. \u201cBut day after day, she kept on waking up at dawn to catch the bus, arriving at work before anyone else, giving her best without complaint or regret. And she would often tell Barack, \u2018So long as you kids do well, Bar, that\u2019s all that really matters.\u2019 \u201c Sandra Fluke campaigns for Obama Watch Michelle Obama's full speech GOP focuses on women, mothers at RNC Ann Romney: Women voters want a grownup The first lady\u2019s remarks were much more than a counterpoint to stories Ann Romney told last week of her husband, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, during the GOP convention last week. The first lady was a heavy hitter on a female-dominated opening night speakers\u2019 roster that included Nancy Keenan, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League-Pro-Choice America; Lilly Ledbetter, for whom a gender pay equity law is named; and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and a cadre of Democratic women from that chamber, among others. First lady seeks to reignite flame for president Both presidential campaigns say their female-heavy convention speaker rolls are about underscoring that women\u2019s issues are America\u2019s issues. However, the female-centric messages also speak to the parties\u2019 battle over the deeply coveted female voting bloc. \u201cIt\u2019s aimed at a specific group of voters that both parties need,\u201d Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the Cook Political Report said. \u201cThis whole argument is aimed at appealing to this group and keeping them in the fold.\u201d In Charlotte, Democratic women took the stage and hammered home the message that on issues of equal pay, reproductive health, health care for seniors, education and other matters they are poised \u201cto move America forward.\u201d When \u201cSisters are Doin\u2019 It For Themselves\u201d played, both the women on stage and those in the crowd waved and swayed to the beat. On Wednesday, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is scheduled to speak at an Emily\u2019s List reception where she\u2019s on tap to discuss the \u201chistoric number of women running for Senate this year.\u201d  Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown University law student and birth control advocate who made national headlines when conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called her a \u201cslut,\u201d is slated to speak at the DNC on Wednesday. \u201cAt this time the Democratic Party is the only party for women because of the controversial stance the Republican Party has taken,\u201d said Alabama delegate Susan Brown. Not to be outdone, the first full day of last week\u2019s RNC was also heavy with female speakers including congressional candidate Mia Love of Utah, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Govs. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Nikki Haley of South Carolina. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice had prime-time speaking spots later that week. \u201cThe Republican Party is doing a good job of demonstrating the softer side of the GOP, that it is not just the party of business guys in suits,\u201d CNN contributor and Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said. In his acceptance speech, Romney offered full-throated support of women\u2019s equal role in the political process. \u201cWhen my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, \u2018Why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation?\u2019 \u201c But, despite a week in which Republican speakers sought to appeal to female voters, a CNN/ORC International survey conducted just after the end of the RNC found that the double-digit gender gap between Obama and Romney was unchanged. Over the past few months, the battle over women voters has taken some nasty turns. U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin\u2019s recent comments that \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely resulted in pregnancy sent Republicans trying to push him out of the way and revived the contentious \u201cwar on women\u201d debate from earlier this year. Democrats pounced and tried to connect Romney and running mate Paul Ryan to Akin\u2019s comments through a Web video called \u201cThe Romney-Ryan-Akin Platform for Women.\u201d Earlier this year, both presidential campaigns were roiled by heated rhetoric over a federal requirement that religious institutions provide contraception coverage for employees. Democrats said Republican pushback against the law and other proposed contraception regulation measures in several statehouses was an attempt to roll back women\u2019s rights. Republicans said Democrats were oversimplifying the issue in a ploy for female voters. \u201cI think it\u2019s a manufactured war on women, this narrative that Republicans want to take away birth control and access to doctors,\u201d Amy Kremer, chairwoman of the Tea Party Express said. \u201cThis is a manufactured crisis to get the women\u2019s vote.\u201d According to the most recent CNN/ORC International poll, Romney trails the Obama-Biden ticket by 12 points among women. When George W. Bush won a second term in 2004, in a relatively close election, he had only a 3-point deficit among women. Opinion: What candidates\u2019 wives are telling us In a TIME/CNN poll of likely voters released last week, Obama led Romney by 12 points in Florida and 10 points in North Carolina among women voters. Women make up roughly 51% of the nation\u2019s electorate. The GOP women gathered at the Woman Up Pavilion at the Republican National Convention last week were a perfectly coiffed phalanx of policy parsing, politically-savvy conservatives on a mission to show their party does speak to women\u2019s concerns. As they lounged on chic white chairs beneath chandeliers dripping with pink flowers, the women plotted how to leverage social media to elevate the party\u2019s platform and bemoaned the nation\u2019s current economic state. However, the ladies steered well clear of discussing the types of polarizing social issues such as abortion and contraception that led Democrats to claim Republicans are launching a \u201cwar on women\u201d. \u201cWomen have always played a huge role (in the Republican Party); one of the big problems has been the rhetoric,\u201d said Mary Anne Carter, policy director at the YG Network, a conservative think tank that put on the \u201cWoman Up\u201d event. However, Kremer and some Republican women said they also feel the tension between supporting their party and GOP leadership\u2019s push for social policies which some Republican women, including several high-profile members of Congress, disagree with. Earlier this year, both Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said they were concerned about some of the GOP rhetoric on women\u2019s rights. Some rank and file GOP women agree. \u201cRepublicans are for getting government out of the boardroom, so they should be for getting the government out of the bedroom,\u201d said Ann Stone, chairwoman of Republicans for Choice, from the convention floor in Tampa last week. In the meantime, groups that represent women say all the pomp and circumstance surrounding both conventions is fine for the television cameras, but they are encouraging female voters to look beyond the flash and concentrate on such issues as reproductive health and stabilizing the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to be sidetracked by larger rhetoric; tune in to the specific ideas. Both conventions are trying to set a tone. Dig deep,\u201d said Deirdre Macnab, president of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters of Florida. \u201cWe need the candidates to do more than tell about their childhood. What are they going to do?\u201d Five things we learned from Day One of the DNC CNN\u2019s John King, Kevin Liptak and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Michelle Obama says her husband lives his values in the White House NEW: Democrats say Mitt Romney and Republicans are out of touch The word \"God\" does not appear in the Democratic platform Rep. Ryan links President Obama to Jimmy Carter's one-term presidency A Democratic National Convention vital to President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election bid opened Tuesday with praise for his battles on behalf of minority rights and the middle class, as well as plentiful attacks on Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Facing a tight race in November and Republican attacks that they have made things worse while in power, Democratic organizers want their three-day convention to emphasize the tough decisions Obama has made and the additional steps needed to bolster the middle class. The more than 5,500 Democratic delegates adopted a party platform that emphasizes middle-class opportunity while differing sharply on key issues with the Republican version endorsed at last week\u2019s GOP convention. Photos: Best of the DNC Candidates' wives: Humanize husbands Candidates' wives: Character Candidates' wives: How we met Candidates' wives: Appeal to women Then speech after speech lambasted Romney and Republicans, accusing them of being out of touch and politically divisive at a time requiring national unity to confront high unemployment, a sluggish economy and mounting federal deficits and debt. Seeking to further strengthen Obama\u2019s advantage with women, Hispanic Americans and young voters, the Democratic speakers hailed the president for promoting health care reforms, supporting gay marriage, and ending deportations of some young illegal immigrants. First lady Michelle Obama offered a personal perspective on why her husband should be re-elected, telling the convention that the same values she fell in love with guide him each day in the White House. \u201cIn the end, for Barack, these issues aren\u2019t political \u2013 they\u2019re personal,\u201d Mrs. Obama said, adding: \u201cBarack knows the American Dream because he\u2019s lived it, and he wants everyone, everyone in this country to have the same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we\u2019re from, or what we look like, or who we love.\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius defended the 2010 health care law despised by Republicans, saying the changes that prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and allow parents to keep their children on family policies up to age 26 were \u201cwhat change looks like.\u201d She said Romney and GOP running mate Rep. Paul Ryan want to repeal the health care law and effectively end the Medicare program for senior citizens by making it a voucher program. \u201cMitt Romney, quite simply, doesn\u2019t get it,\u201d declared  San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro in his keynote address, later adding: \u201cWe know that in our free-market economy, some will prosper more than others. What we don\u2019t accept is the idea that some folks won\u2019t even get a chance.\u201d Romney and Republicans \u201care perfectly comfortable with that America \u2013 in fact, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re promising us,\u201d Castro said. Read how the first lady will set the tone for the convention Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick earlier challenged Obama supporters to be more forceful in supporting the president\u2019s record in the face of unrelenting Republican attempts to discredit the administration\u2019s accomplishments, such as ending the Iraq war and delivering \u201cthe security of health care to every single American in every single corner of the country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for Democrats to grow a backbone and stand up for what we believe,\u201d Patrick said to cheers.. Other speakers mocked Romney\u2019s overseas financial holdings \u2013 a Swiss bank account, a Cayman Islands tax shelter \u2013 revealed in the two years of tax returns the former Massachusetts governor has released so far. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid challenged Romney to make public more of his tax records, citing the example of the 12 years of returns Romney\u2019s father, George, made public in his 1968 presidential run. \u201cTrust comes from transparency, and Mitt Romney comes up short on both,\u201d Reid said. In a video played in the Time Warner Cable Arena where the convention opened, former President Jimmy Carter said Obama prioritized the middle class in making the difficult decisions required of the nation\u2019s highest office. \u201cHe has done it all in the face of bitter, unyielding, in fact unprecedented partisan opposition,\u201d Carter said in reference to congressional Republicans. The convention will conclude Thursday with Obama accepting his party\u2019s nomination exactly two months before the November 6 election. Former President Bill Clinton will address the gathering on Wednesday night. Newark Mayor Corey Booker energized Tuesday\u2019s first session of the convention gaveled to order Tuesday afternoon with a rousing call for delegates to pass the party platform that represented \u201cour fundamental national aspiration.\u201d To applause and cheers, Booker said voters in November faced a choice between GOP policies offering either \u201ca country of savage disparity favoring the fortunate few\u201d or the Democratic goal of equal opportunity for all. \u201cThis is our American mission,\u201d he added. Later, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel recalled the litany of crises that greeted the Obama administration when it assumed power in January 2009 \u2013 a Wall Street meltdown, economic recession, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a collapsing auto industry. \u201cEach crisis was so deep, and so dangerous, any one of them would have defined another presidency,\u201d said Emanuel, who was Obama\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cWe faced a once-in-generation moment in American history, and fortunately, we have a once-in-a generation president.\u201d Other speakers told how Obama\u2019s decision to bail out the struggling auto industry saved vital jobs and kept a mainstay of the U.S. economy afloat. The goal was to contrast a politically unpopular decision \u2013 spending tax dollars to help a private industry \u2013 with Romney\u2019s call at the time to let Detroit go bankrupt. Romney now says he advocated a managed bankruptcy similar to the eventual result under Obama. Senior campaign officials told CNN that the convention has three main objectives \u2013 to outline the clear choice facing voters, to highlight Obama\u2019s leadership in championing necessary but politically unpopular steps such as health care reform and the auto industry bailout, and to present a detailed plan for creating jobs for the middle class. The Democratic platform focuses on improving the economic situation for middle-class Americans, and also contains language endorsing same-sex marriage and abortion rights that directly contrasts with the Republican platform adopted last week. In a break from past conventions, the platform does not include the word \u201cGod\u201d or label Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \u2013 two more issues that differ from Romney and Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to you. You\u2019ll make the choice,\u201d Obama told a campaign event Tuesday at Virginia\u2019s Norfolk State University, framing the election as a decision between starkly different visions for the country\u2019s direction. Romney\u2019s campaign is focused on the question of whether Obama has made life better for Americans, arguing that continued high unemployment and a sluggish economic recovery from the 2008 recession show that White House policies have failed to deliver promised results. The \u201care you better off\u201d strategy was famously employed in 1980 by Ronald Reagan, who asked voters that question when running against the incumbent Carter at a time of national economic woes. Reagan went on to win, and the Romney campaign has repeatedly invoked his name this year while seeking to link Obama and Carter as failed leaders. Ryan, the conservative House Budget Committee chairman, has led efforts to link Obama with the Carter legacy, telling a campaign stop on Tuesday in Westlake, Ohio, that \u201cwhen it comes to jobs, President Obama makes the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days.\u201d \u201cIf we fired Jimmy Carter, then why would we rehire Barack Obama now?\u201d Ryan said to cheers. He later told an Iowa event that the national debt reached $16 trillion on Tuesday, which he called \u201ca serious threat to our economy.\u201d Five things to watch at the DNC this week Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have fought back against the GOP attack line, telling supporters that the nation is better off now than it was when their administration took office in January 2009. In Norfolk on Tuesday, Obama criticized Romney for failing to detail his economic plans, calling them \u201cretreads of the same old polices that have been sticking it to the middle class for years.\u201d He cited the health care reform law he championed and financial industry reforms that followed the Wall Street meltdown as examples of accomplishments under his leadership that Romney opposes and has pledged to repeal. The back-and-forth between the campaigns is part of their competition on how the election gets framed in the minds of voters. Republicans want it to be a referendum on Obama\u2019s presidency, while Democrats seek a choice between differing political ideologies on the size and role of government. In particular, Republicans seek to shrink the size of government and end chronic federal deficits and rising national debt through reduced spending, reforming entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and slashing taxes on businesses and individuals as a spur for economic growth. Obama and Democrats argue that a deficit-reduction plan also needs additional revenue as part of the equation, and they propose allowing tax rates on income of more than $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals to return to higher levels from the 1990s. Republicans oppose any kind of tax increase, and the impasse over that issue has been the main impediment to a comprehensive deficit-reduction agreement during Obama\u2019s first term. The race overall is very tight, with a new poll on Tuesday showing Romney received little bounce from last week\u2019s convention intended to introduce him to voters turning their attention to the presidential race. The CNN/ORC International survey also indicates that less than 40% of registered voters said the GOP convention made them more likely to vote for Romney. At the same time, Romney got a slight bump in his favorable rating, and on being in touch with the middle class and women, although he still trails Obama on those two questions. CNN\u2019s previous poll, released as the Republican convention got underway, indicated 49% of likely voters backed Obama, with 47% supporting Romney, a statistical tie. In the new survey, which was conducted after the GOP convention, both the president and Romney are at 48%. \u201cThe Republican convention had at best a mild effect on the presidential race, and from a statistical viewpoint, no effect at all,\u201d said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \u201cDemographically, Romney\u2019s overall one-point bounce masks some movement among subgroups and suggests that Romney\u2019s pitch to some groups may have worked but at the expense of turning off another group of voters.\u201d While party platforms generally matter little to voters, the contrasts between the versions from this year\u2019s conventions showed the Republican adherence to traditional conservative positions while Democrats adopted more mainstream stances generally backed by American public opinion. The Democratic platform omits a clause from the party\u2019s 2008 version proclaiming Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, which drew immediate criticism from Romney. \u201cFour years of President Obama\u2019s repeated attempts to create distance between the United States and our cherished ally have led the Democratic Party to remove from their platform an unequivocal acknowledgment of a simple reality,\u201d the Republican nominee said in a statement. \u201cAs president, I will restore our relationship with Israel and stand shoulder to shoulder with our close ally.\u201d Israelis consider Jerusalem the capital of their country, but Palestinians also claim rights to the city as the capital of a future independent state. The status of the city is designated for final negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. American policy has long been intentionally vague on the status of Jerusalem. A U.S. law passed in 1995 designates Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and stipulates the American embassy should move to the city from Tel Aviv. The past three presidents, however, have signed waivers suspending the law, citing security and diplomatic concerns. A Democratic National Committee spokesman said that Obama\u2019s stance on Jerusalem was consistent with previous administrations. The omission of the world \u201cGod\u201d from the Democratic platform represented a notable difference from Republicans, who mentioned God 10 times in their document approved at last week\u2019s GOP convention. In 2008, Democrats wrote, \u201cWe need a government that stands up for the hopes, values, and interests of working people, and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their God-given potential.\u201d Democrats did include a section in their 2012 platform specifically devoted to faith, writing faith \u201chas always been a central part of the American story, and it has been a driving force of progress and justice throughout our history.\u201d A Democratic official pointed out that 2008\u2019s reference to God was not specifically about faith, but rather about growing the middle class, and that the 2012 language specifically referring to faith was identical to 2008\u2019s document. Meanwhile, Ryan continued to be hounded by factually challenged statements in his convention speech last week, coming out again Tuesday to defend a remark that appeared to blame Obama for the closure of a General Motors plant in Janesville, Wisconsin. An announcement that the plant would close preceded Obama\u2019s election. \u201cWhat I was saying is the president ought to be held to account for broken promises,\u201d Ryan said on NBC. \u201cAfter the plant was shut down, he said he would lead efforts to restart the plant. It\u2019s still idle.\u201d The Romney campaign reached out to reporters on Monday to point out that, during his Labor Day remarks in North Carolina, Ryan inaccurately described the number of bankruptcy filings under Carter when he was comparing his record to Obama. Ryan also addressed his erroneous claim to have run a three-hour marathon in the past. \u201cI thought I ran an ordinary, kind of normal time, and I thought that was an ordinary time, until my brother showed me a three-hour marathon is crazy fast,\u201d Ryan responded when asked about the marathon claim in an interview with WTOL. \u201cI ran a four-hour marathon. And so it\u2019s just the fact that I did this 22 years ago, and I forgot what my time was and that\u2019s what I thought it was.\u201d CNN\u2019s Adam Aigner-Treworgy, Kevin Liptak, Peter Hamby, Sarah Aarthun and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

Crises on many fronts confronted Barack Obama when he became president Health care reform topped Obama's priorities, tied to his drive to be a \"great president\" Some of president's supporters became frustrated with the status of his campaign promises Obama needs two terms if he wants to be a transformational leader, historian says President Barack Obama was elected in part on a promise of hope and change and a vow to unite Washington and the country. Towering expectations accompanied the candidate whose election symbolized much more than political change. \u201cI started crying,\u201d said U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s. \u201cFor the sons and daughters of the slaves, their offspring, for the people who have built the Capitol \u2026 it means so much to every human being that lives in this country.\u201d Before Obama was sworn in, senior adviser David Axelrod said to the president-elect, \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible ride, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Obama replied, \u201cAnd it\u2019s just  beginning.\u201d John King: To win, Obama must make history again Crises on many fronts confronted the new president. There was anticipation among those who elected him, but the aftermath of the contentious election would shape his time in office and frame the 2012 election. Previewing Obama's DNC speech Obama: Being a hands-on dad Richardson: American people trust Obama Obama's coronation: The rerun Former Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel described the atmosphere after Election Day as \u201crolling thunder.\u201d \u201cYou could have taken the economics, you could have taken the auto, you could have taken the financial, you could have taken Afghanistan, you could have taken Iraq,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cUsually when you have a series of things you have, that\u2019s an A, that\u2019s a B, you start to prioritize. What happens when all five are As?\u201d Economic adviser Austan Goolsbee, one of the brains assembled in Chicago to deal with the crisis, said that \u201cit was basically awful\u201d and pointed to indicators demonstrating the economy was in free fall. Larry Summers and Christina Romer were also present at the briefings. Summers said everyone in the room was \u201cstruck with the gravity of the situation,\u201d while Romer told the incoming president this was his \u201choly bleep moment.\u201d Goolsbee picks up the story: \u201cWhen the briefing\u2019s over, I go up to the president-elect and I say, \u2018You know, that\u2019s got to be the worst briefing that the president-elect\u2019s had since 1932 and maybe since Abraham Lincoln in 1860,\u2019 \u201d Goolsbee said. \u201cAnd the president says, \u2018Goolsbee, that\u2019s not even my worst briefing this week.\u2019 \u201d \u2018On the edge of a cliff\u2019 With more than 11 million Americans unemployed and more than 13 million homes in foreclosure, Romer said the country at the time was \u201changing on the edge of a cliff.\u201d Some in the Obama administration, such as Romer, proposed a stimulus package close to $1 trillion, while Republicans balked at anything even half that amount. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing to say, but every $100 billion helps,\u201d Romer said. But Republicans objected to the spending, not convinced the cash infusion would do enough to spur growth. Hoping for bipartisan support for what ended up being a $787 billion plan, Obama met with Republicans at the White House before he took office, days after the inauguration and on Super Bowl Sunday. He pitched the plan as a bill that would give tax cuts to almost all Americans, pay salaries for teachers and police, and build roads and bridges. Then-Minority Leader John Boehner said ideas presented during those meetings \u201cwere rejected.\u201d Democratic convention to highlight parties\u2019 differing visions Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine said the package set a poor tone for the new administration and that Obama did not give bipartisanship a chance. Can Bernanke's actions help Obama? Can Democrats get the love back? Writer on Obama-Clinton relationship Is honeymoon over for Obama? \u201cIt was all under way without full involvement of bipartisan leadership to help map out how exactly are we going to address stimulus,\u201d Snowe said. Obama said Republicans were united against him from the beginning, adding that he\u2019s \u201creceived a lot of criticism from my own party for going out of my way to try to solicit Republican cooperation.\u201d Emanuel said lines were drawn then. \u201cTwo months after the election, the Republicans said, \u2018This is your problem; we\u2019re going to start planning for four years from now,\u2019 \u201d he said. House Republicans voted against the package en masse, and only three Senate Republicans backed the final measure. \u201cHe just got off to a poor start, and \u2013 unfortunately the wrong foot, and set the tone for the remainder of his administration that had only yet \u2013 had begun,\u201d said Snowe, one of the three GOP members to back the plan. With hindsight, some of the president\u2019s closest aides said there was probably room for more \u201cschmoozing.\u201d \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a whole lot of time left over for sort of hand-holding and schmoozing. Perhaps we should have made more time for it. But at the time it seemed like he was spending his waking hours doing what he was supposed to do,\u201d Axelrod said. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Recovery and Reinvestment Act saved or created more than 3 million jobs, but unemployment did not stay below 8%, as Romer predicted. Republicans slammed it as a failure. Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley described the partisan divide as one between \u201cthe belief that government is going to solve your problem, to the belief that the era of big government is over.\u201d Obama and his administration were trying to save the failing automobile industry at the same time as the push for the stimulus package. \u201cLiterally they were talking about two weeks and bust,\u201d Emanuel said, describing the dire straits of American car companies. Ex-assistant: Obama leads like he plays DNC chair: U.S. 'absolutely better off' Klein: Diversity a weakness for Democrats Julian Castro compared to young Obama Detroit squandered the first federal cash infusion from the Bush administration. So when Chrysler and General Motors, months later, asked for more taxpayer dollars, Congress refused. Going against the advice of some advisers, Obama bailed out the companies in a move that nearly three-quarters of Americans opposed. The bailout ultimately saved jobs and provided the industry a safety net, but the president was not effective at selling it, indicative of a larger theme, said Obama biographer David Maraniss. \u201cIn terms of communicating on specific issues \u2026 he\u2019d be great if you were sitting down for an hourlong lecture in a classroom but not necessarily trying to sell it to the public,\u201d Maraniss said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think in sound bites.\u201d While the president pushed forward with his agenda, critics saw it as a string of liberal programs: stimulus, auto rescue and homeowner relief. At the Conservative Political Action Conference the month after Obama\u2019s inauguration, conservatives railed against the Obama-supported initiatives. \u201cObama is the world\u2019s best salesmen of socialism,\u201d Republican Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina said at the gathering. \u201cLenin and Stalin would love this stuff,\u201d former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said. And perhaps most notably, Rick Santelli unofficially launched the tea party with a rant on CNBC. \u201cYou know Cuba used to have mansions and a relatively decent economy. They moved from the individual to the collective,\u201d Santelli said in February 2009. \u201cNow they\u2019re driving \u201954 Chevys. It\u2019s time for another tea party.\u201d After asking for an additional $300 billion for Wall Street, news came that failing insurance giant AIG, which had received $170 billion in federal funds, paid millions to the executives accused of dragging down the banks. Advisers said privately that Obama was outraged, but it took 10 months and more bonuses before the president showed his outrage in public, during an interview on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t run for office to help out a bunch of fat cat bankers running Wall Street,\u201d Obama said in December 2009. Reggie Love, who was Obama\u2019s personal aide on the campaign trail and in the White House, said it\u2019s not the president\u2019s style to \u201cget up on the sofa and yell and you know, scream and stomp his feet.\u201d \u201cI think people misconceive the expression of emotion with the idea of having emotion,\u201d Love said. The bailout of the banking industry helped keep Wall Street alive and credit flowing, while Obama passed his Wall Street reform through Congress. But before his first 100 days were over, he managed to upset constituencies across the spectrum. Emanuel said, \u201cThe heads of the banks hate him, and a lot of other people think all he\u2019s done is protect them. He\u2019s both a socialist and an advocate for the 1%. Go figure how you were both a socialist and an advocate for the 1% simultaneously.\u201d End run on health care Obama ran on a promise to reform the nation\u2019s health care system, but Emanuel was one of his confidants who cautioned against the politics of health care reform, telling the president he would \u201cdedicate a year minimum\u201d of his presidency to the push. \u201cThe chances of success given 80 years is like, oh, one out of a million,\u201d Emanuel said. Despite the warnings, reform topped the president\u2019s priorities, an initiative Maraniss said was tied to his drive to be a \u201cgreat president,\u201d instead of just \u201canother president.\u201d Obama\u2019s plan to put the initial efforts in the hands of Congress resulted in a total impasse, with nearly a half-dozen plans floating around Capitol Hill. Many GOP members attached words such as \u201cgovernment takeover,\u201d \u201cmandated abortion\u201d and \u201cdeath panels\u201d to the plans, while congressional committees continued to debate the legislation. Rage soon erupted in constituent town halls across the country, and the tea party movement latched onto the health care plan as a pillar of its message, carried out through rallies, marches and speeches in the summer of 2009. When Republican Scott Brown won the Senate seat in Massachusetts once occupied by Sen. Ted Kennedy, the late liberal lion, in January 2010, the president lost the last vote he needed to pass health care. His staff urged him to abandon the effort or return to it later. Longtime friend and aide Valerie Jarrett said the mood in the White House was dark. \u201cWe were in the Oval Office, and everyone was discouraged, and one of his senior advisers said to him, \u2018You know, Mr. President, unless you\u2019re feeling lucky, I just don\u2019t think this is gonna happen.\u2019 \u201d Jarrett recalls the president saying, \u201cLook, my name\u2019s Barack Obama.  And I\u2019m in the Oval Office. I\u2019ve got to be lucky.\u201d Maraniss said the president is cautious and deliberative most of the time but is also capable of making incredibly bold moves. He lobbied Congress and ultimately passed a bill through a procedural end run. \u201cThe president I believe is the ultimate three-point shooter with a second left on the clock,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cHe is, and to his credit, he\u2019s got a lot to show for it.\u201d He accomplished something that had eluded presidents for 75 years that allowed children to stay on their parents\u2019 health care longer and prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, among other perceived successes. But it also mandated coverage, and opponents say it will drive up the cost of coverage in the future, aspects that have only deepened partisan divides, hurried the growth of the tea party movement and supplied Republicans with talking points. A restless base An exchange at a town hall with Obama in September 2010 was evidence some of the president\u2019s supporters were frustrated with the economy and the status of some of his campaign promises. At a CNBC event, supporter Velma Hart told Obama she was \u201cexhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for and deeply disappointed with where we are right now.\u201d Looking back on the moment, Hart said she and her friends were not \u201cfeeling the change that we were all so excited about.\u201d Many Latino voters were disappointed that the president failed to push for immigration reform in his first year as he had vowed. In addition, Republicans blocked the DREAM Act that would have allowed children of undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States. Obama\u2019s administration deported more illegal immigrants than any other. Although he appointed Sonia Sotomayor as the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice, many Latinos, who make up an ever-growing voting bloc, were disappointed. \u201cI think a lot of people came in with the sort of, sort of narrower focus on what he would do for them, not really understanding he\u2019s more pragmatic perhaps than they expected,\u201d Maraniss said. The gay community, another group that overwhelmingly supported Obama in 2008, was also disappointed heading toward the midpoint of the Obama presidency. Candidate Obama promised a repeal of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell\u201d military policy that barred openly gay men and women from serving in the military, but once in office he asked members of the community to wait patiently despite increased pressure in public and behind the scenes. Jarrett said the president wanted \u201cbuy-in,\u201d including that of military leaders, to ensure \u201cgays could serve in the military proudly and without being alienated or ostracized, and have the support.\u201d The repeal passed through Congress and became law almost two years after Obama was elected. Jarrett said it was \u201cone of his largest civil rights accomplishments.\u201d As the nation\u2019s first African-American president, Obama was perhaps expected to tackle issues of race in ways previous presidents have not. He recently told Black Enterprise magazine he is \u201cnot the president of Black America. I\u2019m the president of the United States of America.\u201d Comments around two incidents with racial undertones received intense media coverage. He spoke out after the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. by a white police officer outside his home, saying the police \u201cacted stupidly.\u201d And more recently Obama said if he had a son, he would look like Trayvon Martin, the unarmed Florida teenager shot and killed by a neighborhood watchman. While some African-Americans have been critical of the president\u2019s failure to speak out on problems disproportionately facing the community, such as high incarceration rates and unemployment, Harvard professor Randall Kennedy said that \u201cgreat masses of black Americans have been quite realistic and have understood the special burdens that Barack Obama faced.\u201d A shellacking The 2010 elections were a culmination of the frustration felt around the country. Bolstered by the tea party, Republicans claimed six seats in the Senate, and 63 Republicans swept into the House, giving the GOP the majority. Obama conceded he experienced a \u201cshellacking\u201d at the time, while it appeared the American people had buyer\u2019s remorse, rejecting the president they embraced so warmly just two years earlier. While support for the president\u2019s policies has not been consistent, he has continued to score with his personality. \u201cMost Americans, polls show, like Barack Obama,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cThey like him as a person; it\u2019s the politics they don\u2019t like.\u201d Brinkley said the president wins points with the public when he \u201csings a little song,\u201d as he did with Al Green in 2012, \u201cacts a little cool,\u201d shoots baskets or tells a joke. \u201cPeople still swoon over him,\u201d Brinkley added. In his book, \u201cBarack Obama: The Story,\u201d Maraniss used the Hawaiian phrase, \u201ccool head, main thing\u201d to describe Obama\u2019s even-keeled temperament. He said elements of that philosophy have played out in his presidency \u201cfor better and worse.\u201d His closes aides said that \u201ccool\u201d nature has been an asset in the Oval Office. \u201cWhen things get challenging, he\u2019s at his best,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cSo that coolness is a great quality in a leader.\u201d Obama says fatherhood trumps schmoozing But that characteristic has not always been an asset \u2013 Obama has placed a priority on his time as a father over schmoozing in the capital. Maraniss said his priorities work well for a balanced life but are \u201cnot necessarily good for a president.\u201d The president acknowledged more efforts may be required on both sides of the aisle should he be elected for a second term to get things done. But those efforts will not come at the expense of his being a father. Jarrett points out that Obama grew up largely without a father. \u201cHis father abandoned him, and he\u2019s lived with that kind of missing piece in him,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cAt a very young age, he decided he wasn\u2019t going to be the kind of father he had. He wanted to be a present father.\u201d When asked about the role that first lady Michelle Obama plays in the president\u2019s life, Goolsbee, who has worked with the president since his time in the Senate, said, \u201cFundamentally he\u2019s a guy who really loves his wife.\u201d Brinkley described her role as keeping him \u201cgrounded, to make sure his ego isn\u2019t a Macy\u2019s float that takes off.\u201d First lady to set tone for convention A fierce competitor, who even coaches his daughter Sasha\u2019s basketball team the Vipers, Obama is a famously avid basketball player. His aide Love often plays with the president and said he leads the country like he plays the sport. \u201cYou know, sometimes \u2026 you get a bad call,\u201d Love said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t extend or overextend too much emotion worrying about what just happened.\u201d \u201cFrom an efficiency standpoint, you know, you can cry about the call or you can look to the next play,\u201d Love added. Longest 40 minutes That calm nature was on display in one of Obama\u2019s largest national security tests. While Obama was delivering his stand-up routine at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in 2011, halfway around the world a group of Navy SEALs was moving into position to capture or kill the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden. Planning for the raid started in secret months before then. David Sanger, who chronicled the raid in his book \u201cConfront and Conceal,\u201d said the president was intimately involved in the planning of the raid and ordered more helicopters to land inside Pakistan, where bin Laden was hiding. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said given the disagreement on how to proceed within the national security team, it was ultimately the president\u2019s call. \u201cHe asked each and every one of us \u2013 in the small group of the National Security Council that was \u2013 at the table \u2013 what our opinion was.  And there was disagreement,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo it came down as it does in these situations \u2013 with the hard decision having to go to the president.\u201d When making decisions, the president said he tries to \u201cpull back a little bit and take the long view.\u201d \u201cI think for me (to) be able to step back and say, \u2018All right, what\u2019s best for the country?\u2019 and not get caught up in the immediate fears, risks, concerns \u2026 and pressures that you\u2019re feeling right then has probably been helpful,\u201d Obama said. The president has described the operation as the longest 40 minutes of his life, but the path he chose, the riskiest of the options, paid off. \u201cTo those on the left who watched how the Obama presidency played out, the surprise was his aggressiveness,\u201d Sanger said. \u201cTo those on the right, the surprise was his aggressiveness. They kept thinking he was a community organizer from Chicago who had no concept of how to use American power.\u201d Peter Bergen: Sense and nonsense about Obama and Osama Long before the bin Laden raid, Obama had promised a change to American foreign policy, a change that resulted in a Nobel Peace Prize just 10 months after taking office. Since then, he has pulled troops from Iraq, created a plan for withdrawal from Afghanistan, is believed to have unleashed a covert cyberwar against Iran\u2019s nuclear program and drastically expanded the use of armed drones to target terrorists. The topic of drones is one the president addressed only once before. \u201cMy most sacred duty as president and commander in chief is to keep the American people safe,\u201d Obama said. \u201cDrones are one tool that we use.\u201d And the policy extends to American citizens believed to be targeting the United States. \u201cWhen an American has made the decision to affiliate itself with al Qaeda and target fellow Americans \u2026  there is a legal justification for us to try to stop them from carrying out plots,\u201d Obama said. Asked if he struggled with the policy, Obama replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to slip into a situation in which you end up bending rules thinking that the ends always justify the means,\u201d Obama said. When America is threatened, the president has not hesitated to act on his own. But in humanitarian crises, such as Libya\u2019s, the president prefers company. Without it, he has failed to act, as with the ongoing crisis in Syria. \u201cSyria has created great outrage and terrible humanitarian anguish,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have any international consensus about the way forward.\u201d He is aggressive at times and reserved at times, a combination some call the \u201cObama doctrine,\u201d and critics have charged is an example of his reluctance to lead. \u201cThe Obama doctrine is \u2018less blood, less treasure, less intervention of a lengthy kind,\u2019 \u201d Sanger said. Failed negotiations a turning point Eight months after the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission offered up painful solutions to help tackle the country\u2019s fiscal problems that were largely ignored by Washington and eight months after significant Democratic congressional losses in the midterms, Obama and Boehner, now House speaker, met on the golf course. It was the start of long negotiations as both men attempted to reach an agreement to avoid a national default on America\u2019s loans and a path forward to decrease the ever-expanding debt. \u201cThe president and I like each other,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cI mean, we actually do get along.\u201d While Vice President Joe Biden publicly worked on a deal with members of Congress, the president and House speaker met repeatedly in an attempt to reach a compromise. Republicans advocated significant cuts to spending. Democrats wanted to limit tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. The plan constructed by Obama and Boehner would raise the debt ceiling and include changes to Social Security, Medicare, tax policy and defense spending, proposals that were difficult for members on both sides of the political aisle to swallow. \u201cI think he genuinely thought that there was an opportunity to do something big and meaningful to deal with our long-term debt and have what he considered productive discussions with John Boehner,\u201d Axelrod said. Boehner insisted the two had a deal, but the president changed the terms. Obama insisted he didn\u2019t \u2013 rather the speaker could not control his conference. Boehner has described working with the White House as \u201clike working with Jell-O.\u201d Obama balked at that description, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure that that is how he puts it.\u201d \u201cI was prepared to make \u2026 some cuts and some changes that were very unpopular in my base and among Democrats if I got a little bit of compromise from the other side on revenue,\u201d Obama said. Boehner said the breakdown was his greatest disappointment in his two years as speaker and it served as a turning point for the president. Brinkley said he sees the failed negotiations as a turning point. \u201cIt took him, I think, two years to the debt ceiling debate to understand that he was not going to be able to be the conciliatory president, the mediator in chief,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cHe was going to be the 99-to-1 guy. He was going to have to engage in the kind of Theodore Roosevelt, roll up your shirt sleeves and pound the opponent campaign style if he wanted to get re-elected.\u201d A year after the breakdown of the deal, the president said he will work with Republicans, where he can, but where \u201cthey don\u2019t want to compromise, I\u2019ll work around them.\u201d And that was the path he took. 2012 election Seared after losing the grand bargain on debt reduction, the president turned his attention to a new battle: re-election. \u201cI think his na\u00efvet\u00e9 has been finally squashed,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see that na\u00efve, \u2018Yes, we can\u2019 man of 2008 ever again. \u2026 He\u2019s been through too many combat zones \u2026 to return to that kind of innocence.\u201d Barreling toward his battle for re-election, the president shifted his focus from wooing Republicans to winning back disappointed supporters. Women voters were chief among them. He stood by his controversial decision to make most health care plans cover contraception and often reminds women he acted to ensure with equal pay through the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first bill he signed as president. For three years, the president said little on the issue of same-sex marriage. But after a statement of support from Biden during an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d the president stopped \u201cevolving\u201d on the issue and came out in support of same-sex unions. \u201cHe is not a person that likes to leave the box,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cBut when he does, he\u2019s done it decisively. I think his embracing of gay marriage was very bold.\u201d And in June, the administration temporarily halted the deportation of the children of undocumented immigrants. \u201cHe said, \u2018OK, enough is enough. And now we\u2019re going to take administrative action,\u2019\u201d Jarrett recounted. Five things to know about big change in immigration policy For the president to be the kind of transformational leader he wants to be, he needs two terms, Brinkley said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it in one,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cSo everything is riding on this election for Barack Obama.\u201d Opinion: Obama\u2019s second term would look different",

            "article_content": "The newly anointed Republican ticket campaigns Friday in Florida and Virginia MItt Romney says President Obama has failed, and that he will restore America's greatness \"What America needs is jobs, lots of jobs,\" Romney tells the GOP convention CNN analysts pan Clint Eastwood's convention appearance Promising his traditional conservative policies will restore America\u2019s greatness, Mitt Romney accepted the Republican presidential nomination and then prepared to campaign with his running mate on Friday in two swing states vital to their chances of defeating President Barack Obama in November. In the most important political speech of his life, Romney on Thursday night evoked themes and imagery of GOP icon Ronald Reagan in describing to a cheering Republican National Convention a future of opportunity and promise for the nation after what he called the failed policies under Obama. He recalled the excitement of the country in electing Obama four years ago, saying the president\u2019s campaign theme of \u201chope and change\u201d had a powerful appeal. \u201cBut tonight, I\u2019d ask a simple question: If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn\u2019t you feel that way now that he\u2019s President Obama?\u201d Romney said. \u201cYou know there\u2019s something wrong with the kind of job he\u2019s done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.\u201d What we learned from the RNC Republican convention: The best photos Romney's speech: Did he win the crowd? Romney: I wish Obama had succeeded Eastwood uses empty chair as prop While his own patriotism caused him to hope Obama would succeed, the president\u2019s promises \u201cgave way to disappointment and division,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we can do something. With your help we will do something,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the moment when we can stand up and say, \u2018I\u2019m an American. I make my destiny. And we deserve better! My children deserve better! My family deserves better. My country deserves better!\u2019\u201d When Romney finished, clouds of red, white and blue balloons floated down as running mate Rep. Paul Ryan joined  him on stage, followed quickly by their wives and families amid the cheers and confetti. Storm-shortened convention concludes He and Ryan will campaign together on Friday in Florida and Virginia, then head to Ohio on Saturday as Democrats prepare to hold their convention next week in Charlotte, North Carolina. Romney\u2019s prime-time, nationally televised address concluded a storm-shortened convention that sought to galvanize the conservative Republican base behind him and frame the upcoming election as a referendum on Obama\u2019s presidency. Protesters briefly interrupted him early in the speech, with one shouting \u201cpeople over profits\u201d in reference to the multimillionaire former businessman\u2019s career in private equity. The crowd shouted \u201cU.S.A, U.S.A\u201d to drown them out, and one was removed after a brief scuffle. Ryan had energized the convention on Wednesday night with a powerful attack on Obama that championed conservative principles. On Thursday, speakers, including Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood, laid the foundation for Romney\u2019s highly anticipated speech that was intended to provide those Americans just tuning in to the presidential race with an introduction to the man and candidate. CNN analysts called the speech successful in appealing to the base and showing Romney\u2019s personal side, but also said it was business-like at times and offered no new ideas or proposals from the candidate who has been on the trail for the past year. \u201cIt had a lot of heart. It needed more soul. It needed more poetry,\u201d said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, while Gloria Borger, the CNN chief political analyst, said the themes Romney emphasized showed what audience his campaign wanted to reach \u2013 Obama supporters disappointed with the president today and women, who polls show favor the Democratic incumbent. Rubio: Obama is a bad president RNC declares Romney and Ryan nominees Reaction to Clint Eastwood's RNC speech She and CNN Chief National Correspondent John King panned Eastwood\u2019s appearance, which included a comedy routine of a fictional discussion with Obama, as a mistake by organizers that detracted from the candidate\u2019s defining speech. In his address, Romney provided a biographical look at his life, talking about his parents \u2013 who both held or ran for political office \u2013 and his Mormon faith. Earlier, members of his church gave testimonials to Romney\u2019s help and compassion during past crises, such as the early death of one couple\u2019s son. Five OMG moments from the RNC A rose for his mother and raising five boys Criticized for being stiff and impersonal at times on the campaign trail, Romney told stories of family life  \u2013 the single rose his father, former Michigan Gov. George Romney, gave his mother every day, and the incessant household noise in raising five boys. Paying tribute to his wife, Ann, Romney expressed admiration for the role of women in society in a bid to appeal to women voters. Romney also injected humor, telling how he decided against approaching his church as a young man to invest in his new company. \u201cI figured it was bad enough I might lose my investor\u2019s money, but I didn\u2019t want to go to hell, too,\u201d he quipped. Romney then focused on his ideas for ending the nation\u2019s economic challenges \u2013 lingering high unemployment, sluggish economic recovery, and a chronic deficit and debt problem. \u201cToday the time has come for us to put the disappointments of the last four years behind us, to put aside the divisiveness and the recriminations, to forget about what might have been and to look ahead to what can be,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to restore the promise of America. Many Americans have given up on this president but they haven\u2019t ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America.\u201d Focusing his message on the economy \u2013 an issue that polls show him winning with voters \u2013 Romney said the country\u2019s needs are not \u201ccomplicated or profound.\u201d \u201cWhat America needs is jobs, lots of jobs,\u201d he said, arguing Obama offers only more of the same to people who \u201cnow believe that the future will not be better than the past.\u201d He repeated campaign-tested promises to repeal Obama\u2019s 2010 health care reforms detested by conservatives, increase domestic oil production, reduce government regulations and cut taxes on businesses. Romney also pledged to assert U.S. might and influence around world, saying \u201cwe will honor America\u2019s democratic ideals because a free world is a more peaceful world.\u201d Other issues mentioned reflected traditional conservative policies \u2013 opposition to gay marriage and abortion, no tax increase for the middle class, and strong support for Israel. \u201cIf I am elected president of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America, to lift our eyes to a better future,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThat future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it, our nation depends upon it, the peace and freedom of the world require it. And with your help we will deliver it. Let us begin that future for America tonight.\u201d Mormon speakers at RNC mark sharp departure from Romney\u2019s reticence on faith Rubio and a Reagan tribute Eastwood and other preceding speakers, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, sounded similar themes in different ways. Gingrich and his wife, Callista, narrated a tribute to Reagan that focused on differences between the policies and vision of the former president compared to those of Obama and Jimmy Carter, who preceded Reagan in the White House. Republicans seek to draw parallels between Obama and Carter, who lost to Reagan in 1980  after serving one troubled term. Rubio, whose parents came to America from Cuba, emphasized the theme of American opportunity that offered a new life to his family and allowed him to become a U.S. senator. Referring to his father, who worked as banquet bartender, Rubio said: \u201cHe stood behind a bar in the back of the room all those years, so one day I could stand behind a podium in the front of a room.\u201d \u201cThat journey, from behind that bar to behind this podium, goes to the essence of the American miracle \u2013 that we\u2019re exceptional, not because we have more rich people here,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe\u2019re special because dreams that are impossible anywhere else, come true here.\u201d Eastwood used an empty chair as a prop for his one-sided talk with Obama, drawing laughs by portraying the president as unable and unwilling to defend his policies. He called 23 million Americans out of work a \u201cnational disgrace,\u201d and said \u201cpossibly it may be time for somebody else to come along and solve the problem.\u201d For Romney, 65, the nomination puts him within one step of the goal he first sought in 2007 by running for president after serving as a Republican governor for four years in traditionally Democratic Massachusetts. Who won and who lost in Tampa A political tightrope Though rivals including Gingrich challenged his conservative credentials in the 2012 primaries, Romney emerged victorious. Now he continues to walk a political tightrope in trying to energize right-wing support while also appealing to moderates and independent voters. On Wednesday, Ryan used the biggest speech of his still young political career to tell the party faithful and the American public Wednesday that time is running out to solve the nation\u2019s fiscal problems, but the GOP ticket can do it if elected. \u201cWe will not duck the tough issues \u2013 we will lead,\u201d Ryan said in his prime-time address televised nationwide. \u201c\u2026 The work ahead will be hard. These times demand the best of us \u2013 all of us, but we can do this. We can do this. Together, we can do this.\u201d Romney chose Ryan, the conservative House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin, as his running mate in hopes that the fiscal expert known for big and hard-line ideas would strengthen support on the political right and appeal to moderates and independents seeking solutions for the nation\u2019s economic woes. Ryan, 42, focused mostly on the fiscal issues that are his strength, such as the national debt, stimulus spending under Obama and his proposed Medicare reforms that would partially privatize the government health care system for senior citizens. Obama and Democrats have attacked the Ryan plan, and he sought to turn the tables on the issue by repeating the factually challenged assertion that the president cut Medicare by more than $700 billion to cover the costs of the 2010 health care reform law passed by Democrats. Did Romney gain ground? The figure comes from a July 24 Congressional Budget Office report that said repealing the health care law, as called for by Romney and Ryan, would increase spending on Medicare by $716 billion through 2022. At the same time, the CBO letter said keeping the law known as Obamacare in place would not mean a $716 billion decrease in Medicare spending, as claimed by Ryan. Independent fact-checking organizations have rated the Medicare cut accusation first made by Romney as mostly false. Ryan, however, said he and Romney welcomed the debate on how to ensure the long-term solvency of the popular entitlement program that is a key part of America\u2019s social safety net. Democrats also questioned the accuracy of other statements in Ryan\u2019s speech, including an insinuation that Obama was responsible for a General Motors plant closing in the congressman\u2019s hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, evern though plans to shut it down were announced before the 2008 election. Ryan also criticized Obama for rejecting a deficit reduction plan worked out by a commission that Ryan serve on, but eventually voted against its report. Ryan has \u201cmade a decision to just simply separate himself from the facts and the truth,\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who heads the Democratic National Committee, told CNN. Asked Thursday about those issues, Ryan told CNN that his broader point was that Obama has failed to deliver on promises \u2013 whether to help workers at that GM plant keep their jobs or develop a comprehensive plan to reduce the nation\u2019s mounting deficits and debt. Obama: Romney \u2018wants to go backwards\u2019 Romney and Republicans contend that Obama\u2019s policies, such as stimulus spending, have worsened an already bad economic situation the president inherited from the previous GOP administration of President George W. Bush. They propose traditional conservative policies to shrink government, cut taxes and drastically reform entitlements, steps they say will bring economic growth and job creation. Obama and Democrats call  such prescriptions failed policies of the past and propose increased revenue sources such as higher taxes for wealthy Americans to be part of a deficit reduction plan that includes some spending cuts and entitlement reforms. \u201cOn almost every issue (Romney) wants to go backwards, sometimes all the way to the last century,\u201d Obama said Wednesday at a campaign event in Virginia. The president told Time Magazine in an interview made public Thursday that Democrats are not proposing radical solutions, and the nation doesn\u2019t need drastic changes. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, then you can make modest reforms on entitlements, reduce some additional discretionary spending, achieve deficit reduction and still preserve Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid in ways that people can count on,\u201d Obama told Time, later adding that the country needs \u201csome commonsense solutions that stay focused on helping middle-class families.\u201d \u201cThe only reason that you would have to go further than that is if there\u2019s no revenue whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a major argument that we\u2019re having with the Republicans.\u201d The convention proceeded as Hurricane Isaac drenched the Gulf Coast after making landfall in Louisiana on Tuesday night, the eve of the seven-year anniversary of devastating Hurricane Katrina. The storm prompted Republican organizers to postpone the first day of the convention, which was a crucial opportunity for defining Romney to the American people. Romney clinched the GOP nomination in the roll call of state delegates Tuesday after a rugged Republican primary campaign that saw momentum swings nearly every week and bitter attacks by GOP colleagues The 2,200-plus convention delegates also approved a conservative platform that calls for less government, opposes same-sex marriage and endorses a \u201chuman life amendment\u201d to ban abortion, with no specific exceptions for cases of rape, incest or when the mother\u2019s life is threatened. Throughout the convention, speaker after speaker has emphasized his or her own humble beginnings as descendants of immigrants who worked hard to achieve success for their families and never expected government help or handouts. Virtually every speaker took umbrage with Obama\u2019s comment on the campaign trail that \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d in reference to successful businesses that received government help along the way. The latest CNN/ORC International poll indicates a dead heat between Romney and Obama, with new numbers released Sunday showing that 53% of likely voters believe Obama is more in touch with their needs, compared with 39% for Romney. Obama leads by an equal margin when it comes to being in touch with the middle class, and six in 10 say Obama is in touch with the problems facing women today, with just over three in 10 feeling the same way about Romney. Romney leads 48% to 44% over Obama on managing the government effectively and has a 6-point advantage on having a clear plan for fixing the nation\u2019s problems. Both figures are within the survey\u2019s margin of error. Clint Eastwood, the empty chair and the speech everyone\u2019s talking about CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak, Kevin Bohn, Paul Steinhauser, Dana Davidsen, Ashley Killough, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Halimah Abdullah, Martina Stewart, Shawna Shepherd, Rachel Streitfeld and Mark Preston, and HLN\u2019s Ed Hornick contributed to this report.",

Huckabee addresses Romney's Mormonism Social issues and the GOP Christie defends his RNC speech Romney and Ryan: 'A generation apart' Obama and Democrats have attacked the Ryan plan, and he sought to turn the tables on the issue by repeating the factually challenged assertion that the president cut Medicare by more than $700 billion to cover the costs of the 2010 health care reform law passed by Democrats. The figure comes from a July 24 Congressional Budget Office report that said repealing the health care law, as called for by Romney and Ryan, would increase spending on Medicare by $716 billion through 2022. At the same time, the CBO letter said keeping the law known as Obamacare in place would not mean a $716 billion decrease in Medicare spending, as claimed by Ryan. Undecideds nudge toward Romney? Independent fact-checking organizations have rated the Medicare cut accusation first made by Romney as mostly false. Ryan, however, said he and Romney welcomed the debate on how to ensure the long-term solvency of the popular entitlement program that is a key part of America\u2019s social safety net. Democrats questioned the accuracy of other statements in Ryan\u2019s speech, including an insinuation that Obama was responsible for a General Motors plant closing in the congressman\u2019s hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin when plans to shut it down were announced before the 2008 election. Ryan also criticized Obama for rejecting a deficit reduction plan worked out by a commission that Ryan worked on and eventually voted against its report. Ryan has \u201cmade a decision to just simply separate himself from the facts and the truth,\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who heads the Democratic National Committee, told CNN. Asked Thursday about those issues, Ryan told CNN that his broader point was that Obama has failed to deliver on promises \u2013 whether to help workers at that GM plant keep their jobs or develop a comprehensive plan to reduce the nation\u2019s mounting deficits and debt. America\u2019s role in the world Romney and Republicans contend that Obama\u2019s policies, such as stimulus spending, have worsened an already bad economic situation the president inherited from the previous GOP administration of President George W. Bush. They propose traditional conservative policies to shrink government, cut taxes and drastically reform entitlements, which they say will bring economic growth and job creation. Obama and Democrats say such prescriptions are failed policies of the past and call for increased revenue sources such as higher taxes for wealthy Americans to be part of a deficit reduction plan that includes some spending cuts and entitlement reforms. \u201cOn almost every issue (Romney) wants to go backwards, sometimes all the way to the last century,\u201d Obama said Wednesday at a campaign event in Virginia. Fact Check: Paul Ryan and the debt commission The president told Time Magazine in an interview made public Thursday that Democrats are not proposing radical solutions, and the nation doesn\u2019t need drastic changes. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, then you can make modest reforms on entitlements, reduce some additional discretionary spending, achieve deficit reduction and still preserve Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid in ways that people can count on,\u201d Obama told Time, later adding that the country needs \u201csome commonsense solutions that stay focused on helping middle-class families.\u201d \u201cThe only reason that you would have to go further than that is if there\u2019s no revenue whatsoever. And that\u2019s a major argument that we\u2019re having with the Republicans.\u201d The convention is proceeding as Hurricane Isaac drenches the Gulf Coast after making landfall in Louisiana on Tuesday night, the eve of the seven-year anniversary of devastating Hurricane Katrina. The storm prompted Republican organizers to postpone the first day of the convention, which is a crucial opportunity for defining Romney to the American people. Romney clinched the GOP nomination in the roll call of state delegates Tuesday after a rugged Republican primary campaign that saw momentum swings nearly every week and bitter attacks by GOP colleagues The 2,200-plus convention delegates also approved a conservative platform that calls for less government, opposes same-sex marriage and endorses a \u201chuman life amendment\u201d to ban abortion, with no specific exceptions for cases of rape, incest or when the mother\u2019s life is threatened. Personal stories of hard work, success Throughout the convention, speaker after speaker has emphasized his or her own humble beginnings as descendants of immigrants who worked hard to achieve success for their families and never expected government help or handouts. Virtually every speaker took umbrage with Obama\u2019s comment on the campaign trail that \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d in reference to successful businesses that received government help along the way. Ron Paul supporters protest The latest CNN/ORC International poll indicates a dead heat between Romney and Obama, with new numbers released Sunday showing that 53% of likely voters believe Obama is more in touch with their needs, compared with 39% for Romney. Obama leads by an equal margin when it comes to being in touch with the middle class, and six in 10 say Obama is in touch with the problems facing women today, with just over three in 10 feeling the same way about Romney. Romney leads 48% to 44% over Obama on managing the government effectively and has a 6-point advantage on having a clear plan for fixing the nation\u2019s problems. Both figures are within the survey\u2019s margin of error.

            "article_content": "NEW: Ann Romney tells America to trust her husband to fix the nation's problems MItt Romney will be formally nominated Thursday as the GOP presidential candidate The Republican convention approves a conservative platform The convention resumes after a one-day delay because of Hurricane Isaac Mitt Romney officially clinched the GOP presidential nomination on Tuesday to move a step closer in his five-year quest for the White House. To roaring cheers at the Republican National Convention in the packed Tampa Bay Times Forum, the delegation from New Jersey put Romney above the 1,144-delegate threshold, ensuring he will be the GOP challenger to President Barack Obama in November. Earlier, the 2,200-plus convention delegates approved a conservative platform that called for less government, opposed same-sex marriage and endorsed a \u201chuman life amendment\u201d to ban abortion with no specific exceptions for cases of rape, incest or when the mother\u2019s life is threatened. Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, will be formally nominated on Thursday, and Romney\u2019s acceptance speech that night will conclude the convention that had its agenda delayed by Hurricane Isaac, which hit Louisiana as early evening speakers addressed the delegates. Politics behind Republican Convention The post-convention bounce Storm watching with the Republicans Isaac conjures bad memories for delegates Republican officials appeared determined to stick to a tightened three-day schedule that kicked into full gear earlier in the day with official business and speeches accusing Obama of failed leadership and undermining the American dream. Speaker after speaker emphasized their own humble beginnings as descendants of immigrants who worked hard to achieve success for their families and never expected government help or handouts. Romney\u2019s wife, Ann, repeatedly referred to her first date with the man she fell in love with in urging Americans to trust him to fix the nation\u2019s problems. In the biggest political speech of her life, Mrs. Romney touched on issues considered vulnerabilities for her husband \u2013 support from women, his personal wealth \u2013 and encouraged people to look closely at his record and get to know him for the warm and loving man she met at that high school dance. \u201cYou are the best of America,\u201d Mrs. Romney said of the nation\u2019s women. \u201cYou are the hope of America. There would not be an America without you. Tonight we salute you and sing your praises.\u201d She avoided any mention of controversial issues such as the anti-abortion stand in the convention platform that polls show is opposed by most Americans, instead focusing on the day-to-day challenges facing women throughout the country. \u201cI\u2019m not sure men really understand this, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a woman in America who really expects life to be easy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re too smart to know there aren\u2019t easy answers but we\u2019re not dumb enough to expect there aren\u2019t better answers.\u201d She concluded by declaring \u201cyou can trust Mitt,\u201d adding: \u201cHe loves America. He will take us to a better place, just as he took me home safely from that dance.\u201d As the convention crowd cheered and applauded, Romney came out in his first appearance at the convention to hug and kiss his wife, telling her: \u201cYou were fabulous.\u201d Earlier, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus launched the litany of attacks on Obama, saying that another term for the president and Vice President Joe Biden will mean \u201cfour more years of failure.\u201d In reference to Obama, Priebus said \u201che hasn\u2019t even run a garage sale or seen the inside of a lemonade stand.\u201d The nation needs a president \u201cwith real experience in a real economy,\u201d Priebus added. \u201cMitt Romney will be that president.\u201d Other speakers continued the effort by Priebus to frame the election as a referendum on Obama\u2019s policies. \u201cThe American people are still asking \u2018where are the jobs,\u2019 but President Obama only offers excuses instead of answers,\u201d U.S. House Speaker John Boehner told the delegates. \u201cHis record is a shadow of his rhetoric. Yet he has the nerve to say that he\u2019s moving us forward, and the audacity to hope that we\u2019ll believe him.\u201d Boehner also said \u201cwe can do better,\u201d adding that \u201cit starts with throwing out the politician who doesn\u2019t get it, and electing a new president who does.\u201d Rep. Dan Benishek of Michigan complained earlier that Democrats in Washington were \u201cspending away our children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s futures,\u201d while Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina serenaded Obama with a chorus of the Ray Charles tune, \u201cHit the Road, Jack.\u201d At a campaign event in Iowa, Obama said Tuesday that he expected the GOP convention to be \u201ca pretty entertaining show.\u201d \u201cI am sure they will have some wonderful things to say about me,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut what you won\u2019t hear from them is a path forward that meets the challenges of our time.\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie concluded the first night of speeches with a keynote address that declared Republicans were willing to face the tough issues and find solutions that work, instead of taking the easy way out and pandering for voter support. \u201cLeadership delivers. Leadership counts, and leadership matters,\u201d Christie said, recounting his own record of reforms as a GOP governor in a majority Democratic state. \u201cMitt Romney will tell us the truths we need to hear\u201d and solve the problems worsened by an \u201cera of absentee leadership in the White House,\u201d he added. What the GOP needs to do in Tampa In a sign of lingering internal division in the party after a rugged primary campaign won by Romney, rival candidate Rep. Ron Paul of Texas was thronged by supporters when he entered the convention floor before Tuesday\u2019s session convened. Some Paul supporters shouted \u201clet him speak,\u201d referring to their candidate\u2019s exclusion from the convention agenda. Paul supporters later protested a rule change adopted by the convention that they believe will hinder their kind of grassroots campaign in the future. They also cheered wildly when Paul received any delegates in the state-by-state roll call. Convention organizers acknowledged they were monitoring Isaac, which made landfall one day before the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina\u2019s devastating march through Louisiana and Mississippi. Priebus opens RNC in Tampa Conventions and the power of 'spectacle' Republican convention CEO: Well prepared Touring the floor of the RNC in Tampa They are concerned about the perception of a celebratory convention with colorful balloons and soaring rhetoric juxtaposed with a storm slamming the Gulf Coast at the same time, potentially evoking memories of Katrina\u2019s wrath and ensuing criticism of the response of the Republican administration of George W. Bush. However, Romney and Republicans are reluctant to lose any more of their best opportunity to define the candidate for the American people with less than three months until the election. \u201cHe is a very shy guy. He is a humble guy. He doesn\u2019t like to talk about himself. That\u2019s who he is,\u201d Boehner said of Romney in an interview Tuesday with CNN. \u201cBut I\u2019ve known Mitt Romney for a long time. Decent, honest, hardworking guy. And I think Thursday he\u2019ll have a chance to reintroduce himself to the American people.\u201d The acceptance speech will give Romney a major chance to speak for himself, rather than be defined by either his Republican primary rivals or by Obama, Boehner said. \u201cHe\u2019s been locked in this Republican primary and then locked into this battle with the president,\u201d the Ohio Republican added. \u201cAnd as a result, people have all different kind of views of him. So I think Thursday night is clearly an important speech for him and I think he\u2019ll have a chance to reintroduce himself to the American people, most of whom are just paying attention now.\u201d For Romney, 65, the nomination will put him closer to the goal he first sought in 2007 by running for president after serving as a Republican governor for four years in traditionally Democratic Massachusetts. The multimillionaire businessman lost to veteran Sen. John McCain in the Republican primary campaign in 2008, then spent the next two years preparing for another try. He emerged victorious from the primaries during which rivals challenged his conservative credentials, and continues to walk a political tightrope that attempts to galvanize right-wing support while also trying to appeal to moderates and independent voters. Has the tea party sold out? The Romney campaign and Republicans have a big fund-raising advantage over Obama and Democrats, due in part to unlimited private donations to conservative super-PACs. GOP friendlier to gays \u2013 behind the scenes The latest CNN/ORC International poll indicates a dead heat between Romney and Obama, with new numbers released Sunday showing that 53% of likely voters believe Obama is more in touch with their needs, compared with 39% for Romney. Obama leads by an equal margin when it comes to being in touch with the middle class, and six in 10 say Obama is in touch with the problems facing women today, with just over three in 10 feeling the same way about Romney. Romney leads 48% to 44% over Obama on managing the government effectively and has a six-point advantage on having a clear plan for fixing the nation\u2019s problems. Both figures are within the survey\u2019s margin of error. \u201cThe challenge facing Romney at the GOP convention is to build on those managerial strengths while at the same trying to convince average Americans that he is in touch with their problems. Obama\u2019s personal characteristics, for the moment, outshine Romney\u2019s,\u201d CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. On specific issues, the poll results show a similar dynamic: Obama is generally ahead on foreign policy and social issues, while Romney is generally preferred on economic issues. Another new poll released Monday showed Romney and Obama neck-and-neck in Florida, a battleground state, and North Carolina, where the Democratic convention will take place next week. Republicans say the Republican convention must focus on Romney\u2019s character and show how he can lead the nation to economic prosperity, which is the top issue with voters. GOP\u2019s anti-slavery roots The Obama campaign, anticipating a Romney branding effort by Republicans, released a movie trailer-style video Sunday that previewed a \u201cdo-over\u201d moment for Romney. In a statement accompanying the video, the Obama campaign said it is \u201cpresenting Americans with an epic cinematic preview of Mitt Romney\u2019s \u2018convention reinvention\u2019 \u2013 the Do-Over moment that voters have grown to expect \u2013 because they\u2019ve seen this movie before.\u201d The GOP platform contains traditional conservative planks, including support for the \u201chuman life amendment\u201d with no exceptions to an abortion ban. That runs counter to overall public opinion in America, especially among women, a demographic that polls show favoring Obama far more than Romney at this point. Unfriendly to women? Not my GOP Romney and Ryan, the conservative House Budget Committee chairman, have been asked repeatedly about differences between their personal views on whether there should be limited abortion exceptions. Romney\u2019s Mormon faith calls for the narrow exceptions, while Ryan, a devout Catholic, supports a blanket ban. The campaign has made clear the ticket supports Romney\u2019s stance, which contrasts with the party platform. Frum: Second Obama term would be different The only speaker Tuesday night to touch on the abortion issue was conservative Rick Santorum, who attacked Romney\u2019s conservative credentials in the Republican presidential primary campaign. In his speech, the former senator from Pennsylvania backed Romney to end what he called destructive policies of Obama that undermine American values. \u201cI thank God that America still has one party that reaches out their hands in love to lift up all of God\u2019s children - born and unborn - and we say, and we say that each of us has dignity and all of us have the right to live the American Dream,\u201d Santorum said to cheers.

            "article_content": "Romney advisers view \"image\" scores as one of his biggest challenges Hurricane Isaac presents a distraction for what should be Romney spotlight Republicans go into convention recognizing that President Obama is vulnerable Romney must use convention to begin to change perceptions about him The black and white images form a Reaganesque ring around the concourse of the Tampa convention hall, sending an unmistakable message: This is now Mitt Romney\u2019s Republican Party. Romney\u2019s convention challenges are many, beginning with what his top advisers unanimously say is their overriding goal: improve his \u201cimage\u201d scores \u2013 meaning how voters view him on questions of likeability, empathy, and understanding the struggles of the middle class. How much Hurricane Isaac interferes with Team Romney\u2019s careful script is an open question. Publicly, as they canceled one day of the convention and juggled the agenda for others, convention organizers have kept an air of confidence they can achieve the goals despite the disruption and distraction. Privately, however, there is a sense of frustration among some top Romney aides and advisers that the storm will steal too much of their spotlight, too much of their precious audience with the American people. Poll: Obama vs. Romney on the issues Presidential race close in swing states What Romney needs to do at RNC Romney sons: What America means to us But there is also no mistaking the opportunity: Few Republicans arriving at their convention four years ago thought victory was a real possibility; those here in Tampa \u2013 even those with reservations about Romney \u2013 know President Barack Obama is highly vulnerable. GOP convention: 5 things to watch out for By the numbers, this race is about as close as it gets \u2013 a dead heat in national polls, and nine \u201ctossup\u201d states in a CNN Electoral College analysis that, at the moment, shows the president with an advantage but also offers Romney several plausible paths to 270 and victory. To win, however, Romney must use his convention to change \u2013 or more realistically to begin to change \u2013 the political undercurrents that make this a too-close-to-call race despite an economic environment that by most historical models would suggest a distinct Republican advantage. Consider the empathy gap, the gender gap, and what you might call the ghosts of Massachusetts. Empathy gap: Romney tends to have an advantage when voters are asked which candidate would better handle the economy \u2013 and this question is by far the No. 1 voter concern. Yet Obama consistently leads, and by a decent margin, when voters are asked who best understands their struggles. In our latest CNN/ORC International poll, for example, Obama leads 53%-39% when likely voters nationwide were asked who best understands the middle class. In a close race, if voters are torn between the candidates, trust and likeability come into play; Romney must narrow this empathy gap if he is to take full advantage of profound doubts about the president\u2019s economic stewardship. The gender gap: Romney benefits from an edge among male voters and suffers from a deficit with female voters. In that same poll,  for example, the Romney-Ryan ticket has a 10-point nationwide edge among men, but trails the Obama-Biden ticket by 12 points among women. When George W. Bush won a second term in 2004, in a relatively close election, he had an 11-point advantage among men and only a 3-point deficit among women. Given Obama\u2019s rock-solid standing among African-Americans and Latinos, closing the gap with white women who live in the suburbs and exurbs is a critical Romney convention priority. Ghosts of Massachusetts: Romney won\u2019t appreciate the comparison, but if he is to do what fellow Bay Staters Michael Dukakis and John Kerry failed to do, he must learn the lessons of their defeats. Like Dukakis did in 1988, Romney arrives at his convention viewed as talented, and competent \u2013 more of a technocrat than an ideologue. Dukakis left his convention ahead in the polls, but \u2013 believing competence would carry the day \u2013 did little as the George H.W. Bush campaign portrayed him as far to the left of mainstream America. Now, the Obama campaign is trying to cast the Romney-Ryan ticket as far to the right of the mainstream on issues ranging from Medicare to abortion rights. Exorcising the ghost of Kerry is connected to closing the empathy gap. Like Kerry in 2004, Romney is viewed by a big chunk of the electorate as elitist and distant \u2013 even indifferent. The Obama campaign and its super PAC allies spent millions this summer pushing that image of Romney. To improve his November odds, the governor must use his convention spotlight to improve what voters think of his record in business, and prove compassion has a role in his decision making. Ann Romney\u2019s speech is a critical part of the Romney reset effort. So is the 15-minute introduction Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio will deliver Thursday night. He told CNN he would show the country how Romney is a \u201crole model\u201d for how he juggles being a husband, father and grandfather with his business and political career. Romney\u2019s principal audience is Americans watching at home, especially undecided and persuadable voters in the key battleground states. But he also has some convincing to do in the Tampa convention hall. In our latest poll, 69% of Republicans said the party should nominate Romney, 30% said someone else. While that clearly shows some buyer\u2019s remorse in the GOP,  he is in better standing with his party and its convention delegates than McCain was four years go. Then, 57% of Republicans said McCain should be nominated, while 42% wanted someone else. Party conventions a prelude to trench warfare",

            "article_content": "NEW: Mitt Romney will arrive in Tampa on Tuesday Republican convention gavels to order, then goes into recess due to Tropical Storm Isaac The storm headed for the northern Gulf Coast could still affect the convention schedule Louisiana Gov. Jindal will stay home because of the approaching storm Monday was supposed to be Obama-bashing day to launch the Republican National Convention, and GOP organizers showed they were not going to let something like bad weather totally derail their agenda. While the full proceedings of the first day were canceled because of Tropical Storm Issac, effectively cutting the planned four-day convention to three, Republican officials kept up their efforts to frame President Barack Obama\u2019s leadership as a failure in terms of achievement, direction and substance. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gaveled the convention to order at 2 p.m. ET to cheers from several hundred delegates who showed up to witness the brief session that then went into recess until Tuesday. He pointed out a digital clock in the convention hall tabulating the amount of additional national debt accrued during the proceedings, telling the delegates and journalists, \u201cWe also wanted to draw your attention to the unprecedented fiscal recklessness of the Obama administration.\u201d The original schedule called for targeting Obama on the first day to set up the desired contrast with MItt Romney at the gathering that will formally nominate the former Massachusetts governor as the Republican candidate against the incumbent president in November. Despite the lost day, GOP officials said criticism of Obama\u2019s presidency would be a consistent theme throughout the week. \u201cWhat we would want to do is define what President Obama has done over the last four years, how and why he\u2019s failed, and why his leadership has really failed the American people,\u201d said Russ Schriefer, a strategist for Romney\u2019s campaign. \u201cStagnant economy, increasing debt, you know, and more importantly, the disappointment that many Americans feel in President Obama that he just hasn\u2019t lived up to the promises of the past four years.\u201d Isaac could hinder GOP chance to define Romney at convention Schriefer acknowledged at the same time Monday that convention organizers were keeping a nervous eye on Tropical Storm Isaac. Forecast to reach hurricane strength, Isaac churned through the Gulf of Mexico on the same path as Hurricane Katrina, a storm that devastated New Orleans seven years ago this month. What Romney needs to do at RNC Tampa security tight for GOP convention Storm watching with the Republicans Gingrich: Ron Paul won't embarrass son Full proceedings are now scheduled to begin Tuesday, when the convention\u2019s 2,200-plus delegates will adopt a conservative platform and endorse Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, as the GOP ticket. Romney will arrive in Tampa on Tuesday, his campaign said. \u201cWe are continuing to go ahead with our program with Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday,\u201d Schriefer said, adding that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna make sure that we monitor the storm as it proceeds and see what happens over the next few days.\u201d The concern is the perception of a celebratory convention atmosphere with colorful balloons and soaring rhetoric as a hurricane slams into the Gulf Coast, evoking memories of the havoc caused by  Katrina and the ensuing criticism of the Republican administration\u2019s response. Did the RNC jump the gun by delaying convention? \u201cObviously, our first concern is for the people who are in the path of the storm,\u201d Schriefer said, describing \u201ca wait-and-see attitude to see what happens with the storm.\u201d Romney has shown no inclination to further delay the proceedings that offer his best chance to define himself to Americans  who, according to polls, think Obama is more in touch with their daily lives and needs. \u201cOur sons are already in Tampa and they say it\u2019s terrific there, a lot of great friends,\u201d he told reporters in a brief exchange Monday, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to a great convention.\u201d Delegates who found themselves with an open day attended state meetings and talked about travel challenges getting to Tampa, as well as packing for a possible hurricane. \u201cI packed a flashlight! Never done that before,\u201d Cyndy Aafedt of North Dakota said. \u201cI even went and bought batteries before I came.\u201d So far, the biggest casualty of the shortened schedule has been a planned appearance by Donald Trump. The real estate mogul and outspoken conservative was going to take part on Monday, but has scheduling conflicts the rest of the week, Schriefer said. He added it was still possible that  Trump would show up before the convention ends Thursday night. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, considered a rising conservative star in the Republican Party, also will not attend because of the storm bearing down on his state. Members of the Louisiana delegation in Tampa sounded torn over being away from loved ones under possible threat. \u201cI think that for Louisiana people, we know that the political part of it is important, what we\u2019re here for, but it is hard to celebrate in some ways when you have your heart in a different place,\u201d delegate Adonica Duggen said. A more reclusive Republican backer, Nevada billionaire Sheldon Adelson, is expected to attend the convention, a source with knowledge of the plan told CNN. Adelson and his wife are expected to listen to many of the speeches, especially ones by Ann Romney on Tuesday night and Mitt Romney on Thursday night. Together, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson have given at least $36 million to various organizations and candidates this campaign season, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the influence of money in politics. Adelson, a casino magnate and one of the nation\u2019s richest men, has told friends he is willing to spend up to $100 million this election season to make sure a Republican is elected to the White House and to support GOP congressional candidates. Such unlimited backing from private and corporate donors has helped Romney and Republicans gain a big fundraising advantage over Obama and Democrats. Has the tea party \u2018sold out\u2019 to the GOP? In a new ad on Monday, the liberal MoveOn.org\u2019s political wing attacked Romney for what the group claims is his focus on the rich. The 30-second spot, titled \u201cStepping on the Middle Class,\u201d features Romney and Ryan look-alikes stepping on people dressed as typical middle-class Americans \u2013 firefighters, students, seniors and children \u2013 as they walk across the convention floor to accept the GOP nomination. \u201cThe ad is aimed at conveying to voters how Romney and Ryan would raid the middle class to transfer wealth to the top 1%,\u201d the group said in a statement. While the CNN/ORC International Poll indicates a dead heat between Romney and Obama, the new numbers released Sunday show that likely voters believe Obama is more in touch with their needs. \u201cThe public gives Obama a big advantage over Romney on questions on caring about people and understanding their concerns,\u201d said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, adding that Romney\u2019s strong points  in the minds of poll respondents are his managerial skills and having a clear plan to solve the country\u2019s problems. According to the poll, 53% of likely voters say Obama cares about the needs of people, with 39% feeling the same way about Romney. Obama leads by an equal margin when it comes to being in touch with the middle class, and six in 10 say Obama is in touch with the problems facing women today, with just over three in 10 feeling the same way about Romney. Romney has a 48%-44% margin over Obama on managing the government effectively and a 6-point advantage on having a clear plan for fixing the nation\u2019s problems. Both are within the survey\u2019s margin of error. No more niceness: Obama, Romney try to rain on each other\u2019s parade \u201cThe challenge facing Romney at the GOP convention is to build on those managerial strengths while at the same trying to convince average Americans that he is in touch with their problems. Obama\u2019s personal characteristics, for the moment, outshine Romney\u2019s,\u201d Holland said. On specific issues, the poll results show a similar dynamic: Obama is generally ahead on foreign policy and social issues while Romney is generally preferred on economic issues. According to the survey, likely voters prefer Obama\u2019s policies on gay and lesbian issues by 59%-33% and choose Obama over Romney on abortion by 53%-40%. The president also has a 51%-44% advantage over Romney on foreign policy and a 50%-43% margin on terrorism. The candidates were statistically even on the economy, with Romney\u2019s 50%-46% advantage within the survey\u2019s margin of error, and Romney holds a 10-point advantage on handling the federal deficit. Another new poll released Monday showed Romney and Obama neck-and-neck in Florida, a battleground state, and North Carolina, where the Democratic convention will take place next week. The CNN/Time Magazine/ORC poll had both races statistically even, with Obama\u2019s 50%-46% advantage in Florida and Romney\u2019s 48%-47% lead in North Carolina both within the margin of error. Republican organizers say the shortened convention schedule provides enough time for all the planned major speeches, though some will be shortened to fit the revised schedule. Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008 who had the first day of his nominating convention in Minneapolis shortened because of a hurricane then threatening the Gulf Coast, agreed that losing one night is manageable. However, McCain told NBC on Sunday, \u201cIt could be harmful if we lose more than that.\u201d Speakers guide to the RNC In a sign of how badly the party wants to hold the convention to showcase Romney, GOP officials have not ruled out extending it by a day to Friday if necessary, a Republican source told CNN. On Sunday talk shows, Republicans said the convention must focus on Romney\u2019s character and show how he can lead the nation to economic prosperity, which is the top issue with voters. \u201cIt\u2019s the vision of Mitt Romney versus the record of Barack Obama, and facts just are stubborn things,\u201d Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell told ABC, adding that \u201cthe middle class is hurting\u201d and people want \u201cresults, not rhetoric.\u201d The Obama campaign, anticipating the Romney branding effort by Republicans, released a movie trailer-style video Sunday that previewed a \u201cdo-over\u201d moment for Romney. In a statement accompanying the video, the Obama campaign said it is \u201cpresenting Americans with an epic cinematic preview of Mitt Romney\u2019s \u2018convention reinvention\u2019 \u2013 the Do-Over moment that voters have grown to expect \u2013 because they\u2019ve seen this movie before.\u201d Responding to the video, Romney\u2019s campaign said Sunday the president was relying on \u201cnegative attacks\u201d as a way to distract from his own record. However, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told ABC that Romney is vulnerable to being portrayed as a political opportunist because of the right-wing positions he adopted during the rugged primary campaign against conservatives such as Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. \u201cI suspect that they are not going to be able to Etch A Sketch their way out of this campaign,\u201d Villaraigosa, a Democrat, said in a reference to a Romney aide\u2019s comment earlier this year about resetting the campaign message. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to put away all the things they said in the primary and all the things they have in their platform right now.\u201d Last week, controversial comments by conservative Republican Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri ignited a political firestorm about rape and abortion as the Romney team sought to build momentum up to the convention. Akin, who won Missouri\u2019s Republican Senate primary to challenge Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in November, told an interviewer that women have an undefined biological response to what he called \u201clegitimate rape\u201d that oftentimes prevents pregnancy. Rove slams Akin Romney and a full spectrum of GOP politicians, from the RNC to tea party groups, condemned Akin\u2019s comments and called for him to drop out of a race considered crucial to Republican hopes of winning a Senate majority. Akin apologized and called his remarks incorrect, but he has refused to end his Senate bid. The imbroglio has given new life to McCaskill, considered the most vulnerable Democratic senator running, and caused chagrin within the Republican establishment. Republican strategist Karl Rove kept up the criticism of Akin on Monday, telling a breakfast in Tampa hosted by Politico that Akin is a good man with a good heart who \u201csaid a really stupid, indefensible thing from which there is no recovery, and if he really cares about the values of conservatism and pro-life, he will not go down for defeat as the biggest loss by a Republican candidate for Senate in modern history.\u201d Some conservatives, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, have defended Akin\u2019s decision to stay in the Missouri race, but Rove was unmoved. \u201cI talk to some conservatives who say, \u2018It\u2019s not fair. We have to stand with him,\u2019\u201d Rove said. \u201cWell, it is unfair. I get that. But it was also incredibly wrong, and there was no recovery from it. It would be one thing if it was some minor misstatement. But this was pseudo-science and morally incomprehensible.\u201d A further concern is that Akin\u2019s comments focused attention on the volatile abortion issue in the run-up to the convention, when the Romney campaign wanted to talk about the candidate\u2019s prescriptions for high unemployment and slow economic growth under Obama. Instead, Romney and Ryan, the conservative House Budget Committee chairman, have been asked repeatedly about differences between their personal views on whether abortion should be banned in all cases or permitted only for pregnancies from rape, incest or that threaten the life of the mother. Romney\u2019s Mormon faith supports the narrow exceptions, while Ryan \u2013 a devout Catholic \u2013 supports a blanket ban. The campaign has made clear the ticket supports Romney\u2019s stance, which also contrasts with the party platform that convention delegates are scheduled to vote on this week. In an interview with Fox broadcast on Sunday, Romney again answered questions on the Akin comments, saying \u201cit obviously is being used by Democrats to try and cast a shadow on our entire party, and it\u2019s not.\u201d At the same time, Romney noted that Democrats are \u201cwise enough to understand\u201d that Akin\u2019s comments can hurt Republicans. Meanwhile, a new Romney ad Sunday continued his campaign\u2019s aggressive stance on another potentially vulnerable issue: Medicare. Romney on faith, family and private life Like previous Romney spots, the new ad includes a claim that, \u201cAs president, Barack Obama cut $700 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare,\u201d the 2010 health care reform law despised by Republicans. The claim cites a report from the Congressional Budget Office that shows repeal of the president\u2019s health care law would mean an additional $716 billion in spending on Medicare. However, it ignored the same report\u2019s finding that the additional spending would come from rising costs and inefficiencies that the health care law would have addressed, rather than restoring money cut from Medicare. The Obama campaign has called the Romney claim on Medicare false, citing the CBO report, and repeatedly attacked the Medicare reform plan proposed by Ryan that would partially privatize the government-run health care program for senior citizens. Democrats claim the Republican proposal would \u201cend Medicare as we know it,\u201d while Ryan says his plan is the kind of reform necessary to ensure Medicare\u2019s long-term solvency. According to the poll results released Sunday, likely voters are evenly divided between the candidates on the Medicare issue.

            "article_content": "The controversy puts GOP's social conservatism in the campaign spotlight It detracts from Mitt Romney's desired focus on economic issues Analyst: Democrats will use Akin's hardline stance as a scare tactic Forecasters downgrade GOP chances of winning the Missouri Senate race If there is any silver lining for Republicans from the Todd Akin imbroglio, no one seems to have found it yet. Election forecasters have downgraded the Missouri congressman\u2019s chances of winning the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill because of his incendiary comments on rape and pregnancy. The story dominates political coverage in the week before the Republican National Convention, forcing certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney to repeatedly address it when he wanted to focus on convincing Americans why he would be a better president than Barack Obama. Even more, the controversy surrounding Akin\u2019s remarks on \u201clegitimate\u201d rape has forced Republicans to publicly confront the 15,000-pound elephant in their living room: the party\u2019s internal rift between traditional fiscal conservatives such as Romney and the increasingly influential social conservatives of the religious right such as Akin. Akin's claims called \"utter hogwash\" Friedman: Akin's comments 'despicable' Davis: Akin's move makes sense to Akin Defiant Akin staying in race Republican officials told CNN on condition of not being identified that the Akin controversy hurts on several fronts. It decreases the chances of capturing McCaskill\u2019s Senate seat, which is crucial to GOP hopes of winning control of the chamber, they said. Akin takes on \u2018party bosses,\u2019 insists he \u2018can win this race\u2019 At the same time, the brouhaha shifts the national discussion to divisive social issues that could repel swing voters rather than economic issues that could attract them in a climate of high unemployment and stumbling recovery, the GOP officials said. \u201cNo party wants to be defined by its most extreme element,\u201d noted Darrell West, the vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what has happened to Republicans. The danger is that voters will see the party as out of step and not see Akin as an aberration.\u201d The debate that Republicans sought to focus on economic issues such as the budget deficit and tax reform now covers the full spectrum of GOP policy, including the conservative stance on abortion stated by Akin and included in the party platform for next week\u2019s convention, noted Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University. \u201cWhen the hard-core conservative policy differences of the Republican Party are emphasized, it really reduces the GOP ability to win over independents, undecided and even Democrats disappointed with Obama,\u201d Schiller said. West agreed, saying the impact could turn the November choice \u201cinto an up-or-down vote on the two party visions, and Democrats like that because it means the election is no longer a referendum on high unemployment.\u201d The Republican reaction to the Akin controversy shows the level of concern. Top leaders including Romney, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and five past and present Republican senators from Missouri such as John Danforth and Christopher \u201cKit\u201d Bond called for Akin to drop out of the race. \u2018Legitimate rape\u2019 reaction, from the Congo to black crickets The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and the American Crossroads super PAC that backs GOP candidates both announced that they will stop spending money on the Missouri Senate race. Even tea party groups that have backed Akin in the past said he should step aside for the good of the party and the conservative cause. Akin, who won a tough primary battle this month, has apologized for his comments but also stubbornly defied the pressure to get out of the election. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he described the race as a \u201ccause\u201d with the goal of strengthening the anti-abortion voice in Washington. \u201cI believe that there is a place for people to look for a message that\u2019s big enough to deal with the size of America\u2019s challenges today,\u201d Akin said in an interview Tuesday on conservative commentator Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show. \u201cAnd the defense of the unborn and the deep respect for life which underlie our American culture are very important, and I don\u2019t think we should run away from them.\u201d Since the controversy erupted Sunday, two of the top nonpartisan political handicappers altered their ratings of the Senate race in Missouri. The Cook Political Report moved its ranking from \u201ctoss-up\u201d to \u201clikely Democrat,\u201d and the Rothenberg Political Report changed its assessment from \u201ctoss-up/tilt Republican\u201d to pure \u201ctoss-up.\u201d \u201cThis firestorm that Todd Akin has created for himself has engulfed not only him but we think any chance whatsoever of being able to salvage this race as long as he\u2019s in this race,\u201d Steve Law, the president and CEO of American Crossroads, said Wednesday. \u201cI think he unfortunately doesn\u2019t recognize it yet, but he\u2019s dealt a mortal blow to his candidacy.\u201d According to Republican officials, a failure to wrest McCaskill\u2019s seat from the Democrats would mean GOP candidates must win in Montana, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Massachusetts to seize the majority. Opinion: Raped, pregnant and ordeal not over In traditionally liberal Massachusetts, incumbent Republican Scott Brown is in a tough re-election battle with Democrat Elizabeth Warren, the consumer\u2019s rights advocate from the Obama administration. Not surprisingly, Brown was the first national Republican figure to call for Akin to get out of the Missouri race. He also made a public plea Tuesday for the Republican platform at next week\u2019s convention to be more flexible on the abortion issue than the current plank that backs a \u201chuman life amendment\u201d banning abortion with no stated exceptions. \u201cIf we are to grow and succeed in all parts of this great nation, we must be a \u2018big-tent\u2019 party,\u201d Brown wrote in a letter to Priebus, the RNC chairman. \u201cThere are people of goodwill on both sides of the abortion issue, and we need to send a message to voters that there is room in the Republican Party for differing perspectives.\u201d Analysts Schiller and West agreed that Brown was trying to separate himself from the Republican image presented by Akin of rigid opposition to abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. The Democratic message will be that \u201cif you give Republicans control in the Senate, guys like Todd Akin are going to be controlling your life, controlling your bodies,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cThis is going to be a turning point for the Democrats. Instead of making this a localized race, they are going to scare voters with a picture of Todd Akin.\u201d In response to the Akin controversy, Romney made clear that his policy would allow abortion in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother, which is consistent with his Mormon faith and the stance of former Republican presidents such as George W. Bush. Opinion: Wake up \u2013 it\u2019s not just Akin However, it differs from both the party platform endorsed Tuesday and the personal views of his running mate, conservative Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a devout Catholic who has cast repeated House votes opposing abortion. The Akin controversy ensured that such a discrepancy received major media attention. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman known for his economic expertise, has been asked about it in every exchange with journalists this week. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my record\u201d opposing abortion, he said Wednesday. \u201cMitt Romney is going to be president, and the president sets policy. His policy is exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. I\u2019m comfortable with it because it\u2019s a good step in the right direction.\u201d In an interview Tuesday with a CBS affiliate in Pittsburgh, Ryan was asked about legislation he sponsored that initially included a reference to \u201cforcible rape\u201d \u2013 the same point Akin claimed he was trying to make but wrongly referred to as \u201clegitimate\u201d rape. The issue involves the longstanding insistence by abortion opponents that women falsely claim they were raped in order to get an abortion. In his initial remarks and follow-up explanations this week, Akin has backed off by admitting he was wrong to try to distinguish rape in any way or suggest that women who were forcibly raped had a biological response that impeded pregnancy. Ryan sought to cut off the issue, telling the interviewer: \u201cRape is rape, period. End of story.\u201d Romney, meanwhile, has been accused of flip-flopping on the abortion issue in his career. He expressed a more moderate view when he ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 and then adopted a more conservative stance in launching his first presidential campaign in 2006. The Romney campaign managed to avoid damage on the issue during the primary campaign, even when conservative rivals Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich raised questions about Romney\u2019s conservative credentials. Opinion: GOP policy is the scandal, not just Akin\u2019s comments Now, any campaign efforts to avoid discussing the volatile abortion issue have been rendered moot by Akin\u2019s incendiary remarks. \u201cHe\u2019s simply the poster boy for the longstanding position of the GOP on abortion,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cThat has now become inescapable for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\u201d Anti-abortion activists acknowledge that a candidate espousing a rigid anti-abortion stance with no exceptions for rape, incest or the mother\u2019s health was less likely to win in today\u2019s political environment. Advocating exceptions has \u201cbeen mostly for political viability and expediency\u201d rather than out of any serious debate among anti-abortion activists, said Ralph Reed, who leads the conservative Faith and Family Coalition. At the same time, Reed noted that abortions in response to rape and incest are a \u201cstatistically insignificant portion of abortions as a whole, even as they represent a significant national tragedy.\u201d The focus on GOP calls for no-exception abortion bans, Reed said, is \u201can attempt by the left to raise a bogeyman and by the media to raise \u2018gotcha questions\u2019 with candidates who are pro-life.\u201d iReport: \u2018Rape is rape\u2019 \u2013 Akin should step down CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Paul Steinhauser and Dan Gilgoff contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Todd Akin used the term \"legitimate rape\" in talking about pregnancy and abortion He has apologized but was under pressure from the GOP to drop out of the Senate race By election time, Akin's gaffe could fade from voter memory \u201c#Akin\u201d was still trending on Twitter on Tuesday, two days after the Missouri congressman committed a gaffe on rape. And Missouri voters were still reeling from what many viewed as an incendiary choice of words. Republican Todd Akin had until 5 p.m. to decide whether he ought to remain in a U.S. Senate race but had already announced that he was not quitting, despite the pressure from his own party. He has apologized for saying that a woman\u2019s body is capable of preventing pregnancy in cases of \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and asked for forgiveness in a television ad. In his home state, people were divided over whether the six-term representative should drop out. Clock ticking for Akin as GOP urges him to withdraw Beverly Johnson of  St. Charles, Missouri, in the heart of Akin\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, said she voted for Akin in the past and plans to vote for him again. \u201cI cringed because basically I agree with his stance on abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the way he said it, it could have been worded differently. \u2026 A legitimate rape? You know, like, what rapes aren\u2019t legitimate?\u201d Still, she thinks it\u2019s too soon to pass judgment. Opinion: GOP policy is the scandal, not just Akin\u2019s comments \u201cI think, let\u2019s let it play out and see what happens.\u201d Judi Meredith, a Democrat and owner of a counseling practice that often deals with rape victims, said she was horrified by Akin\u2019s comments. He should withdraw from the race immediately, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a really terrible crime that\u2019s used against people, and if he doesn\u2019t know and understand the dynamics there and what goes on and why that happens and how it happens, he\u2019s not qualified, in my opinion, to be a candidate for something like that.\u201d Two large newspapers in Missouri, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Kansas City Star, both ran editorials weighing in on the matter, though neither called for him to withdraw. \u201cThe phrase \u2018legitimate rape\u2019 is no better or worse than \u2018forcible rape,\u2019 \u201d the Post-Dispatch said. \u201cThey are sexist terms used to distinguish between such things as an attack from a stranger and date rape. This is language used to disguise the types of sentiments that were once OK to express \u2013 such as suggesting that a woman who was raped after being dressed in provocative clothing was \u2018asking for it.\u2019 \u201cWhether Missouri Republicans stick with Mr. Akin or toss him aside, they\u2019re stuck with a problem of their own making. A legitimate problem.\u201d Piers Morgan puts up empty chair after Akin cancels appearance The Star said it abhorred Akin\u2019s comments but, noting the outcry for him to step aside, said: \u201cWe will not add our voice. Traditionally, we favor letting democratically elected candidates rise or wither on their own merits. In the absence of financial or criminal malfeasance, the voters\u2019 decision determines the contest. The crime of intemperate remarks doesn\u2019t necessarily win a do-over or the chance for the party to choose a stronger contender.\u201d Top Republican officials have indicated that Akin should give up the Senate race. Under Missouri law, Akin would require a court order to do so if he waits beyond the 5 p.m. deadline Tuesday. Gene Wood, a Republican who supported Akin in the past, said he plans to do so again \u2013 gaffe or no gaffe. \u201cIt strikes me that this is a tempest in a teapot,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he used a word that in reflection he wouldn\u2019t use again, like the word \u2018legitimate.\u2019 Forcible. But this is just a matter of semantics. \u201cI think people are looking for something to accuse Todd or drag him down when he, I don\u2019t think he said anything that\u2019s really worth all the coverage that it\u2019s getting.\u201d Wood said. Independent voters were more critical. Jennifer Derfeld said she cast a ballot for Akin in the past but not in the last election and probably not in the Senate race, either. \u201cI don\u2019t understand where he would come up with that,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, either you have been raped or you have not been raped. It\u2019s not legitimate or illegitimate. Its very condescending and kinda like a slap in the face for any rape victim.\u201d Paul Roesler, a political science professor at St. Charles Community College, predicted Akin would opt to stay in the race. Opinion: Wake up, it\u2019s not just Akin \u201cWhy would he drop out? If he drops out now, his political career is over,\u201d Roesler said. Roesler\u2019s take was this: Akin made a pretty powerful mistake, but he might find forgiveness in  a conservative state like Missouri. \u201cYou are more likely to forgive people who you agree with ideologically,\u201d he said. It\u2019s not the first time Akin has offended people with things he has said. Last year on Family Research Council President Tony Perkins\u2019 radio show, Akin said, \u201cThe heart of liberalism really is a hatred for God.\u201d He later apologized and said his remarks were directed at liberalism as a political movement. Roesler said Akin\u2019s real trouble could come if the gender gap widens and he loses support from conservative women in Missouri who might not be able to stomach a vote for him after his remarks about rape. \u201cIf the vote were held today, he would lose,\u201d predicted Roesler. \u201cI think the Republican Party is eager for him to drop out. He is definitely a weakened candidate.\u201d The Democrats will try to ensure that the term \u201clegitimate rape\u201d stays afloat for a while, said Dale Neuman, professor emeritus of political scientist at the University of Missouri in Kansas City. And the Republicans, he said, may pull critical funding for Akin. That leaves Democrat McCaskill in a greatly improved situation in a key Republican state, Neuman said. Still, the election is many weeks away \u2013 enough time perhaps for Akin\u2019s gaffe to become faint memory. \u2018Legitimate rape\u2019 reaction, from the Congo to black crickets CNN\u2019s Moni Basu reported from Atlanta and Chris Welch from St. Charles, Missouri.",

He cited what he called a grassroots conservative movement in the country that needs a voice in government for his decision to reject increasing pressure from his own Republican Party, congressional colleagues and others to step aside. \u201cI\u2019m in this race for the long haul and we\u2019re going to win it,\u201d Akin told conservative radio host Dana Loesch. Akin \u2018legitimate rape\u2019 reaction, from the Congo to black crickets He spoke minutes after five past and present Republican senators from Missouri, including highly regarded figures John Danforth and Christopher \u201cKit\u201d Bond, added their voices to widespread calls for Akin to end his campaign. Obama: 'Rape is rape' Akin: Rape remark 'Ill conceived, wrong' Rep. Akin's controversial claims Akin cancels appearance on CNN \u201cWe do not believe it serves the national interest for Congressman Todd Akin to stay in this race,\u201d said the statement by Sen. Roy Blunt and former senators Danforth, Bond, John Ashcroft and Jim Talent. \u201cThe issues at stake are too big, and this election is simply too important. The right decision is to step aside.\u201d Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney also advised Akin to end his campaign, saying: \u201cHis fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race.\u201d Opinion: GOP policy is the scandal, not just Akin\u2019s comments Romney\u2019s running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, echoed the call, according to a statement from his spokesman. Other prominent Republicans to join the chorus urging Akin\u2019s withdrawal included Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and veteran Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. Akin complained his detractors overreacted to a liberal media campaign to take him down. He said fellow Republicans \u201cran for cover at the first sound of gunfire.\u201d His decision means he faces the first statewide race of his career with no mainstream GOP backing. After he announced his intention to stay in the race, the National Republican Senatorial Committee made clear it would not provide any help. \u201cWe continue to hope that Congressman Akin will do the right thing for the values he holds dear, but there should be no mistake \u2013 if he continues with this misguided campaign, it will be without the support and resources of the NRSC,\u201d said a statement by communications director Brian Walsh. Piers Morgan puts up empty chair after Akin cancels appearance The political drama exposes the tension in the Republican Party created by the growth of the conservative movement, particularly the birth of the tea party movement before the 2010 mid-term elections. A six-term congressman who won more than 60% support in his five re-election efforts, Akin is a staunch conservative Christian who opposes abortion. By staying in the race, Akin\u2019s candidacy ensures the abortion issue will be a focal point of next week\u2019s Republican National Convention. Romney is basing his presidential election campaign on economic issues, and the attention to social issues such as abortion distracts from his message that he is better qualified than President Barack Obama to restore strong growth and create jobs. The controversy erupted after Akin told a television interview Sunday that a woman\u2019s body is capable of preventing pregnancy in cases of \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d He later apologized, explaining he meant to say \u201cforcible rape\u201d and acknowledged that women \u201cdo become pregnant\u201d during such instances. Romney\u2019s campaign quickly distanced the candidate from Akin and declared that Romney didn\u2019t oppose abortion in cases of rape. However, the party platform being drafted ahead of next week\u2019s convention includes an endorsement of a \u201chuman life amendment\u201d to the Constitution that would outlaw abortion with no explicit exemption for rape or incest. The language, approved by the platform committee on Tuesday, is similar to the platforms that were adopted by the party at its conventions in 2000, 2004 and 2008. Convention delegates are expected to approve the platform next week. Opinion: Wake up \u2013 it\u2019s not just Akin The issue is particularly sensitive for Romney\u2019s running mate, Ryan, who is a devout Catholic opposed to abortion. The Romney campaign acknowledged that Ryan personally opposes abortion in cases of rape, but said Romney\u2019s view is the policy of the ticket. In a new ad and radio interviews Tuesday, Akin called his mistake a lone misstep with unintended consequences. \u201cRape is an evil act; I used the wrong words in the wrong way. And for that, I apologize,\u201d he said in the new ad that came out Tuesday. \u201cAs the father of two daughters, I want tough justice for predators, have a compassionate heart for the victims of sexual assault, and I pray for them. Fact is, rape could lead to pregnancy; the truth is rape has many victims. The mistake I made was in the words I said, not in the heart I hold. I ask for your forgiveness.\u201d He told the radio show of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee that \u201cthe defense of the unborn and a deep respect for life which underlie all of America \u2013 those are important parts of who we are and they are not things to run away from.\u201d Akin also characterized his mistake as isolated and relatively minor. \u201cWell it just seems that I just misspoke one word in one sentence on one day,\u201d he told Huckabee. \u201cI hadn\u2019t done anything that was morally or ethically wrong, as sometimes people in politics do. \u2026 It does seem like a little bit of an overreaction.\u201d Later, he said on the radio show of Sean Hannity that he sees no harm in continuing to remain in the race. \u201cMy interest in this race has nothing to do with me. It has to do with who we are as a nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will help Romney and I think it\u2019s going to help the Republican party.\u201d His decision won support from the Missouri Republican Assembly, which issued a statement urging the party to back Akin in the battle against McCaskill. Experts: Rape does not lower odds of pregnancy \u201cThe Republican leadership needs to grow a spine and disallow the Democrats, who always support their candidates even when they are wrong, to dictate our stance,\u201d the group\u2019s statement said.  \u201c\u2026  While Todd may have been indiscreet in his word choice, he was not wrong in his facts. Todd can win despite this misstep. All Republicans will lose if they continue throwing their candidates under the bus because of a poor word choice.\u201d However, top Republicans strengthened their calls for Akin to depart the race. \u201cIn his heart of hearts, I\u2019m certain that he is sincerely sorry for what he said, but in this instance, when the future of our country is at stake, sorry is not sufficient,\u201d Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. \u201cTo continue serving his country in the honorable way he has served throughout his career, it is time for Congressman Akin to step aside.\u201d American Crossroads, an influential conservative super-PAC, also cited the importance of the election, in which McCaskill\u2019s seat is considered vital to GOP hopes of gaining a Senate majority. \u201cRep. Akin faces a simple choice: Will he help Democrats hold the McCaskill seat and potentially the Senate majority by staying in the race, or will he help Republicans defeat Barack Obama\u2019s most reliable ally in the Senate by getting out?\u201d said Steven Law, the group\u2019s president and CEO. Nate Hodson, a spokesman for the Crossroads GPS non-profit that backs Republican candidates around the country, said the group won\u2019t spend any more money in the Missouri Senate race for now. Akin told Huckabee that he still was ahead of McCaskill in the polls, and that pundits had wrongly predicted he would lose in the GOP primary campaign that chose a Senate nominee for the November election. \u201cWe have a message that people understand,\u201d Akin said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t something that\u2019s in the brain. It\u2019s in the heart.\u201d Akin\u2019s remarks deemed \u2018harmful\u2019 to rape survivors Voters sounded split over the controversy in Akin\u2019s U.S. House district, which comprises a broad swath of suburban St. Louis including formerly rural areas that have seen a large population increase in recent decades. Gene Wood of St. Charles, about 20 miles west of St. Louis, said he voted for Akin in past elections and the recent Senate primary and still plans to support him. \u201cIt strikes me that this is a tempest in a teapot,\u201d Wood said, calling the issue \u201ca matter of semantics.\u201d Another St. Charles resident, Judi Meredith, owns a counseling business that deals with rape victims. She has not supported Akin in the past and said she was horrified by his comments. \u201cIt really showed a level of lack of knowledge and ignorance about society and rape as it\u2019s used against women as a tool of oppression,\u201d Meredith said, adding she believes Akin should withdraw. Akin asks for \u2018forgiveness\u2019 in new ad If Akin were to drop out of the race, the state Republican Party would choose another candidate to run against McCaskill, considered one of the most politically vulnerable senators in the country. Democrats have sought to portray Akin\u2019s stance on rape and abortion as indicative of the broader Republican approach to women\u2019s issues. Obama said Akin\u2019s remarks were \u201coffensive\u201d and didn\u2019t make sense, while House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called them \u201canother manifestation of the total disregard and disrespect of women by Republican leaders.\u201d After previously criticizing Akin\u2019s remarks, McCaskill issued more supportive comments later Monday. \u201cWhile I disagree with what he said, he has now in the last few hours really apologized for what he said,\u201d McCaskill noted. \u201cI think what is startling to me is that these party bigwigs are coming down on him and saying that he needs to kick sand in the face of the Republican primary voters.\u201d Opinion: Pregnant by rape? Of course Amy Kremer, chairwoman of the Tea Party Express, said Tuesday that \u201cthe fact that Claire McCaskill wants him to stay in the race speaks volumes.\u201d She said the longer Akin remains in the race, the more his comments will overshadow crucial economic issues. \u201cWhat he said is completely indefensible and changes the narrative of what\u2019s going on here,\u201d Kremer said Tuesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point with Soledad O\u2019Brien.\u201d \u201cIf he looks at the bigger picture, he will do what\u2019s best and step aside.\u201d Akin was one of the first members of Congress to join the Tea Party Caucus in 2010 and has easily won re-election in recent years. The lawmaker raised $2.2 million this cycle, as of July 18. Before the new controversy, the top nonpartisan political handicappers had rated the Missouri race a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d Should Akin quit the race? Share your views with CNN iReport.

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama slams Republican rivals over education Candidates hone in on economy, Medicare, mostly ignored Akin flap Romney and Ryan charge that Obama cut funding for Medicare to pay for health care law The ongoing furor over U.S. Rep. Todd Akin\u2019s remarks on rape and pregnancy was largely ignored on the campaign trail Tuesday as candidates for president and vice president refocused their attention on the issues that have dominated the election for weeks: Medicare and the economy. Speaking at a community college in Reno, Nevada, President Barack Obama spoke about education, slamming his Republican rivals for not having a clear plan. \u201cThis country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of all who were willing to work for it. That\u2019s part of what made us an economic superpower,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to make sure that America once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve come too far to turn back now,\u201d the president added. Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential candidate, spoke at a Pennsylvania steel plant in front of a sign reading \u201cWe Did Build It,\u201d another reference to a now-familiar Republican line against Obama, who in July said that small businesses owed part of their success to government-provided services. \u201cWe have this funny idea, Mitt and I, that if you encourage success you get more of it,\u201d Ryan said at Beaver Steel Services in Carnegie. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.  If you demonize success, if you resent success, you get less success and less prosperity, less jobs and less take home pay.\u201d The attention on the economy came as Republican leaders were ramping up their calls for Akin, a Missouri congressman, to drop out of his race for the U.S. Senate after asserting that \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely resulted in pregnancy. Mitt Romney, who spent Tuesday fund-raising in Texas, characterized the remarks as \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d and called on the Missouri lawmaker to step down. Akin allowed a state deadline to pass Tuesday, defiantly staying in the race to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. Keeping them Honest: Campaign Attacks Obama and Romney open up on faith Ryan mocks Biden over flub Akin: I'm staying in the race Akin defies calls to withdraw from Senate race Ryan, who personally maintains an opposition to abortion in all cases except when the life of the mother is at risk, also distanced himself from Akin, echoing Romney\u2019s call for him to withdraw, and did not mention the Republican dust-up at his stop Tuesday. The Wisconsin congressman chose instead to wade back into a debate over Medicare, which has been at the forefront of the campaign since he became Romney\u2019s running mate. Ryan has proposed a plan in the House that would allow private insurers to compete with traditional Medicare on an exchange, a move Democrats say would amount to a \u201cgutting\u201d of the government-run health care program for senior citizens. Ryan and Romney have hit back, pointing out that the House plan, as well as Romney\u2019s own plan, would not affect seniors currently enrolled in Medicare. They also claim Obama cut funding for Medicare to pay for his sweeping health care law. Ryan continued using the attack line Tuesday, saying Obama \u201ctreated Medicare like a piggybank to pay for Obamacare and his campaign called that an achievement.\u201d Vice President Joe Biden, campaigning in Minnesota, pushed back hard on Ryan\u2019s claim, saying the law put in place by Obama strengthened Medicare without \u201ccutting a penny.\u201d \u201cWe extended the life of Medicare by eight years,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe very thing Romney wants to eliminate now. Saving millions of seniors hundreds of dollars a year on their prescription drugs, allowing them to go to preventative care.\u201d Biden framed the upcoming election as a \u201cmake or break moment for the middle class,\u201d and took a shot at Romney for not standing by some of his claims. \u201cI don\u2019t have to talk about the character or conviction of the president compared to his rival,\u201d Biden said. \u201cPresidential elections come down to character, and the conviction of your character. The American public knowing that what you say, you mean. That you stand by what you said you would do.\u201d He also took aim at Republican economic policies in general, arguing they offer nothing new. \u201cThere\u2019s overwhelming evidence that their policies will not grow the economy. It didn\u2019t do it before and it won\u2019t now. Folks, we\u2019ve seen this movie before. And we know, we know how it ends,\u201d the vice president said. Romney, in remarks at a fund-raiser in Houston, took a jab at Obama\u2019s campaign one day after financial filings revealed the president\u2019s re-election team had spent more money than it raised in July. \u201cWe\u2019re a little wiser in our spending of dollars than the other side, apparently,\u201d Romney said, according to pool reports. \u201cI\u2019m not managing their campaign for them, but we\u2019re going to spend our money wisely. We\u2019re going to spend it to win.\u201d Money gap between Romney, Obama grows In Ohio, where he appeared earlier, Obama sharply rebuffed his Republican rivals, saying their economic plans \u2013 specifically Romney\u2019s suggestion that students struggling to pay for college borrow money from their parents \u2013 unfairly benefited the wealthy. \u201cThat\u2019s not an answer,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere is nothing a parent wants more than to give our kids opportunities we never had. And there are few things as painful as not being able to do that.\u201d \u201cI do not accept the notion that we should deny their children the opportunity of a higher education and a brighter future just because their families were hit hard by the recession,\u201d the president continued. Romney\u2019s campaign fired back, saying the president\u2019s own record on higher education was nothing to brag about. \u201cUnder this president, too many young Americans are suffering from higher college costs, more debt, and a lack of good jobs when they graduate,\u201d Amanda Henneberg, a Romney campaign spokeswoman, wrote in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s policies are just more of the same from a president who hasn\u2019t fixed the economy or kept his promises to the young people who supported him four years ago.\u201d Ryan revisits Obama circa 2008 Top Dems, Obama campaign seek to tie Romney to GOP anti-abortion stance Biden to be in Tampa during Republican National Convention",

Akin is a no-show on CNN's \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" The chairman of the RNC says he hopes Akin won't be at the national convention Akin apologizes: \"I never told anybody I was perfect\" Calls mount for the Republican candidate to drop out of Missouri Senate race Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin canceled a primetime TV appearance at the last minute Monday night, shying away from the spotlight on a day he was under fire for controversial comments he made about rape. Akin was scheduled to be on CNN\u2019s \u201cPiers Morgan Tonight.\u201d A studio was booked and a chair was set. But shortly before he was to appear, Akin canceled. He was editing a new ad, an activity that forced him to bow out, two people with ties to his campaign said. Clock ticking for Akin as GOP urges him to withdraw \u201cCongressman, you have an open invitation to join me in that chair whenever you feel up to it,\u201d said Morgan. Pressure from the mainstream Republican Party mounted on the Missouri representative throughout the day to drop his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in November because of his comments about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and opposing abortion in rape cases. McCaskill also was booked to be a guest on \u201cPiers Morgan Tonight.\u201d She canceled earlier in the day. Akin\u2019s remarks shifted the political focus Monday to abortion and women\u2019s rights, causing certain GOP nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s team to clarify the campaign\u2019s abortion stance. Top congressional Republicans, including House Speaker John Boehner, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas advised Akin to spend time considering what is best for his family, party and country \u2013 political code for urging him to withdraw. Republicans distance themselves from Akin Obama: 'Rape is rape' Akin: Rape remark 'Ill conceived, wrong' Granderson to women : Wake up \u201cWhat he said is just flat wrong in addition to being wildly offensive to any victim of sexual abuse,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \u201cAlthough Representative Akin has apologized, I believe he should take time with his family to consider whether this statement will prevent him from effectively representing our party in this critical election.\u201d The National Republican Senatorial Committee headed by Cornyn has advised Akin that it will not support his campaign if he stays in the race, a source from the group told CNN. In an interview on Monday with WMUR television in Manchester, New Hampshire, Romney echoed the sentiment of other GOP leaders, according to a tweet from the station\u2019s political director, Josh McElveen: \u201c@MittRomney on if Akin should end senate bid- \u2018he should spend 24 hours considering what will best help the country at this critical time.\u201d Akin\u2019s remarks deemed \u2018harmful\u2019 to rape survivors Missouri election rules allow a candidate to withdraw with little difficulty through Tuesday, which is 11 weeks prior to the Nov. 6 election. After Tuesday, the candidate must get a court order and pay for any necessary reprinting of ballots. The state Republican Party would choose another candidate to run against McCaskill, considered one of the most vulnerable senators in the country. Akin apologized, repeatedly, Monday for what he called a serious error in using the wrong words when he stated in an earlier interview that \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely resulted in pregnancy. \u201cRape is never legitimate. I used the wrong words,\u201d Akin said on Sean Hannity\u2019s syndicated radio show. \u201cWhen I was running for this race I never told anybody I was perfect. I make mistakes. But when I do make mistakes, Sean, I admit it and I tell people I\u2019m sorry and I\u2019ve done that from the bottom of my heart,\u201d he told Hannity. Akin asks for \u2018forgiveness\u2019 in new ad Akin made it clear he would remain in the race and said he believed the people of Missouri are capable of looking beyond the mistake. \u201cThis campaign is more than just one TV interview.\u201d Romney\u2019s camp distanced itself  from the Missouri Republican, who is in a race viewed as crucial for determining which party will control the Senate next January. In addition, the controversy drew attention away from the economic themes of Romney\u2019s campaign in the run-up to the Republican National Convention next week in Tampa, Florida. Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, held a joint town hall-style campaign event Monday in New Hampshire. Ryan also visited Romney headquarters in Boston. At the White House, President Barack Obama told reporters that Akin\u2019s remarks were \u201coffensive\u201d and didn\u2019t make sense. Asked if Akin should withdraw, Obama said that was up to Missouri Republicans. Earlier, Romney told National Review Online the comments by Akin were \u201cinsulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong.\u201d \u201cWhat he said is entirely without merit and he should correct it,\u201d Romney said, according to the website. When news of Akin\u2019s comments broke Sunday, the Romney campaign responded by declaring a definitive stance on one of the most volatile political issues in the country. A campaign statement on Sunday night said the former Massachusetts governor and Ryan differed with Akin on the matter and that \u201ca Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape.\u201d Opinion: Pregnant by rape? Of course The issue is particularly sensitive for Ryan, a devout Catholic and staunch anti-abortion politician who has previously expressed opposition to abortion in all cases except when the life of the mother is endangered. A Romney-Ryan campaign official, speaking on condition of not being identified, confirmed to CNN that Ryan\u2019s personal view opposes abortion in the case of rape. The campaign official said Ryan\u2019s stance differed with Romney\u2019s view, which was described in the statement on Sunday and is the formal position of the GOP presidential ticket. Democrats challenged the Romney-Ryan team on the issue. \u201cWhile Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are working overtime to distance themselves from Rep. Todd Akin\u2019s comments on rape, they are contradicting their own records,\u201d said an Obama campaign statement Monday. \u201cMr. Romney supports the Human Life Amendment, which would ban abortion in all instances, even in the case of rape and incest. In fact, that amendment is a central part of the Republican Party\u2019s platform.\u201d It also said that Ryan worked with Akin \u201cto try to pass laws that would ban abortion in all cases, and even narrow the definition of \u2018rape.\u2019 \u201c Other Democrats and some Republicans piled on. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said he hoped Akin would not come to the national convention in Florida. Opinion: It\u2019s not just Akin \u201cIf it was me and I had an opportunity to let someone else run to actually give ourselves a better chance of winning, I would step aside,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cCongressman Akin\u2019s statement is another manifestation of the total disregard and disrespect of women by Republican leaders,\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement, adding that it was \u201calmost impossible to believe that any political leader would suggest that any case of rape is \u2018legitimate.\u2019 \u201c In Massachusetts, Republican Sen. Scott Brown called on Akin to drop out of the race because of the \u201coutrageous, inappropriate and wrong\u201d comments. The nation\u2019s largest tea party political action committee, the Tea Party Express, similarly called on Akin to step down, describing the candidate\u2019s comments as \u201cunfortunate and inappropriate.\u201d However, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent conservative organizations rallied to Akin\u2019s defense. Top officials from the Family Research Council said Akin is the target of a Democratic smear campaign, and they also chided Republicans calling for him to step down. Connie Mackey, who heads the group\u2019s political action committee, said the organization \u201cstrongly supports\u201d Akin. \u201cTodd Akin is getting a really bad break here,\u201d Mackey told reporters.  \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the science or the legal implications of his statement.  I do know politics, and I know \u2018gotcha\u2019 politics when I see it.\u201d Leading social conservatives rally to Akin\u2019s defense Akin\u2019s controversial comments give Obama and Democrats an opportunity to further strengthen their advantage with women voters \u2013 a demographic that already favors them, according to the polls. The controversial remarks about whether abortion should be legal in the case of rape were made in an interivew with Missouri television station KTVI. A clip of the interview was posted online by the liberal super PAC American Bridge. In it, Akin explained his opposition by citing unnamed bodily responses that he said prevented pregnancy. \u201cFirst of all, from what I understand from doctors, that\u2019s really rare,\u201d Akin said of rape-induced pregnancy. \u201cIf it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,\u201d Akin continued. He did not provide an explanation for what constituted \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d He added: \u201cBut let\u2019s assume that maybe that didn\u2019t work or something. You know I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.\u201d Statistics on pregnancies that result from rape are difficult to produce, since rape is a crime that often goes unreported. The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, along with Planned Parenthood, each estimate that 5% of rapes lead to pregnancy. A 1996 study from the Medical University of South Carolina found the same percentage, adding that 32,101 pregnancies occurred annually from rape. \u201cRape can make you pregnant. Period,\u201d Aaron Carroll, associate professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine and the director of the university\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research, wrote in an opinion piece for CNN. \u201cIf you put sperm near egg, women can get pregnant.\u201d Empty chair on Piers Morgan after Akin cancels appearance Akin, a six-term U.S. congressman, touted his socially conservative values on the primary campaign trail. He opposes abortion in all circumstances and has said he also opposes the morning after pill, which he equates to abortion. McCaskill responded almost immediately to her opponent\u2019s comments, writing Sunday on Twitter: \u201cAs a woman & former prosecutor who handled 100s of rape cases, I\u2019m stunned by Rep Akin\u2019s comments about victims this AM.\u201d She later released a statement condemning her rival as \u201cignorant about the emotional and physical trauma brought on by rape.\u201d Republicans consider McCaskill, first elected in 2006, highly vulnerable in her bid for a second term. Ahead of the GOP primary, a Mason-Dixon poll showed the senator falling behind Akin and the two other main GOP primary competitors in hypothetical match ups among registered Missouri voters. Akin was one of the first members of Congress to join the Tea Party Caucus in 2010 and has easily won reelection in recent years. The lawmaker raised $2.2 million this cycle, as of July 18. Before the new controversy, the top nonpartisan political handicappers had rated the Missouri race a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d Among Akin\u2019s constituents, reactions to his comments were mixed. \u201cIt strikes me that this is a tempest in a teapot,\u201d said Gene Wood, who voted for Akin and plans to vote for him again. \u201cI think he used a word that in reflection he wouldn\u2019t use again \u2026 But this is just a matter of semantics,\u201d he said. Jennifer Derfeld, an independent who voted for Akin in the past but is not leaning toward him in the upcoming race, compared his comments to a slap in the face for rape victims. \u201cI mean either you have been raped or you have not been raped. It\u2019s not legitimate or illegitimate,\u201d she said. What happens if Akin drops Senate bid? Should Akin quit the race? Share your views with us on CNN iReport.

            "article_content": "Rep. Todd Akin's comments could dash GOP Senate hopes, impact presidential race Mitt Romney and other GOP leaders raced to denounce Akin's comments Democrats use the comments to stoke \"war on women\" campaign rhetoric If Akin stays in the race he could further damage the GOP, strategists say The fallout over U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin\u2019s controversial comments on rape jolted Republicans nationally on Monday and threatened longer-term consequences for them, potentially reviving the \u201cwar on women\u201d debate and possibly hurting their campaign to win control of the Senate. Republican leaders let out a collective groan when Akin claimed in a television interview on Sunday that \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely resulted in pregnancy, saying that \u201cthe female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\u201d A social conservative congressman, Akin apologized repeatedly as the political uproar intensified and sought to clarify his remarks, saying he misspoke. Democrats skewered him nevertheless and many top Republicans called for Akin to reconsider his decision to stay in the Missouri race a week before they nominate Mitt Romney for president at their Tampa convention. Abortion moves front and center Akin: Rape remark 'Ill conceived, wrong' Akin rape comment to shape races? Granderson to women : Wake up In an interview with the National Review Online, Romney said that Akin\u2019s comments on rape were \u201cinsulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong.\u201d But Democrats sensed a political opening to shift the conversation away from the sluggish economy, saying that Republicans led by Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, were pushing policies that were anti-women. Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor at the Cook Political Report, said Akin potentially reignited the \u201cwar on women\u201d rhetoric that factored prominently in the political debate earlier this year and for a time put Republicans on the defensive. \u201cIt plays into this Democratic messaging that it is not a party friendly to women,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cAs the top political story of the day it is going to be something that plays into the larger narrative that Democrats want in order to appeal to women voters.\u201d A Republican National Committee member who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity said the issue is \u201cis not where (Governor) Romney and his ticket want to spend their time\u201d between now and Election Day. President Barack Obama handily won over women voters in the 2008 election and holds an edge with that key bloc in his race with Romney, polls show. A recent Gallup survey showed Obama with an 8% lead over his Republican rival among women. The \u201cwar on women\u201d label stemmed in part from a fierce political fight in Washington this year over contraception coverage for employees of religiously affiliated institutions. Congress, in addition, waged a partisan fight over updates to the Violence Against Women Act. The Romney campaign has adopted a message that Democrats are the ones waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d For instance, Romney has accused the Obama\u2019s administration of failing working women. The potential longer-term implications of the Akin controversy also were evident in Republican calls for him to withdraw from his Senate race where incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill has been trailing in the polls. Republicans were concerned the flare-up would permanently harm their chances of upending McCaskill in November and push them closer to taking control of the Senate. Ron Bonjean, a veteran GOP strategist for several congressional leaders and partner at the political communications firm Singer Bonjean Strategies, said Akin\u2019s comments were \u201cpolitically indefensible\u201d and \u201cvirtually guarantees\u201d McCaskill would be re-elected. Outside of Missouri,  Republican Sen. Scott Brown, locked in a tough fight in Massachusetts, also called for Akin to step aside. Stuart Rothenberg editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, said he has been told by Republican strategists that Akin is now \u201ctoo radioactive.\u201d \u201cThere is a lot of national pressure being put on Akin that he\u2019s not going to be able to raise Republican money and get the party behind him,\u201d Rothenberg said. Akin said he plans to remain in the race. Video of the Akin interview with Missouri television station KTVI was posted online by the liberal super PAC American Bridge.

            "article_content": "An aide's comment on health care stokes conservative distrust of Mitt Romney Romney needs strong support from the conservative base to win in November Analyst: Romney needs more than dislike of President Obama to get the support he needs Conservatives have a \"fragile truce\" with Romney, one commentator says Like a lion trained on its prey, conservatives are tracking certain Republican nominee Mitt Romney for any gaffe, policy shift or other signal that shows he is really the moderate they fear instead of the right-wing ideologue they want. The continuing distrust of Romney by some on the political right will be one of the most interesting dynamics at the upcoming Republican National Convention that will formally anoint the former Massachusetts governor as President Barack Obama\u2019s challenger in November. Conservative angst over Romney skyrocketed Wednesday when his campaign press secretary highlighted the health care law Romney championed in Massachusetts, which served as a model for Obama\u2019s national reforms that are detested by the political right. Influential talk show host Rush Limbaugh blasted the remark by chief Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul as a \u201cpotential gold mine\u201d for Obama supporters, while conservative commentator Erick Erickson wrote on his RedState.com website that Romney was like a puppy that needs to be house-trained. \u201cRomney needs to know not to go there,\u201d wrote Erickson, who is a CNN contributor. \u201cThe reaction should come quickly and be vocal or the Romney campaign, which is not conservative, will take it as a tacit admission from conservatives that it is safe to let their hair down on these issues.\u201d Romney swarmed by Jersey wedding party Why Pawlenty may be Romney's VP Romney's role in tax shelter? For Republicans, the question comes down to whether traditional conservative voters \u2013 the GOP base \u2013 dislike Obama enough to overlook their apprehension that Romney is not as far to the right as they would like. \u201cConservatives still have doubts about Romney,\u201d said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey continue to worry that he\u2019s not conservative enough, and that even when he says conservative things, he doesn\u2019t really mean them.\u201d West told CNN on Thursday that the continuing doubts are a problem for Romney in what will be a close race. \u201cHe really needs a strong turnout from the base and if he doesn\u2019t get that, he loses,\u201d West said, adding that Romney \u201ccan\u2019t just rely on anti-Obama sentiment \u2013 he has to provide a reason for conservative to vote for him.\u201d Romney tried to burnish his conservative credentials during the grueling primary campaign, insisting that he had shifted to the right from past moderate positions on hot-button issues such as abortion and health care. For example, he argues that the Massachusetts health care law \u2013 which included a mandate for people to have health insurance, just like the federal provision most vehemently opposed by conservatives \u2013 was designed for the state\u2019s specific needs, rather than a federal approach. Romney has repeatedly pledged to grant waivers for all 50 states to opt out of Obamacare provisions on his first day in office, and to work for a full repeal of the federal law that passed Congress with no Republican support. However, Saul spoke positively of Romney\u2019s Massachusetts law when responding Wednesday to an attack ad by a pro-Obama super-PAC that sought to link Romney to the circumstances of a laid-off steelworker whose wife died five years after he lost his health insurance. \u201cIf people had been in Massachusetts, under Gov. Romney\u2019s health care plan, they would have had health care,\u201d Saul said on Fox News. \u201cThere are a lot of people losing their jobs and losing their health care in President Obama\u2019s economy.\u201d Erickson reacted immediately, posting on Twitter: \u201cOMG. This might just be the moment Mitt Romney lost the election. Wow.\u201d In his blog post, Erickson wrote that conservative support for Romney was not secure. \u201cNo one doubts we must beat Barack Obama. No one doubts Mitt Romney is the only vehicle with which we can beat Barack Obama,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I doubt we can if the Romney camp makes unforced errors and those errors \u2014 not being vocal about those errors \u2014 shake the fragile truce conservatives have with him in the name of beating Obama.\u201d If that truce gets shaken, Erickson continued, \u201cthere are some in the center-right coalition who lean toward the libertarian end of the spectrum who will just sit it out.\u201d \u201cThere are independents who will sit it out,\u201d he added. \u201cThey need to know Romney has seen the error of his ways and is not \u2013 as so many of the candidates in the primary season said he was \u2013 not very different from the man he is trying to beat.\u201d Christopher Arps, co-founder of Move-On-Up.org, an African-American conservative group based in St. Louis, Missouri, called Saul\u2019s comment \u201cunfortunate\u201d because \u201cit gives Obama cover during the debates when the health care issue does come up.\u201d \u201cAs it relates to conservatives, the primary is over and Mitt Romney is our nominee whether we like it or not, and some of us don\u2019t,\u201d Arps said, adding that the Romney campaign needs to \u201chammer home\u201d the economic message to exploit Obama\u2019s biggest vulnerability. The upcoming announcement of a running mate provides Romney with the chance to show conservatives he is committed to their principles, Arps said. \u201cHopefully when he picks a running mate, he picks a conservative running mate,\u201d Arps added. \u201cHis conservative bona fides are suspect.\u201d Recent polling reflects some questions about Romney among Republican voters. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday showed 83% of Republican voters feel positively about Romney, but only 41% feel \u201cstrongly favorable.\u201d That compares to 61% of Democratic voters who feel strongly favorable toward Obama, with 84% having an overall positive impression. By coincidence or on purpose, the Romney campaign on Thursday released a new television ad that veered away from the candidate\u2019s consistent attacks on Obama\u2019s economic record to take on what it referred to as the administration\u2019s \u201cwar on religion.\u201d In particular, the spot says Obama\u2019s health care law forces religious institutions to \u201cgo against their faith.\u201d \u201cWho shares your values?\u201d the announcer asks. \u201cPresident Obama used his health care plan to declare war on religion, forcing religious institutions to go against their faith. Mitt Romney believes that\u2019s wrong.\u201d West said the new ad was intended to shore up support from the GOP conservative base and others, such as Catholics concerned about the rule in the health care law that requires employers \u2013 including religiously affiliated organizations like hospitals and colleges, but not churches \u2013 to provide free access to contraception to employees through health insurance plans. \u201cThat ad helps deflect attention from (Saul\u2019s health care comments) and moves the campaign back into attack mode against the president,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel the religion issue helps them both with their base and with undecided voters.\u201d However, West noted, the Republican voting base \u201cshould be galvanized by now, but it\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cThere continue to be conservative shots against Romney and they continue to doubt his sincerity on a number of different issues,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it shows the challenges he faces within his own party.\u201d CNN\u2019s Halimah Abdullah, Kevin Liptak and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Mitt Romney's campaign raises $3.2 million in hours after the ruling President Barack Obama calls the ruling a victory for the American people The Supreme Court finds the \"individual mandate\" is constitutional as a tax The 2010 Affordable Care Act is the signature legislation of the Obama presidency The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling upholding the health care law championed by President Barack Obama reignited an intense debate, with Democrats celebrating millions of Americans getting access to insurance while Republicans railed against what they contend is a dangerous expansion of government. Thursday\u2019s narrow 5-4 ruling was a victory for Obama, causing elation at the White House, according to an administration official. \u201cToday\u2019s decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives are more secure because of this law,\u201d Obama said in a televised White House statement. Meanwhile, the ruling quickly became a rallying cry for Republicans who criticized the high court\u2019s reasoning and vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Andrea Saul, spokeswoman for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign, said Friday night via Twitter that more than $3.2 million was raised in the hours after the decision was announced. Beyond the election, Thursday\u2019s decision affects how Americans get medicine and health care and also provides new court guidelines on federal power. Photos: Controversial health care bill goes to court The most anticipated Supreme Court ruling in years allows the government to continue implementing the health care law, which was passed in 2010 but doesn\u2019t take full effect until 2014. That means popular provisions that prohibit insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions and allow parents to keep their children on family policies to the age of 26 will continue. What the health care ruling means to you In the ruling, the court decided the most controversial provision \u2013 an individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance \u2013 is valid as a tax, even though it is impermissible under the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause. \u201cIt is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go without health insurance,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \u201cSuch legislation is within Congress\u2019s power to tax.\u201d He later added: \u201cThe federal government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance. \u2026 The federal government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance.\u201d Read the court ruling (PDF) Roberts joined the high court\u2019s liberal wing \u2013 Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 in upholding the law. Romney: I'll do what justices didn't How will the court's ruling affect you? CNN Explains: Health care reform Woman inspired Obama's health care plan Four conservative justices \u2013 Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas \u2013 dissented. \u201cTo say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it,\u201d the justices wrote in their dissenting opinion. \u201cImposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of government least accountable to the citizenry.\u201d The polarizing law, dubbed \u201cObamacare\u201d by many, is the signature legislation of the president\u2019s time in office. It helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement and will be a centerpiece of the presidential election campaign. Romney \u2013 who, as governor of Massachusetts, signed a law that also had an individual mandate \u2013 blasted Obamacare as bad policy and a bad law on a federal level, adding that defeating Obama in November is the only way to get rid of it. \u201cWhat the court did not do in its last session, I will do on the first day if elected president of the United States, and that\u2019s to repeal Obamacare,\u201d he said after the decision was announced. How Thursday\u2019s ruling affects that election remains to be seen, especially given Americans\u2019 mixed views on the law itself. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday indicated 37% of Americans would have been pleased if the law was found unconstitutional, compared with 28% who would have been pleased if it had been found constitutional. The poll of 1,000 U.S. adults also found nearly four in 10 surveyed would have \u201cmixed feelings\u201d had the justices struck down the whole law. On Thursday, Obama used the focus on the issue to spell out the law\u2019s benefits. The principle upheld by the high court\u2019s ruling is that no American should go bankrupt because of illness, the president said. Ruling plays into campaign narrative for both sides \u201cI know the debate over this law has been divisive,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt should be pretty clear that I didn\u2019t do this because it was good politics. I did it because I believe it is good for the country.\u201d He said the country can\u2019t afford to \u201cto refight the political battle of two years ago or go back to the way things were.\u201d Other Democrats celebrated the victory for their major policy objective. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, who helped push through the law when she was House speaker, cited the late Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a longtime proponent of health care reform who died before the bill became law. \u201cNow he can rest in peace,\u201d she told reporters, echoing what she\u2019d earlier told Kennedy\u2019s widow by phone. The real people behind health care reform And former White House chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel lauded his former boss for having \u201ccourage to bend the needle of history and did something presidents have tried to do for 60 years,\u201d he said of broadening health care accessibility. In his opinion, Roberts skirted the political debate, stating outright that \u201cwe do not consider whether the act embodies sound policies.\u201d \u201cThat judgment is entrusted to the nation\u2019s elected leaders,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cWe ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions.\u201d The narrow focus of the ruling on key issues like the individual mandate \u2013 limiting it to taxing powers rather than general commerce \u2013 represented an effort by the court to limit the government\u2019s authority. Republicans seized on the ruling by accusing Obama of lying to Americans when he said during the protracted political debate on the bill in 2009 that it wasn\u2019t a tax. Opinion: A health care victory that\u2019s only a start In an interview then with ABC, Obama said various provisions of the health care law were intended to create an all-inclusive system, so that penalizing people who refused to join was not a tax. \u201cFor us to say that you\u2019ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase,\u201d Obama said, noting that \u201cright now, everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance. Nobody considers that a tax increase. People say to themselves, that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car, that I\u2019m not covering all the costs.\u201d Opinion: Liberty lost? The Supreme Court punts Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a leading tea party voice, complained the ruling \u201cmeans now, for the first time in the history of the country, Congress can force Americans to purchase any product, any service.\u201d \u201cThis is truly a turning point in American history. We\u2019ll never be the same way again,\u201d she said. Roberts, however, wrote in the majority opinion that Congress exercised an authority it held to assess a tax, rather than create any new taxing authority. In another part of Thursday\u2019s decision, the high court ruled that a part of the law involving Medicaid must change. Opinion: Aging boomers need health care law The law calls for an expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, which involves spending by the federal government and the states, and threatens to remove existing Medicaid funding from states that don\u2019t participate in the expansion. Thursday\u2019s ruling said the government must remove that threat. The entire act passed Congress along strictly partisan lines in March 2010, after a lengthy and heated debate marked by intense opposition from the health insurance industry and conservative groups. The debate on the sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed almost every traditional hot-button topic: abortion and contraception funding, state and individual rights, federal deficits, end-of-life care, and the overall economy. How the Supreme Court justices voted, what they wrote When Obama signed the bill \u2013 which stretched to 2,700 pages \u2013 later that month, he said it marked a \u201cnew season in America.\u201d While it was not the comprehensive national health care system liberals initially sought, supporters said the law would reduce health care costs, expand coverage and protect consumers. In place of creating a national health system, the law bans insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions, bars insurers from setting a dollar limit on health coverage payouts and requires them to cover preventive care at no additional cost to consumers. Breaking down the court\u2019s decision It also requires individuals to have health insurance, either through their employers or a state-sponsored exchange, or face a fine beginning in 2014. There are, however, a number of exemptions. For instance, the penalty will be waived for people with very low incomes who are members of certain religious groups, or who face insurance premiums that would exceed 8% of family income even after including employer contributions and federal subsidies. Supporters argued the individual mandate is critical to the success of the legislation, because it expands the pool of people paying for insurance and ensures that healthy people do not opt out of having insurance until they need it. Critics say the provision gives the government too much power over what they say should be a personal economic decision. Timeline of the health care law Twenty-six states, led by Florida, went to court to say individuals cannot be forced to have insurance, a \u201cproduct\u201d they may neither want nor need. And they argued that if that provision is unconstitutional, the entire law must go. The Justice Department countered that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not \u201cchoose\u201d whether to participate in the health care market. Four federal appeals courts heard challenges to parts of the law before the Supreme Court ruling, and came up with three different results. Courts in Cincinnati and Washington voted to uphold the law, while the appeals court in Atlanta struck down the individual mandate. A fourth panel, in Richmond, Virginia, put its decision off until penalties for failing to have health insurance take effect in 2014. Basics: Health care reform issues In March, the the Supreme Court heard three days of politically charged hearings on the law formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The challenge focused primarily on the law\u2019s requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a fine. During those arguments, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the law appeared to \u201cchange the relationship between the government and the individual in a profound way.\u201d Liberal justices, however, argued that people who don\u2019t pay into the health system by purchasing insurance make care more expensive for everyone. \u201cIt is not your free choice\u201d to stay out of the market for life, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said during arguments. Roberts argued then that \u201call bets are off\u201d when it comes to federal government authority if Congress was found to have the authority to regulate health care in the name of commerce. He maintained that reasoning in his ruling out Thursday, even while he saved the law itself on other grounds. Earlier today, CNN incorrectly reported that the Supreme Court struck down the individual mandate. We regret the error.

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court decision on health care will come Thursday The Affordable Care Act was passed in March 2010 along partisan lines The law requires individuals to buy health insurance or face a fine The U.S. Supreme Court will rule Thursday on the constitutionality of the sweeping health care law championed by President Barack Obama, in a hotly awaited decision that is bound to divide the country. The stakes cannot be overstated:  what the justices decide will have an immediate and long-term impact on all Americans, both in how they get medicine and health care, and also in vast, yet unknown areas of \u201ccommerce.\u201d Five scenarios: Health care options before the justices According to a poll released Tuesday, 37% of Americans say they would be pleased if the health care law is deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Twenty-eight percent would be pleased if the Affordable Care Act is ruled constitutional, the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey showed, compared to 35% who said they would be disappointed if the court came back with that outcome. It helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement and will be a centerpiece of the presidential election campaign. The real people behind health care reform Supreme Court nears health care ruling One justice may make or break health care How SCOTUS rulings could shape 2012 race Bachmann: Obama not talking health care Previous surveys have indicated that some who oppose the law do so because they think it doesn\u2019t go far enough. The polarizing law, dubbed \u201cObamacare\u201d by many, is the signature legislation of Obama\u2019s time in office. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told supporters in Virginia on Tuesday: \u201cIf Obamacare is not deemed constitutional, then the first three and a half years of this president\u2019s term will have been wasted on something that has not helped the American people.\u201d Romney, whose opposition to the law has been a rallying cry on the stump, continued: \u201cIf it is deemed to stand, then I\u2019ll tell you one thing.

We\u2019re gonna stop it on day one.\u201d Speaking to supporters in Atlanta Tuesday, Obama defended his health care law as the way forward for the American people. Opinion: Aging boomers need health care law \u201cThey understand we don\u2019t need to re-fight this battle over health care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do that we\u2019ve got 3 million young people who are on their parent\u2019s health insurance plans that didn\u2019t have it before. It\u2019s the right thing to do to give seniors discounts on their prescription drugs. It\u2019s the right thing to do to give 30 million Americans health insurance that didn\u2019t have it before.\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that the administration is \u201cconfident that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional, in keeping with decades of precedent under the Commerce Clause. We continue to implement the law accordingly, and we are ready for the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, whatever it may be.\u201d In its ruling Thursday, the nation\u2019s highest court could rule the whole law constitutional or unconstitutional, or strike down certain portions of the law while letting other provisions stand. The Supreme Court heard three days of politically charged hearings in March on the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a landmark but controversial measure passed by congressional Democrats despite pitched Republican opposition. The challenge focused primarily on the law\u2019s requirement that most Americans buy health insurance or pay a fine. The entire act passed Congress along strictly partisan lines in March 2010, after a lengthy and heated debate marked by intense opposition from the health insurance industry and conservative groups. The debate on the sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed almost every traditional hot-button topic: abortion and contraception funding, state and individual rights, federal deficits, end-of-life care, and the overall economy. All sides preparing for political fallout from health care decision Four different federal appeals courts heard challenges to parts of the law before the Supreme Court ruling, and came up with three different results. Courts in Cincinnati and Washington voted to uphold the law, while the appeals court in Atlanta struck down the individual mandate. A fourth panel, in Richmond, Virginia, put its decision off until penalties for failing to buy health insurance take effect in 2014. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed Congress along strictly partisan lines in March 2010, after a lengthy and heated debate marked by intense opposition from the health insurance industry and conservative groups. When Obama signed the legislation later that month, he called it historic and said it marked a \u201cnew season in America.\u201d While it was not the comprehensive national health care system liberals initially sought, supporters said the law would reduce health care costs, expand coverage and protect consumers. Health care\u2019s big four issues: What the justices are tackling The law establishes a staged series of reforms over several years, including banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, forbidding insurers from setting a dollar limit on health coverage payouts, and requiring them to cover preventative care at no additional cost to consumers. It also required individuals to have health insurance, either through their employers or a state-sponsored exchange, or face a fine beginning in 2014. Supporters argue the individual mandate is critical to the success of the legislation, because it expands the pool of people paying for insurance and ensures that healthy people do not opt out of buying insurance until they needed it. Critics say the provision gives the government too much power over what they say should be a personal economic decision. Twenty-six states, led by Florida, say individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a \u201cproduct\u201d they may neither want nor need. And they argue that if that provision is unconstitutional, the entire law must go. The Justice Department countered that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not \u201cchoose\u201d whether to participate in the health care market.

During arguments on March 27, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the law appeared to \u201cchange the relationship between the government and the individual in a profound way.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts argued that \u201call bets are off\u201d when it comes to federal government authority if Congress was found to have the authority to regulate health care in the name of commerce. Liberal justices, however, argued people who don\u2019t pay into the health system by purchasing insurance make care more expensive for everyone.

The high court announced a series of other decisions on Monday, but not the most anticipated one.  It announced that all remaining rulings for the year will come in three days.

The polarizing law, dubbed \u201cObamacare\u201d by many, is the signature legislation of Obama\u2019s time in office.

A March poll for CNN by ORC International found that while support for the law appears to be growing, 50% of Americans opposed the law, 43% supported it and 7% had no opinion. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they wanted the Supreme Court to overturn at least some of the law\u2019s provisions, although the poll did not specify which ones. The law, which helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement, is likely to be a centerpiece of the presidential election campaign. Obama\u2019s presumptive Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, has promised to repeal the measure if elected. But 76% of respondents in the March CNN/ORC poll said a Supreme Court ruling against the law still wouldn\u2019t change their minds about whom to vote for in November. The 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act came after months of bare-knuckled fights over politics and policy and a century of federal efforts to offer universal health care.

            "article_content": "A ruling on the sweeping law is expected in the coming weeks The Affordable Care Act was passed in March 2010 along partisan lines The law requires individuals to buy health insurance or face a fine Justices will decide whether that mandate is unconstitutional Winners and losers are the natural consequence of the American legal system. In the Supreme Court, five majority votes among the nine members are enough to fundamentally change lives and legacies. The high court in coming days will issue rulings in perhaps its most important appeal in a dozen years: whether the sweeping health care law championed by President Barack Obama will be tossed out as an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority. The stakes cannot be overstated \u2013 what the justices decide on a quartet of separate questions will have immediate and long-term impact on every American, not only in the field of medicine but in vast, untold areas of \u201ccommerce.\u201d Health care expenditures alone currently make up 18% of the U.S. economy, and the new law promises to significantly expand that share. Five scenarios: Health care options before the justices \u201cI think the justices probably came into the argument with their minds made up. They had hundreds of briefs and months to study them,\u201d said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a prominent Washington attorney. \u201cThe oral arguments [in March] might have changed their minds around the margin. But we won\u2019t find out until the end of June.\u201d A century of federal efforts to offer universal health care culminated in the 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. After months of bare-knuckled fights over politics and policy, the legislation signed by Obama reached 2,700 pages, nine major sections and 450-some provisions. At issue is the constitutionality of the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d section \u2013 requiring nearly all Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 or face financial penalties. Twenty-six states in opposition say if that linchpin provision is unconstitutional, the entire law must go.  The partisan debate around such a sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed traditional hot-button topics: abortion and contraception funding, state and individual rights, federal deficits, end-of-life care, and the overall economy. The high court now has the final word. The court will not say precisely when the health care opinions will be released, but the last scheduled public session of the term is set for June 25. Depending on how long it takes the justices to finish up, that deadline could easily slip a few days. The justices have already secretly voted on the health care cases, as well as a dozen or so other separate appeals. They met privately as a group just days after the late March arguments, voting preliminarily. Individual justices were assigned to write the one or more opinions, as well as separate dissents. Only they and their law clerks know how this will end. On Point:  Analyzing the health care law Romney attacks Obama health care plan Will Geisinger plan improve health care? Obama's health care record And no one is talking \u2013 that\u2019s an unbroken tradition of discretion rare in leak-loving Washington. \u201cAt the Supreme Court, those who know, don\u2019t talk. And those who talk, don\u2019t know,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Friday in a speech at the American Constitution Society convention in Washington. The court holds fast to an unofficial but self-imposed deadline to have all draft opinions finished by June 1. They are circulated to colleagues, and subsequent dissents and concurrences must be submitted by June 15. Nothing is final until the decision is released to the public. Votes can and do change at the last minute. The last two weeks beginning Monday will be the busiest, most chaotic time. Justices and their law clerks are holed up in chambers, furiously working to frame and craft the final opinions, making sure every fact, every footnote, every legal theory is fully checked and articulated. The nine members know they are writing their legacies with this one issue. The outcome may be disputed, but the constitutional reasoning\u2013 at least in their own minds\u2013 must be sound. \u201cGetting themselves organized, identifying the different majorities, getting opinions written and circulated in dissents and concurrences will really test their capabilities in the final days,\u201d Goldstein said. Health care\u2019s big four issues: What the justices are tackling The opinion-writing exercise is little-known, and the court likes it that way. Consistently predicting the outcome is a time-honored Washington parlor game, but rarely successful. \u201cObviously everybody in a case of this magnitude is trying to read tea leaves. I think it\u2019s hard to read tea leaves,\u201d Paul Clement, lawyer for the 26 states opposing the law, told CNN Correspondent Kate Bolduan moments after the last of the cases were argued March 28. \u201cI suppose if half the justices were snoozing through it, that would have been a bad sign for my side of the case. They obviously weren\u2019t snoozing through it.\u201d The first lawsuits challenging the health care overhaul began just hours after the president signed the legislation two years ago. After a series of reviews in various lower federal courts, the petitions arrived at the high court in November, when the justices decided to review them. Written briefs were filed, oral arguments held. The court is considering four key questions: \u2022 Does the law overstep federal authority, particularly with the \u201cindividual mandate?\u201d \u2022 Must the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act be scrapped if that key provision is unconstitutional? \u2022 Are the lawsuits brought by the states and other petitioners barred under the Anti-Injunction Act, and must they wait until the entire law goes into effect in 2014? \u2022 Are states being \u201ccoerced\u201d by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration, with the risk of losing that funding if they refuse? Everything hinges on the mandate, also known as the \u201cminimum coverage\u201d or \u201cmust-buy\u201d provision. It is the key funding mechanism \u2013 the \u201caffordable\u201d aspect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2013 that makes most of the other 450 or so provisions possible. It would require nearly all Americans to buy some form of health insurance beginning in 2014 or face financial penalties. May the federal government, under the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause, regulate economic \u201cinactivity\u201d? The coalition of 26 states led by Florida says individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a \u201cproduct\u201d they may neither want nor need. The Justice Department has countered that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not \u201cchoose\u201d to participate in the health care market. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services, costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers. The law would expand insurance by at least 30 million people, according to government estimates. As with multiple questions, the justices have multiple options: allowing the mandate to stand or fall; if it falls, keeping all, parts, or none of the rest of the law; issuing a definitive statement on the centuries-long tension between federal and state power; treating health care as a unique aspect of \u201cmarket\u201d activity, allowing an exception upholding the law; and deciding who will craft the all-important opinions. \u201cAnyone who says the individual mandate isn\u2019t in any trouble is just deluding themselves,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that it will be struck down but you cannot say from those arguments, that it\u2019s anything other than a toss-up. The [Obama] administration had as hard a time from those justices as they could have expected, and they are desperately hoping that they can pull together a fifth vote in favor of the mandate.\u201d Timeline of the health care law The justices never discuss internal strategy, and the full story of how health care was decided in the marble halls of the court may never be fully known. The current waiting game has prompted anxiety and a touch of political rancor outside the court. Legal sources say the White House has quietly set up an informal \u201cwar room\u201d of sorts, ready to respond when the rulings are handed down. Low-key coordination is under way between the White House Counsel\u2019s office, Political Office, senior Oval Office and campaign staff, Capitol Hill Democrats, as well as select outside advisers and friendly advocacy groups. Republicans are quietly doing the same, with outreach to conservative activists and candidates. Managing the message will be all-important in a presidential election year. Publicly, Obama has said he was \u201cconfident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress, and I just remind conservative commentators that for years, what we\u2019ve heard is, the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint, that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law.\u201d Some conservative critics interpreted those remarks as a challenge to judicial authority, suggesting Obama was putting direct political pressure on the high court. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged the bench \u2013 and Chief Justice John Roberts in particular \u2013 to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and uphold the mandate. Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney used the same words when urging a different outcome. \u201cI hope they do the right thing and turn this thing down,\u201d Romney told donors last week in Atlanta. \u201cAnd say it\u2019s unconstitutional, because it is.\u201d No one doubts the health care cases will have an immediate impact on Obama\u2019s re-election chances, as well as the long-term credibility of the federal courts, which are supposed to be beyond politics. Recent polling suggests a \u201clegitimacy crisis\u201d in the Third Branch. A New York Times/CBS poll this month shows only 44% of Americans approve of the Supreme Court\u2019s job performance \u2013 a steady drop over recent years. Three-quarters of those polled now say the justices are sometimes influenced by their political views. A separate CNN/ORC International poll released June 8 found a majority \u2013 51% \u2013 oppose the health care law in general, most because they think it is \u201ctoo liberal,\u201d while 13% think it is \u201cnot liberal enough;\u201d 43% of those surveyed favor the law. The key players could be two conservatives on the court: Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, long labeled a \u201cswing\u201d vote. \u201cWith the four more liberal justices almost certain to vote to uphold the individual mandate, the administration is really hoping for the votes of either the chief justice, who signaled that he had questions for both sides,\u201d said Goldstein, \u201cor the traditional swing vote in the court, Anthony Kennedy, who really was tough on the government lawyer but toward the end suggested that maybe insurance was special enough that he could vote to uphold the mandate.\u201d Roberts has long talked about achieving consensus on divided issues, saying it brings long-term credibility and public confidence to the court\u2019s work. It has been mostly a pipe dream, as his nearly seven years of leadership has shown a continuing 5-4 conservative-liberal split on most hot-button issues. \u201cThe court is bitterly divided over the individual mandate,\u201d Goldstein noted, \u201cso if the administration is going to get his vote, it\u2019s either because he believes in a broad federal power or that he doesn\u2019t believe that the Supreme Court shouldn\u2019t overturn such an incredibly important economic statute.\u201d Health care will soon enter the history books, among the handful of the high court\u2019s greatest cases, the outcome no doubt monumental \u2013 legally, politically, socially. An issue that affects every American will naturally attract that kind of attention. Picking winners and losers at this stage is a subjective, even partisan, exercise. The court itself will be both cheered and vilified however it rules. But as an institution, it has survived similar crises of confidence over its discretionary authority: slavery, racial integration, corporate power, abortion \u2013 even Bush v. Gore. Rapid-fire reaction to health care will be swift and furious, from the campaign trail, professional punditry, and halls of government. Some individual Americans stand to gain from the decision, others could be hurt \u2013 financially, emotionally, and physically. So why entrust all this in the hands of nine judges? The Supreme Court usually gets the last word in these matters, regardless of whether one agrees with their decisions \u2013 even matters of life and death, which many argue are the stakes in this health care debate. Justice Robert Jackson may have put it best: \u201cWe are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.\u201d What you should know about health care reform Employers\u2019 \u2018plan B\u2019 if health reform is axed Health spending growth to stay low, then jump",

            "article_content": "Bob Kerrey is running for office after serving in the Senate 1998-2000 Nebraska state Sen. Deb Fischer wins over better-funded GOP candidates Democrat Ben Nelson is retiring from the U.S. Senate Kerrey initially was a reluctant entrant in the race Nebraska state Sen. Deb Fischer won the Republican nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat on Tuesday, official results showed, beating two better-funded candidacies for the opportunity to face off against a former U.S. Senator for the open seat in November. Fischer\u2019s upset toppled state Attorney General John Bruning, seen as the establishment candidate, and state Treasurer Don Stenberg, seen as the tea party favorite. The senate race in Nebraska was the most closely watched contest on Tuesday, when GOP voters there and in Oregon cast ballots in the presidential race. Presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney was projected to win the presidential tally in Nebraska, standing at 71% with all precincts reporting, according to the Secretary of State website.   In Oregon, he was ahead with 72% of the vote out of 100% of precincts tallied. Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania had approximately 14% of the Nebraska vote, several weeks after he suspended his White House bid.  Texas Rep. Ron Paul had approximately 12% in the Oregon contest, held days after he announced that he would no longer actively campaign for the GOP nod. In the Nebraska senate race, Brunning and Stenberg, along with their allies, spent millions against each other, while Fischer picked up late endorsements from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and one-time GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain. She now goes head-to-head against former U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey, who represented the state from 1988-2000, then chose not to seek reelection. The retirement of Sen. Ben Nelson, a Democrat, left an open seat and political trends there have led to independent handicappers favoring a Republican win come November. Fischer sailed relatively under the radar as Bruning and Stenberg waged war against each other and Kerrey, who was presumed as the Democratic nominee, faced Republican challenges to his residency in Nebraska.  After stepping down from the Senate in 2001, Kerrey lived and worked in New York. The majority of tea party-aligned individuals and groups split between Fischer\u2019s two rivals. Bruning received the support of Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Tea Party Express.  \u201cThe federal government spends too much, taxes too much, regulates too much, and listens too little,\u201d he posted on his website. Stenberg \u2013 hardly a political outsider \u2013 was waging his fourth campaign for the U.S. Senate, and he won the party\u2019s nomination once.  That was the year 2000, and he eventually lost the general election to Nelson.  He was backed this cycle by the PAC behind the tea party, FreedomWorks, as well as Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina and the Club for Growth. Long before GOP voters chose their nominee on Tuesday, two prominent and independent political handicappers rated the race as leaning towards the eventual Republican nominee. Reliable polling in the state has been scarce, but watchers of the race perceived Fischer as closing a gap between her and Bruning in the final days. The Cook Political Report lists the race as \u201clikely\u201d a Republican pickup \u2013 which falls between \u201csolid\u201d and \u201clean\u201d \u2013 while the Rothenberg Political Report calls it \u201cRepublican favored,\u201d one step below a safe seat but three steps above a toss-up. A win in Nebraska would help Republicans wrestle a simple majority in the U.S. Senate from Democrats, a feat the GOP is four seats away from achieving. Democrats, meanwhile, are defending or facing a retirement in 23 of the 33 Senate seats up for election this year. And of the 10 open seats, seven are held by Democrats and three by Republicans. While the GOP candidates exchanged elbows through a series of television advertisements, they found time to beat up on Kerrey and were joined by national operations, such as the American Crossroads committee founded by Karl Rove. Within days of Kerrey\u2019s decision to enter the race \u2013 he initially said he would not run, then two weeks later, announced he would \u2013 Bruning was on the air with an ad questioning the former senator\u2019s residency and the influence of the former Cornhusker senator\u2019s time in New York. Kerrey is a \u201cNew York liberal,\u201d Bruning\u2019s ad went, while American Crossroads said, \u201cA decade in Greenwich Village changed Bob Kerrey.\u201d The group also seized on his reluctance to enter the race, claiming in a radio ad that Kerrey \u201ccut his own secret deal with Democratic leaders in Washington, a deal so secret Kerrey won\u2019t talk about what promises were made.\u201d The state Republican Party even filed an official challenge of his residency with the Secretary of State\u2019s office. Kerrey\u2019s campaign manager, Paul Johnson, told CNN in March that the residency attacks were \u201cinsulting to Nebraskans\u201d and that Bob is \u201ca fiscal conservative\u201d concerned with national debt and budget deficit. Other attacks have sought to tie Kerrey to outgoing Nelson \u2013 who provided the 60th vote for Democrats to pass the health care overhaul. He agreed to support the bill after negotiating a compromise, which came to be known as the \u201cCornhusker Kickback.\u201d  It would have modified federal abortion funding regulations and saved the state approximately $100 million on Medicare costs over a decade. As Republicans at home and nationwide protested, he had the provision removed, and said he did not wish his state to have an advantage over other states. Like others in the upper chamber who are retiring willingly or unwillingly this year, Nelson is known for casting votes with both sides of the aisle. This open seat has taken a backseat in prominence to other states\u2019 races, such as last week\u2019s primary defeat of Republican incumbent Sen. Richard Lugar in Indiana. But Nebraska has a front seat to an issue splitting the two parties this year. The controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline, generally favored by Republicans and opposed by Democrats, was to stretch from Canadian oil sands to the Gulf Coast, bisecting Nebraska. But environmentalists worried about polluting the Ogallala Aquifer, which supplies most of the state with drinking water. Nelson, the outgoing senator, easily won a second term in 2006, but as it became clear that Republicans considered his seat in play this cycle, Nelson made a December announcement that he would not seek a third term. \u201cSimply put: It is time to move on,\u201d Nelson said at the time. Nebraska is expected to be anything but tranquil as the race between Fischer and Kerrey heats up this summer. Don Walton, a political writer with the Lincoln Journal Star, had a simple warning in his pre-election Sunday column: \u201cbuckle up.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ron Paul supporters want bottom-to-top takeover of GOP Part of the plan is electing supporters to party posts from local level and up Supporters say they're looking beyond 2012 to what's down the road \"At the end of the day, this is all practice for the next time,\" Paul director says Ron Paul supporters have a plan. As they doggedly work the Republican system from the ground up, electing more of their team as delegates to the Republican National Convention, they have a heavyweight plan that\u2019s markedly different from the rumors of convention subterfuge and the guess of simply getting their candidate to the podium. \u201cWe want to change the Republican Party,\u201d said Chris Stearns, the Virginia state director for the Ron Paul campaign. \u201cWe are making sure our people get in positions of leadership \u2013 in the nation, in their state, in their county and city, all the way down to the grass roots level.\u201d Libertarians such as Stearns aspire to nothing less than the kind of bottom-to-top takeover that proved so successful for the religious right and anti-abortion forces in the 1980s. Many of the men and women who swept into local party office then inhabit top rungs of the GOP now. And similar to that movement, Ron Paul and his campaigners for liberty are looking down the road. \u201cThis is not just for this term,\u201d Stearns told CNN Radio from the southern end of the state, \u201cbut four, six or eight years from now.\u201d Nearly 200 miles away, in northern Virginia, a separate Ron Paul supporter is similarly forward looking. \u201cFour years, eight years, 12 years, we are here for the long haul,\u201d said Patrick Bailey, a 26-year-old who moved from New York to Washington specifically to get involved in electoral politics. He plunged in on Saturday as one of three Paul supporters running for delegate to the national convention from Virginia\u2019s 8th Congressional District. Battle in the grass roots That kind of local party election is often ignored by headlines and pundits, but it\u2019s where Ron Paulians are waging their most furious battle. Primaries and caucuses often dictate how a state\u2019s delegates should vote, but it is these internal state and local party conventions that determine who the individual delegates will be. They represent hundreds of small but open doors to get your troops to the convention. The 8th District, which includes the Washington suburbs of Alexandria and Arlington, felt the Paul surge Saturday. Four years ago, the district convention saw some 350 participants. The 8th District Republican chairman told CNN that participation had nearly doubled this year. Anyone can attend and vote, as long as they sign up by a deadline and have not voted in a Democratic primary in the past five years. This is how the Paul strategy works: Sign up. Show up. Vote. \u201cWe have been calling and e-mailing,\u201d Bailey said ahead of the vote. \u201cOur turnout\u2019s looking great.\u201d But some feel it is an attempt at political hijacking. \u201cThere are people out here who are still fighting for Ron Paul who got defeated at our primary,\u201d said Fran Redmon, who has been involved in the 8th District Republican Party for 40 years. \u201cIt\u2019s so ridiculous. They should either be a Republican or not be here today.\u201d Asked what she thought the Paul supporters were trying to accomplish, Redmon replied, \u201cI think they aren\u2019t really thinking it through. I suppose they think we\u2019re people who don\u2019t have an agenda or something.\u201d Indeed, the agenda is the rallying cry for the libertarian forces. CNN spoke with more than two dozen Paul supporters at this local Republican meeting and they shared common goals: substantially smaller government both in spending and in power, far more limits on the Federal Reserve, an end to what they see as American interventionist policy overseas and a cry of concern for individual rights. The second-ballot gambit \u201cThis is a movement,\u201d said Homan Rabie, who came to the 8th District convention with his high school friends, \u201c(Republicans) need a true philosophy.\u201d They need to bring in more minorities and young people like his group, he added. So it\u2019s a movement. Why then all the national convention delegates? Especially in a place like Virginia where, by Republican rules, nearly all the elected delegates must vote for Mitt Romney on the first ballot. Let\u2019s get the nomination theory out of the way. One supporter at the 8th District convention mentioned a much-forwarded idea that Paul delegates could abstain on the first ballot, forcing a second vote at the convention and then, on that second ballot, cast votes for Paul. But there are two problems with this notion: One is that if a delegate abstains, an alternate delegate, who may or may not be a Paul supporter, would step in. The other problem? Many Paul supporters told CNN they think it\u2019s a pipe dream. They\u2019re distancing themselves from the idea. \u201cTo me personally, it doesn\u2019t look like any way that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Bailey, the candidate trying to get to Tampa. \u201cI don\u2019t see (the Paul delegates) going in and causing a ruckus. The last thing we need is to become a scapegoat (if Republicans don\u2019t win in November).\u201d Change the party from the bottom up Paul says as much himself. He told CNN last week that the idea of disrupting the national convention \u201cis not in my plan. That is against my plan.\u201d The plan, say supporters up and down the Paul chain, is to put their people in Republican positions of power from the bottom to the top, and change the party. Saturday, the few hundred voters at Virginia\u2019s 8th District convention chose between seven candidates for three national convention seats. While Bailey came in fifth, his friend and fellow Paul supporter Matthew Burrow took third place and won a spot for libertarians in Tampa. Stearns says Paul supporters have won 15 of the 24 congressional delegate spots decided in Virginia so far. Add it to the list. Paul took all 21 elected delegate spots in Maine and the vast majority of the elected delegate positions in Nevada, state party officials confirmed to CNN. Party officials in Minnesota have not been able to certify their exact results to CNN but agreed that Paul won most of the up-for-grabs delegates there as well. That is especially notable because Minnesota\u2019s delegates are not bound on the first ballot at the national convention. But the 2012 nomination is not the point, Bailey reminded those around him. Instead, it\u2019s learning the process, getting better at it, gaining positions and changing the Republican party, no matter how long it takes. \u201cWe\u2019re all getting training on the ground now,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is all practice for the next time. And the next time all be practice for the time after that. And eventually we are going to win.\u201d It is a big plan, requiring not just determination but stamina.",

Two independent political analysis show Nebraska switching to Republicans Democrats are defending or facing a retirement in 23 of the 33 Senate seats With their eyes on winning control of the U.S. Senate in November, Republicans will be looking Tuesday to the primary for Nebraska\u2019s open seat, where the yet-to-be-decided Republican candidate is already favored over the former senator expected to win the Democratic nod. Sen. Ben Nelson, a Democrat, is retiring, leaving an open race rated by two prominent independent political handicappers as \u201clikely Republican\u201d and \u201cRepublican favored.\u201d The likely Democratic candidate, former Sen. Bob Kerrey, did not seek a third term in the 2000 election, and is expected to face either state Attorney General and frontrunner John Bruning, state legislator Deb Fischer, or state treasurer Don Stenberg. Voters in Idaho and Oregon will also cast ballots for U.S. House and state-level races. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici is the only Democrat on the ballot in Oregon\u2019s first district, a seat she assumed in February after Rep. David Wu resigned amid an ethics investigation involving an allegation of a sexual encounter with the daughter of a donor to his campaign. The Nebraska primary has drawn in national figures such as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who endorsed Fischer a week ago, and the tea party group FreedomWorks, which in September said it would back Stenbebrrg. All three are backed by anti-abortion organizations and tout their Second Amendment credentials. Bruning touts his support for and action on a lawsuit against the health reform law, as well as his opposition to abortion and current levels of federal spending. \u201cThe federal government spends too much, taxes too much, regulates too much, and listens too little,\u201d his campaign website reads. His prominent endorsements include Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Tea Party Express. Bruning has outraised his GOP rivals, raking in nearly $2.9 million this cycle. Stenberg won his party\u2019s nomination once before, when he faced Nelson for the open seat in 2000, and also ran in 1996 and 2006. In addition to the backing of FreedomWorks, Sen. Jim DeMint\u2019s Senate Conservative Fund has aired television spots for Stenberg which criticize his rival Bruning, who Stenberg says is not a genuine conservative. He has been endorsed by the Family Research Council PAC, the Club for Growth, conservative talk show host Mark Levin, conservative blogger and CNN Political Contributor Eric Erickson, and several potential future senate colleagues, including Rand Paul and Mike Lee. Despite the endorsements he has raised approximately $680,000. Fischer points to her experience as a state legislator, where she and her colleagues have balanced the state budget while providing tax relief. Her five step plan for federal government reform includes a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution and repeal of the health reform law, the Dodd-Frank banking law, and the No Child Left Behind education statute. She also proposes greater Congressional oversight, an audit of the Federal Reserve, and downsizing or elimination of some government agencies. While reliable polling in the state has been scarce, two independent political analysis show Nebraska switching hands from Democrats to Republicans. The Cook Political Report lists the race as \u201clikely\u201d a Republican pickup \u2013 which falls between \u201csolid\u201d and \u201clean\u201d \u2013 while the Rothenberg Political Report calls it \u201cRepublican favored,\u201d  one step below a safe seat but three steps above a toss-up. Democrats are defending or facing a retirement in 23 of the 33 Senate seats up for election this year.  Of the 10 open seats, seven are held by Democrats and three by Republicans. The GOP would need to pick up four seats to gain a simple majority in the body.

Nancy Keenan, who has led the National Abortion Rights Action League Pro-Choice America since December 2004, chose \u201cnot to renew her contract,\u201d the group said in a news release. \u201cThanks to all of you who have supported me these past 8 years at @NARAL,\u201d Keenan wrote Thursday on her Twitter account. \u201cI look forward to fighting with you through 2012!\u201d Members of the league\u2019s board of directors lauded Keenan in announcing her departure. \u201cNancy inspired Americans, from lawmakers to everyday citizens, to proudly proclaim their pro-choice views and act on these values,\u201d said Janet Denlinger, the board\u2019s chairwoman. \u201cNancy directed efforts that reshaped the debate over reproductive rights, produced tremendous electoral wins for choice, and defeated attacks from anti-choice opponents. As a result, we are a stronger organization positioned to lead the fight for reproductive rights now and into the future.\u201d According to her official biography, Keenan was one of five siblings growing up in an Irish-Catholic family  in the copper-smelting town of Anaconda, Montana. She taught children with disabilities in her hometown before becoming a Montana state legislator and state superintendent of public instruction. Under her leadership, the league claimed that 44 more abortion rights people earned seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and eight more in the U.S. Senate in the 2006 and 2008 election cycles.

In that time, she will \u201cfocus on helping pro-choice candidates win elections.\u201d In the meantime, a search committee has been formed made up of members from across the country to select her successor. \u201cWe have built an innovative initiative to engage and recruit even more members of the Millennial Generation to the pro-choice cause,\u201d Keenan said. \u201cWe did this by listening and learning from younger people about their experiences and ideas for protecting choice in the next 40 years and beyond.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Experts say they don't think same-sex marriage to be a deciding issue in November President Obama's statement on Wednesday ends a streak of ambiguity over his position Obama had said that his position was \"evolving\" In an election year that some pundits have predicted will be focused on jobs and the economy, social issues like same-sex marriage have stolen the spotlight a surprising number of times. But experts say don\u2019t expect those hot-button topics to be the ultimate markers of the 2012 cycle. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama officially came out in support of the right of Americans to marry same-sex partners, ending a streak of ambiguity over his position that has long perplexed supporters of marriage equality. \u201cI\u2019ve just concluded that for me, personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,\u201d Obama told ABC News. His now-evolved statement came one day after North Carolina became the latest Southern state to pass an amendment banning same sex-marriage and domestic partnerships. Obama\u2019s campaign issued a statement last month opposing the amendment. But pressure had grown on the White House to go further after Vice President Joe Biden said Sunday, in response to a question on a talk show, that he was \u201cabsolutely comfortable\u201d with same sex-marriage. Obama had said only that his position was \u201cevolving\u201d after having once opposed same-sex marriage. State-by state breakdown of gay marriage Evolving opinions on same-sex marriage Rep. Barney Frank talks weddings, rings Black voters on Obama's same-sex support On Monday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan also showed support for same-sex marriage. Marriage-equality advocates quickly pounced on the statement, ramping up pressure on Obama to do so as well. \u201cStanding up for the freedom to marry is not just the right thing to do, it\u2019s the right thing politically, and it\u2019s time for the president to stand on the right side of history,\u201d said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, an advocacy group. Political observers say the president was simply playing smart politics. With a Gallup poll showing the country is split over the issue \u2013 50% of voters support the practice, while 48% oppose \u2013 Obama had a fine line to walk in terms of political impact. Opinion: Obama\u2019s most courageous moment \u201cWhile this president can point to successes in advancing gay civil rights, much more than I think any other president, that final step (of endorsing same-sex marriage) would leave him open to a series of negative attacks that could really alienate swing voters,\u201d CNN political contributor John Avlon said Tuesday, before the president made his statement. Several other states are dealing with the issue this year. Washington, Maryland, Colorado and Maine have passed or are poised to pass legislation in favor of same-sex marriage, while Minnesota will vote on a ballot initiative similar to North Carolina\u2019s. Analysts say the move could prove to be risky for the president this fall, especially in key swing states like Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia, which have strong conservative bases and demographics that might take issue with the president\u2019s stance. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have some political cost for him,\u201d predicted Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. \u201cHe will lose some Reagan Democrats, the cultural blue-collar Reagan Democrats in states like Ohio and North Carolina and Pennsylvania \u2013 important swing states.\u201d Opinion: Support for same-sex marriage growing in GOP But some argue the move was a bold one, which could poll well among independents looking for \u201cconviction\u201d in the White House. \u201cYou\u2019ll never agree with everybody on every issue, but now he\u2019s taken the position that is clearly in his heart,\u201d Paul Begala, a senior adviser for the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action, told CNN. \u201cPeople admire a \u2018conviction politician,\u2019 and I think he can stand proud on that.\u201d Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney reiterated his position on the issue after Obama\u2019s interview on Wednesday, drawing a stark contrast with that of the president. \u201cMy view is that marriage itself is a relationship between a man and a woman, and that\u2019s my own preference,\u201d he told reporters in Oklahoma. \u201cI know other people have differing views.\u201d In an interview earlier in the day, he said he supported domestic partnership benefits and hospital visitation rights for same-sex couples. However, in the past, Romney has expressed support for a federal amendment banning gay marriage and has said that he, unlike Obama, would defend the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman. This isn\u2019t the first time a social issue has appeared front and center this cycle. In February, the Obama administration\u2019s so-called contraception mandate sparked a wave of opposition from Republicans, who decried a requirement that institutions affiliated with religions include contraception coverage in their health care plans. iReport: What\u2019s your take on this issue? The outcry ultimately influenced the administration to amend its proposal so that insurance companies, not the institutions, would pay for contraception coverage. That episode was part of a larger Democratic-led narrative that paints the GOP as waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d As another example, Democrats point to a bill recently signed by Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell that requires any woman desiring to undergo an abortion to first be given an ultrasound test. Hitting back, Republicans seized on comments made by Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen, who last month criticized Ann Romney for having \u201cnever worked a day in her life\u201d as a stay-at-home mother. The GOP argued her comments reflected a cultural bias among Democrats against Republicans. But will same-sex marriage prove to be a key issue in the presidential election? With a number of states voting this year on the issue, experts say it will probably make a few more headlines but will unlikely be the biggest issue of 2012. The fact that North Carolina, a traditionally conservative state, voted to pass the amendment is no surprise and indicates little about voters\u2019 attitudes on same-sex marriage, said Professor Andrew Koppelman of Northwestern University Law School. But if social issues do play a prominent role this cycle, Obama would come out ahead in the resulting debate, said Koppelman, who has done extensive research on the legal implications of same-sex marriage. \u201cPeople who feel most strongly about same-sex marriage are either strong Democrats or strong Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who could go either way are people who are worried about the economy. If the economy does not look like the winner for Romney, it\u2019s hard to imagine him pulling it out with this.\u201d Koppelman said Obama\u2019s support for same-sex marriage will likely energize his base \u2013 but he added that the statement is about all the president can do in terms of affecting the issue. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s up to the courts to decide,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, all that he can do is try to be an opinion leader here. He hasn\u2019t got any real power.\u201d A Pew Research Center survey in April showed same-sex marriage to be low on voters\u2019 minds, with the issue coming in dead last out of the 18 topics listed. Only 28% of voters described it as a \u201cvery important issue\u201d this election year. Jennifer Pizer, legal director at The Williams Institute, which studies sexual orientation, law and public policy at UCLA, said she would be surprised if the issue comes into play this fall, despite its appearance on states\u2019 ballots and the president\u2019s changed position. \u201cI suspect the issue might have played some role in North Carolina, which will be contested,\u201d she told CNN in an e-mail. \u201cBut with the marriage vote having happened just now, it seems unlikely to still be much on voters\u2019 minds six months from now.\u201d She added that Obama\u2019s comments may fuel ongoing discussion among pundits and politicos, but doubts voters will view the issue as a highly important one this fall. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of Americans already enjoy the right to marry the person they wish to marry, and are not directly affected by laws prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying,\u201d she said. \u201cThose laws just don\u2019t affect their families, let alone their jobs, their children\u2019s schools, or whether they are able to take loved ones to the doctor.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney is setting GOP policy on key issues as the certain presidential nominee The strategy seeks to gain the advantage on matters of traditional GOP vulnerability Democrats consider such moves election year politics GOP leaders in Congress seek agreement on issues pushed by Democrats For Republicans and certain presidential nominee Mitt Romney, the best defense appears to be a good offense on issues and themes being pushed by President Barack Obama and Democrats. In recent days, Romney has come out in favor of steps also advocated by Democrats to hold down interest rates for federal student loans and renew the Violence Against Women Act. The two issues appeal to key voting blocs for Democrats \u2013 women and youths \u2013 and the attention given them by Romney signals an attempt to erode traditional Democratic bases of support. Coming off a primary campaign dominated by conservative issues, Romney is now pivoting toward the center to try to win independent support while also challenging Obama on topics considered strengths for the president. Biden brags about Obama's 'big stick' Biden's foreign policy doublespeak Romney-Rubio 2012? Why hasn't Bachmann endorsed? In addition, Romney offered a GOP variation of a central theme Obama has pushed in recent months \u2013 fairness, or the lack of it, in America\u2019s economy \u2013 in his speech Tuesday night after five more primary victories that amounted to his virtual coronation as the Republican standard-bearer. \u201cWe will stop the unfairness of government workers getting better pay and benefits than the very taxpayers they serve,\u201d the former Massachusetts governor said. \u201cAnd we will stop the unfairness of one generation passing larger and larger debts on to the next.\u201d It is all part of a concerted strategy to try to reverse perceived campaign weaknesses for Republicans as the general election campaign launches. \u201cI think what they have decided to do is start playing offense instead of defense when it comes to the fairness issue, and what you\u2019re going to hear from Mitt Romney over and over again is that there are unfair ways in which the government operates, and so he wants to kind of play a little on the president\u2019s turf,\u201d said Gloria Borger, CNN chief political analyst. Such a strategy is risky, Borger added, because polling shows that a majority of Americans side with Obama\u2019s complaints of an unfair tax system that favors the rich. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s sort of a look at what\u2019s to come, that he\u2019s not going to lay back and say, \u2018OK, that\u2019s the president\u2019s turf, not mine,\u2019 \u201d Borger said of Romney. The same can be said for Obama\u2019s campaign to extend lower interest rates on federal student loans, which are set to double from the current 3.4% to 6.8% on July 1 unless Congress acts. Originally passed with bipartisan support in 2007 and signed into law by then-President George W. Bush, the expiring lower interest rates provided Obama with another opportunity to promote his campaign theme of economic growth through middle-class development. In speeches this week on college campuses in North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa, Obama told cheering crowds of students how he and the first lady needed student loans to succeed and only paid them off eight years ago. His goal was to contrast his background with that of Romney \u2013 a multimillionaire businessman turned politician \u2013 to argue that he better understands the issues and needs of young voters. Obama also encouraged supporters to let their congressional representatives know their feelings. Apparently, it worked. Romney quickly tried to defuse any disadvantage, blaming Obama\u2019s policies for high unemployment among new graduates and saying this week: \u201cI fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate on student loans.\u201d In Congress, Republican leaders still smarting from being outmaneuvered by Obama and Democrats in last December\u2019s payroll tax cut extension debate sought to use Romney\u2019s stance as cover for GOP efforts to alter the student loan legislation. Both Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, insisted that Republicans always supported extending the lower tax rates for federal student loans but quibbled with how to pay for it. \u201cThe president has come out for a one-year extension. Gov. Romney\u2019s come out for a one-year extension. We\u2019re discussing it as well,\u201d McConnell told reporters this week, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody believes this interest rate ought to be allowed to rise. The question is, how do you pay for it?  How long do you do the extension?\u201d Boehner announced Wednesday that the House will vote Friday on a proposal to extend the lower interest rates and pay for them by taking money from funding in the 2010 health care reform law detested by conservatives. On Thursday, Boehner unleashed an exceptionally harsh attack on Obama, saying the president\u2019s speeches this week on the student loan issue were \u201cbeneath the dignity of the White House\u201d and \u201cpathetic.\u201d \u201cDemocrats and Republicans fully expected this would be taken care of,\u201d Boehner told reporters. Noting the nation\u2019s economic and fiscal problems, Boehner said Obama was \u201cwasting time on a fake fight to try to gain his own re-election.\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney responded Thursday by telling reporters: \u201cI understand there is an effort to politicize this, to hide the fact they have a policy problem on their hands.\u201d Carney said the House Republican budget embraced by Romney called for letting the lower interest rates on student loans expire, as well as cutting funding for Pell grants. \u201cWe know what their position was. We\u2019re glad they changed it,\u201d Carney said, referring to the shift as \u201ca little Johnny-come-lately.\u201d To Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Republican move is all election year politics. \u201cIf this were a year ago, the House Republican majority wouldn\u2019t have batted an eye at blocking our proposal to extend the lower rate,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut it\u2019s an election year. President Obama has done a great job bringing attention to this looming rate hike, and now, Republicans are in damage-control mode.\u201d Romney also has sought to blunt an Obama advantage among women voters consistently revealed in recent polling across the country. The polling indicated that a conservative focus on social issues such as abortion and contraception, hyped by Democrats as a Republican \u201cwar on women,\u201d expanded the gender gap. Earlier this month, Romney mounted an attack line that Obama\u2019s economic policies harmed women. His support for extending the Violence Against Women Act appeared to be another effort to defuse a potential electoral vulnerability among independent voters. Vice President Joe Biden has led the White House charge on the issue, and legislators in both chambers are considering competing versions of proposals to continue the measure. \u201cOur support for victims of violent crime has always been bipartisan, and it cheapens this important piece of legislation for it to digress into partisanship,\u201d conservative Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Thursday. \u201cSo, that\u2019s my hope, is that we can sort of not take the low road but we can take the high road here in a bipartisan way and get it done.\u201d Another Republican senator, Missouri\u2019s Roy Blunt, acknowledged Thursday that Romney\u2019s stances might differ from positions taken by GOP legislators. With disapproval of Congress at all-time highs, Blunt said it probably doesn\u2019t hurt Romney\u2019s overall message \u201cto have disagreements with members of Congress right now.\u201d For many conservatives, what is happening is that RINOs, or \u201cRepublicans in name only,\u201d are herding behind Romney now that he has essentially secured the nomination. \u201cWe will go to the polls and vote for him. We may be violently ill while we do it, but at least he is not Barack Obama, and at least he has the chance to do better than we expect,\u201d conservative blogger Judson Phillips wrote about Romney on the Tea Party Nation website. At the same time, Phillips wrote, conservatives must ensure that their preferred candidates win election in the House and Senate. \u201cWe have enough RINOs and moderates as it is,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year, the House under John Boehner spent 3% more than it did when Nancy Pelosi was the speaker. Much of the Republican leadership did not even notice this, nor did it even bother them. For them, it was business as usual.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Strategist said she wasn't driving wedge between working, stay-at-home moms Rosen apologizes for remark about Ann Romney Stick to economic policy issues, Haley Barbour advises Mitt Romney Vice President Biden targets Romney in speech in New Hampshire A Democratic strategist apologized Thursday for a comment questioning Ann Romney\u2019s qualifications to advise her husband on women\u2019s economic issues, while the Romney campaign sought to exploit the controversy to help fix a gender gap problem in the race against President Barack Obama. Hilary Rosen issued a statement after fellow Democrats, including a Twitter post on Michelle Obama\u2019s page, criticized her remarks the night before on CNN. \u201cI apologize to Ann Romney and anyone else who was offended,\u201d said the statement by Rosen, who is a CNN contributor. \u201cLet\u2019s declare peace in this phony war and go back to focus on the substance.\u201d In a later interview on CNN, Rosen said she \u201cshould not have chosen words that seemed to attack Ann Romney\u2019s choice in life\u201d and that she hoped Mrs. Romney \u201cunderstands I didn\u2019t mean it personally,\u201d adding \u201cI was trying to talk about economic issues.\u201d \u201cThis is going to be an ugly campaign season,\u201d Rosen told CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\u201d On Wednesday night, Rosen said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAC360\u201d that Mitt Romney shouldn\u2019t be relying on his wife for guidance on economic issues affecting women. \u201cWhat you have is Mitt Romney running around the country, saying, \u2018Well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues, and when I listen to my wife, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing,\u2019 \u201d Rosen said. \u201cGuess what? His wife has actually never worked a day in her life.\u201d Rosen apologizes for remarks about Ann Romney Rosen continued by saying Ann Romney had \u201cnever really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of the women in this country are facing, in terms of how do we feed our kids, how do we send them to school, and why do we worry about their future.\u201d The strategist, speaking Thursday night on \u201cAC360,\u201d  said a debate over economic stances of the candidates is more important than the firestorm over her remarks. Rosen: Attacks don't erase Romney record Carney: Raising kids is a tough job Do voters view 'mommy wars' as old news? Meet Ann Romney \u201cThe idea that I would create a division between stay-at-home moms and working moms is just silly. That has nothing to do with what I said,\u201d Rosen told Anderson Cooper. She also said she is not an adviser to the White House or the Democratic National Committee. Republicans slammed Rosen\u2019s comments as disparaging to stay-at-home mothers, and top Democrats, including Obama and his chief campaign adviser, also chimed in. On Thursday, Twitter posts attributed to Michelle Obama and Democratic National Committee head Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz took exception with Rosen\u2019s remarks. \u201cEvery mother works hard, and every woman deserves to be respected,\u201d the first lady tweeted. Ann Romney told Fox News earlier Thursday that raising five boys was hard work, and she hears from women all the time about economic difficulties they face. First lady stands up for Ann Romney \u201cLook, I know what it is like to struggle,\u201d said Romney, a cancer survivor who has multiple sclerosis. \u201cIf maybe I haven\u2019t struggled as much financially as some people have, I can tell you and promise you that I have had struggles in my life. And I would love to have people understand that Mitt and I have compassion for people that are struggling and that\u2019s why we are running.  We care about those people that are struggling and we recognize that this economic recovery has been very weak.\u201d The imbroglio occurred as the November presidential race took shape this week, with conservative challenger Rick Santorum suspending his campaign to make Mitt Romney the certain Republican nominee against Obama. With polls repeatedly showing female voters favoring Obama over the former Massachusetts governor, Romney launched a harsh attack Wednesday on how the administration\u2019s economic policies hurt women. Rosen\u2019s comments Wednesday night provided another opening for the Romney campaign, which made top surrogates available for a conference call with reporters Thursday to discuss the issue. Republican Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said Rosen was a frequent White House visitor who was saying what the Obama campaign intended. \u201cClearly they are using surrogate women, including Hilary Rosen, who is a paid spokesperson, to deliver messages about Republicans that the president does not want to deliver himself for fear of the backlash,\u201d Lummis said. Two leading social conservative groups endorse Romney At the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday he was unaware of how many times Rosen had visited. In a sign of the sensitivity of the issue, Carney repeatedly emphasized Obama\u2019s policies on women, such as making the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act the first piece of legislation he signed into law. Rosen\u2019s comments prompted immediate criticism Wednesday night on Twitter. Within a few hours of her making them, Josh Romney posted that his mother \u201cis one of the smartest, hardest working women I know\u201d who \u201ccould have done anything with her life, chose to raise me.\u201d The senior adviser to Obama\u2019s re-election bid, David Axelrod, called the remarks \u201cinappropriate and offensive,\u201d while Obama deputy campaign manager, Stephanie Cutter, posted, \u201cFamilies must be off limits on campaigns, and I personally believe stay-at-home moms work harder than most of us do.\u201d Axelrod later told CNN\u2019s John King that the Romney campaign \u201cjumped on (the comment) like a raft out in the deep blue sea because they were drowning under the weight of their own problems.\u201d Before issuing her apology Thursday, Rosen told CNN that Republicans were attacking her as part of a strategy to divert attention from policies championed by Romney that will hurt women. \u201cThe issue that I\u2019m focusing on is does Mitt Romney have a vision for bringing women up economically and can he himself stop referring to his wife as his economic surrogate,\u201d Rosen said. Her apology statement said: \u201cLet\u2019s put the faux \u2018war against stay-at-home moms\u2019 to rest once and for all.\u201d \u201cAs a mom, I know that raising children is the hardest job there is. As a pundit, I know my words on CNN last night were poorly chosen,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn response to Mitt Romney on the campaign trail referring to his wife as a better person to answer questions about women than he is, I was discussing his lack of a record on the plight of women\u2019s financial struggles.\u201d While Romney still needs several hundred delegates to clinch the GOP nomination, Santorum\u2019s departure from the race leaves his path free of obstacles. However, Romney\u2019s campaign still struggles to generate enthusiasm among the GOP conservative base, which questions his more moderate stances as Massachusetts governor. In addition, a Washington Post/ABC News poll this week affirmed findings of other recent polls that Romney trails Obama among female voters. Another poll released Thursday by Quinnipiac University showed Obama leading Romney in New Jersey, even under the hypothetical scenario that popular Republican Gov. Chris Christie was on the GOP ticket as Romney\u2019s running mate. New Jersey is considered a solidly Democratic state in presidential general elections. The Quinnipiac poll also showed a Romney-Christie ticket trailing against Obama and Vice President Joe Biden among female voters. The Republican presidential campaign has included a conservative shift to appeal to tea party voters in the primary and caucus season. However, some socially conservative polices opposing abortion and health care coverage for contraception appear to be raising concerns among female voters. Democrats have seized on that dynamic by emphasizing Republican stances that they say harm equal treatment and opportunity for women. In response, the Romney campaign is targeting Obama\u2019s economic policies as being bad for women. The \u201cwar over women\u201d erupted in full force Wednesday, when Romney said Obama may not have started the recession but his policies extended it, which hurt women. \u201cHe just made it worse, and made it last longer,\u201d Romney said. \u201cAnd because it lasted longer, more and more women lost jobs, such that in his 3\u00bd years, 92.3% of the people who lost jobs have been women. His failures have hurt women.\u201d An analysis of federal labor statistics shows that the Romney claim is technically true, but lacks important context. The number of nonfarm-employed women from January 2009, when Obama took office, to March 2012 fell far more than the number of employed men in that period. The total job loss for the period for both men and women combined was 740,000. The number of women who lost nonfarm jobs in that time was 683,000, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That amounts to 92.3% \u2013 the figure Romney cited. However, the statistic does not reflect that men constituted a much larger chunk of the job loss pie in the year leading up to Obama\u2019s inauguration. In the 2008 calendar year, men lost a total of 2.7 million nonfarm jobs, compared with 895,000 lost for women. Men made up 75.4% of the 3.6 million jobs lost that year. Romney\u2019s claim also does not reflect that the job losses for women began in March 2008, almost a full year before Obama took office. At that point, women held a total of 67.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs, the highest level of female employment of the Bush administration. Romney got a boost Thursday when two prominent anti-abortion groups \u2013 the Susan B. Anthony List and National Right to Life \u2013 endorsed his nomination, a sign that conservatives will coalesce around his candidacy despite concerns about his more moderate history as Massachusetts governor. An influential Republican, former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, said Thursday that Romney should aggressively focus on a policy-heavy message that questions Obama\u2019s handling of the economy. That theme will be enough to keep the conservative base excited while also appealing to independent voters who will ultimately decide the election, Barbour said. \u201cThis campaign is going to be waged in the center,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cDon\u2019t ever forget that Barack Obama is the great uniter of Republicans. The party apparatus, the conservatives, the tea party, the organizations like small businesses and the NRA, they will be very active in providing volunteers and our base will be very active. That\u2019s critically important. But the election is going to be decided by a few million people, most of whom voted for Obama last time but have the same level of buyer\u2019s remorse as ticket purchasers on the Titanic.\u201d Obama had no public events scheduled Thursday, but Biden used a New Hampshire campaign speech to attack Romney\u2019s economic policies, calling them a repeat of failed measures that caused economic collapse in 2008. \u201cJust look at what Gov. Romney wants to do,\u201d Biden said to a crowd of 400 supporters in Exeter, considered the birthplace of the Republican Party. \u201cThe Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, the ones that were intended to expire, the ones that will expire this December \u2013 he wants to extend them.\u201d At one point, when a baby started crying during his critique of Romney\u2019s plan, Biden quickly quipped, \u201cI don\u2019t blame the baby for crying,\u201d which was met with applause from the audience. \u201cThat\u2019s one smart baby!\u201d Biden exclaimed. Romney\u2019s campaign, which spent substantial resources to win New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation GOP primary in January, held a conference call Thursday ahead of Biden\u2019s visit featuring prominent Romney supporters, including former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu. \u201cWelcome to New Hampshire Joe Biden,\u201d Sununu said on the call. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t know how to talk about jobs that America needs and it\u2019s a shame you haven\u2019t been able to create the jobs that America needs.\u201d The Obama campaign\u2019s focus on tax policy is part of a larger effort to push the so-called \u201cBuffett Rule,\u201d which would mandate that Americans earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%. Named for billionaire Warren Buffett, who complained about paying a lower tax rate than his secretary, the proposal coming up for a Senate vote next week is championed by the Obama administration as a first step toward bringing more fairness in the tax code. On Wednesday, Obama called for Congress to approve the Buffett Rule, which is strongly opposed by Republicans. Citing \u201csignificant\u201d deficits and the need to be competitive in the 21st century\u2019s \u201ctechnologically integrated economy,\u201d Obama said: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to keep spending more money on tax cuts for wealthy Americans who don\u2019t need them and weren\u2019t even asking for them.\u201d CNN\u2019s latest estimate of the GOP delegate tally shows Romney with 659, Santorum with 275, Newt Gingrich with 140 and Texas Rep. Ron Paul with 71. It takes 1,144 delegates to clinch the nomination. By suspending his campaign, Santorum can continue raising money and likely keep control of some or all of his delegates. Both Gingrich and Paul say they intend to stay in the race to the GOP convention in August. The next primaries are April 24 in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Delaware, with 231  delegates at stake. The goal now for Gingrich and Paul is to prevent Romney from reaching the 1,144-delegate threshold before the convention.

Not for Mitt Romney. Rick Santorum had barely left the stage when a different question loomed.  Can the former Massachusetts governor \u2013 who famously shifted his position on abortion and other hot button issues \u2013 rally skeptical social conservatives in his own party? The answer to that question \u2013 which will have major ramifications in November \u2013 appears uncertain. Romney, Obama battle over women voters Will Romney consider Santorum as V.P.? Gingrich: No one asked me to drop out The Family Research Council\u2019s Tony Perkins told CNN minutes after Santorum suspended his campaign there is such a lack of enthusiasm for Romney that social conservative grass roots operations will likely turn away from the presidential race and towards efforts to put the Senate in GOP hands. Other longtime conservative activists say Romney still has plenty of time to get them excited. But he has to work at it. Veteran conservative strategist Ralph Reed is one of many who told CNN Romney \u201chas some more work to do.\u201d Where should his focus be? Appeal to evangelical voters through \u201cgeneral election messaging, the vice presidential selection, and the convention acceptance speech,\u201d said Reed, who stressed he is \u201cconfident both Gov. Romney and his campaign know they have to build bridges to conservatives, and will work diligently to do so.\u201d Not all conservative activists are so sure. \u201cI would not refuse to talk to him. It\u2019s not too late necessarily, but I don\u2019t know what he could say to me that would make me feel better,\u201d said Michael Farris, who heads a home school grass roots organization that gets out the vote for GOP candidates. Farris told CNN that if the election were held today, he would hand in a blank ballot. He says Romney\u2019s \u201cpropensity to change his story\u201d on issues important to social conservatives, like abortion, is a problem. \u201cIf I were advising him, I\u2019d be looking for some issue to reach out the conservatives with. But he needs to have an issue where people can\u2019t say it\u2019s one more flip flop,\u201d said Farris. \u201cA Republican presidential candidate can\u2019t win without a fully mobilized evangelical base. It\u2019s impossible for Romney to win the general election without evangelicals,\u201d said Farris. Steve Scheffler is a longtime social conservative activist in Iowa, which will be a battleground state in the general election. He told CNN his Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition invited Romney to two presidential forums last year, and he \u201crefused to come.\u201d Scheffler said Romney has done \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d to reach out to the base, which he called a huge mistake. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Romney campaign has any room for error\u201d in the general election. Like other conservative leaders, Scheffler said the issue isn\u2019t so much whether conservatives already going to vote will check the box for Romney over President Obama.  The issue is whether people are going to get out and work for him \u2013 providing critical grass roots energy fueled by the kind of passion that can mean the difference between winning and losing. \u201c95% of the people that are going to man your phone banks are not the old party hacks, they\u2019re the conservative activists. Who\u2019s going to man the phone banks?\u201d Scheffler asked. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous to proceed with an arrogant attitude,\u201d he stressed. But in an editorial board meeting with CNN, Southern Baptist Convention leader Richard Land had a different perspective. \u201cI think that Romney will get the support of most social conservatives and the enthusiastic support of most of them unless he drives them away - unless he picks a non-social conservative running mate, he doesn\u2019t talk about our issues or gives any indication he\u2019s going to soft pedal our issues when it comes to places of influence in a Romney administration,\u201d said Land. Land said he knows Romney \u201cfairly well\u201d and insists he is misunderstood. He said he believes Romney\u2019s transition from pro-abortion rights to anti- abortion was genuine, not a politically motivated flip-flop. Land called Romney a \u201cdata guy\u201d and described a story Romney told him about deliberating over whether to approve embryonic stem cell research as Massachusetts governor. Land said Romney looked at information that made the governor believe an embryo is human life. Land doesn\u2019t endorse candidates, but insisted that intense opposition to Obama will boost support for Romney. \u201cObama does the motivation for us,\u201d said Land. Land described the president\u2019s caught-on-camera remarks to Russia\u2019s leader promising to be flexible after the election as a major motivator that \u201creverberates, reverberates and re-reverberates in the conservative community.\u201d \u201cIt feeds into their fears and suspicions that inside Barack Obama is a radical waiting to get out the day after he is elected to his second term and is no longer accountable to the voters,\u201d said Land. Reed told CNN anti-Obama fervor not enough. \u201cMitt Romney will win the support of evangelicals and conservatives because his opponent is Barack Obama.  But he needs the grassroots enthusiasm of activists who are for him, not just against Obama,\u201d said Reed Multiple conservative leaders compared Romney\u2019s problem with conservatives to troubles John McCain had in 2008, which he helped solve by picking Sarah Palin, a conservative rock star, as his running mate. Land dismissed the analogy in colorful, personal terms, saying there are more \u201cpositive feelings\u201d towards Romney now than there were at this point in the 2008 cycle towards McCain. \u201cHe\u2019s a more likable guy. I mean McCain, even McCain\u2019s friends don\u2019t like him much. His nickname was McNasty when he was in prep school,\u201d said Land. But the data show that Romney actually has less support among evangelical voters than McCain did. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll taken late last month shows Romney with 63 percent of the white, born-again Christian vote in a matchup against Obama. The same poll taken at roughly the same time in 2008 showed McCain with 72 percent support from white, born-again Christian voters. What all conservative activists agree on is how critical Romney\u2019s vice presidential pick will be in galvanizing social conservative voters. \u201cWhether they\u2019re going to work hard for him depends on what he does. If he picks a [Florida GOP Sen.] Marco Rubio, or if he picks a [House Budget Chairman] Paul Ryan they\u2019re going to work for him,\u201d said Land. Some suggest Romney announce his running mate earlier than usual in order to motivate the conservative base. In fact, that urgency was shared by multiple conservative leaders and activists contacted by CNN. One told CNN he would suggest Romney attend the Southern Baptist Convention in June and give a major speech. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to say anything wacko,\u201d said the conservative activist who is sympathetic to Romney and asked not to be identified talking about potentially private advice. He recommended that Romney go after Obama on health care and other issues, talk about the importance of the First Amendment, and praise Southern Baptists for work with the homeless and other charitable efforts. When CNN posed the idea to Land, he responded, \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea.\u201d He described Romney\u2019s cure for disenchanted evangelicals this way: \u201cAll he\u2019s got to do with the base is pick a pro-life nominee and give signals that he will have an administration that will be pro-life, will undo Obamacare if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t do it for us, will have strict constructionist original intent jurists, (and) will not seek to put distance between the United States and Israel. That\u2019s enough,\u201d said Land. CNN\u2019s Keating Holland contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Conservatives laud Santorum's presidential bid But they don't mention Romney They are expected, however, to close ranks Some leading social conservative groups are praising Rick Santorum following his suspension of his Republican presidential campaign. But their reaction Tuesday didn\u2019t mention Mitt Romney, the all-but-certain GOP nominee with Santorum out of the race. That could spell trouble for Romney as he tries now tries to consolidate the Republican base by reaching out to the social conservative voters who backed Santorum and other candidates during the long and divisive battle for the nomination. \u201cRick Santorum\u2019s historic run for president achieved remarkable success because his campaign was based not on money spent, but on the message of faith, family and freedom that he carried. I commend his courage, boldness and tenacity in fighting for the values that made America great, and are fundamental to returning America to greatness,\u201d said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council Action, a leading social conservative group. \u201cMillions of voters flocked to Rick not because he was a Republican, but because he passionately articulated the connection between America\u2019s financial greatness and its moral and cultural wholeness. He realizes that real problem-solving starts with an understanding that the economy and the family are indivisible. Santorum bows out Santorum to 'help' Romney Romney: Santorum will have role in party Gingrich: Santorum showed courage The statement didn\u2019t mention Romney. Neither did a statement by Susan B. Anthony List, another leading social conservative group. \u201cWith great vision and passion, Rick Santorum reached the hearts of pro-life voters and allowed them to show the strength of their voting bloc,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA List. \u201cThe Susan B. Anthony List is proud to have mobilized those key voters.\u201d \u201cPro-life voters are a consistent and growing constituency, who proved invaluable to Senator Santorum in state after state throughout the primary elections. We will continue to reach out and mobilize those voters and millions more like them across the country. The political muscle of the pro-life movement will be critical to defeating President Obama in November.\u201d added Dannenfelser, who also didn\u2019t mention Romney by name. Perkins was the spokesman of a January conference in which three-quarters of the social conservative leaders attending endorsed Santorum\u2019s bid for the nomination. Social conservative voters, who are a crucial part of the GOP base, were the backbone of Santorum\u2019s campaign. They flocked to him for his longtime stance against abortion rights and same-sex marriage, and for his personal story of being a devout Catholic who home-schooled his seven children. Thanks to their support, the former senator from Pennsylvania went from a long shot last year to the top of the pack in February. According to exit polls, Santorum came out on top in states where self-described born-again Christians made up a majority of the GOP primary electorate. With Santorum gone, the big question is whether social conservatives will now support Romney \u2013 or if they\u2019ll sit out the presidential election come November and concentrate their efforts down ballot in the Senate and House races. In an interview with CNN senior congressional correspondent Dana Bash, Perkins said that conservative activists are so unenthusiastic about Romney that many are likely turn their grassroots efforts away from the presidential race and towards Congress \u2013 specifically putting the Senate in Republican hands. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for us to back a candidate our constituents don\u2019t believe in and aren\u2019t excited about,\u201d Perkins said in a telephone interview, speaking about Romney. Perkins also told Bash that the consensus was to turn their \u201cemphasis\u201d to campaigns for Congress rather than campaign for Romney. Evangelical activist Michael Farris was not exactly surprised that Rick Santorum suspended his campaign on Tuesday. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Farris, a longtime political organizer, knows what he\u2019s supposed to do now. \u201cRight now my choice is to sit on my hands and do nothing or to actively try to find some alternative\u201d to Mitt Romney, Farris told CNN.com Religion Editor Dan Gilgoff, soon after Santorum\u2019s announcement. \u201cSome of us just have a hard time supporting a person who said he was going to be more liberal on gay rights than Ted Kennedy,\u201d said Farris, chairman of the Home School Legal Defense Association, referring to remarks Romney made in a 1994 letter, during his unsuccessful Senate bid to try and unseat Kennedy. Gilgoff says that Farris\u2019 reaction is \u201ca stark emblem of the disappointment among religious conservatives over Santorum\u2019s announcement, and a reminder that Romney\u2019s enthusiasm deficit among the conservative evangelicals who form the GOP\u2019s base hasn\u2019t gone away.\u201d But CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein says that in the end, social conservatives will close ranks around Romney. \u201cMitt Romney will do fine among evangelical Christian voters who are very conservative on social and role of government issues, and he will probably win over 90% of Republican voters in the end mostly because whatever they think about Romney, they know they don\u2019t want Barack Obama in the White House for antoher term.\u201d \u201cThis is now a team sport. Everyone knows what team they are on, and the vast majority support their team,\u201d adds Brownstein, editorial director at National Journal.",

            "article_content": "Santorum made his decision after evaluating the race with his family Campaign hoped that Texas would become a winner-take-all state Santorum also wanted Gingrich out of race, but he shows no sign of quitting Financial issues also played a role in Santorum's decision Rick Santorum\u2019s decision to drop out of the Republican presidential race came after he spent the holiday weekend evaluating the race with his family, who were grappling with the latest hospitalization of his 3-year-old daughter Bella. Santorum\u2019s path to the nomination hinged on three puzzle pieces falling neatly in place, multiple sources close to the campaign told CNN, a prospect that grew dimmer with each passing day. The campaign, eagerly looking ahead to a slew of conservative leaning states that vote in May, had hoped that Texas would adjust its proportional primary rules and award its treasure trove of 155 delegates on a winner-take-all basis \u2013 but Texas Republicans dismissed the idea. Santorum was also hoping that Gingrich, who has also been competing for the same conservative anti-Romney voters, would drop out of the race, something the former House Speaker shows no signs of doing. Focus shifts to Romney-Obama showdown Romney: Santorum will have role in party Santorum to 'help' Romney The road ahead for Paul & Gingrich Finally, the campaign understood that a victory in Santorum\u2019s home state of Pennsylvania on April 24 was crucial. Romney\u2019s poll numbers have lately creeped up in Pennsylvania and his campaign was in the process of unleashing a more than $2 million negative ad blitz against Santorum across the state, but Santorum aides said they remained confident that they would pull out a win on their home turf. His campaign reported it was nearly $1 million in debt last month and would have been forced to drain its campaign account to compete with Romney and his allies on the costly Pennsylvania airwaves, another factor in Santorum\u2019s decision. Where do religious conservatives go? \u201cThe Romney team was putting a lot of money out there,\u201d said one Santorum adviser who did not want to be named discussing internal decision-making. \u201cThe budget was a factor.\u201d Despite trailing in the delegate count, Santorum vowed as recently as last week to remain in the race until one candidate reached the 1,144 delegates needed to capture the nomination. However, during a conference call with his wife, Karen, campaign manager and staff before his announcement on Tuesday, Santorum said the decision was based on personal and political factors, according to a Santorum source. A campaign adviser also said the financial state of the campaign probably played a role in the conclusion. \u201cWe made a decision over the weekend that while this presidential race for us is over for me and we will suspend our campaign effective today, we are not done fighting,\u201d Santorum said during his speech in Gettysburg on Tuesday. \u201cWe will continue to fight for those voices for those Americans who stood up and gave us that air under our wings.\u201d He also acknowledged the decision was not entirely political, saying the past weekend was a \u201ctime of prayer and thought\u201d as he and his family cared for his daughter Isabella, the youngest of Santorum\u2019s seven children, who suffers from Trisomy 18, a chromosomal condition. Santorum\u2019s organization announced they were halting campaign events on Friday because the candidate\u2019s three-year-old daughter Bella was admitted to the hospital. Bella, the youngest of Santorum\u2019s seven children, suffers from a rare chromosomal disorder called Trisomy 18, which causes severe medical and developmental problems. Santorum\u2019s departure leaves rival Mitt Romney with a firm grasp on the nomination but also deep wounds left to heal within the GOP. Priebus: \u201cTime heals some wounds\u201d Santorum spoke to Romney before Tuesday\u2019s speech, according to a Republican source. But Santorum aide Hogan Gidley told CNN an endorsement of the former Massachusetts governor \u201cis not a inevitability.\u201d Gidley said Santorum and Romney are attempting to schedule a meeting to discuss an endorsement and that the latter would like it to occur \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d Santorum entered the race with a voting record in the House and Senate of a staunch social conservative and presented himself on the campaign trail as the alternative to more moderate candidates, who he said had compromised their ideals for political expediency. More recently, he elevated his fire directly at Romney, labeling him a flip-flopper on conservative issues including abortion rights, cap and trade and government mandated health care. He also repeatedly accused the former executive of failing to tell the truth. \u201cFor somebody who is maybe the weakest candidate we\u2019ve every had on the pro-life issue to attack the leader of the pro-life cause is absurd,\u201d Santorum said at a forum in Troy, Michigan on February 25. \u201cHe glosses over and doesn\u2019t even tell the truth\u2026.Here is a guy who is the ultimate flip-flopper running for president, and he\u2019s attacking me for not being principled?  That doesn\u2019t wash.\u201d Santorum officially announced his candidacy on June 6, 2011, and quickly began airing radio ads in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the first three states to vote. Soon after his official announcement, he told CNN that his bid would be based on a consistent conservative record. \u201cI think I stand out because I have been a consistent conservative, someone who has been a leader, someone who\u2019s had the courage to lead on a variety of hot-button topics before they were popular, like entitlement reform. I\u2019ve been a leader on that,\u201d he said. In August, when his candidacy was barely making waves in key early voting states, Santorum maintained his effort would take a long view of the race, saying at a rally, \u201cThis is the little-engine-that-could campaign.\u201d He was eclipsed first by Michele Bachmann\u2019s entry in the race, then Rick Perry\u2019s. When those two faltered, Herman Cain became the conservative favorite. As Cain was faltering amid accusations of sexual harrassment, Newt Gingrich was the last conservative to slingshot past Santorum, taking a lead over Romney in polls in November and December. At GOP presidential debates throughout the fall, Santorum was mostly marginalized as the most questions went to the top-tier candidates. In the months leading up to Iowa\u2019s caucuses, Santorum became the first GOP presidential candidate to visit all of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties, often sporting what became his signature look (and the butt of jokes): a sweater vest bearing his campaign\u2019s logo. Despite all that time in Iowa, Santorum didn\u2019t see substantial traction in polls until January as Gingrich withered in the heat of negative ads from Romney\u2019s campaign and a super PAC that supports him. And on election night in Iowa, it looked like Santorum had narrowly missed his first surprise victory in the race when initial counts showed he had come eight votes short of beating Romney. The narrow miss was enough to energize conservatives to contribute to the cause and give Santorum a spike in fundraising. And his conservative rivals began to fall. Bachmann dropped out of the race the day after Iowa. Two weeks later, the certified vote in Iowa showed that Santorum had actually won there and Perry dropped out of the race later that same day. Gingrich then won in South Carolina and Romney won in Florida and Nevada, states that Santorum largely ignored to concentrate on more conservative voters down the road. That strategy paid off when he stunned Romney by sweeping Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri all on the same day and changed the trajectory of the race. Romney, who had begun to take on the air of the Republican nominee by focusing on President Barack Obama rather than Republican rivals, had to turn his focus back toward his challenger and built up a nearly 400-delegate lead in the race to the 1,144 needed to clinch the nomination. Zelizer: The real race is now on Despite increasingly long odds, Santorum maintained throughout the last weeks of March that he would stay in the race, citing flawed delegate math and upcoming contests that looked to be in his favor. \u201cOur delegate calculation has Gov. Romney far below 50%,\u201d Santorum said on March 19 on CBS. \u201cWe think there\u2019s a lot of primaries coming up, including Pennsylvania my home state, where we can make some big delegates. Texas will be another great state for us. We feel very good that we\u2019re going to continue to win and do well.\u201d A senior Santorum source said that Bella\u2019s hospitalization was a major factor in the decision to bow out. \u201cWhen you have enough time with your adrenaline down, you start to think about what\u2019s really important,\u201d the source told CNN. Sitting in the hospital with his daughter for the second time during this campaign put that in perspective for Santorum, the source said.",

            "article_content": "President Obama warns that Republican policies will reverse progress on women's issues \"They are issues that impact all of us,\" Obama tells a White House forum Polls indicate an electoral gender gap, with Obama leading GOP rivals among women voters The fight for progress must continue, Obama says President Barack Obama on Friday added a political element to an annual White House forum on women\u2019s issues by saying Republican policies would reverse progress that his administration has made. Citing steps from the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 \u2013 the first bill he signed into law \u2013 to expanded government loans for small businesses run by women to increased Pell grants for female college students, Obama said the November election represented a choice in future direction. \u201cWhen it comes to our efforts on behalf of women and girls, I\u2019m proud of the accomplishments that we can point to,\u201d Obama told the third White House Forum on Women and the Economy. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve got a lot more to do, but there\u2019s no doubt we\u2019ve made progress,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe policies we\u2019ve put in place over the past three years have started to take hold.  And what we can\u2019t do now is go back to the policies that got us into so many of the problems that we\u2019ve been dealing with in the first place. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\u201d For example, Obama said, repealing the 2010 health care reform law \u2013 as advocated by his likely Republican challenger in November, Mitt Romney \u2013 would remove 1 million young women from their parents\u2019 health care coverage. Cutting all government funding for Planned Parenthood \u2013 another Republican objective, because of the group\u2019s abortion and contraception services \u2013 would prevent women from getting preventive care such as mammograms provided by the organization, Obama said. Instead, the focus should be to ensure that women have equal opportunities to participate and succeed in the workforce and society, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we mean when we say that these issues are more than just a matter of policy,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd when we talk about these issues that primarily impact women, we\u2019ve got to realize they are not just women\u2019s issues; they are family issues, they are economic issues, they are growth issues, they are issues about  American competitiveness. They are issues that impact all of us.\u201d The conference attended by Cabinet members, women\u2019s leaders and others occurred as Obama\u2019s re-election bid kicked into high gear, with Romney marching toward the Republican nomination and the two exchanging increasingly hostile attacks this week. Recent polls show Obama holding a solid leader over Romney among female voters in likely battleground states. While too early to be considered definitive, the polling indicates that a conservative shift by Romney in the primary campaign is costing him support among independent women voters. On Sunday, a USA Today/Gallup poll of 12 possible battleground states in November indicated that Obama held a 51%-42% lead over Romney overall. Among women, Obama\u2019s lead was 54%-36%. In addition, a CNN/ORC International survey released last week indicated Obama leading Romney nationwide among registered voters by 11 points, 54%-43%, up from a five-point advantage in February. Among women, the president\u2019s lead was 60%-37%. Controversies in recent months over exempting birth control from health care coverage, spiced by conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh\u2019s labeling an advocate of contraception coverage a \u201cslut,\u201d raised the profile of women\u2019s issues in the political spotlight. Conservatives including presidential hopeful Rick Santorum criticized the Obama administration for requiring religious institutions to provide contraception coverage in health care plans of employees at affiliated workplaces such as hospitals. The critics framed the issue as one of religious liberty, while Democrats responded that critics were attacking women\u2019s rights involving heath care choices. Romney added to the debate by saying he wanted to \u201cget rid\u201d of Planned Parenthood, a comment that referred to its government funding but was seized on by Democrats as a full-fledged assault against the organization. \u201cThe so-called war on women has resonance, and the Democrats appear to be winning the spin war,\u201d CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley said. \u201cTheir accusation that Republicans are declaring a war on women has clearly seeped into the political groundwater and has hurt Romney.\u201d The former Massachusetts governor responded to the poll results Sunday by noting that \u201cwe have work to do to make sure we take our message to the women of America, so they understand how we\u2019re going to get good jobs and we\u2019re going to have a bright economic future for them and for their kids, and make sure that these distortions that the Democrats throw in are clarified and the truth is heard.\u201d As a first step, Romney and Santorum both expressed the same position as Obama when asked Thursday about whether women should be able to join the all-male Augusta National Golf Club, site of the Masters tournament. Their answer was yes, though it was up to the private club to decide, which was how White House press secretary Jay Carney had earlier explained Obama\u2019s stance. Romney\u2019s campaign and other top Republicans say the gender gap in current polling will disappear once the divisive GOP primary battle ends. However, history shows that women have tended to vote more for Democrats over the past three decades. \u201cPollsters first noticed the gender gap in the 1980 election between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, and it has been a constant in American politics since then,\u201d CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. \u201cIn presidential elections, the percent of women voting for the Democrat has usually been seven to nine points higher than the percent of men voting for the Democrat. In 2008, for example, 49% of men voted for Barack Obama, compared to 56% of women.\u201d Obama has made women\u2019s issues a high-profile theme of his administration, starting with the creation of the White House Council on Women and Girls that hosted Friday\u2019s forum. He told the gathering that the influential role of women in his life, including a mother who nurtured and pushed him to succeed as well as his wife and two daughters, gave him a personal prism on women\u2019s issues. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about women and women\u2019s issues lately, as there should be,\u201d Obama said, calling some of the analysis about women voters \u201coversimplified.\u201d \u201cWomen are not some monolithic bloc,\u201d Obama said to applause. \u201cWomen are not  an interest group. You shouldn\u2019t be treated that way.\u201d At the same time, he cited issues of particular concern to women, such as Republican efforts to change the Violence Against Women Act, which originally passed with bipartisan support in 1994 and now is up for reauthorization by Congress. \u201cThat is not something we should still be arguing about,\u201d Obama said to cheers before making a plea for the fight to continue. \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell anybody here that progress is hard,\u201d the president said. \u201cChange can come slow. Opportunity and equality don\u2019t come without a fight, and sometimes you have got to keep fighting even after you have won some victories. Things don\u2019t always move forward. Sometimes they move backward if you are not fighting for them.\u201d CNN\u2019s Paul Steinhauser and Becky Brittain contributed to this report.",

Romney, Santorum focus on Wisconsin Romney and his allies have outspent their rivals by a little less than a 4-1 margin on television ads in the state, according to figures provided by an unaligned Republican media consultant that tracks ad spending in the nomination race.

Santorum rep: GOP race 'long way to go' Speculation on Romney running mate Romney stays optimistic before Tuesday vote There is a growing call for Santorum to drop out of the race and allow the party to coalesce around Romney, but Santorum used his rival\u2019s spending in Wisconsin to dispute the notion the race is over. Romney: Wisconsin win path to nomination Santorum, Romney at Wisconsin dinner \u201cOn a North Dakota radio station the other day, (former New Hampshire) Gov. (John) Sununu, one of Romney\u2019s chief spokesmen, tried to spin this, \u2018Well, this race is over, this race is over.\u2019 Well, then why is he spending $4 million in Wisconsin if this race is over? If it\u2019s over and there\u2019s no chance, then why he is bothering even campaigning anymore, if it\u2019s over?\u201d Santorum asked Sunday. Romney\u2019s campaign and the super PAC backing his candidacy, Restore Our Future, will have spent about $3.028 million in television ads through Tuesday\u2019s voting, while Santorum and the super PAC supporting him, the Red, White and Blue Fund, will have put out about $810,310. Romney\u2019s campaign is playing one ad that criticizes Santorum over voting for bills that include family planning funds while saying he personally opposed such programs and another that touts the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s fiscal conservative credentials. Restore Our Future\u2019s ads also hit the former senator over the family planning issue and use a Santorum speech in which he says, \u201cI don\u2019t care what the unemployment rate is going to be. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d The commercial also highlights Santorum\u2019s votes on the debt ceiling and congressional earmarks. Santorum\u2019s campaign previously had fought back on attacks that used the unemployment sound bite, saying, \u201cRick was making the point that the Santorum campaign is not based solely on unemployment rates \u2013 it\u2019s based on returning freedom and restoring this country\u2019s greatness \u2013 and it\u2019s a mistake for anyone to try and reduce the idea of America to just the \u2018economy,\u2019 \u201d Santorum communications director Hogan Gidley told CNN last week. Restore Our Future has deployed its financial juggernaut in earlier caucuses and primaries not only on TV and radio ads but also robocalls and mailers to tout Romney\u2019s record and attack both Santorum and Newt Gingrich. The Red, White and Blue Fund\u2019s ad attacks Romney for raising fees in Massachusetts by more $700 million as governor and hits him on the state\u2019s health care reform effort, saying it \u201cserved as the blueprint for \u2018Obamacare\u2019 and its $1.7 trillion price tag. We just can\u2019t trust Mitt Romney.\u201d Santorum links Romney, Obama in ad The super PAC also devoted resources to robocalls, spending more than $62,000 to reach Wisconsin voters, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. Several voters told CNN on Sunday that all of these ads were a turnoff and would not sway their vote. \u201cI\u2019m just sick of them. They\u2019ve been going on for a long time, and they\u2019re very negative. And I\u2019m just tired of them. I just turn it to another channel,\u201d said Diana Hollander of Sun Prairie. Laura Zielski, a Republican from Waunakee, said she had received more than 12 calls in two days. \u201cIt was just, like, all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like them because I am Republican. I don\u2019t like them pitting one against the other. Even the Romney campaign, and I\u2019m for Romney, but I don\u2019t like that he would be down on Santorum. I would like us to be united.\u201d Zielski said she was planning to vote for Romney despite the negative ads. Arlen Leholm, an independent from Madison, has also been inundated with phone calls that start during the day and run into the evening. \u201cOh my God, yes. Most of them were Romney calls but some Santorum. But I don\u2019t pay much attention to that. I listened to the first few all the way through.\u201d One robocall from the Romney campaign attacks his opponent, saying, \u201cRick Santorum repeatedly supported big labor bosses\u201d as well as claiming the former senator from Pennsylvania \u201cjoined liberal Democrats against collective-bargaining legislation.\u201d The latter apparently was a reference to Santorum\u2019s 1996 vote against right-to-work legislation that would forbid people applying for a job to be forced to join a union. The call ends again trying to link Santorum to \u201cbig labor bosses.\u201d Labor issues are a controversial topic in Wisconsin as Republican Gov. Scott Walker faces a recall election after supporting a bill effectively to end collective-bargaining for public employees. Santorum has said calling him a friend of big labor is not true. He said he voted for some of the bills supported by unions because they were important to many of his Pennsylvania constituents, although he would not back the measures on a national scale. The super PAC backing Romney also is calling voters in the state to attack Santorum for having voted to fund the \u201cultraliberal, pro-abortion Planned Parenthood.\u201d That attack refers to bills Santorum voted for that included money for family planning. Santorum has said that while he personally opposed those programs, he reluctantly voted for that legislation because of other things included in the bills. The recorded call ends by saying a voter \u201cdeserves a leader who stands up for our principles, not a Washington insider.\u201d Some of the harshest attacks come in the mailers. Restore Our Future spent at least $118,000 on direct mail in the state, according to filings with the FEC. One sent out by the pro-Romney super PAC \u2013 obtained by CNN \u2013 shows pictures of Santorum and Hillary Clinton. It goes after Santorum, saying he \u201chas been in Washington too long \u2026 he voted with Hillary Clinton to allow felons to vote. Rick Santorum thinks letting felons vote is a good idea.\u201d Legislation that Clinton, then a senator, advocated would have restored voting rights to felons after they completed all parole or pardon requirements. Another mailer asks, \u201cWhat do you believe is our best path forward?\u201d Above a picture of Romney, it says, \u201cThe American way,\u201d and above a picture of Santorum are the words \u201cor the Washington way?\u201d The ad lists contrasts between Romney and Santorum. Romney is called a \u201cconservative businessman\u201d who created thousands of jobs and also eliminated a $3 billion deficit in Massachusetts as governor, while Santorum is labeled a \u201cWashington politician\u201d who as senator supported increases to the federal debt ceiling and voted to \u201cspend millions on wasteful pork projects.\u201d At the bottom, the flier says: \u201cThe facts speak for themselves.\u201d Gingrich\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t spending any money in the state on ads, but the super PAC supporting his candidacy is. It bought $129,000 worth of cable time and spent $46,802 for radio and e-mail advertising and $12,500 for Web ads, according to FEC filings.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney doesn't want to speculate on a vice president, but others sure do Candy Crowley: Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell could possibly help Romney in the South New Jersey Gov. Christ Christie would be a boost to the authenticity gap, she observes Would U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan want to crunch budget numbers from the VP spot? Mitt Romney thinks a Wisconsin/Maryland/D.C. sweep Tuesday night will set him sailing to the nomination long before the August Republican convention. Still, he\u2019s not about to own it. Asked at a diner in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin whether he had made a vice presidential pick, Romney said no. \u201cI\u2019m not presumptuous enough because I\u2019m not the nominee yet.\u201d Romney optimistic ahead of Tuesday vote Rest assured someone inside Camp Romney is thinking about vice presidential picks. The candidate, though, follows a long line of almost-nominees who do not want to be caught publicly musing about a No. 2. There is no such reticence in the rest of political world, where it is never too early to rush the season with a quick round of veepstakes. Among the most frequently mentioned vice presidential possibilities: Paul Ryan on his Romney endorsement Who will the GOP nominee pick as VP? Sen. McConnell not endorsing Romney \u2013 Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a popular, media-savvy guy from the South, which has not been fertile territory for Romney. And Virginia is a swing state, which swung Obama-Biden in 2008. But that McDonnell-signed Virginia law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound procedure before an abortion might not do much to close that giant Republican gender gap. \u2013 If Romney has an authenticity deficit, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie oozes it. Republicans love his in-your-face-ness, but part of the \u201cauthentic Christie\u201d is a temper: Christie once told a law student who argued with him at a town hall meeting, \u201cLet me tell you something, after you graduate from law school, you conduct yourself like that in a courtroom,  your rear end\u2019s gonna get thrown in jail, idiot.\u201d After the man was removed, Christie told the audience that he tried to be patient, \u201cand i think, \u2018Damn, man, I\u2019m governor \u2013 could you just shut up for a second.\u2019 \u201d Christie may also have a geographic problem. An all-Northeast ticket might be a hard sell west of the Mississippi. If Romney sees geography as important (and he might not), there are plenty of choices to balance out the \u201cEast Coast\u201d thing. \u2013 First among equals is U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the brainy budget star of the House. Paul Ryan endorses Romney Downside: Ryan is the Republican face of Medicare reform, not a huge plus in an election year. \u2013 U.S. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota is solid and versatile. He has the distinction of toppling Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle in 2004. \u2013 Two-term Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels is regarded as a bright light in the party. Who is to blame for high gas prices? The Campaign Trail Paul Ryan: 'Misspoke' on military budget Still, all three declined chances to run for the top spot, so there are big questions as to why No. 2 would look better.  So far, only Ryan has shown nuanced interest. \u201cI\u2019m focused on doing my job. So it\u2019s just not my forte to get into that kind of speculation,\u201d he told me on Sunday. \u2013 Also offering a change-up in geography and resume, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio is a seasoned though not scintillating  Washington veteran of Congress and the Bush administration. \u2013 Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal also makes the cut.  Though his star has been higher, Jindal still brings youth, diversity, party brand conservatism and a breadth of policy experience to the table \u2013 not to mention those Southern roots. His endorsement of Rick Perry might not help.  Just sayin\u2019. Here are some other people sometimes mentioned: \u2013 New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez has a trifecta of political assets. She is female, Hispanic and the governor of a swing state. Debits: Martinez is untested and unknown on the national scene as is South Carolina\u2019s Gov. Nikki Haley, whose name comes up from time to time. There have been stumbles for both in their first terms, but they are sharp and know how to wield power. Still, the thinking in and around Camp Romney is that whoever they pick must be seen as having the resume and the chops to step into the No. 1 slot if necessary. And finally, someone who is always mentioned: \u2013 U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is a tea party favorite, a rising star from a swing state and a Cuban-American, which could help build an inroad to the politically pivotal Hispanic community. A senator for less than two years, he is also young and green and unwilling to play the veepstakes. \u201cMy answer hasn\u2019t changed. I\u2019m not going to be vice president,\u201d he said Thursday. They almost always say things like that. Until they say yes.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Mitt Romney responds to Etch A Sketch comment by affirming his conservatism Rivals jump on Romney aide's remark that his campaign can reset like an Etch A Sketch Jeb Bush endorses Romney and calls for Republican unity The Louisiana primary Saturday is the next contest in the Republican presidential race Mitt Romney picked up a highly prized endorsement Wednesday from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush after a convincing victory the night before in the Illinois primary but then saw a top adviser\u2019s televised comment provide new ammunition to his trailing rivals in the Republican presidential race. Eric Fehrnstrom, Romney\u2019s senior campaign adviser, was asked in a CNN interview Wednesday morning whether the former Massachusetts governor had been forced to adopt conservative positions in the rugged race that could hurt his standing with moderates in November\u2019s general election. \u201cI think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes,\u201d Fehrnstrom responded. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again.\u201d Rival candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, who are vying for conservative support against the more moderate Romney, seized on the comment as indicative of their longstanding criticism that Romney shifts his positions on issues such as health care reform and abortion to suit his political needs. Etch A Sketch shakes up GOP race Romney's Etch A Sketch headache Retracing the Etch A Sketch flap Santorum: What you see is what you get Gingrich brought out an Etch A Sketch at a campaign appearance in Louisiana, where the next primary takes place Saturday. \u201cYou have to stand for something that lasts longer than this,\u201d Gingrich said at the Lake Charles event, holding the drawing toy invented in 1959. \u201cYou could not have found a more perfect illustration of why people distrust Romney than to have his (adviser) say that the Etch A Sketch allows you to erase everything in the general election,\u201d Gingrich added. \u201cYou have to read the guy\u2019s quote to realize \u2013 if he had set out to highlight for everybody why we distrust Romney, I think he couldn\u2019t have done a better job.\u201d Santorum\u2019s campaign posted a photo on Twitter of the candidate using an Etch A Sketch, saying it showed him \u201cstudying up on (Romney\u2019s) policy positions.\u201d Romney \u201cwill say what he needs to say to win the election before him, and if he has to say something different because it\u2019s a different election and a different group of voters, he will say that, too,\u201d Santorum said while campaigning in Harvey, Louisiana. \u201cWell, that should be comforting to all of you who are voting in this primary.\u201d Fehrnstrom later said he was referring to the campaign as a whole, and Romney spoke to reporters after an afternoon event to try to exercise some damage control. \u201cOrganizationally, a general election campaign takes on a different profile,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThe issues I am running on will be exactly the same. I am running as a conservative Republican. I was a conservative Republican governor. I will be running as a conservative Republican nominee, at that point hopefully, for president. The policies and positions are the same.\u201d However, the Etch A Sketch remark \u2013 coming on what should have been a triumphant day that happened to be Romney\u2019s 43rd wedding anniversary \u2013 threatened to sap attention from his growing momentum toward winning the nomination to face President Barack Obama in November. Romney scored a solid victory in Tuesday\u2019s Illinois primary, followed by the endorsement Wednesday from Bush, a respected Republican leader once considered a possible presidential contender this year. \u201cNow is the time for Republicans to unite behind Gov. Romney and take our message of fiscal conservatism and job creation to all voters this fall,\u201d Bush, the brother of one Republican former president and son of another, said in a statement. A spokesman for Gingrich said the Bush endorsement merely demonstrated the Republican establishment\u2019s push for Romney instead of a less conventional candidate like the former House speaker. Romney captures key Illinois areas to win Romney: I can get us out of this mess Gingrich: Santorum didn't mean it Santorum: We don't need a manager \u201cIt\u2019s a completion of the establishment trifecta,\u201d Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond said in reference to endorsements for Romney by former President George H.W. Bush, former Sen. Bob Dole and now Jeb Bush. Analysts sounded like the Republican campaign was essentially over. Romney\u2019s Illinois victory showed \u201cthe writing\u2019s on the wall\u201d for the rest of the field, said CNN analyst Erick Erickson, a longtime Romney critic. \u201cThis comes down to Mitt Romney,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cNot only is he the front-runner but the nominee. This is a clear win for Mitt Romney tonight in a state with blue-collar voters, with industrial voters and suburban voters.\u201d The Illinois result followed established patterns in the Republican race, with Romney doing well in urban and suburban areas while Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator who is his main conservative rival, ran strong in rural areas. In Chicago, Romney had 55% of the total with 99% of precincts reporting, while Santorum notched 25%, according to the city\u2019s election website. In Lake County, one of the surrounding counties near Chicago, Romney had 56% with all precincts reporting, according to the clerk\u2019s office website, and Santorum had 28%. Texas Rep. Ron Paul and Gingrich trailed well back, according to unofficial results from local clerks and election boards. The results gave Romney at least 41 of the 54 delegates up for grabs in the state, increasing his total to 562, according to CNN\u2019s estimate. Santorum is second with 249, Gingrich third with 137 and Paul last with 69. A total of 1,144 delegates is needed to clinch the GOP nomination. Romney\u2019s campaign trumpeted the Illinois showing as a broad-based triumph, seeking to overcome questions about the candidate\u2019s ability to win over the conservative GOP base. \u201cRomney won with tea party voters. He won with Catholics,\u201d campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said. \u201cThere are a lot of groups within the Republican Party, and Gov. Romney has won their votes.\u201d In remarks to cheering supporters, Romney resumed his front-runner attacks on Obama\u2019s economic, health care and spending policies. \u201cThe simple truth is, this president does not understand the genius of this economy,\u201d Romney said, adding that \u201cthe American economy is fueled by freedom.\u201d Santorum skipped Illinois on primary night and awaited the results in Gettysburg in his home state of Pennsylvania. In his concession speech, below a banner that proclaimed \u201cFreedom,\u201d he said he was staying in the race to battle a government that he complained was \u201ctrying to order us around.\u201d \u201cThis is an election about fundamental and foundational things,\u201d Santorum said, attacking Romney\u2019s claim of greater business and government management experience. \u201cThis is an election about not who\u2019s the best person to manage Washington or manage the economy. We don\u2019t need a manager, we need someone who\u2019s going to pull government up by the roots and do something to liberate the private sector in America.\u201d Santorum said he expected to do better in upcoming primaries and caucuses, adding: \u201cWe are feeling very, very good about winning Louisiana on Saturday.\u201d Santorum has made a strong showing in traditionally conservative Southern states, winning Alabama and Mississippi a week ago, while Romney finished third. Another Santorum victory in Louisiana would continue the pattern of the race, while a Romney win would signal growing support from the conservative base that he needs to finish off his rivals. Romney\u2019s Illinois victory followed an overwhelming triumph Sunday in Puerto Rico, where Romney got 83% of the vote and picked up all 20 delegates at stake. Gingrich, who appears increasingly unlikely to mount another comeback after two previous campaign surges, said Thursday  he is used to fighting from behind. \u201cTo defeat Barack Obama, Republicans can\u2019t nominate a candidate who relies on outspending his opponents 7-1,\u201d Gingrich said. Saul, the Romney spokeswoman, responded:  \u201cThat\u2019s like a basketball team complaining they lost to another team because their players were too tall. \u201cFundraising is part of a campaign. So is organization,\u201d Saul said. Gingrich plans to head to Louisiana, as does Paul, the libertarian champion with a small but devoted following.

            "article_content": "CNN defines the terms and buzzwords of the 2012 U.S. presidential election What's the difference between a red state, a blue state and a purple state? Find out who Chuck Norris endorsed in this year's Republican primary race Know your caucuses from your primaries? Your superdelegates from your Super PACs? As Republican presidential hopefuls battle to win the right to take on Barack Obama in November, we\u2019ve defined the array of words and acronyms that will define this year\u2019s election. Attack ads \u2013 An ad that promotes another candidate\u2019s perceived weakness, rather than the good qualities of the candidate the ad wants you to vote for. Battleground states \u2013 Both sides concentrate their efforts on those states they want to keep from falling into the other\u2019s hands, and those they think they could take from the other party. States seen as safe will not see an influx of candidates or cash, as the White House hopefuls consider it better to spend their time and money in the battleground states. This time round, Florida \u2013 center of the controversial 2000 election \u2013 will again be a key state, as will Ohio and Pennsylvania. Blue state \u2013 Traditionally a Democratic-controlled state. Caucus \u2013 Local party members get together for an evening of debate before deciding who they will support for their party\u2019s presidential nomination. The process is open for all to see and takes place in someone\u2019s home or a town hall rather than a voting booth. Debates \u2013 Debates are held between the Democratic nominees, the Republican nominees, as well as in the presidential campaign between the Democratic and Republican candidates. Rules for answering and the format of the debate are laid down in advance, taking much of the spontaneity out of the debate. But they are still seen as important to the race, and each candidate\u2019s performance \u2013 best answer, worst answer, even appearance \u2013 is analyzed in the media for days after. The candidates for vice president typically have their own face-off. Delegate \u2013 A person chosen at local level to represent the state at the party\u2019s National Convention. They are there to support a particular candidate based on the results of the state primary or caucus. Electoral College \u2013 The Electoral College was created in the early years of the United States. Each state has a number of Electoral College votes depending on its population. California has 55, while a number of smaller states have only three. With the exception of Nebraska and Maine, all electoral votes are cast for the candidate that wins the state, no matter what the margin. A presidential candidate needs 270 Electoral College votes to win the election. The system can mean a candidate wins the popular vote but does not win the election. Endorsements \u2013 Come in three types: From celebrities, from newspapers and from political figures and organizations. Whether any endorsement sways voter opinion is debatable but all candidates fight hard behind the scenes to earn them. In this election, notable endorsements have included House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and business magnate Donald Trump coming out for Republican candidate Mitt Romney, and actor Chuck Norris endorsing Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. When newspapers give an endorsement, they usually do it in the form of an editorial in support of their candidate. FEC \u2013 Federal Election Commission enforces U.S. federal election law, discloses campaign finance information and oversees public funding of presidential elections. Favorite son \u2013 A politician winning support in a state because of connections to that state such as being born there or having held public office there. GOP \u2013 Grand Old Party, nickname of the Republican Party. Magic Number \u2013 The number of Electoral College votes a candidate needs in the general election, and the number of delegates a nominee needs in the primary process. In the general election, state wins translate into Electoral College votes based on the state\u2019s population. A candidate needs 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency. In the nominating process, Republicans need 1,144 delegates and each state has its own rules on whether they are assigned as a proportion of the number of votes received or if they all go to the winner of the state vote. Democratic candidates need 2,025 delegates, usually earned as a proportion of state votes, but this time round there is no challenge to incumbent President Barack Obama. Party national conventions \u2013 A gathering of the party faithful to formally select the presidential and vice presidential candidates. Involves state delegations standing around a state banner and announcing that they come from \u201cthe great state of\u2026\u201d This year, the Democrats have their convention in Charlotte, North Carolina from September 3-6; the Republicans will have theirs in Tampa, Florida from August 27-30. Primary \u2013 Primaries are generally only open to party members. Democrats and Republicans vote for the candidate they want to be their party\u2019s presidential candidate. Republican and Democratic primaries do not have to be held on the same day. Purple state \u2013 A state that regularly swings from one party to the other. Push polling \u2013 Similar to an attack ad but disguised as opinion polling. During the course of the poll questions, spurious information or disinformation about a candidate will be mentioned to those being surveyed. Red state \u2013 Traditionally a Republican-controlled state. Stump speech \u2013 A stump speech is the candidate\u2019s form speech in which he mentions key policies, family background and asks for citizens\u2019 votes. It is generally repeated in the same form in state after state, county after county, with only minor tweaks for each venue. Super Tuesday \u2013 Super Tuesday is the biggest single day of the Republican presidential nomination process. This year, 10 states choose their Republican candidate for president, including Ohio, Massachusetts, and Virginia. More than 400 delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday, which takes place on March 6. Superdelegate \u2013 Members of the party hierarchy with an individual vote at the National Convention on who the candidate will be. Their vote does not have to reflect any primary result, or the popular vote of the party. They can pledge support to one candidate and then change their mind later. What exactly are Super PACs? Super PACs \u2013 A controversial 2010 court decision swept away restrictions on the amount of money corporations can donate to political action committees (PACs). In the wake of the ruling, a new breed of PACs called Super PACs were formed that can receive unlimited contributions from corporations and unions to use to advocate for or against a candidate. While they are banned from coordinating their efforts with candidates, some Super PACs are run by their former aides or close associates.

            "article_content": "CNN LIVE: Tune in Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET for the last presidential debate before Super Tuesday, the CNN/Arizona Republican Party Debate hosted by John King. Follow it on Twitter at #CNNDebate and on Facebook at CNN Politics. For real-time coverage of the Arizona and Michigan primaries, go to CNNPolitics.com or to the CNN apps or the CNN mobile website. NEW: More than 200,000 early ballots cast in Arizona so far The final debate before a series of key primaries is Wednesday night on CNN Rick Santorum accuses Obama of ignoring the Constitution Mitt Romney and Ron Paul say Santorum is not a fiscal conservative On the eve of the last debate before crucial primaries, Republican presidential challengers Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich battled for conservative support by targeting President Barack Obama in increasingly strident attacks Tuesday. Santorum told a crowd in Arizona, which will hold its primary with Michigan on February 28, that Obama and liberals consider the U.S. Constitution an out-of-date document for modern times. Citing the reported comment by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that the South African Constitution is a better modern model in some respects, Santorum said such thinking amounted to disrespect on the political left for America\u2019s founding document. Obama believes \u201cthat this document has lived past its expiration date and that we need something new, and since it is so hard to change, these old men that put this together made it really hard for it to change, so we\u2019ll just find out a new way,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cWe\u2019ll use the courts or in the case of President Obama we\u2019ll just run roughshod over the Constitution and do whatever we want to do.\u201d Romney attacks Santorum as an 'insider' GOP battle becomes matter of faith Gingrich rep: Voters don't want Romney DCCC chair: Gingrich line 'irresponsible' Gingrich, meanwhile, said in an interview on the CBS program \u201cThe Early Morning\u201d that Obama\u2019s policies pander to Islamic countries and the federal government refuses to \u201ctalk accurately about radical Islam.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s dangerous to America,\u201d Gingrich said a day after he accused Obama of being incapable of defending the country. Gingrich also criticized Obama over what he called \u201coutrageously anti-American energy\u201d policies such as the failure to grant approval for the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada\u2019s tar sand production and the administration\u2019s push for more efficient cars. At a later campaign event, Gingrich outlined his energy policy by calling for opening up federal holdings on land and at sea for development, as well as writing off the cost of new equipment in the first year. Both Santorum and Gingrich have ratched up their rhetoric in recent days as the topsy-turvy campaign endured another shift, with Santorum surging to the top of the polls while Gingrich has slipped well back. The two are considered the conservative challengers to the more moderate Mitt Romney, a consistent top-tier candidate who has received solid but, so far, limited support. The fourth candidate, Texas Rep. Ron Paul,  also has the backing of a devoted, but limited, following for his libertarian views. The 8 p.m. ET debate Wednesday, to be broadcast on CNN, will be the last face-to-face showdown before the Arizona and Michigan primaries and subsequent contests including the Super Tuesday showdown on March 6 when 10 states and 437 delegates will be at stake. A new CNN/Time/ORC International poll Tuesday showed Romney and Santorum in a statistical tie at the top among likely voters in next week\u2019s Arizona primary, with Gingrich well back in third place and Paul trailing. Arizona officials said that more than 200,000 early votes had been cast a week before the primary, a dynamic expected to favor Romney because the early balloting began before Santorum\u2019s surge began. Randy Pullen, a former chairman of the Arizona Republican Party and a prominent Romney supporter, said the expected Romney lead in early voting should overcome Santorum\u2019s rising popularity. \u201cOn election day, I think Rick Santorum is going to win. But I think early balloting is going to Mitt. I think enough votes have already been cast,\u201d Pullen said. Romney campaigned Tuesday in Michigan, which is considered his home turf because he grew up there and his father George served as governor back in the 1960s and \u201970s. Santorum\u2019s surge has raised the previously unimaginable possibility that Romney could lose Michigan, a result that would launch questions about whether Romney can gain any conservative backing to win the nomination. Pullen said a Romney loss in Michigan would be a \u201cdevastating\u201d defeat. \u201cThat would be very difficult to explain \u2014 how you lose your home state,\u201d Pullen said, though he added a loss in Michigan could be offset by a win in Arizona. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich ratcheted up their attacks against President Barack Obama on Monday as they competed for conservative votes ahead of primaries and caucuses in the Republican presidential race. Seeking to establish his conservative credentials in the face of Santorum\u2019s energized campaign, Romney declared he was anti-abortion and would cut off funding for Planned Parenthood if elected. He added that his running mate would be pro-life and \u201cconservative to the core\u201d if he gets the GOP nomination. Romney also accused Obama of following a \u201csecular agenda\u201d and said a Romney administration would promote religious freedom. \u201cYou expect the president of the United States to be sensitive to that freedom and protect it and unfortunately, perhaps because of the people the president hangs around with, and their agenda, their secular agenda, they have fought against religion,\u201d Romney said. In a rare reference to his Mormon faith, Romney continued by saying: \u201cI can assure you, as someone who has understood very personally the significance of religious tolerance and religious freedom and the right to one\u2019s own conscience, I will make sure that we never again attack religious liberty in the United States of America.\u201d Romney also took a shot at Santorum, responding to a question from the crowd by saying the former Pennsylvania senator had yet to undergo the rigorous scrutiny that comes with being a front-running candidate. \u201cRick Santorum voted to raise the debt ceiling five times without getting compensating reductions in spending,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThe fact that he continues to defend earmarks, including his $500,000 earmark to the Pittsburgh zoo for a polar bear exhibit \u2013 I don\u2019t think that is consistent with the principles of conservatism. I don\u2019t think Rick Santorum\u2019s track record is that of a fiscal conservative.\u201d Paul\u2019s campaign also questioned Santorum\u2019s record as fiscal conservative in a new television commercial in Michigan. \u201cIs this dude serious? Fiscal conservative? Really?\u201d asks the narrator in the ad. \u201cSantorum voted to raise the debt ceiling five times, doubled the size of the Department of Education, then supported the biggest entitlement expansion since the 1960s. Not groovy. Santorum voted to send billions of our tax dollars to dictators in North Korea and Egypt, and even hooked Planned Parenthood up with a few million bucks. Rick Santorum a fiscal conservative? Fake.\u201d The Santorum campaign was quick to respond, with national communications director Hogan Gidley telling CNN that \u201cfor all of Ron Paul\u2019s blustering about conservatism, the bottom line is that he\u2019s been in Congress for decades and has not had a single accomplishment to forward the cause of conservatism. Not one.\u201d Santorum later told a Maricopa County GOP lunch that \u201cI voted for smaller government, lower taxes, less regulation \u2013 the things that we need desperately in this country.\u201d \u201cYou see all these commercials  \u2013 Rick Santorum is a big spender \u2013 but they never once mention, talk about how I voted for any increase in the appropriation bills. Why? Because I never did,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cI voted to cut appropriation bills. They never talk about I voted for a tax increase why? because I never did in 16 years of public life.\u201d The heightened rhetoric reflected mounting stakes in the campaign to choose a Republican nominee to face Obama. Gallup\u2019s daily tracking poll Monday showed Santorum leading Romney 36% to 26% among Republicans nationwide. The new numbers represented a six-point drop for Romney since last week, when the former Massachusetts governor was statistically tied with Santorum, who rose by five points in the same period. Gingrich, a former House speaker, has seen his poll numbers decline over the past month since his only primary win in South Carolina on January 21. According to Gallup, Gingrich came in third place in Monday\u2019s poll with 13%, and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas was close behind at 11%. Arizona debate matters for GOP final four Romney\u2019s once presumptive march to the nomination has come into question since Santorum swept contests in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri on February 7. For Romney, the question is why he can\u2019t increase his always solid but never dominating support as the primary campaign moves across the country. Romney\u2019s campaign said Monday it raised $6.5 million in January, while Federal Election Commission findings showed it significantly depleted resources by burning through $18.7 million during the month. According to the documents, Romney finished January with $7.7 million on hand and no debt after starting the month with $19.9 million on hand. Gingrich finished January with almost $1.8 million cash on hand and owing nearly as much in debt, his campaign disclosed Monday. He raised nearly $5.6 million during the month, according to financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. Santorum\u2019s campaign brought in $4.5 million in January, more than the candidate spent over the course of a month that saw his poll numbers rise and his national profile expand. According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the former Pennsylvania senator spent $3.3 million in January, and ended the month with nearly $1.5 million cash on hand. Paul raised about the same amount as Santorum and has $1.6 million cash, according to his campaign and filing documents.

NEW: Romney spent more than $18 million in January Newt Gingrich questions President Obama's ability to defend the nation Rick Santorum attacks Obama for rising gas prices GOP candidates are preparing for a CNN debate Wednesday in Arizona Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich ratcheted up their attacks against President Barack Obama on Monday as they competed for conservative votes ahead of primaries and caucuses in the Republican presidential race. Campaigning in the perennial swing state of Ohio, Santorum said the president\u2019s \u201cradical environmentalist policies\u201d are helping push gas prices to near record highs and are threatening to derail the economic recovery. He cited Obama\u2019s disapproval of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in the United States and what he characterized as the president\u2019s mismanagement of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East as the cause of \u201ctension\u201d reflected in rising oil prices. Noting his grandfather once worked in Pennsylvania\u2019s coal mines, Santorum also said the White House placed misguided environmental concerns above real economic need. Santorum: Environment is political Santorum: Religious liberty is at stake Gingrich rep: Voters don't want Romney Paul: U.S. could slip into fascism There\u2019s a \u201clack of real scientific evidence\u201d about global warming, he declared. \u201cPhony studies\u201d on the subject are not \u201cnot climate science but political science.\u201d Gingrich, meanwhile, told a Tulsa, Oklahoma, event that Obama was \u201cincapable of defending the United States\u201d and therefore defeating him in the November election was a \u201cduty of national security.\u201d \u201cThe president wants to unilaterally weaken the United States, he wants to cut the aid to Israel for its anti-ballistic missile defense, he refuses to take Iran seriously,\u201d Gingrich said. The heightened rhetoric reflected mounting stakes in the campaign to choose a Republican nominee to face Obama. Santorum\u2019s emphasis on hot-button social and economic issues comes amid a recent surge in GOP support for the former Pennsylvania senator, who now leads Mitt Romney in a number of national primary polls. Gallup\u2019s daily tracking poll Monday showed Santorum leading Romney 36% to 26% among Republicans nationwide. The new numbers represented a six-point drop for Romney since last week, when the former Massachusetts governor was statistically tied with Santorum, who rose by five points in the same period. Gingrich, a former House speaker, has seen his poll numbers decline over the past month since his only primary win in South Carolina on January 21. According to Gallup, Gingrich came in third place in Monday\u2019s poll with 13%, and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas was close behind at 11%. The four Republicans, struggling for advantage in what has so far proved an unpredictable nomination fight, are set to meet Wednesday evening in an Arizona debate moderated by CNN\u2019s John King. It will be the last debate before Arizona and Michigan primary voters head to the polls February 28, launching a series of contests including the Super Tuesday showdown in 10 states worth 437 delegates for the nomination. Arizona debate matters for GOP final four Romney\u2019s once presumptive march to the nomination has come into question since Santorum swept contests in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri on February 7. For Romney, the question is why he can\u2019t increase his always solid but never dominating support as the primary campaign moves across the country. Romney\u2019s campaign said Monday it raised $6.5 million in January, while Federal Election Commission findings showed it significantly depleted resources by burning through $18.7 million during the month. According to the documents, Romney finished January with $7.7 million on hand and no debt after starting the month with $19.9 million on hand. While next week\u2019s contests in Arizona and Michigan have a similar number of delegates at stake with 29 and 30 respectively, most of the attention has been focused on Michigan, a virtual home state for Romney, whose father, George, was once governor there. Some analysts believe a Romney loss in the state will shatter any remaining consensus that the former Massachusetts governor is the GOP front-runner. For his part, Gingrich conceded Sunday that losing his home state of Georgia in the March 6 Super Tuesday primaries would \u201cbadly\u201d weaken his candidacy. Appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Gingrich argued that if either of his chief rivals lose their home states \u2013 Romney in Michigan and Santorum in Pennsylvania \u2013 they also would be \u201cbadly, badly weakened.\u201d But the former speaker stopped short of saying he would drop out if he fails to win Georgia. \u201cGiven the chaos of this race, I\u2019m not willing to say anything,\u201d Gingrich said, adding: \u201cI think it\u2019s extraordinarily important to win your home state.\u201d Gingrich finished January with almost $1.8 million cash on hand and owing nearly as much in debt, his campaign disclosed Monday. He raised nearly $5.6 million during the month, according to financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. Perhaps emboldened by his increased support, Santorum has launched a series of harsh attacks against Obama and Romney in recent days. Santorum depicts himself to voters as the only legitimate conservative alternative to the more moderate Romney, and on Monday, he criticized Romney\u2019s campaign track record of attack ads on leading rivals. Stumping for votes in Steubenville, Ohio, Santorum said Americans want a candidate who \u201cdoesn\u2019t think politics is the equivalent of mud wrestling.\u201d Politics, Santorum said, should be \u201ca higher calling.\u201d He drew the ire of the president\u2019s campaign Sunday by declaring the government should never require health care providers to cover fully the cost of prenatal testing such as amniocentesis, which can determine the possibility of Down syndrome or other problems in the fetus. In particular, amniocentesis \u201cmore often than not\u201d results in abortion, said Santorum, who is vehemently anti-abortion, on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cPeople have a right to do it, but to have the government force people to provide it free just is a bit loaded,\u201d Santorum said in arguing against what he called a mandate in the health care reform legislation passed by Obama and Democrats in 2010. Santorum blasts prenatal testing Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for Obama\u2019s campaign, called Santorum\u2019s remarks \u201cthe latest in a long string of unfortunate comments in the race to the bottom that the Republican presidential primary has become.\u201d \u201cPrenatal screenings are essential to promote the health of both the mother and baby and to ensure safe deliveries,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThese misinformed and dangerous comments reinforce why women cannot trust any of the Republican candidates for president.\u201d On Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, Santorum appeared to raise questions about Obama\u2019s adherence to Bible-based Christian theology in comments that Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs said went \u201cwell over the line.\u201d Santorum said then that the president was adhering to \u201csome phony ideal, some phony theology,\u201d which he described as \u201cnot a theology based on the Bible, a different theology. But no less a theology.\u201d Later asked by reporters about the remark, Santorum said he was trying to say Obama merely holds \u201cdifferent moral values.\u201d Obama has reached a \u201clow in this country\u2019s history of oppressing religious freedom that we have never seen before,\u201d Santorum added. Gibbs, appearing Sunday on the ABC program \u201cThis Week,\u201d said Santorum\u2019s comments continued the kind of character attacks that he noted have marked the Republican presidential race so far. \u201cI think that if you make comments like that, you make comments that are well over the line,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cI think this GOP primary, in many cases \u2026 has been a race to the bottom. We have seen nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness, distortions of opponents\u2019 records, of the president\u2019s records.\u201d CNN\u2019s Shawna Shepherd and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Obama's campaign calls Santorum's comments \"misinformed and dangerous\" Former senator says prenatal testing such as amniocentesis increases abortions The government should not mandate health care coverage of such tests, Santorum says Republican's comments continue a series of harsh attacks on president The government shouldn\u2019t make health care providers fully cover prenatal tests like amniocentesis, which can determine the possibility of Down syndrome or other fetal problems, Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum said Sunday. Santorum, an outspoken opponent of abortion rights, told the CBS News program \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that amniocentesis \u201cmore often than not\u201d results in abortion. \u201cPeople have the right to do it, but to have the government force people to provide it free, to me, is a bit loaded,\u201d he said. The former Pennsylvania senator was arguing against what he called a mandate in the health care legislation passed by President Barack Obama and Democrats in 2010. He said Saturday at an appearance in Ohio that the law was intended to increase abortions and reduce overall health care costs. How Santorum lead could change race Sound of Sunday with Candy Crowley Santorum's 'Gotcha' complaints No support for Santorum in Senate? \u201cOne of the mandates is they require free prenatal testing in every insurance policy in America,\u201d Santorum, a conservative Roman Catholic, told a Christian Alliance luncheon in Columbus. \u201cWhy? Because it saves money in health care. Why? Because free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done, because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society.\u201d He added that the requirement was \u201canother hidden message as to what President Obama thinks of those who are less able.\u201d The White House referred CNN to Obama\u2019s re-election campaign for comment, and campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith called Santorum\u2019s remarks \u201cthe latest in a long string of unfortunate comments in the race to the bottom that the Republican presidential primary has become.\u201d \u201cPrenatal screenings are essential to promote the health of both the mother and baby and to ensure safe deliveries,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThese misinformed and dangerous comments reinforce why women cannot trust any of the Republican candidates for president.\u201d On Sunday, Santorum mentioned his own experience with this 3-year-old daughter Isabella, who has Trisomy 18, a chromosome disorder that often results in stillbirths or early childhood death. He said prenatal testing showed the problem, and doctors recommend abortion in virtually all cases. Such a recommendation is common when any problem is detected through amniocentesis, said Santorum, who added that in such cases \u201cwe know that 90% of Down syndrome children are aborted.\u201d Some studies since the late 1990s do suggest a high percentage of women terminate their pregnancies after receiving a Down syndrome diagnosis, with one British study putting the figure as high as 92 percent. A 2005 study of nearly 1,100 pregnant women found 76% would consider an abortion if tests indicated their child would be born with Down syndrome. Now considered the main conservative challenger to the more moderate Mitt Romney, Santorum has shed a more understated demeanor to challenge both Romney and Obama as the Republican campaign heads toward a series of key primaries in coming weeks, including Super Tuesday on March 6. He continued throwing out the cultural red meat for primary voters Sunday night, telling a rally at a Georgia church that Obama was intent on starting a cultural war. As the audience roared with applause, he called on the country to build a foundation that will \u201cdefend the church, defend the family, defend the nonprofit community, defend them from a government that wants to weaken them.\u201d His attack on insurance coverage for prenatal testing was the latest in a series of controversial comments he has made since surging to the top tier of polls in the Republican presidential race. He also found himself defending other Saturday comments regarding Obama\u2019s religion, appearing to question the president\u2019s adherence to Bible-based Christian theology. Santorum said Saturday the president was not motivated by concerns for ordinary Americans but by \u201csome phony ideal, some phony theology. \u201cOh, not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology. But no less a theology,\u201d he said. Asked about those remarks on CBS, Santorum said he was referring to Obama\u2019s energy policies, which he said favored what he called radical environmentalism. Asked specifically if he was questioning Obama\u2019s Christian beliefs, Santorum said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting the president is not a Christian. I accept the fact the president is a Christian.\u201d Instead, he said he was taking on what he called \u201can attempt to centralize power in the government.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m talking about the belief that man should be in charge of the Earth,\u201d Santorum said, and then in specific reference to Obama: \u201cI am talking about his worldview and the way he approaches problems in this country.\u201d But former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Sunday that Santorum\u2019s comments continued the kind of character attacks he said were typical of the GOP presidential race. \u201cI think that if you make comments like that, you make comments that are well over the line,\u201d Gibbs told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI think this GOP primary, in many cases \u2026. has been a race to the bottom.  We have seen nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness, distortions of opponents\u2019 records, of the president\u2019s records,\u201d he said. The negative tone of the campaign was hurting the Republican candidates and causing low turnout numbers in some of the primaries so far, Gibbs added. \u201cIt\u2019s just time to get rid of this mindset in our politics that, if we disagree, we have to question character and faith,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cThose days have long passed in our politics. Our problems and our challenges are far too great.\u201d The issues raised by Santorum follow another religious-themed controversy over the Obama administration\u2019s decision to require church-affiliated hospitals and other institutions to provide employees with health care coverage for contraception. Catholic bishops vehemently opposed the move, and the administration changed its rule to require health care insurers to provide free coverage for contraception rather than the churches or other religious-based institutions. Santorum\u2019s comments may appeal to some Republican voters who have questioned Obama\u2019s faith before, or others who saw the administration\u2019s recent contraception mandate as an overreach. Last month, Santorum was criticized by some for not correcting a voter who called the president a Muslim when she stood up to ask a question at one of his campaign town halls. On Sunday, Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, who flirted with a presidential bid last year, told the CNN program \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the contraception issue could benefit Republicans if properly approached. \u201cThese are the questions that I think Republicans can unite on,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cThey do have to be framed, as they really are, as the defense of individual freedom against the right now limitless power of the state.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Welch, Athena Jones, Ashley Killough and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

Appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Gingrich added that if either of his chief rivals for the Republican presidential nomination lose their home states \u2013 Mitt Romney in Michigan and Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania \u2013 they also would be \u201cbadly, badly weakened.\u201d However, Gingrich stopped short of saying he would drop out if he fails to win Georgia on March 6. \u201cGiven the chaos of this race, I\u2019m not willing to say anything,\u201d Gingrich commented, adding: \u201cI think it\u2019s extraordinarily important to win your home state.\u201d Romney faces the first test, with Michigan\u2019s primary on February 28. The Pennsylvania primary is on April 24. The dynamic of the Republican race has continually shifted, with Romney\u2019s position at or near the top the only consistent factor. However, the former Massachusetts governor has been unable to broaden his support through the early primaries, while Santorum has surged in recent weeks to supplant Gingrich as Romney\u2019s main conservative challenger. The latest results from Gallup\u2019s daily tracking poll showed Santorum now leads Romney among registered Republicans nationwide. Gingrich's Southern Strategy Sound of Sunday with Candy Crowley Paul: Santorum is a pretend conservative Pressing Romney on religion According to the poll released Sunday, 36% of respondents backed Santorum while 28% preferred Romney. The new numbers represented a five-point drop for Romney since Wednesday, when the former Massachusetts governor was statistically tied with Santorum, who increased by five points in the same period. Gingrich, meanwhile, has seen his poll numbers decline over the past month since his only primary win in South Carolina on January 21. According to Gallup, Gingrich came in third place in Sunday\u2019s poll with 13%, with Texas Rep. Ron Paul closely behind at 11%. Perhaps emboldened by his increased support, Santorum has launched a series of harsh attacks on President Barack Obama in recent days. He drew the ire of Obama\u2019s campaign Sunday by declaring the government should never require health care providers to fully cover the cost of prenatal testing such as amniocentesis, which can determine the possibility of Down syndrome or other problems in the fetus. In particular, amniocentesis \u201cmore often than not\u201d results in abortion, said Santorum, a strident anti-abortion politician, on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cPeople have a right to do it, but to have the government force people to provide it free just is a bit loaded,\u201d Santorum said in arguing against what he called a mandate in the health care reform bill passed by Obama and Democrats in 2010. Santorum was responding to questions about comments he made the day before at a Christian Alliance luncheon in Columbus, Ohio, in which he said the mandate in the health care law was intended to increase abortions and reduce overall health care costs. Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for Obama\u2019s campaign, called Santorum\u2019s remarks \u201cthe latest in a long string of unfortunate comments in the race to the bottom that the Republican presidential primary has become.\u201d \u201cPrenatal screenings are essential to promote the health of both the mother and baby and to ensure safe deliveries,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThese misinformed and dangerous comments reinforce why women cannot trust any of the Republican candidates for president.\u201d Also Saturday in Columbus, Santorum appeared to raise questions about Obama\u2019s adherence to Bible-based Christian theology in comments that Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs said went \u201cwell over the line.\u201d Santorum said Saturday the president was adhering to \u201csome phony ideal, some phony theology,\u201d which he described as \u201cnot a theology based on the Bible, a different theology. But no less a theology.\u201d Later asked by reporters about the remark, Santorum said he was trying to say Obama merely holds \u201cdifferent moral values.\u201d Obama has reached a \u201clow in this country\u2019s history of oppressing religious freedom that we have never seen before,\u201d Santorum added. Gibbs, appearing Sunday on the ABC program \u201cThis Week,\u201d said Santorum\u2019s comment continued the kind of character attacks that he noted have characterized the Republican presidential race so far. \u201cI think that if you make comments like that, you make comments that are well over the line,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cI think this GOP primary, in many cases \u2026. has been a race to the bottom. We have seen nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness, distortions of opponents\u2019 records, of the president\u2019s records.\u201d The negative tone of the campaign was hurting the Republican candidates and causing low turnout numbers in some of the primaries so far, Gibbs added. \u201cIt\u2019s just time to get rid of this mindset in our politics that, if we disagree, we have to question character and faith,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cThose days have long passed in our politics. Our problems and our challenges are far too great.\u201d Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who lost to Obama in the 2008 presidential election, agreed that persistent infighting among Republicans was hurting the party\u2019s cause and image. \u201cI\u2019ve been in very tough campaigns.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen one that was as personal and as characterized by so many attacks as these are,\u201d McCain said on the ABC program \u201cThis Week.\u201d He blamed the influence of super PACs that can spend unlimited amounts on campaign ads, adding: \u201cI do not believe I\u2019ve ever seen campaigns characterized overwhelming(ly) by negative attacks.\u201d Santorum\u2019s comments may appeal to some Republican voters who have questioned Obama\u2019s faith before, or others who saw the administration\u2019s recent contraception mandate as an overreach. Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland told the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Santorum and other Republicans were seeking to shift the political debate to social issues because the latest reports showed Obama\u2019s economic policies were helping the nation recover from recession. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing here is that as the economy is improving and more and more people are going back to work, and it\u2019s clear that the president\u2019s policies on the economy are working, you find Republicans going back to the old red meat social issues that helps rile up their base,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cThat\u2019s what is going on.\u201d On the same program, Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said the issue was Obama\u2019s attempt to expand government powers beyond what was intended by the Constitution on issues such as the health care reform law of 2010. \u201cIf the president is willing to trample on our constitutional rights in a difficult election year, imagine what he will do in implementing the rest of this law after he doesn\u2019t have to face the voters again if he gets re-elected?\u201d Ryan said. Meanwhile, Paul took aim at Santorum on Sunday by questioning his conservative credentials and doubting if the former Pennsylvania senator could beat Obama in November if he wins the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cHis voting record is, I think from my viewpoint, an atrocious voting record \u2013 how liberal he\u2019s been in all the things he\u2019s voted for over the many years he was in the Senate and in the House,\u201d Paul said of Santorum on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Paul has previously attacked Santorum for voting for raising the debt ceiling five times as a senator, as well as the infamous \u201cBridge to Nowhere\u201d in Alaska that was considered unnecessary government spending. While Paul has yet to win any state contests, unlike the other three GOP presidential contenders, he reiterated he was still in the race for the long haul, anticipating a run that could extend to the Republican National Convention. Gingrich, who is under pressure from the political right to drop out to consolidate conservative support behind Santorum, told reporters Sunday he also expects a long campaign. \u201cI tell people it\u2019s like the NCAA Final Four with no elimination,\u201d Gingrich said in reference to the annual college basketball tournament known as March Madness, adding: \u201cYou could imagine all of us going all the way to the convention.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Athena Jones and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Rick Santorum served 12 years in Senate, 4 years in House Three House members have endorsed him, no sitting Senators have Santorum aides say he hasn't done much lobbying of former colleagues There is a Senate tradition dating back to 1965. One specific desk in the Senate chamber has a drawer filled with candy. The senator assigned to that desk is responsible for keeping candy in it and providing sweets to all his or her colleagues. Rick Santorum had the desk with the candy drawer, yet all that sugar didn\u2019t win him any endorsements for his presidential bid from former Senate colleagues. Santorum was in the Senate for 12 years. He served in the House for four years before that. Yet only three House members have endorsed him, and he has no endorsements from any sitting senators. Mitt Romney, who never served in Congress, has racked up 77 congressional endorsements, including 12 senators. Ask Santorum\u2019s former Senate colleagues about his bid for president and many refuse to comment. \u201cThat\u2019s not the purpose of the news conference,\u201d responded Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who served with Santorum in the Senate and the House. At another news conference, Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, simply said he came out early for Romney. \u201cI think he\u2019s in the best position to win the election,\u201d Thune said of Romney. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, was one rank below Santorum in the GOP leadership. She declined to step forward to the microphone to talk about Santorum. When asked by CNN if she could say anything good about him, Hutchison cautiously replied, \u201cCertainly he\u2019s a very nice person, but I\u2019m not going to do presidential politics right now.\u201d So, why the lack of support for the former senator? Most observers point to questions about Santorum\u2019s electability. Multiple GOP Senate sources tell CNN many who were in the Senate trenches with Santorum like him personally, but don\u2019t think he can win the presidency. They recall fiery speeches on the Senate floor about social issues from abortion to same-sex marriage. \u201cSociety should be all about creating the best possible chance for children to have a mother and a father,\u201d Santorum said on the Senate floor in 2004. \u201cUnless our laws enforce that, then I think it\u2019s fairly obvious that our culture will not,\u201d he said. One veteran GOP leadership aide called him a culture warrior likely to turn off moderate voters. \u201cThe fear of Santorum is that it would just be a slow decay. There is no faith that he would bring independent or moderate voters. If he does well on Super Tuesday you\u2019ll have serious people talking about convention strategies,\u201d said the Senate GOP leadership aide. When former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was on the rise, many of his former colleagues were openly nervous, calling into question his leadership ability. The same GOP leadership aide said with Santorum, it\u2019s a \u201cquieter freak out. It\u2019s a freak out, just it\u2019s muted.\u201d Another GOP leadership aide agreed, saying people \u201cwould be pretty nervous\u201d if Santorum does well in big contests March 6, Super Tuesday. Republican Senate sources tell CNN that colleagues often privately point to Santorum\u2019s crushing 18-point loss in his 2006 re-election bid. But Pennsylvania Rep. Glenn \u201cGT\u201d Thompson dismissed all that. He\u2019s one of the three House members to endorse Santorum. \u201cWe learn from these experiences, and I think that probably that experience in 2006 prepared Rick to be a better public servant. You learn as many lessons from elections that you\u2019ve lost \u2013 in fact I think you learn more from that than what you do when you win,\u201d Thompson said. Thompson noted that Abraham Lincoln was  \u201csoundly defeated\u201d in elections before he was president. As to the Republican concern that Santorum is too polarizing on social issues to win over moderates and independents, Thompson said that\u2019s overblown. \u201cHe recognizes what the No. 1 task and hurdle facing this country (is) and it\u2019s jobs, and I like the fact that he talks about manufacturing, and small businesses in particular, as the backbone of this country economically,\u201d said Thompson, who also noted that there hasn\u2019t been a president from Pennsylvania since James Buchanan at the beginning of the Civil War. Thompson said Santorum personally called him early on in his campaign for president and asked for his endorsement. Drew Cantor, a former Santorum Senate aide, brushed aside talk that Santorum is too polarizing a figure on social issues to bring moderates and independents into the fold. Cantor said when Santorum was chairman of the Republican Conference, the No. 3 position in the Senate GOP leadership, he \u201cunderstood the role of conference chair was promoting relationships and unity in the conference. He played that role effectively.\u201d Santorum campaign aides said he hasn\u2019t done much lobbying of former colleagues, and said that may be one reason he hasn\u2019t gotten any endorsements yet from his former stomping grounds in the Senate. Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, who endorsed Romney early on, said he never got a call from Santorum, despite the fact  the two of them are personal friends, and often played tennis together. When asked if he thinks Santorum would make a good president, Cochran chuckled nervously and said, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Cochran then said he just thinks Romney is \u201cideally suited for a very challenging job.\u201d Other Republican senators who have not endorsed any GOP candidate are quick to say nice things about Santorum. \u201cHe\u2019s knowledgeable, and conservative,\u201d said James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma. Inhofe had endorsed Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who dropped out of the race last month. His home state of Oklahoma has a contest coming up, and is a place Santorum aides said he is competing in aggressively. Why won\u2019t Inhofe endorse Santorum? \u201cThat\u2019s my judgment,\u201d Inhofe replied. Other Senators simply want to stay out of the endorsing business. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, said he won\u2019t back any of the GOP candidates because they\u2019re all his friends. Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions said, \u201cI love Rick Santorum. I think he\u2019d be a great president.\u201d So, why won\u2019t he endorse Santorum? \u201cI haven\u2019t endorsed anybody,\u201d said Sessions. While Santorum aides said they welcome support anywhere they can get it, they also downplay the importance of high profile endorsements. After all, Mitt Romney\u2019s point person in the Senate is Roy Blunt, Republican from Missouri. Last month, Romney lost that state to Santorum, and lost it big.

            "article_content": "Conservatives still have questions about Romney's core convictions Losses to Santorum on Tuesday exposed conservatives' suspicions Romney had been able to avoid questions as he focused on Obama instead of GOP rivals \"Severely conservative\" line in CPAC speech left some scratching their heads Mitt Romney\u2019s twin victories Saturday in Maine and in a conservative straw poll were badly needed bright spots for his campaign at the end of what was perhaps the most humbling week of his presidential candidacy, a five-day stretch that exposed the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s frail relationship with conservatives. One day after dubbing himself a \u201cseverely conservative Republican\u201d in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, Romney won a presidential straw poll of conference-goers with 38% of the vote to Rick Santorum\u2019s 31%. Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul trailed in the distance. Just hours later, Romney narrowly defeated Paul to win the Maine caucuses, a nonbinding contest in which fewer than 6,000 voters participated. Romney narrowly wins Maine caucuses But if the talk the among conservative activists at CPAC was any indication of what\u2019s to come as the Republican race moves into a national phase, Romney\u2019s wins Saturday may do little to halt lingering questions about his core convictions or bridge the deepening rift between the party\u2019s insurgent and establishment factions. Santorum supporters were nearly apoplectic in the moments after the CPAC straw poll results were announced, accusing Romney of lying about his conservative record in the conference\u2019s main ballroom just 24 hours earlier. Santorum: I don't rig straw polls Paul: Romney lacks enthusiastic support Romney avoided 'major embarrassment' \u201cYou repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth,\u201d said Justin Wight, a political consultant based in Asheville, North Carolina. \u201cThat is the Mitt Romney campaign for president of the United States right there.\u201d Judd Saul, a tea party activist and Santorum backer who traveled to CPAC from Cedar Falls, Iowa, said the Republican establishment\u2019s fixation on Romney\u2019s electability against President Barack Obama is leading the party to an all-but-certain loss in November. \u201cIt is a lie that none of the other candidates are electable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a flat lie. You know who gets to decide who is electable? The people decide. Not the media, not the pundits.\u201d GOP battle lines hardening Never mind that the straw poll data showed that a candidate\u2019s position on the issues was more important to CPAC voters than his chances of defeating Obama \u2013 the battle lines in the Republican presidential race are hardening. Romney\u2019s losses to Santorum in Minnesota, Missouri and Colorado last Tuesday were nonbinding. But the three states were laboratories of GOP sentiment largely untouched by the blizzard of television and radio ads that swamped airwaves in previous nominating states \u2013 and Romney was firmly rejected by the conservative base in all three. His stumbles provided Santorum and Gingrich a rationale to forge ahead to the next contests and embrace the hard-line grass-roots fury that has been roiling the GOP since 2009. Santorum entered CPAC after several days campaigning in Texas, where he drew some of the largest crowds of his campaign. \u201cAs conservatives and tea party folks, we are not just wings of the Republican Party,\u201d Santorum declared at CPAC, hours before Romney was set to speak. \u201cWe are the Republican Party.\u201d For most of the Republican race, Romney steered clear of fiery talk and cautiously tried to convey an aura of inevitability, keeping the Republican base at arm\u2019s length while focusing his economy-themed attacks on the president. For months, it worked. Gergen: CPAC win a 'psychological boost' Mitt Romney: Severe conservative? Mitt Romney's record as a conservative In debates and campaign events throughout 2011 and in the early days of this year, Romney\u2019s past support for abortion rights and a health insurance mandate in Massachusetts largely escaped attention as the rest of the GOP candidates dueled with each other. When Romney did come under fire, most directly in South Carolina from Gingrich, the central line of attack focused on his personal wealth and tax returns \u2013 not his evolving positions on core conservative issues. Tuesday losses expose suspicions But the suspicions that conservative activists have long harbored toward Romney burst into full view after his losses last Tuesday. Santorum wins shake up GOP race And so the hobbled front-runner came into CPAC grappling with questions about his ideological purity \u2013 the very questions that dogged him in 2008, and the ones he sought to avoid this election cycle when he and his team made the calculation not to compete aggressively in socially conservative states like Iowa and South Carolina. The day before his address, Romney quietly organized a private session with conservative leaders in a Marriott hotel suite to make them \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d about his bid and solicit advice about his message, according to one participant in the meeting. Then came his speech, a sharp pivot to the right that made clear his campaign is girding for a tougher-than-expected nomination fight, even if it means employing partisan rhetoric that risks turning off the independent voters who will be so crucial in the general election. Romney said that as Massachusetts governor, he fiercely opposed same-sex marriage, fought for abstinence education in public schools, and vetoed a bill that would have made it easier for young women to obtain abortions. \u201cI know conservatism because I have lived conservatism,\u201d Romney said. The speech, specifically Romney\u2019s claim to be a \u201cseverely conservative Republican,\u201d left some outspoken voices on the right confused. Romney defends \u2018severely conservative\u2019 credentials Romney unashamed of business background Romney: Obama poster child of arrogance Santorum 'interrupts' Romney's march \u201cI wasn\u2019t quite sure what the word \u2018severely\u2019 meant,\u201d said former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who said in an interview with CNN and The New York Times that Romney needs to improve his relationship with tea party activists. Palin says Romney has to work harder for conservative vote Radio host Rush Limbaugh called the line a \u201cpander.\u201d \u201cI have never heard anybody say, \u2018I\u2019m severely conservative,\u2019\u201d Limbaugh said on his show. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anybody say it.\u201d Legendary conservative activist Richard Viguerie released a harshly worded statement on Saturday casting doubt on Romney\u2019s sincerity. \u201cIn my 50 years in conservative politics at the national level, I have never heard anyone other than Governor Romney describe himself as \u2018severely\u2019 conservative,\u201d Viguerie said. \u201cRomney has shown, once again, that he can mouth the words conservatives use, but he has no gut-level emotional connection with the conservative movement and its ideas and policies.\u201d Romney is now fighting a war on two fronts: one against the conservatives who appear increasingly hostile to his candidacy, and the other against the Obama campaign, which continues to view Romney as the candidate it would least like to face this fall. Though Romney\u2019s complicated week ended on a high note in snowy Maine, the Obama campaign seemed pleased that its expected opponent is tacking to the right at a moment when he would clearly prefer to be gearing up for the general election. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Romney has rushed to check off every box on the tea party\u2019s litmus test,\u201d said Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt. \u201cBut the same lack of trust Romney is facing from many conservatives would be amplified in a general election across the ideological spectrum, because he has taken both sides of so many key issues and said anything to please whatever political audience he is courting,\u201d he added.",

            "article_content": "Former Massachusetts Gov. Romney gets 38% of the vote in straw poll Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum finishes second at 7 points behind Straw poll caps three-day conference of conservative leaders and activists GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney won the close-watched Conservative Political Action Conference presidential straw poll on Saturday. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, took 38% of the vote in the poll. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum received 31%, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was at 15% and Texas Rep. Ron Paul stood at 12%. When asked about their preference for vice president, 34% of the attendees at the conservative conference chose Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Romney\u2019s win took some of the sting out of a bad week for the former governor, who saw the momentum he had gained with back-to-back wins in Florida and Nevada slowed by going 0-for-3 on Tuesday in contests in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri. Conservatives have had lingering doubts about the depth of Romney\u2019s conservative convictions, which has kept him from being able to run away with the nomination. \u201cHonored to have won the CPAC straw poll,\u201d Romney tweeted after the results were announced. \u201cI\u2019m heartened that so many friends here agree with me about the need for conservative change.\u201d In an address to the conference on Friday, Romney tried to convince the conservative leaders and activists gathered that he was one of them, describing himself as a \u201cseverely conservative\u201d governor of Massachusetts who stood with conservatives in the fight against same-sex marriage and abortion. He framed his conservatism with his stable family and his private sector experience and defended his business record \u2013 for which Gingrich and Santorum have attacked him. Those attacks have made some Republicans uncomfortable. \u201cI started new businesses and turned around broken ones, and I am not ashamed to say that I was very successful at it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know conservatism because I have lived conservatism.\u201d He took broad swipes at President Obama and a single, subtler one at his two closest challengers, Santorum and Gingrich, portraying himself as a Washington outsider compared to Gingrich, the former House speaker who resigned his post, and Santorum, whom Romney has hammered over his record on earmarks during his time in Washington. \u201cI am the only candidate in this race, Republican or Democrat, who has never worked a day in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have old scores to settle or decades of cloakroom deals to defend.\u201d Winning the straw poll would have capped a stunning turnaround for Santorum with his earlier three-state sweep. His campaign reported that it had raised $1 million a day in the three days following his sweep. Santorum used most of his address Friday to attack Obama but also took an opportunity to tie the front-runner to the president, calling Romney\u2019s health care program in Massachusetts the \u201cstepchild\u201d of Obama\u2019s sweeping health care reform. But the straw poll also gives Santorum an argument that he is the stronger conservative challenger to Romney than Gingrich. Gingrich had surged to challenge Romney near the end of last year and stunned him by winning South Carolina\u2019s primary, which has been won by every one of the party\u2019s eventual presidential nominees since 1980. But Romney successfully counter-punched, with his campaign and super PACs that support his candidacy pouring millions of dollars into attack ads that blunted Gingrich\u2019s growing momentum. Gingrich used his CPAC speech to portray himself as the heir to Barry Goldwater\u2019s and Ronald Reagan\u2019s conservative movement, slamming a GOP establishment that lacks the \u201ctoughness,\u201d \u201ccommitment,\u201d and \u201cphilosophy\u201d necessary to build a political majority. \u201cThis is the year to reset the country in a decisive, bold way,\u201d Gingrich declared. \u201cThis is going to be a big choice, big decision election.\u201d Paul, the fourth major Republican candidate, was invited but opted to stay on the campaign trail in Maine, which announces the results of its caucuses later Saturday.

            "article_content": "NEW: South Carolina Sen. DeMint says he'll back any Republican nominee Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry push back at critics of their attacks against Mitt Romney South Carolina's January 21 primary is widely seen as a critical contest Looking ahead, Romney campaigns in Florida on Thursday GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney on Thursday aggressively defended his tenure as head of Bain Capital, asserting again that his private-equity career resulted in the net creation of over 100,000 jobs while also calling any job losses an unfortunate fact of life in the private sector. Under criticism from some Republican foes \u2013 as well as Democrats \u2013 for his role in corporate downsizing in the past, Romney confronted the issue while campaigning in South Carolina, site of the next primary contest on January 21, and Florida, which holds its key primary 10 days later. Romney seeks to parlay momentum from his victories in the first two states of the nominating process \u2013 Iowa last week and New Hampshire on Tuesday \u2013 into a knockout blow against his five GOP rivals by sweeping the upcoming contests in Southern states. Conservative South Carolina has picked the winner of every GOP nomination fight since 1980, and Romney hopes his early victories and standing atop the polls in the state will bolster his bid to take on President Barack Obama in the November general election. Speaking to reporters after a campaign event in the Palmetto State, Romney said that in the private sector \u201cthere are some businesses that are growing and thriving, and we were fortunate enough to be able to be a part of that in a small way.\u201d At the same time, \u201cthere are some businesses that have to be cut back in order to survive,\u201d Romney continued. \u201c\u2026 Sometimes we\u2019re successful at that, and sometimes we\u2019re not.\u201d Romney said any job loss is a \u201ctragedy,\u201d but insisted that every time Bain \u201cinvested in a business it was to try and encourage that business to have ongoing life.\u201d He later appeared at a Florida event, telling a West Palm Beach audience that he believes in a \u201cmerit nation\u201d where people achieve through education, hard work, risk-taking and \u201cmaybe a little luck.\u201d \u201cAnd by the way, as they were successful they did not make the rest of us poorer,\u201d Romney added. \u201cTheir success actually lifted the rest of us, as well.\u201d Several of Romney\u2019s GOP rivals \u2013 most notably former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Gov. Rick Perry \u2013 are trying to halt the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s victory streak by hammering him on his private sector track record. Perry, who recently castigated Romney for practicing \u201cvulture capitalism\u201d that generated wealth for a select few while gutting companies, pushed back Thursday against criticism from fellow Republicans that challenging Romney\u2019s business background amounted to opposing the free enterprise system. \u201cI love capitalism. Free market capitalism in the state of Texas has created over a million jobs,\u201d Perry said at an event in Orangeburg, South Carolina. \u201cWe understand how capitalism needs to work, but this corrupt and fraudulent activity going on in Washington, D.C., between them and Wall Street has to stop.\u201d At a Columbia, South Carolina event, Gingrich expressed amazement \u201cat the intensity of the counterattack,\u201d adding \u201cit is almost as though if you ask questions you are somehow challenging the whole system.\u201d \u201cI think when you have crony capitalism or politicians taking care of their friends, that is not free enterprise,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cThat\u2019s just back-door socialism in which the rich get all the money and the rest of us get all the debt. And I am not going to back down or be afraid to say that we the American people have the right to know and any candidate for president has an obligation to tell us.\u201d The other Republican contenders \u2013 Texas Rep. Ron Paul, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former Utah Gov. and U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman \u2013 have steered away from challenging Romney\u2019s venture capitalist experience. An outside group backing Gingrich has promised to spend $3.4 million in South Carolina television ads largely blasting Romney\u2019s business record. Strategists for the group \u2013 Winning Our Future \u2013 believe the ads will have particular resonance in a state with a reeling manufacturing sector and unemployment hovering close to 10%. GOP critics of the ads characterized them as a form of class warfare better suited for a Democratic than a Republican campaign. The president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, said Thursday that attacking Romney\u2019s tenure at Bain Capital was \u201cfoolish.\u201d \u201cWe think Romney\u2019s had a pretty good track record. Perfect? Hell, no. But damn good,\u201d said Donohue, who heads the influential business advocacy group. South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, a GOP powerbroker who has declined to endorse any of the candidate so far, defended Romney\u2019s record during an interview with MSNBC. DeMint, who endorsed Romney in his unsuccesful 2008 presidential bid, called the focus on Bain Capital a \u201cteachable moment.\u201d  He also minimized Perry\u2019s and Gingrich\u2019s chances in the race, and said that \u201cto damage a front-runner makes no sense to me.\u201d In a later interview on CNN, DeMint said he would back whoever becomes the Republican nominee, adding all had good and bad points but any of the GOP contenders would be better than \u201cwhat we have now.\u201d Three prominent DeMint loyalists \u2013 including a former top fundraiser for Perry \u2013 were planning to publicly endorse Romney Thursday, a source confirmed to CNN. One of the loyalists, former South Carolina GOP Chairman Barry Wynn, told CNN the escalating rhetoric about Romney\u2019s business background is \u201cdestructive.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a dance I didn\u2019t want to be a part of,\u201d Wynn said.  \u201cIt kind of falls into this politics of envy that the Obama campaign is going to be all about between now and November.\u201d Meanwhile, the pro-Romney group Restore Our Future announced the release of a new television ad Thursday ripping Gingrich\u2019s record.  The ad, titled \u201cDesperate,\u201d says the former speaker \u201chas more baggage than the airlines.\u201d  It focuses on Gingrich\u2019s past ties to mortgage giant Freddie Mac and his previous association with Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi, among other things. The group indicated it plans to spend $2.3 million airing the ad in South Carolina, along with $3.4 million in Florida, which holds its primary at the end of the month. In addition, a group backing former Santorum is planning to buy $600,000 in new South Carolina ad time, a source familiar with the buy confirmed to CNN Thursday.  The Red, White, and Blue Fund has already purchased $190,000 in ads touting Santorum\u2019s conservative principles. Santorum\u2019s campaign has said it intends to spend at least $1.5 million in the state. Desperate to regain momentum after a weak showing in New Hampshire following his close second-place finish in Iowa, Santorum challenged South Carolina voters to prevent Obama\u2019s re-election by choosing a true conservative like himself instead of a moderate such as Romney. \u201cIf South Carolina gets it wrong, this country may be stuck with four more years of Barack Obama,\u201d Santorum said in Bluffton. \u201c\u2026 We will be the generation that will have to explain to your children and grandchildren as to what you did, the opportunity you missed.\u201d At another event in Hilton Head, Santorum raised Romney\u2019s well-known policy shifts on major issues including abortion and health care. \u201cAren\u2019t you looking for someone as president you can trust?\u201d Santorum said. \u201cWhat would give you the idea that someone who\u2019s changed their position on nearly every single issue is a guy you can trust?\u201d Gingrich, meanwhile, has called on Romney to release his tax returns and identify major financial backers. Romney replied he has complied with all legal requirements so far, but left open the possibility of disclosing more information in the future. Romney has spent more than $3 million on his campaign so far, and a super PAC backing him has spent another $2 million. The total is almost $1 million more than the amount spent by Perry and a super PAC supporting him, the closest competitor on the list. However, other super PACs helping conservative candidates \u2013 and therefore not Romney \u2013 have spent more than $13 million so far. Fresh off his strong second-place showing in New Hampshire, Paul\u2019s campaign plans to spend about $1 million in South Carolina, said campaign manager Jesse Benton. Paul\u2019s aides admitted his organization in Iowa and New Hampshire far exceeded the campaign organization in South Carolina and beyond. They hope his third-place finish in Iowa and strong runner-up performance in New Hampshire will spur grassroots growth. Even if Romney is unstoppable as the GOP nominee, Paul and his aides made clear he intends to keep his campaign going, perhaps all the way to the convention. The more delegates he can rack up, the more leverage he would have to integrate key messages of his libertarian, anti-interventionist movement into the Republican Party platform. CNN currently estimates that Romney has won 25 GOP national convention delegates, compared to 10 for Paul, eight for Santorum, four for Perry, three for Gingrich, and two for Huntsman. 1,144 delegates are needed to win the Republican nomination. CNN\u2019s Alan Silverleib, Dana Bash, Peter Hamby, Paul Steinhauser, Robert Yoon, Tom Cohen, Shawna Shepherd and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe is an advocate for gay rights Pro athletes, however, usually don't take a strong stance on the issues Outspoken sports stars like Kluwe, Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson are rare Kluwe: \"It shouldn't be news when someone speaks out for equality\" When Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo spoke out in August in favor of a Maryland ballot initiative that would legalize gay marriage, state Delegate Emmett C. Burns Jr. wrote a letter to Ravens owner, Steve Bisciotti saying that many football fans are \u201copposed to such a view\u201d and suggesting that Bisciotti \u201cinhibit such expressions\u201d from his employee. Ayanbadejo, one of the first pro athletes to publicly support gay marriage, saw Burns\u2019 efforts to stifle him as a violation of his First Amendment rights. On September 7, Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe\u2019s penned a scathing response to Burns, stating, among other things: \u201cI can assure you that gay people getting married will have zero effect on your life. They won\u2019t come into your house and steal your children. They won\u2019t magically turn you into a lustful c**kmonster.\u201d When football, same-sex marriage and politics collide In an interview with CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow, Kluwe attributed the \u201clustful c**kmonster\u201d bit to the fact that he developed a talent for coming up with attention-grabbing message board postings after growing up playing a lot of online video games. \u201cIf you can\u2019t make a point that sticks in someone\u2019s mind,\u201d Kluwe explained, \u201cmost people probably won\u2019t really listen to you. So I developed a writing style that combined logical presentation of facts with hopefully some pretty hilarious insults.\u201d NFL LB thankful for gay marriage fight Colorful language aside, Kluwe was trying to make a serious point. He hoped that calling Burns out would spark a genuine conversation about the issues highlighted in the letter. Professional athletes, on the whole, aren\u2019t as outspoken as Kluwe when it comes to gay marriage and other hot-button issues. For the most part, they keep low profiles because they don\u2019t want to upset fans, risk endorsement deals or disappoint their coaches. Jackie Robinson, the first black man to play in the majors since the 1800s, desegregated Major League Baseball in 1947 when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers. Robinson let his talent speak for itself, playing in six World Series with the Dodgers, until his playing career was over and he became an advocate for civil rights. Recognized as a hero of the era, Robinson is the only player ever to have his jersey number \u2013 42 \u2013 retired across the board by every Major League team. In 1966, when he became eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, boxer Muhammad Ali declared himself a conscientious objector. That same year, the heavyweight champion also delivered the \u201cBlack is Best\u201d speech to 4,000 students at Howard University upon being invited to speak by the campus protest group Black Power Committee. For refusing to enlist, Ali was arrested, fined and stripped of his title, and for more than three years he could not box in any state in the U.S. In 1967, Ali was convicted of violating United States Selective Service laws by refusing to be drafted. As public opposition to the war grew, Ali delivered speeches across the country, at one point asking, \u201cWhy should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?\u201d Ali\u2019s conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1971. Pro athletes ignore backlash, show true political colors The outspoken Alis, however, were few and far between. In 1990, for example, Michael Jordan declined to endorse Democratic North Carolina Senate candidate Harvey Gantt, saying \u201cRepublicans buy shoes, too.\u201d Times have changed, and this past summer, Jordan helped President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign net $3 million at a $20,000-a-plate fundraising dinner. While the majority of professional athletes today still adopt a laissez-faire attitude toward taking a stand on controversial issues, the tide is slowly turning. Cleveland Browns linebacker Scott Fujita, a longtime advocate for NFL player safety, publicly accused Commissioner Roger Goodell this month of abusing his power by not being more vigilant about health and safety issues concerning players. \u201cHe failed to acknowledge a link between concussions (and) post-career brain disease,\u201d Fujita said in a statement, \u201cpushed for an 18-game regular season, committed to a full season of Thursday night games, has continually challenged players\u2019 rights to file workers\u2019 compensation claims for on-the-job injuries, and he employed incompetent replacement officials for the start of the 2012 season. His actions or lack thereof are, by the league\u2019s own definition, \u2018conduct detrimental.\u2019 \u201c Goodell maintained that Fujita, a former New Orleans Saints team captain, should have done more to stop players from participating in a team bounty program. That scandal involved several Saints defensive players who were discovered to have secretly managed a pool of money from which bonuses were awarded to players who injured opponents between 2009 and 2011. Goodell suspended Fujita for three games but reduced that suspension to one, acknowledging that Fujita did not participate in Bountygate. In Minnesota, as residents prepare to vote on an amendment to ban gay marriage, Kluwe remains outspoken. \u201cIt would be great if Minnesota could show America that this state treats people the right way and knows that gay people contribute just as much to society as straight people,\u201d Kluwe said. Although he himself is not a homosexual, Kluwe posed for the November cover of Out magazine. He noted that historically \u2013 though most sports figures are reluctant to do so \u2013 it has often been professional athletes who have brought about awareness of issues like gay marriage and civil rights. \u201cWhen sports gets on board with a civil issue, then that issue is rapidly resolved in the next, you know, 10, 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cSports speaks to a large segment of the population, and when kids look at athletes as role models, they say, \u2018OK, hey, these guys are saying it\u2019s OK if you\u2019re gay, it\u2019s OK to have same-sex marriage.\u2019 \u201c Kluwe maintains that, despite his outspokenness, he has no plans to become a politician after his playing days are over. He hopes that one day, it won\u2019t be necessary for him to defend the issue of gay marriage. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be news when someone speaks out for equality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be news when someone speaks out against equality.\u201d",

            "article_content": "To ring in the New Year, CNN\u2019s Belief Blog asked experts in religion, faith leaders, and a secular humanist about how the forces of faith and faithlessness will shape the world in 2012. Here\u2019s what they told us: 1. The Republican Party will tap Mitt Romney as its presidential nominee, and America will finally have its \u201cMormon moment.\u201d As evangelicals try to figure out whether they can support a president who practices Mormonism, the rest of us will try to figure out whether Mormonism is a cult, a form of Christianity, or something in between. Meanwhile, visitors to Marriott hotels will finally crack open some of those nightstand copies of The Book of Mormon. \u2013Stephen Prothero, Boston University religion professor and regular CNN Belief Blog contributor 2. Despite all of the lessons that could have been learned from Y2K and Harold Camping, people will still rally around the idea that apocalyptic events are on the calendar for 2012. Some will turn to the end-date of the 5125-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar (closely associated with the Maya civilization) and a handful of folks believe cataclysmic events are awaiting on December 21, 2012. But the dates will pass with little fanfare \u2014 except for those profiting from the sale of gold coins, generators, and dried food that you\u2019d probably rather want to die than eat. \u2013Margaret Feinberg, author of \u201cHungry for God\u201d 3. Continuing revolutions across the Arab world will raise alarming questions about the fate of the remaining Christians in the region, and will put the issue of religious persecution squarely on the political agenda. Sizable Christian populations now survive in only two Arab countries, Egypt and Syria, both of which could soon be under Islamist rule. At a minimum, expect to see inter-faith violence on the ground. In a worst-case scenario, Arab Christians could face large scale persecution, forcing millions to seek new homes overseas. Watch too for religious persecution to be an emotive issue in the U.S. presidential race. \u2013 Philip Jenkins, Penn State University professor and author of \u201cLaying Down the Sword: Why We Can\u2019t Ignore the Bible\u2019s Violent Verses\u201d 4. The year will see an increase in the number of people \u201ccoming out\u201d as nonbelievers. Major events like the Reason Rally in March will be a catalyst for more people to publicly declare their secular worldview. The statements of popular celebrities George Takei and Ricky Gervais as atheists in 2011 are just the tip of the iceberg. \u2013Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the American Humanist Association 5. \u201cAll-American Muslim\u201d will become a bigger hit than \u201cJersey Shore\u201d ever was. Obsessed fans worldwide, regardless of gender, will begin rocking sassy colorful hijab (veil) and converting en masse. Tim Tebow will choose to fast in solidarity with Muslim football players and Tebowing will be replaced by Teprostrating. President Obama will jump on the bandwagon and replace VP Joe Biden with Keith Ellison as his running mate, guaranteeing his re-election in a landslide victory in November. Peace will reign on Earth and pigs will have a new lease on life. \u2013Maysoon Zayid, comedian, actress and co-producer of the New York Arab American Comedy Festival 6. There\u2019s no question the worldview of most younger Christians already differs from previous generations regarding social justice, cultural engagement and politics. The next issue of probable divergence? The conflict in Israel and Palestine. The American church has largely purported just one theology about the modern state of Israel, but now questions are being asked \u2013 especially by younger Christians learning of persecution and human rights issues happening in the region \u2013 if the church should have a more active role in peacemaking. Is there a way for the Church to be pro-Israel, pro-Palestine and pro-peace? \u2013Cameron Strang, publisher of RELEVANT magazine 7. Significant numbers of millennials (young people born in the 1980s and 1990s) will continue to walk away from socially conservative religious traditions. Bringing them back will be tough, especially for religious organizations deeply invested in brick-and-mortar and bureaucracy. Millennials who are facing the erosion of access to affordable, quality education and meaningful employment and who stand to inherit from their elders a great deal of debt and environmental destruction want to know why and how faith matters. \u2013Joanna Brooks, Mormon author and columnist for Religion Dispatches 8. The year 2012 promises to be a time of great spiritual stirring in our nation. People are seeking both practical and spiritual answers to their problems. As a result, churches and media ministries that answer specific needs will grow in unprecedented numbers. We can expect to see the numbers of mega-churches and super mega-churches continue to grow. Culturally there will be marked return to helping the poor (both domestically and internationally) and political and social engagement by a younger/more racially diverse, evangelical people. \u2013Harry R. Jackson Jr., senior pastor, Hope Christian Church and president of the High Impact Leadership Coalition 9. Sabbath becomes trendy! Fourth Commandment makes a comeback! Sabbath named Time\u2019s person of the year! A new movement sweeps the country. They call themselves 24/6. Worn out by being tethered to the grid 24/7, sick of being accessible all hours of the day, inundated by updates, upgrades, and breaking news, Americans finally rebel, demanding, \u201cWe need a day off.\u201d People all over the country go offline for 24 hours every week. The simple break from the frenetic pace results in lowered cholesterol rates, fewer speeding tickets, and a reduction in marital strife. Peace, tranquility and contentment spread like wildfire. \u2013Jamie Korngold, rabbi and author of \u201cThe God Upgrade\u201d 10. Women in the Middle East and around the world will rally in protest about the woman who was beaten, stomped on and stripped down to her blue bra (under her abaya) during a demonstration in Egypt. Women everywhere who have been oppressed by their religions will rise up, as they have already done in Egypt, to join \u201cThe Blue Bra Revolution.\u201d We\u2019re mad as hell and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore. \u2013Sally Quinn, founder and editor-in-chief of Washington Post\u2019s \u201cOn Faith\u201d 11. More churches will lose the moat dragon mentality, lower the drawbridge and dispatch members beyond the church service to church SERVICE, applying their faith in the community through volunteerism and outreach. \u2013A. Larry Ross, Christian communications executive representing clients like Billy Graham and Rick Warren 12. Hindu Americans will continue to become better advocates for themselves, particularly in the public policy arena. They will play a larger role in defining the manner in which Hinduism is represented in the media, academia, popular culture, and interfaith dialogue. The acknowledgment of the Hindu roots of yoga will continue to spread with more people seeing the connection. And the Hindu ethos of religious pluralism will take on a more prominent role in nurturing not only tolerance, but respect for and between the world\u2019s religions. \u2013Sheetal Shah, senior director of the Hindu American Foundation 13. In 2012 the lines between the sacred and the profane will get even more blurry: Scientists will religiously maintain their search for the elusive God particle (they won\u2019t find it); evangelical sports superhero and Denver Bronco quarterback Tim Tebow will continue to be both an inspiration to the faithful and an object of scorn to skeptics (he will be watching, not playing in, the Super Bowl); at least one well-known religious leader or leading religious politician will be brought down by a sex scandal (let\u2019s hope all our leaders have learned a lesson from former Rep. Anthony Weiner and stay away from sexting); and the \u201cnones\u201d \u2013 those who don\u2019t identify with one religion \u2013 will grow even more numerous and find religious meanings in unexpected places (what TV show will become this season\u2019s \u201cLost\u201d?) \u2013Gary M. Laderman, chairman of Emory University\u2019s religion department and  director of  Religion Dispatches 14. America\u2019s evangelical community will have its hands full addressing both a presidential election and offering a biblical response to \u201cend of days\u201d Mayan prophecies surrounding 2012. With the economy emerging as the primary issue for the November election, America\u2019s born-again community will have an opportunity to contextualize an alternative narrative to the polarizing elements from both the right and the left by reconciling the righteousness message of Billy Graham with the justice platform of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. By offering compassionate, truth-filled solutions and focusing on the message of grace, love, reconciliation and healing, evangelicals will demonstrate that the greatest agenda stems neither from the donkey nor the elephant but rather from the lamb. \u2013 Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference 15. We are seeing the divide between younger generation evangelicals and older generation (baby boom and older) get wider every year both theologically and culturally (lifestyle). 2012 promises to widen the gap even more with Gen X and younger evangelicals having trouble understanding why the traditional lines make sense and/or just outright rejecting those lines. \u2013Mark Tauber, publisher at HarperOne",

            "article_content": "NEW: The NRA calls for armed guards at schools Gun owners have walked a careful line in the wake of the Connecticut shootings Gun sales are up across the country in anticipation of possible gun-control legislation Some gun owners part with the NRA on policies, calling its recent announcement \"garbage\" Lou Klein, 64, shot his first gun when he was 11. \u201cMy dad bought me a single-shot .22 rifle at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago for $19.95,\u201d Klein remembered. \u201cI used to take that gun on the bus when I was 11 years old and go down to the shooting range. You couldn\u2019t do that now; you would have the FBI on you.\u201d Those bus trips to the firing range started a lifelong passion for the Vietnam veteran and lifetime National Rifle Association member and recruiter who owns Lou\u2019s Sporting Goods in Bowie, Maryland. Why would someone own a military-style rifle? His shop sells everything from handguns to AR-15 semi-automatic rifles \u2013 the military-style weapon used in several mass shootings, including the one last week in Newtown, Connecticut, that claimed 28 lives, including 20 children, their principal, the shooter\u2019s mother and gunman Adam Lanza, who took his own life. Klein\u2019s business is booming. And like many gun owners, he said he doesn\u2019t think limiting firearms will prevent another massacre. Parents defend right to keep guns in the home \u201cGun control is not the answer; it\u2019s about education and about responsibility,\u201d said Klein, who supports background checks, a waiting period, gun safety courses and mental health screening. Protesters interrupt NRA statement NRA helped defeat pro-gun lawmaker Fear of new laws drive gun sales Could the NRA become obsolete? Klein and millions of other small-town gun shop owners, hunters, housewives, former police officers and just plain everyday folks who proudly defend their right to bear arms have walked a tenuous line in the week following the Newtown shootings. They\u2019ve tried to balance responding to the nation\u2019s grief and horror at a crime that ended so many young lives, while worrying about what gun rights advocates see as a threat of knee-jerk legislation that could tread on their constitutional rights. \u201cI believe the Second Amendment provided that the average American citizen should have the same rights to armaments as the military. But do I want my next-door nut job neighbor to have a bazooka? No,\u201d said Noel Flasterstein, a Florida attorney and gun rights advocate. Mike Zammitti, a young gun owner in New England, agrees. Zammitti, 22, lives in Boylston, Massachusetts, and has three guns \u2013 a .22 rifle, a .25-caliber pocket pistol and a .22 Luger handgun. He also is a Class-A license holder, which allows him to \u201cconceal and carry\u201d his guns with him. But that doesn\u2019t mean that he does it. iReport: Was your gun banned? His weapons, he said, are for protection. He also said he doesn\u2019t need an assault rifle to protect himself in his home and doesn\u2019t think other people need them either. \u201cI absolutely think we should ban assault weapons,\u201d Zammitti said. \u201cThere is no reason to have assault weapons on the market. \u2026Those are people killers; they are not meant to go hunting.\u201d Still, even though he believes in some gun control laws, Zammitti said he fully supports the right to bear arms. The NRA, a powerful gun lobby with roughly 4.3 million members, spoke out on Friday, calling for armed guards at schools to protect the nation\u2019s children. The group signaled no willingness to consider any of the various proposals offered this week to change gun laws regarding access to assault weapons, universal background checks, limits on sales at gun shows, increased use of trigger locks or any other gun control regulation. Instead, the group pointed at media sensationalism, violent video games, gun-free zones, the failure to enforce gun laws already on the books, issues with the nation\u2019s mental health system and other societal problems. Policies banning guns at schools create a place that \u201cinsane killers\u201d consider \u201cthe safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk,\u201d Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA said on Friday. LaPierre said U.S. society has left children \u201cutterly defenseless.\u201d \u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,\u201d he said. In the days following the school shootings, individual NRA members took to Twitter, Facebook, the airwaves and the comment sections of websites such as CNN.com to explain their position. It usually went along these lines: They are not all gun-toting villains. They are, they proudly proclaim, patriots. \u201cGuns are what\u2019s kept this country free, and it\u2019s what\u2019s keeping our country free,\u201d Klein said, pointing to the militias in the Revolutionary War that fought against the British. Risk of daring to disagree with the NRA Changing gun control in U.S. America's long history with guns NRA breaks silence after shootings The NRA plans to speak out Friday and \u201cis prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again.\u201d Not everyone is buying the \u201cmeaningful contributions,\u201d however. \u201cI think the statement they just released is a bunch of garbage; they just wanted to get ahead of the issue,\u201d Zammitti said. \u201cIf you look at their history, they are hard-core \u2018guns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people.\u2019 \u201cAs soon as little kids get hurt, they try to get ahead of the picture saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to do something.\u2019 \u201d This week, President Barack Obama tapped Vice President Joe Biden to help lead a White House effort to craft proposals aimed at preventing another tragedy such as the Newtown shootings. The recommendations are due sometime in January. That same month, several lawmakers have promised to introduce or reintroduce gun control legislation, ranging from a reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons to banning the sale of high-capacity magazines. The NRA, which is regrouping in anticipation of that massive legislative push, will make its presence felt through congressional testimony and wielding the type of political sway the pro-gun lobby has carefully amassed over dozens of election cycles, experts said. \u201cI want to see legislators make correct appraisals, not emotional responses,\u201d said Richard Feldman, who was regional political director for the NRA during its rise to power in the 1980s and is president of a gun rights group called the Independent Firearm Owners Association. The list: Despite emotions, little happens legislatively after mass shootings Across the rest of the nation, attitudes about guns appear to be changing. A CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday indicates that a slight majority now favor major restrictions on owning guns or an outright ban on gun ownership by ordinary citizens and more than six in 10 favor a ban on semi-automatic assault rifles. The number of Americans who favor major restrictions or an outright ban has typically hovered just under the 50% mark in recent years; now that number is 52%. That\u2019s a rise in 5 percentage points from a CNN survey conducted in August following the mass shootings at a movie theater in suburban Denver that left 12 dead and shootings at a Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee, where six people were killed. The 5-point rise is within the poll\u2019s sampling error. Forty-three percent said the elementary school shootings in Connecticut make them more likely to support gun control laws, a 15-point increase from January 2011 following the Arizona gun rampage that wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Half of those questioned said the school shootings have not changed their opinions on gun control, down 19 points from January 2011. But that\u2019s just roughly half of the country. The other half is made up of the kind of people who have flooded Klein\u2019s suburban Washington shop after the Newtown shootings. People who, like Klein, believe that if Sandy Hook Elementary School teachers were armed, they would have been able to kill the shooter before he killed all those children. Lanza\u2019s guns: What we know so far \u201cLast night I didn\u2019t get out until 10,\u201d Klein said through a mouthful of a rushed lunch. He\u2019s almost sold out of AR-15s, he said. He just sold two Wednesday morning to a man who wanted them for his sons. Since the gun sales are not reported, trends in gun sales are typically tracked by the number of background checks the FBI conducts each year. In 2011 \u2013 a record year \u2013 the FBI conducted 16,454,951 background checks. In 2012, not counting the month of December, the FBI has already conducted 16,808,538. This includes the run on guns after Obama\u2019s re-election but does not include the recent sprint to buy up weapons after the Newtown shootings. And Klein\u2019s store\u2019s sales are not an anomaly; gun stores across the country are reporting record sales in the week following the Newtown shootings. Klein said gun owners are worried they won\u2019t be able to purchase semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 in the future, so they are buying them up now. Those concerns are rooted in the fear that tampering with Second Amendment rights could lead to a slippery slope of infringing on other constitutional rights, gun policy experts said. \u201cWith respect to assault rifles, I have a constitutional right to have one. \u2026 That\u2019s what our founding father and mothers recognized,\u201d said Feldman of the Independent Firearm Owners Association. \u201cIt\u2019s what it protects us from \u2013 the possibility of a tyrannical government. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have a tyrannical government, and I don\u2019t think Obama (is going to bring about a) tyrannical government. If we take away the Second Amendment, maybe it would.\u201d Opinion: Strong case for gun rights CNN\u2019s David Mattingly and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama to support Feinstein effort to reinstate assault weapons ban Sandy Hook shooting might become a tipping point for gun legislation Several pro-gun Democrats have said it is time to look at all options Some Republicans say fewer restrictions on guns are what are needed It has happened before: Aurora. Columbine. Tucson. Virginia Tech. But, this time, the White House and a growing number of Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill promise it will be different. This time, they say, things will change. In Washington and around the country, the legacy left by the 26 people \u2013 20 of them young children \u2013 slaughtered in a school shooting on Friday in Newtown, Connecticut, might indeed be meaningful legislative reform. Over the past few days, several lawmakers have promised to introduce or reintroduce gun control legislation, ranging from a reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons to banning the sale of high-capacity magazines. On Monday, there was a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. Senate to honor those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The chamber\u2019s chaplain called on lawmakers to \u201cact promptly.\u201d The House also observed a moment of silence Monday evening. Obama vows to prevent more gun tragedies A strong call to action from Obama Changing gun control in U.S. Latest updates out of Newtown, Connecticut \u201cTo me and to others, this one feels different,\u201d said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. \u201cMaybe because of the timing, maybe because of the victims, 20 young children. Maybe it\u2019s because we have a president who has been re-elected who is not going to be running again. That doesn\u2019t mean those political obstacles aren\u2019t still there, but it does feel different.\u201d Friday, just after the shooting, White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama was willing to consider reinstating the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. On Sunday, in his remarks at the vigil in Newtown, Obama hinted that he\u2019ll \u201cuse whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens \u2026 in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this. Because what choice do we have?\u201d On Monday, the White House inched closer to addressing what Carney called a complex problem. And Tuesday afternoon, Carney said the president now supports Sen. Diane Feinstein\u2019s intended effort to reinstate the assault weapons ban. Will Newtown change America\u2019s attitude toward guns? Pro-gun Democrats The most notable shift in tone comes from some conservative Democrats who have high rankings from the National Rifle Association for their pro-gun rights legislative stances. Friday\u2019s shooting was a \u201cgame changer,\u201d tweeted Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, who\u2019d previously received an \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA. \u201cThis awful massacre of our youngest children has changed us, and everything should be on the table,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia and \u201cproud gun owner,\u201d said Monday in a statement. \u201cWe need to move beyond dialogue \u2013 we need to take a sensible, reasonable approach to the issue of mass violence.\u201d New Jersey Democrat Sen. Frank Lautenberg plans to reintroduce legislation in the next Congress that would prohibit the sale of high-capacity magazines, his office confirmed Monday. He and California Sen. Feinstein hail from states that advocates of gun control, such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, say have some of the toughest gun restrictions. Feinstein announced Sunday she\u2019ll reintroduce an assault weapons ban when Congress reconvenes in January. Movement in the White House America's long history with guns Newtown tragedy renews fierce debates Piers takes on gun rights advocate Citizen-created petitions on the White House\u2019s website have netted thousands of signatures on both sides of the issue in just a few days. But the political reality is that crafting meaningful legislation is a tricky prospect. The White House has said Obama supports reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons \u2013 a position he took in the 2008 campaign but failed to press during his first term. \u201cIt does remain a commitment of his,\u201d Carney told reporters Friday. But later that day, an emotional Obama did not address the issue directly in a televised statement from the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,\u201d said Obama, the father of two girls. A White House source told CNN that on Monday afternoon, Obama had discussions with White House senior staff, the vice president and several Cabinet members, including Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Attorney General Eric Holder to begin looking at ways the country can respond to the tragedy in Newtown. The politics of guns Obama largely avoided the issue of gun control during his first term. He wrote an opinion piece two months after the 2011 assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, acknowledging the importance of the Second Amendment right to bear arms and called for a focus on \u201ceffective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place.\u201d Jared Loughner sentenced to life in deadly Arizona shootings But in the aftermath of that shooting and as the election season loomed, the Justice Department backed off from a list of recommendations that included measure designed to help keep mentally ill people from getting guns. There are also other political considerations. While Democratic lawmakers took to the airwaves this weekend to call for congressional action on gun control, the few Republicans who did speak out pointed to numerous court cases that have upheld Second Amendment rights and said guns are needed as mechanisms for self-defense. And others have said the solution is more guns in schools, not fewer. Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that if school principal Dawn Hochsprung had an assault rifle in her office, she could have killed the shooter. \u201cI wish to God she had an M-4 in her office locked up \u2013 so when she heard gunfire, she pulls it out and she didn\u2019t have to lunge heroically with nothing in her hands,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cBut she takes him out, takes his head off, before he can kill those precious kids.\u201d NRA big supporter of politicians Protecting those Second Amendment rights has also included hefty campaign donations. During the 2012 election cycle, the NRA donated $719,596 to candidates. Republicans received $634,146 of that, according to the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 analysis of federal campaign data. For example, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, ranked among the top five recipients, having received $7,450 in this cycle. Some $85,450 went to Democrats, many of them in states that are considered more conservative when it comes to gun control laws. For example, Democratic Rep. Jim Matheson got $6,950 this cycle and represents a district in Utah, a state gun control policy advocates say has some of the nation\u2019s weakest gun laws. A number of Democratic lawmakers who hail from conservative states are up for re-election in 2014, which may also increase the pressure not to touch the gun issue. Analysis: Guns and the law Gun policies are \u201cstill a third rail especially if you\u2019re really going to try and do something about it,\u201d said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the State University of New York at Albany\u2019s School of Criminal Justice. \u201cThere are a lot of issues there.\u201d According to a new ABC News/Washington Post survey on gun control conducted over the weekend, 52% of people see the mass shootings as a sign of broader problems in society. This up from 24% in August shortly after the deadly theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado. The poll also found rise in people who strongly favor stricter gun control, 44%, and a double-digit gap between them and the 32% who say they strongly oppose stricter gun control laws. In August, 39% supported tougher laws and 37% opposed them. A Pew poll conducted after the Giffords shooting found that 49% of Americans said it was \u201cmore important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns,\u201d while 46% said it was \u201cmore important to control gun ownership.\u201d But a survey conducted by CNN/ORC International in August shortly after the Aurora incident found that 76% of those surveyed believe \u201cthere should be some restrictions on owning guns.\u201d And as debate is sure to ensue in Washington, so it has already online. \u201cYou can make as many laws as you want it will NOT change people who want to hurt others. We all need to arm our self now. That is the only way,\u201d reader Steve Lahey commented on CNN.com. Which prompted another reader to reply: \u201cThat worked so well for the shooter\u2019s mother, didn\u2019t it?\u201d View from abroad: Sorrow, but little hope for U.S. gun control CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough and Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "If speechifying were hoops, Obama would be Kobe Bryant; Romney,  Moochie Norris Obama's set the bar high eight years ago, and this speech didn't hit the same mark John Kerry: \"Ask Osama bin Laden if he is better off now than he was four years ago.\" If Charlie Crist wants to run for Florida governor as a Dem, he's got a lot of work to do President Barack Obama accepted the nomination of his party Thursday on the last night of the Democratic National Convention, wrapping up a three-day political lovefest in Charlotte, North Carolina. Obama\u2019s acceptance speech wasn\u2019t one of his best, but it was enough to send Democrats infused with enthusiasm as they head home and hope it spreads there. Here are five things we learned on Thursday: 1. Obama clears the hurdle The president of the United States unleashed a corker of a convention speech on Thursday night in Charlotte. Obama: Romney 'new' to foreign policy Kerry accuses Romney of flip-flopping Biden: Romney sees things the 'Bain way' Animated Granholm fires up DNC Watch Gabby Giffords lead Pledge at DNC The message was clear: Things are tough, but if we stay on the same path, things will get better. The crowd loved it. It was lyrical. It was poignant. If speechifying were basketball, Barack Obama would be Kobe Bryant and Mitt Romney would be Moochie Norris. \u201cAmerica, I never said this journey would be easy, and I won\u2019t promise that now.  Yes, our path is harder \u2013 but it leads to a better place,\u201d Obama said. But here is the burden of being Barack Obama: This was his third nationally televised convention speech, and it was unquestionably his most underwhelming. Obama only has himself to blame. The bar is so high only because his skills as an orator are stunning. Analysis: Obama hit the marks he needed to His 2004 keynote address, so moving that it seemed more of a prayer than a political speech, will go down as one of the greatest public addresses in American history.  His 2008 convention speech in Denver was almost as inspiring. Thursday\u2019s attempt to transform the prose of governing into the poetry of a campaign had a noticeably different feel. It reaffirmed for Democrats the gravity of what\u2019s at stake in this election: a strong economy and better future for a Wall Street plutocracy. His attacks on the Republican ticket\u2019s lack of foreign policy experience were particularly cutting. Obama used the term \u201cchoice\u201d 10 times. But the realities of being president make for a more complicated speech than the soaring kind he routinely delivered during the heady days of the 2008 campaign. He acknowledged as much. \u201cI recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention,\u201d Obama explained. \u201cThe times have changed \u2013 and so have I. I\u2019m no longer just a candidate.  I\u2019m the president.\u201d Four years later: Are you better off? He mentioned the word \u201chope\u201d 15 times in his speech, reprising the theme that carried him to the Oval Office in 2008. But as the writer Andrew Sullivan wrote on his blog Thursday, \u201cThis feels like a State of the Union \u2013 not a convention rallying cry.\u201d Obama was forced to temper his inspiring rhetoric about the greatness of the American spirit with references to the policy battles that have consumed his tenure in office. Energy, same-sex marriage, education, taxes, climate change \u2013 all referenced. His health care reform law? Barely touched on. The stimulus went unmentioned. Expectations were high, and Obama delivered. But instead of knocking it out of the park, he might have just hit a triple. Opinion: We\u2019re in for a heck of a ride 2. All forgiven for Obama\u2019s long evolution to back same-sex marriage Although Obama had a rough start in laying out his support for same-sex marriage earlier this year, the celebration on the convention floor Thursday marked a full embrace from the LGBT community. But all seemed forgotten Thursday night when Democrats saved same-sex marriage for the final night, featuring several speakers and testimonies praising the president\u2019s newly minted position, as well as the party\u2019s decision to fold marriage equality into its platform. The DNC and gay rights 40 years later \u201cThis has been the most diverse, most inclusive convention ever held \u2013 a convention not just of symbolism, but of substance. For the first time, a major party platform recognizes marriage equality as a basic human right,\u201d said convention Chairman Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles. Zach Wahls, an Iowan, spoke about being raised by his two moms and faulted Republicans and Mitt Romney for what he argued were prejudice and unfair positions on same-sex marriage. \u201cPresident Obama understands that. He supports my moms\u2019 marriage,\u201d Wahls said. \u201cPresident Obama put his political future on the line to do what was right.\u201d Also featured in the segment \u2013 one that received much fanfare from the crowd \u2013 was a U.S. Army captain who applauded the president\u2019s work to help repeal \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d saying it was wrong that many of the men and women he served with were turned away because of their sexual orientation. \u201cSoldiers who I trusted with my life, and fought alongside with, could be discharged because of who they love,\u201d Jason Crow said. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, who\u2019s fighting for a U.S. Senate seat, also praised the DADT repeal. \u201cOur president has made historic progress toward equality,\u201d Baldwin, a lesbian, said. \u201cRepublicans want to write discrimination into our Constitution. But the Wisconsin I know believes that with each passing year and each generation, our country must become more equal, not less.\u201d And in his speech, Obama chided \u201cWashington politicians who want to decide who you can marry\u201d and credited the American people for helping to ensure that \u201cselfless soldiers won\u2019t be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love.\u201d 3. Kerry displays his foreign policy cred The 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, John Kerry, brought the people to their feet in a speech that showed his supporters haven\u2019t forgotten the senator\u2019s foreign policy chops. Could Kerry, with 27 years in the Senate, soon have a larger role should Obama win? The Massachusetts senator focused his remarks on painting Romney, former governor of the Bay State, as out of touch on national security and international affairs. On overseas involvements, the Senate Foreign Relations chairman attacked Romney for wavering on his answers about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as action taken in Libya. \u201cMr. Romney, here\u2019s a little advice: Before you debate Barack Obama on foreign policy, you better finish the debate with yourself,\u201d Kerry said. The zing was somewhat double-layered, as Kerry has been tapped to play the role of Romney in debate prep for Obama. Excerpts: Kerry to extol Obama foreign policy record at DNC Continuing with his crowd-pleasing breakdown of Romney\u2019s national security policy, Kerry referenced Romney\u2019s gaffe when he argued on CNN earlier this year that Russia was the United States\u2019 No. 1 geopolitical foe. \u201cSarah Palin said she could see Russia from Alaska,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cMitt Romney talks like he\u2019s only seen Russia by watching Rocky IV.\u201d And while Vice President Joe Biden delivered his famous line, \u201cOsama bin Laden is dead; General Motors is alive,\u201d Kerry was the one who really brought down the house when he turned the tables on the Republican attack line of whether voters thought they were better off than they were four years ago. \u201cAfter more than 10 years without justice for thousands of Americans murdered on 9/11, after Mitt Romney said it would be naive to go into Pakistan to pursue the terrorists, it took President Obama, against the advice of many, to give that order to finally rid this Earth of Osama bin Laden. \u201cAsk Osama bin Laden if he is better off now than he was four years ago,\u201d Kerry said, prompting near-deafening applause in the arena. The surprisingly hard-hitting speech, one also laced with ideals of American exceptionalism, begged the question of whether the senator was vying for a potential Cabinet position should Obama win re-election. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has already said she\u2019ll step down at the end of Obama\u2019s first term. Could Kerry be filling her shoes? 4. It takes an import to pump up crowd over American autos Jennifer Granholm revved up the Time Warner Cable arena Thursday night with a rousing and spirited defense of the bailouts of Chrysler and General Motors. The former Michigan governor had the crowd at the Democratic convention on their feet and energetically applauding as she touted Obama\u2019s role in rescuing America\u2019s auto industry. \u201cThe entire auto industry, and the lives of over 1 million hard-working Americans, teetered on the edge of collapse; and with it, the whole manufacturing sector. We looked everywhere for help. Almost nobody had the guts to help us \u2013 not the banks, not the private investors and not Bain Capital. Then, in 2009, the cavalry arrived: Our new president, Barack Obama!\u201d Granholm said. \u201cHe organized a rescue, made the tough calls and saved the American auto industry.\u201d While Granholm had the audience cheering wildly, don\u2019t start thinking of her as possible contender for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 she was born in Canada before moving to the U.S. as a child, and that means she can\u2019t be president. But she can serve as a strong surrogate for the president in an important battleground state. Granholm embraced that role, attacking Romney for his opposition to the auto bailouts. \u201cMitt Romney saw the same crisis and you know what he said? \u2018Let Detroit go bankrupt.\u2019 Sure, Mitt Romney loves our lakes and trees. He loves our cars so much, they have their own elevator. But the people who design, build, and sell those cars? Well, in Romney\u2019s world, the cars get the elevator; the workers get the shaft,\u201d she said. Five lines that killed Romney opposed the government bailout and pushed for a privately financed, managed bankruptcy of the two automakers. One thing Granholm didn\u2019t do is give any credit to President George W. Bush. The auto bailouts were actually started in late 2008 during Bush\u2019s last couple of months in office. Obama continued, funded and expanded the program after taking office in early 2009. The auto bailouts have been prominently touted during the Democratic convention, with the Obama campaign seeing them as a roadway to victory in Michigan and neighboring Ohio, which is also a major base for the auto industry. As for Granholm, who\u2019s now a host on progressive network Current TV, she proved she can charge up a crowd in only a matter of moments. Her six-minute speech won praise from Vice President Joe Biden, who during his address an hour later gave her a shout-out, saying \u201cGod love Jennifer Granholm! Wasn\u2019t she great?\u201d But her performance may best be summed up by a tweet: I\u2019LL HAVE WHAT SHE\u2019S HAVING!!!! 5. Charlie Crist has some work to do Charlie Crist, who once billed himself as a \u201cpro-life, pro-gun, anti-tax Republican,\u201d has a lot of work to do if he plans to run for governor as a Democrat in 2014, as many Florida insiders expect him to do. The Obama campaign\u2019s decision to hand Crist a prime-time speaking slot at the convention was widely mocked by Republicans who see him as a craven political operator and turncoat of the worst order. But the move also rankled Sunshine State Democrats who think the former governor and Senate candidate is shamelessly positioning himself for yet another statewide run. Crist endorsed Obama for re-election last week and is expected to formally register as a Democrat any day now. \u201cTo many longtime Florida Democrats,\u201d the Miami Herald\u2019s Marc Caputo wrote this week, \u201cit\u2019s revolting.\u201d Florida Republicans hammer Crist for switch The political class delivered some brutal reviews after Crist took the convention stage \u2013 accompanied by a floor fan, of course, to prevent any unwanted perspiration \u2013 to thank Obama for passing a 2009 stimulus bill that \u201csaved Florida.\u201d \u201cI find Charlie Crist detestable w/an intensity I usually reserve for communist tyrants and frogs,\u201d tweeted Ana Navarro, a Republican fundraiser close to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and a CNN contributor. Navarro clarified moments later: \u201cI apologize to all frogs, toads and tadpoles for previously saying I detest Charlie Crist w/same intensity I do frogs. I detest him more.\u201d A spokesman for Bush said in an e-mail that Crist is \u201csolely focused on personal ambition.\u201d Sam Stein of the Huffington Post hanged Crist with his own words, retweeting in rapid succession a series of 2010-era Crist tweets attacking Obama\u2019s health care reform law. And no Crist-watch would be complete without a joke about his famous tan. \u201cCharlie Crist\u2019s speech was oranger than a Frank Ocean album,\u201d tweeted liberal blogger Jesse Taylor. Florida Republican Party Chairman Lenny Curry and his adviser Brian Hughes were sipping beers inside the CNN Grill during Crist\u2019s speech, smirking and then bursting into laughter as the TVs cut away from his speech to go to commercial break. Curry took issue with Crist\u2019s assertion that he \u201cdidn\u2019t leave the Republican Party; it left me.\u201d \u201cThat is a ridiculous claim,\u201d Curry told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie. Everyone knows Charlie Crist left the Republican Party because he was trying to win an election.\u201d Crist, employed at a law firm run by his political patron John Morgan, is working hard to repair his image and political gravitas. He was seen leaving an Obama campaign finance meeting Thursday morning \u2013 not a bad place to meet potential Democratic donors. But it was hard to find anyone in Charlotte, this week\u2019s center of the political universe, who takes Crist seriously. And that\u2019s a big problem if he hopes to recapture his office in Tallahassee in two years. Obama urges voters to secure the change he started",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Now that the 2012 Democratic National Convention is underway in Charlotte, CNN contributor John Avlon offers his Top 5 questions President Obama and the DNC must resolve during the rest of the week. Weather concerns have shifted the venue for President Obama's speech on Thursday The DNC and President Obama need to resolve several looming issues this week Enthusiasm, the Blue Dogs, a deep bench and a second-term agenda are among questions they face 1) Where is Obama\u2019s Second Term Agenda? \u2013 President Barack Obama\u2019s Thursday night nomination speech, now being held in the tight Time Warner Cable Arena due to weather concerns, needs to lay out a specific second-term agenda. For Obama, simply promising more of the same isn\u2019t enough to earn re-election. He\u2019s got to lay out a specific contrasting plan with some new details, because the curse of being Barack Obama is that giving a great speech isn\u2019t good enough anymore. 2) How Deep is the Bench? \u2013 Nobody doubts Obama\u2019s star power, but the question is his effectiveness as a party builder. The Republican convention gave a clear look at their future stars: Paul Ryan, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio. Who do Democrats have on the bench?\u00a0San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro gave a very impressive keynote speech \u2013 but can he win statewide in Texas? 3) Are Blue Dogs Still Alive? \u2013 When Bill Clinton brought Democrats back from three consecutive elections losing more than 40 states apiece, it was because he was able to re-center the party \u2013 winning over moderates and the middle class, particularly in the South. The Party of Obama has seen an erosion of those voters, largely due to greater polarization. Bill Clinton\u2019s speech on Wednesday will be a key test of whether those Blue Dogs can still hunt, and whether a state like North Carolina is still within reach. 4) Can they bridge the Enthusiasm Gap? \u2013 This has been a relentlessly negative election, playing to the base of both parties with ads attacking the opposition rather than building up their own side. Republicans tried to praise their nominee rather than attack the president at their convention, but their energy is more anti-Obama than pro-Romney. The questions is whether the energy in the Charlotte convention hall is pro-Obama or anti-Romney.\u00a0The positive always beats the negative, if it is of equal intensity, 5) Is there life outside the arena? \u2013Get out and enjoy the city of Charlotte and the entire convention experience. Pay attention to the big speeches and pick your favorite panels \u2013 but this is a time for reconnection and conversation and exploring the host city, one of the great cities of the South. Sleep can come later. Make sure you take advantage of every moment here in North Carolina.",

            "article_content": "Minnesota voters will decide in November whether to implement a same-sex marriage ban Same-sex marriage supporters say they've gotten a boost from President Obama's comments Obama said he favored same-sex marriage, although agreed states should decide the issue Same-sex marriage opponents say their base was also energized by Obama Minneapolis is a conflicted city. It\u2019s home to one of the largest gay pride festivals in the Midwest and was once dubbed the \u201cgayest city in America\u201d by The Advocate magazine. The metropolitan area is also home to the conservative power base of Rep. Michele Bachmann. And in six months, voters there and across the state will decide whether to amend the state\u2019s constitution to ban same-sex marriage. It is one of four states where voters will cast ballots on the issue, along with Washington, Maine and Maryland. Across the nation, 29 states have approved constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. Six states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriages while five states allow civil unions between same-sex couples. Same-sex marriage by the numbers President Barack Obama\u2019s May 9 announcement that he supports same-sex marriage helped mobilize activists for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in Minnesota. Same-sex marriage an election hot topic History of same-sex marriage in the U.S. Romney's record on same-sex marriage The day after Obama spoke, \u201cmore than twice as many\u201d people signed up to volunteer for Minnesotans United for All Families than on previous days, according to the group\u2019s campaign manager Richard Carlbom. Carlbom\u2019s group is working to defeat the November measure that would ban gay marriage. He said that even North Carolina voters\u2019 decision on May 8 to ban same-sex marriage there helped energize Minnesota\u2019s pro-LGBT lobby to get out the vote in November. \u201c[Obama\u2019s decision and North Carolina\u2019s vote] was an incredible one-two punch for us in Minnesota in terms of punching up the amount of energy,\u201d Carlbom said. He added that the goal is to capitalize on the energy from both events. Kate Wulf and her partner of 31 years Marianne Christianson, both volunteers for Minnesotans United for All Families, desperately want to see the amendment defeated for both political and personal reasons. \u201cNorth Carolina was kind of a wake-up call for everyone,\u201d Wulf said. She and Christianson were legally married in Canada, but they would like nothing more than to walk down the aisle \u2013 and have their commitment for each other recognized \u2013 in their home state. \u201cWe want the equality of marriage that I don\u2019t think we should be denied according to the Constitution of this country,\u201d said Christianson. In his recent announcement, Obama said while he personally supports same-sex marriage, he still believes the issue should be decided by each state. That\u2019s something that Wulf and Christianson don\u2019t agree with. \u201cI think marriage is a fundamental right,\u201d Wulf said. \u201c(It) shouldn\u2019t be determined on a state-by-state basis.\u201d Christianson said she\u2019s believes that won\u2019t be Obama\u2019s position forever. \u201cHe had to start somewhere,\u201d Christianson added. \u201cAnd where he started right now is a good beginning. I\u2019m hoping he will evolve into a stance where \u2026 it is recognized nationwide.\u201d The couple believes defeating the amendment will be an uphill battle, particularly when those on the opposing side have the resources of the Roman Catholic Church, they say. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that we\u2019re going to see the goodness of people of Minnesota come out, but it\u2019s really hard to fight the church,\u201d Christianson said. \u201cThey have a built-in organization.\u201d Two years ago, the Minneapolis-St. Paul archdiocese sent out 400,000 DVDs to its parishioners urging them to support legislation banning same-sex marriage, even though the issue wasn\u2019t even on the ballot. So far, Catholic churches across the state have donated $350,000 to Minnesota for Marriage, a group that supports the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, according to Jason Adkins, executive director of the Minnesota Catholic Conference, which represents the state\u2019s Catholic bishops. North Carolina was kind of a wake-up call for everyone. Kate Wulf,  volunteer, Minnesotans United for All Families \u201cThe various dioceses are giving money to the Minnesota Catholic Conference to use to support the marriage amendment,\u201d Adkins told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re going to raise and spend the money we need to get the message out about what marriage is, why it\u2019s important and what the consequences will be if it\u2019s redefined.\u201d Advocacy groups opposed to same-sex marriage say their supporters also got a boost from Obama\u2019s comments. \u201c[President Obama\u2019s] comments \u2026 alerted our base to the fact that there are politicians who are trying to meddle with the definition of marriage,\u201d said Chuck Darrell, communications director for Minnesota for Marriage. \u201cWhen they hear that they\u2019re motivated to get out and do something to pass the marriage amendment.\u201d The group\u2019s chairman, John Helmberger, said it\u2019s too early to tell if there has been an increase in volunteers after Obama\u2019s statement. However, he agreed that the president\u2019s admission that he supports same-sex marriage will help Minnesota for Marriage rally supporters ahead of the November ballot. \u201cThat will energize them to make phone calls, knock on doors, and to make sure they turn out in November,\u201d Helmberger said. While the recent media coverage of North Carolina\u2019s vote and Obama\u2019s comments have raised awareness of the issue, Minnesota for Marriage volunteer Michael Blissenbach said this did not affect how hard he\u2019s been campaigning against same-sex marriage. Blissenbach, 25, has been volunteering in support of the proposed amendment on behalf of the Catholic Church since August. He personally believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman because \u201credefining marriage would diminish the importance of having the influence of the mother and the father on the life of a child.\u201d \u201cI see marriage as an institution primarily oriented to the raising and procreation of children, and I see that as why the government recognizes marriage,\u201d Blissenbach said. He said that doesn\u2019t mean he is opposed to same-sex relationships. \u201cI respect their right to live as they wish, and I don\u2019t deny that there\u2019s love in those relationships,\u201d Blissenbach explained. \u201cBut I see marriage as about a particular kind of love between a man and a woman that brings a child into the world.\u201d While many predict this fight could get ugly as the two sides duke it out for the next six months, the same-sex marriage issue could also fade from voters\u2019 minds by the time the November election rolls around. When they hear [Obama\u2019s position], they\u2019re motivated to \u2026 do something to pass the marriage amendment. Chuck Darrell, Minnesota for Marriage After all, economic issues are expected to be the top issue for voters across the United States this fall. Either way, it could help the president gain some voters, according to University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs. \u201cSocial issues including gay marriage are unlikely to affect voter choice between [Mitt] Romney and Obama,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cBut it could be a big tool for Obama to turn out disaffected Democrats who are likely to sit out the election.\u201d However Minnesota\u2019s voters decide on the proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, the issue isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, Jacobs said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that gay marriage is coming to a state near you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it does begin to shift the balance and reflects a very significant shift in public thinking about gay marriage.\u201d What are your top election issues of 2012?

            "article_content": "NEW: Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts calls Lugar's loss \"a tragedy for the Senate\" \"You got this done,\" rival Richard Mourdock tells supporters after win The Senate fight pitted moderate Republicans against the more conservative wing of the party If Dick Lugar \"was running for something to do with foreign policy, I'd be all over it,\" Mourdock voter says Indiana voters retired Dick Lugar on Tuesday after 36 years in the Senate, punishing him for the qualities he considered assets: seniority, expertise in foreign policy and a penchant for bipartisan cooperation. Hoosier Republicans overwhelmingly chose to replace Lugar with Richard Mourdock, a longtime GOP operative who benefited from manpower and money from tea party activists and outside groups determined to topple the six-term veteran. Six years ago, Lugar ran unopposed by Democrats, much less Republicans, and cruised to another term. But this time, the 80-year-old was drummed out of office by many of the same voters who sent him repeatedly to Washington but now say they want a change. Analysis: Lugar\u2019s grass roots withered Lugar conceded the race about an hour after the polls closed, telling supporters that he congratulated Mourdock on \u201ca hard-fought race.\u201d \u201cI want to see a Republican in the White House,\u201d Lugar said. \u201cI want to see my friend Mitch McConnell have a Republican majority in the Senate. I hope that Richard Mourdock prevails in November so he can contribute to that Republican majority.\u201d Mourdock, Indiana\u2019s state treasurer, will face Democrat Joe Donnelly in November in a contest the nonpartisan Cook Political Report calls safely Republican. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t been about me. This has been about all of you. You got this done,\u201d Mourdock told supporters during a victory speech in Indianapolis. He thanked his supporters and led them in a round of applause for Lugar. \u201cWhen I began this campaign, Senator Lugar was not my enemy,\u201d Mourdock said. \u201cHe is not now my enemy. He will never by my enemy. He was simply, over the last 15 months, my opponent.\u201d But now, he said, Republicans need \u201cto get this country back on a course where all can rise and all sense the excitement of the dream that is America.\u201d Dick Lugar reflects on his Senate career Mourdock: Never compromise on principles Follow all of Tuesday\u2019s political results at CNN.com\u2019s Election Center In recent years, Lugar had served as chairman, then ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. The panel\u2019s current leader, Sen. John Kerry, called Lugar\u2019s defeat \u201ca tragedy for the Senate\u201d Tuesday. Kerry, D-Massachusetts, said Lugar could be compared to the renowned U.S. Sen. William Fulbright, an Arkansas Democrat \u201cwho is remembered today not for one loss, but for a legacy of following the facts and speaking the truth despite the political risks.\u201d \u201cThis is a tough period in American politics, but I\u2019d like to think that we\u2019ll again see a United States Senate where Dick Lugar\u2019s brand of thoughtful, mature and bipartisan work is respected and rewarded,\u201d Kerry said in a written statement. \u201cThat kind of seriousness of purpose should never go out of fashion.\u201d Mourdock\u2019s move to oust the widely respected senior senator was initially viewed as an uphill battle. Lugar\u2019s campaign released a poll in February showing the incumbent up by 25 points. But then outside conservative groups fed up with his penchant for compromise began pouring money into the race, and they turned it into the first stand of so-called Super PACs in a contested primary. As polls started to show the race tighten, tea party groups mobilized grassroots supporters and turned the David vs. Goliath race into a national referendum on the state of the Republican Party. The Club for Growth, a conservative pro-growth group, perhaps played the biggest role, releasing a barrage of ads that framed Lugar as out of step with his own party. The group endorsed Mourdock in mid-February and spent close to $1.5 million on television ads \u2013 close to what Lugar\u2019s own campaign spent on TV spots. But it also collected more than $300,000 from donors and gave it to the Mourdock campaign, making their total spending on the race close to $2 million. Chris Chocola, President of the Club for Growth, used the win as a warning to other Republicans who didn\u2019t toe the conservative line. \u201cRichard Mourdock\u2019s victory truly sends a message to the liberals in the Republican Party: voters are rejecting the policies that led to record debt and diminished economic freedom, and they will continue to be rejected in elections throughout America,\u201d Chocola said in a written statement. Lugar focused his pitch on his more than three decades in the Senate as a leading voice on foreign policy. \u201cI\u2019m still working every day. I\u2019m getting warheads out of Russia. And missiles, things that are of very grave consequence. I would just say that people may not have their eye on the ball, but I do,\u201d Lugar told CNN after greeting voters in Greenwood. But perplexed Republican strategists say that Lugar\u2019s focus talking nukes at a time of widespread joblessness was off-key, and a major factor in his defeat. Arizona Sen. John McCain, who endorsed Lugar, told CNN the \u201cmoral of the story is play offense, not defense.\u201d Unlike Republican colleagues who got toppled by tea party insurgents two years ago, Lugar had time to prepare for his primary challenge and tack right but he chose not to. Instead, he voted for legislation unpopular with the GOP base, such as allowing children of illegal immigrants to have a path to U.S. citizenship. In ads and in the mail, Lugar\u2019s opponents repeatedly linked him to the president, calling him President Barack Obama\u2019s favorite Republican. Ralph Williams, a longtime Lugar supporter whose grandmother was close to the senator, came out to vote for his opponent this time. \u201cIf he was running for something to do with foreign policy, I\u2019d be all over it,\u201d Williams told CNN. But he said now, \u201cI think he\u2019s done.\u201d Williams\u2019 vote was more about voting Lugar out than putting Mourdock in, he said. Lugar\u2019s decision to reside primarily in his home in McLean, Virginia, outside Washington, instead of Indiana played into his opponent\u2019s line that he was \u201cout of touch\u201d and no longer able to represent the interests of his own constituents. \u201cHe\u2019s not been here. He\u2019s been absent for a long time,\u201d Mourdock told CNN after meeting voters in Avon on Tuesday afternoon. After his state residency was challenged, Lugar registered to vote at his son\u2019s family farm and repaid hotel bills he said were inappropriately charged to his Senate account. And he argued his choice about staying close to the Capitol was about raising his four sons together with his wife, which he said was evidence of \u201cfamily values\u201d and had no bearing on his job performance. While Mourdock and his allies didn\u2019t explicitly argue the 80-year-old senator was no longer up to another six-year term, some voters in Indiana said while they admired his long list of accomplishments for the state \u2013 they just thought it was time for him to step down. But Lugar\u2019s supporters say his ability to work with Democrats and his foreign policy expertise earned him their vote for another term. \u201cI liked the fact that Sen. Lugar isn\u2019t a strict party person,\u201d Vicki Johnson, a voter in Fairland, said Tuesday afternoon. But Johnson also conceded that a defeat this election not be the worst outcome for Lugar. \u201cIf he loses, maybe it\u2019ll be a blessing. Because he\u2019s older. Maybe he can enjoy life a little,\u201d she said. What was striking about Lugar\u2019s loss is how evident it is Hoosier voters respect him. Many Republican voters told CNN they were voting against him for the first time in decades, and it was clear they felt bad about it. \u201cI hated to depart,\u201d David Kitley said. But he quickly added, \u201cWe can\u2019t let Obama dictate to us anymore what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Kitley spoke in a hushed tone only a few feet away from Lugar, working the polls. Minutes earlier, he approached the senator and thanked him for his service.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Mitt Romney names a former top aide to lead his vice-president nominee search NEW: Romney trails Obama by 9 points in latest CNN/ORC International poll NEW: Romney attends a Boston Red Sox game on Patriots' Day in Massachusetts Romney is the presumptive GOP nominee, though more primaries remain Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign confirmed Monday that a trusted aide of the former Massachusetts governor will lead the search for his running mate in November, as the presumptive Republican nominee trails President Barack Obama by 9 points in the latest CNN/ORC International nationwide poll. Beth Myers, who served as chief of staff when Romney was governor of Massachusetts and managed his 2008 presidential campaign, will head the search effort, according to Romney\u2019s campaign, which confirmed comments by Romney in an interview with ABC News to be broadcast Monday night. \u201cThis weekend was the first time we seriously really talked about it and there are some wonderful people out there,\u201d Romney said in a preview of the interview released by ABC News. Obama\u2019s 52%-43% lead in the first CNN poll since Rick Santorum suspended his Republican bid for the White House highlighted a perception among respondents that the president is more likeable and more in touch with the problems facing women and middle class Americans, according to the poll. CNN Poll: Gender gap and likeability keep Obama over Romney Romney was celebrating Patriots\u2019 Day in his hometown of Boston and watched the Red Sox lose to Tampa Bay, 1-0, at Fenway Park. Romney was joined by son Tagg and a grandson to watch along with supporters who won a promotion called \u201cPatriots\u2019 Day with Mitt.\u201d In Massachusetts, Patriots\u2019 Day commemorates the battles of Lexington and Concord, which launched the Revolutionary War. It also is the date of the Boston Marathon. Robert De Niro on Mitt Romney Previewing the general election A different take on the 'mom wars' CNN pundit faces backlash Earlier Monday, a campaign official responded to reports that Romney had floated the possibility of eliminating or restructuring certain government agencies, saying he was tossing out ideas, not unveiling policy. At a fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, the night before, Romney said, as part of ideas aimed at reforming Washington, he would combine some government agencies and eliminate others, according to accounts from reporters who overheard Romney\u2019s remarks, including one from the Wall Street Journal, while standing outside the venue where he was making his pitch. Romney suggested he might eliminate the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which his father, George, once headed, and either consolidate or reduce the size of the Education Department. Now the candidate is getting a tiny bit more specific about his plans. According to the Journal, Romney \u201csaid he would eliminate or limit for high-earners the mortgage interest deduction for second homes, and likely would do the same for the state income tax deduction and state property tax deduction.\u201d Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul responded to the comments, saying her candidate is tackling bold issues while President Barack Obama is \u201cinterested only in offering excuses and blaming others for his failures.\u201d Meanwhile, the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action unleashed an online and TV commercial directly targeting Romney\u2019s \u201canti-middle class\u201d tax policy, timed to Tax Day, April 17. The ad is the first part of a multimillion-dollar campaign attacking Romney focusing on the battleground states of Florida, Iowa, Ohio and Virginia. Pro-Obama super PAC to hit Romney on taxes With no primaries in the Republican presidential race until next week, Romney will focus on fundraising with events in North Carolina and Pennsylvania in coming days, while Ann Romney is scheduled to hold a birthday-themed fundraiser in New York on Tuesday. Mrs. Romney turned 63 on Monday. In addition, her husband will address the Tri-State Tea Party Caucus in Philadelphia on Monday night, when the joint interview on ABC will be broadcast. Obama, meanwhile, is scheduled to campaign in Michigan this week, while first lady Michelle Obama will be in the District of Columbia, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. Vice President Joe Biden will host events in the District of Columbia, Arizona and California. While Romney is positioned as the likely Republican presidential candidate in November, he still needs several hundred delegates to clinch the nomination over remaining rivals Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul. The next primaries are April 24 in Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. On Sunday, both parties continued jockeying to position themselves as more deserving of the female vote, a battle that took on new life last week after a Democratic strategist questioned Ann Romney\u2019s standing to give her husband advice on economic issues affecting women. The criticism from Hilary Rosen, also a CNN contributor, rekindled the national conversation on whether Republicans or Democrats are better equipped to improve economic conditions for women. Polls show a majority of female voters favor Obama over Romney, and Rosen\u2019s comment that Ann Romney never worked outside the home and therefore was unqualified to provide her husband with advice on women\u2019s economic issues gave Republicans a line of attack against Democrats. On morning talk shows, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner defended the Obama administration\u2019s record on job creation and accused Romney of leveling \u201cridiculous\u201d accusations against the president\u2019s policies. He specifically pointed to Romney\u2019s claim that 92.3% of jobs lost since Obama took office were held by women. \u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous and deeply misleading look at the economy,\u201d Geithner said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cRemember, the recession and the crisis started at the beginning of 2008 before the president took office. It caused a huge amount of damage to men, to women, to families. And the damage lasted for a time, and you\u2019re still seeing the scars of that.\u201d The 92.3% figure was batted back and forth to jab Obama in the latest skirmish. Although the number is correct, many observers say it is misleading because it fails to reflect the depth of the recession that began before Obama took office, with many more men than women losing their jobs in that period. Geithner stressed the downturn \u201churt everybody\u201d and unsurprisingly rallied behind the president\u2019s proposals, including the \u201cBuffett Rule,\u201d which he said is part of a comprehensive plan that will continue to improve the country\u2019s economic outlook. In a CNN/ORC poll released Monday, seven in 10 respondents said they favor the bill named for billionaire financier Warren Buffett that would require people earning $1 million a year or more to pay at least 30% in taxes. It is intended to prevent the wealthy from paying a lower actual tax rate than middle class workers. CNN Poll: 7 out of 10 support \u2018Buffett Rule\u2019 On Monday Republicans in the Democratic-controlled Senate blocked the Buffett Rule bill, garnering enough support to reject a proposal to debate it. Supporters of the millionaire tax say they will keep pushing the idea in the months ahead. Senate GOP blocks Buffett Rule bill Romney backers, including Republicans Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, argued that the former Massachusetts governor is armed with proposals that will not only court female voters, but also turn the economy around. McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, predicted Romney would win the female vote, despite the gender gap in current polling. \u201cI do believe that Ann Romney was right when she said the women she talks to and the women I talk to, traveling around my state, are interested in jobs and the economy,\u201d McCain said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that a lot of women have been hurt very badly in this recession. And jobs and the economy is their No. 1 priority.\u201d In the CNN/ORC poll released Monday, women voters back Obama over Romney by 16 points, 55% to 39%. A recent poll from ABC News/Washington Post showed Obama leading Romney among women, 57% to 38%. Rodgers, who was one of the women dispatched by the Romney campaign to capitalize on Rosen\u2019s comment last week, told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley that Romney\u2019s policies will \u201chelp women succeed in this country and all people in this country succeed.\u201d \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s policies are the ones that are failing  Americans, failing women,\u201d she added on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Most Americans overwhelmingly support women working outside the household, according to a new CNN/ORC survey, with nine in 10 saying the number of women in the workplace is a good thing, a significant change from attitudes on that topic in the 1980s and 1990s. CNN Poll: Support for working women almost unanimous The back-and-forth over female support is the latest Twitter- and cable-fed controversy to demonstrate that the general election between Romney and Obama is already under way. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus would not yet characterize Romney as the \u201cpresumptive nominee\u201d out of respect for Gingrich and Paul, who are far behind in the delegate count but remain in the race. However, Priebus said Romney\u2019s significant advantages on all fronts make it highly likely he will face Obama for the presidency. CNN\u2019s Paul Steinhauser, Rachel Streitfeld and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.",

Can \"numbers guy\" Ryan avoid the fiscal wonkery quicksand that sank Obama last week? Will Biden argue or avoid his ticket's differences with the Republicans on Social Security? Almost three decades apart, will the age gap between Ryan and Biden be a factor? Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate, will share the stage in Danville, Kentucky, in their only debate. Biden and Ryan\u2019s debate follows the top of the tickets\u2019 first of three debates last week, in which Obama turned in a lackluster performance, upstaged by an aggressive and vibrant Romney. Here are five things to watch for on Thursday night: 1. Will Biden go where Obama didn\u2019t? Biden is not shy on the campaign trail; the day after last week\u2019s first presidential debate, the vice president attacked Republican nominee Mitt Romney in a way that many Democrats had wished President Barack Obama would have done the night before. King: VP debate no game-changer, but could shift momentum How aggressive will Biden be in going after the man at the top of the GOP ticket rather than the man he\u2019ll share the debate stage with? Will Biden highlight the \u201c47%\u201d controversy, Bain Capital and Romney\u2019s tax returns? \u201cThe vice president likes laying out the contrast between the Romney-Ryan extreme agenda and the plans he and the president have to move this country forward and we fully expect that to continue Thursday night,\u201d an Obama campaign official told CNN. With the polls tightening both nationally and in key battleground states after last week\u2019s debate, the stakes for the showdown between the running mates have increased. 7 questions you would ask at the VP debate What to expect in the Biden-Ryan debate Advice from Palin? Ryan Says \"Sure\" Pressure on Biden and Ryan in debate \u201cBiden needs to play offense, not defense,\u201d said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala, who is a senior adviser for a pro-Obama super PAC. \u201cAttack the Romney-Ryan plan to cut taxes for the rich and raise them on the middle class. Dissect the Romney-Ryan plan to end Medicare as we know it. Point out that if Romney had been president, Osama bin Laden would be alive and GM would be dead. And be prepared to body-slam Ryan when \u2013 not if \u2013 he fibs.\u201d 2. The wonk trap Paul Ryan likes to call himself \u201ca numbers guy.\u201d Indeed, wonky budget talk is Ryan\u2019s calling card. It\u2019s the primary reason he has captured the hearts of conservative elites in Washington, who see him as the second coming of Jack Kemp. Ryan\u2019s debate prep as meticulous as he is But fiscal wonkery was quicksand for Obama during last week\u2019s debate. His dreary reliance on budget math over pointed political arguments contrasted sharply with Mitt Romney, who presented his ideas with vigor and clarity, despite obvious questions about the factual underpinnings of his ideas. Can Ryan avoid getting bogged down in the arithmetic that so thrills him? An adviser to the GOP vice presidential nominee told The National Review\u2019s Robert Costa this week that Ryan \u201cmay be over-preparing\u201d for his showdown with Biden. By some accounts, Ryan has bristled at platitude-driven demands of the campaign trail. He\u2019d rather be talking substance, on the road with a PowerPoint presentation about Medicare costs. The challenge for Ryan on Thursday, though, is to present the Romney vision to millions of voters without sounding too much like the Beltway think tank staffer he once was. He\u2019s done a solid job of that since Romney put him on the GOP ticket in August. Now, on the biggest stage of his career, he has to abandon some of the Capitol Hill tendencies that made him a star in the first place. Paul Ryan hasn\u2019t called Palin for advice 3. Will Biden put Social Security in play? In the House, Paul Ryan has backed moving Social Security funds to private investment accounts as a way to make the popular entitlement program more solvent. Ryan\u2019s past proposals would seem to tee up what\u2019s usually a winning political argument for Democrats: that the Republican ticket wants to gut Social Security to help their old pals on Wall Street. But to the bewilderment of Democratic strategists, Obama appeared to take the issue off the table in the first debate. \u201cI suspect that on Social Security, we\u2019ve got a somewhat similar position,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSocial Security is structurally sound. It\u2019s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Democratic Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill. But it is, the basic structure is sound.\u201d CNN Money: Social Security, Where Obama and Romney stand The Obama campaign scrambled to clarify last week that yes, in fact, the two candidates have fundamentally different views on Social Security. \u201cThe choice is clear: President Obama will never privatize Social Security or undermine retirement security for middle-class Americans,\u201d read a post on the Obama campaign website that went up after the debate. \u201cThe same cannot be said for Romney.\u201d Will Biden try to score fresh points by raising the issue of Social Security privatization against Ryan? Or did the president already holster one of his party\u2019s most effective political attacks? 4. The age gap \u201cI am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d So went Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous line in one of his 1984 debates against Democratic challenger Walter Mondale. Will Biden have a similar quip ready on Thursday? OK, Biden is not nearly as old as Reagan, who was 73 at the time of his re-election. But at 69, he has almost three decades on Ryan, his 42-year-old debate opponent. How Ryan sharpens debate skills Biden is also known for his exuberance and devilish charm, so perhaps the age gap won\u2019t be as apparent as it was in 2008, when 47-year-old Barack Obama shared a stage with 72-year-old John McCain. Or as it was in 1988, when 67-year-old Lloyd Bentsen debated his boyish vice presidential foe Dan Quayle. Stylistically, their birthdays might not matter much. But the age difference neatly crystallizes the arguments being presented by both campaigns. Will voters choose experience and decide to move forward on the path we\u2019re on? Or will they look to a pair of fresh-faced outsiders who offer a new direction? 5. Ryan\u2019s role as commander in chief Just as Mitt Romney needed to prove last week that he\u2019s acceptable to Americans to serve as president, Ryan needs to convey that he\u2019s ready to fill in as president in case something happens to Romney. It\u2019s one of the top tasks for the challenger\u2019s running mate in a vice presidential debate. We\u2019ll be keeping a close watch on Ryan to see if he touts his ability to step in, if needed, to the leading role. The Romney campaign is confident that the congressman from Wisconsin will pass the test, thanks to Ryan\u2019s position as House budget chairman and his mastery of complex fiscal issues. \u201cIt will come down to his competency on the issues, his command of the issues,\u201d a Romney campaign official told CNN. But Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos thinks that this time around, passing the competency test is not as important. \u201cThere is very little pressure for either of these vice presidential candidates to prove they are ready to step into the office of president. Both their bosses are relatively young and in great health,\u201d Castellanos said. Opinion: Biden must deliver for Team Obama What questions would you ask the VP candidates?

            "article_content": "Obama says he's seeking to restore \"the basic bargain\" that made America great Romney says the president \"just hasn't been able to do the job\" The campaigns disagree over whether Romney plan would send more jobs overseas Barack Obama and Mitt Romney resumed campaigning Monday, with both men focusing on the economy as key to their chances of winning the votes of Americans in November. Obama told supporters in Cincinnati that he entered office four years ago seeking to restore \u201cthe basic bargain that made America the greatest nation on Earth.\u201d He cited the idea that \u201cif you work hard, then you can get ahead; if you\u2019re responsible, then you can live out your dreams. You\u2019re not confined to the circumstances of your birth.\u201d Romney, meanwhile, said in a TV interview that \u201cin my opinion, the issue people care about is who can get the American economy going again to help people have a brighter future, with rising wages and more capacity to care for their kids and to know that their kids will get good jobs when they come out of school. \u201cThat\u2019s what this campaign is about,\u201d the presumptive GOP nominee said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d Obama said he entered office at a time that the American dream \u201cwas slipping away from too many people\u201d and that \u201cincomes and wages were flat-lining while the cost of everything \u2013 from college to health care to groceries to gas \u2013 were all going up.\u201d He said his goal has been to reclaim that dream, but that he recognized when he became president that \u201cit might take more than one term, maybe more than one president\u201d to do so. Speaking from New Hampshire, Romney focused on Obama\u2019s performance in office and found it wanting: \u201cThere are 23 million people that are out of work and (who have) stopped looking for work,\u201d he said. \u201cMedian income has dropped 10% over the last four years. The American people know whether things are better now than they were four years ago \u2026 he (Obama) just hasn\u2019t been able to do the job he told us he was going to try to do.\u201d But Obama sought to deflect the blame and appealed to his audience for support. \u201cThe problem is that we\u2019ve got a stalemate right now in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cThis election is about more than just two candidates or political parties. It\u2019s about two different visions about how do we build a strong economy. The good news is you\u2019re the tie-breaker. The choice is up to you.\u201d Sununu: Obama admin. 'a disaster' Clinton laughs about Romney Ad Obama: Romney will create jobs overseas Experts: Swift boat similarities in '12 Obama also cited a new report that estimates that Romney\u2019s support for eliminating U.S. taxes on American companies\u2019 foreign incomes would create an incentive for U.S. companies to move more of their jobs overseas. Gergen: Facts don\u2019t support Obama\u2019s claims \u201cWe have not found any serious economic study that says Governor Romney\u2019s economic plan would actually create jobs until today,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest, today we found out there\u2019s a new study out by nonpartisan economists that says Governor Romney\u2019s economic plan would, in fact, create 800,000 jobs. There\u2019s only one problem. The jobs wouldn\u2019t be in America.\u201d The Romney campaign quickly fired back. \u201cPresident Obama is at it again today with another dishonest attack meant to distract from his own record of failure,\u201d Romney campaign spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg told CNN. \u201cAfter spending three years pushing policies that drive jobs overseas and sending taxpayer money to foreign-owned companies, it\u2019s clear President Obama doesn\u2019t have a clue when it comes to job creation in America.\u201d The U.S. corporate tax rate is the highest in the industrial world, which hurts the ability of American businesses to compete globally and to create jobs in the United States, she said. \u201cMitt Romney has a comprehensive plan to reform the corporate tax code that will lower rates, get rid of incentives for firms to create jobs in other countries, and encourage the kind of economic growth President Obama has been unable to deliver,\u201d she added. The new back-and-forth came as both campaigns have repeatedly accused the opposing candidate of outsourcing U.S. jobs overseas. On another topic, Romney defended his release of his 2010 tax return and the promised release of his 2011 return as sufficient, despite calls from critics that he make public earlier returns. \u201cJohn McCain ran for president and released two years of tax returns,\u201d the former CEO of Bain Capital said of the 2008 GOP candidate. \u201cThe Obama people keep on wanting more and more and more, more things to pick through, more things for their opposition research to try to make a mountain out of and to distort and to be dishonest about.\u201d Frum: Romney\u2019s painfully bad week That stance is largely consistent with Romney\u2019s position during his 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor. Romney\u2019s Democratic rival that year, Shannon O\u2019Brien, released her tax information and called on Romney to do the same. Romney repeatedly declined. \u201cPeople who run for public office are exposed to extraordinary scrutiny, and that\u2019s as it should be, but there are some things that are not required for release, that are private, and I think my own income taxes, and my net worth and so forth are things I\u2019d like to keep between myself and my family,\u201d Romney said in May 2002, according to the Boston Herald. Portman: Obama using stale tactics Markell on Romney taxes:Get it out there Romney defends Bain departure date Romney veepstakes speculation heats up His longtime strategist Eric Fehrnstrom cited the family\u2019s \u201cprivacy\u201d and noted that state law did not require candidates to provide anything more than a financial disclosure form filed with the state Ethics Commission. On Sunday, Obama\u2019s senior campaign adviser David Axelrod told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d such limited disclosure only raised more questions about Romney\u2019s finances. \u201cI can only conclude, with all these Republicans asking him to release these returns, that whatever is in those returns would be more damaging to his campaign than simply not releasing them,\u201d Axelrod said. Some Republicans began pushing Romney to release tax information over the weekend, saying it would be politically savvy to release the information to avoid a drawn-out fight with Democrats. \u201cHe should release the tax returns tomorrow. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d conservative columnist Bill Kristol said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cYou gotta release six, eight, 10 years of back tax returns. Take the hit for a day or two.\u201d All of this, Romney said Monday, was a distraction from the real issues of the campaign. He said his own campaign was happy to compare itself with Obama\u2019s administration on transparency, citing the president\u2019s use of executive privilege to withhold documents related to the botched \u201cFast and Furious\u201d  program. \u201cThe administration has shown a serious departure from the transparency from which they suggested we had,\u201d Romney said. \u201cAnd the American people should be calling for that kind transparency.\u201d Families object to 9/11 Memorial\u2019s ban on politicians GOP Sen. Rob Portman defended Romney against Obama\u2019s \u201cpersonal\u201d attacks, saying the Democrat was focusing on Romney because his own record falls short. Portman, speaking in Lebanon, Ohio, was holding an event for Romney roughly two hours ahead of Obama\u2019s own campaign speech in nearby Cincinnati. \u201cHe\u2019s attacking Mitt Romney on a personal basis. Why? Because he doesn\u2019t want to talk about his record,\u201d the Republican from Ohio said. Portman is widely speculated to be a potential vice-presidential pick for Mitt Romney. Last week Portman said he met with Romney campaign staffers during three meetings while in Boston to headline a couple of fund-raisers for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But Portman, a former congressman and cabinet member in the George W. Bush administration, said the meetings were not at the Romney campaign headquarters, and had nothing to do with the vice presidential vetting process. On Monday, he refused to speculate on the vice presidential selection process, nor would he say whether Romney had made up his mind on his running mate. Portman added, \u201cPeople vote for the presidential candidate, not the vice president.\u201d Another potential vice presidential pick said Monday he had spoken with the Romney aides involved in the search. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota told The Hill that he had traveled to Boston to meet with Beth Myers, who is leading Romney\u2019s search for a vice presidential pick, along with other senior advisers at the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s headquarters. Thune would not say whether he was being formally vetted by Romney\u2019s team. Thune would provide geographic balance on a potential Republican ticket, though he would not offer a large degree of ideological disparity with the likely GOP nominee. Thune decided against making his own presidential bid in February 2011, but is considered a GOP hero for toppling incumbent Tom Daschle, then the top Democrat in the Senate, in 2004. Thune chairs the Senate Republican Conference, which controls the party\u2019s message in the Senate, and is often mentioned as a presidential contender down the road. Also Monday, Restore Our Future, the super PAC backing Romney, announced it had brought in $20 million in June. That marks a major jump from the prior month, when Restore Our Future reported bringing in $4.6 million. The spike was not a surprise, however, since the group received a $10 million donation from Nevada casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, in June. Also helping the group was the first donation from Foster Friess, a millionaire who backed the pro-Rick Santorum super PAC. He told CNN he gave a six-figure donation to Restore Our Future last month, though he refused to give the exact amount. Restore Our Future was active during the GOP primary, spending $38.9 million in the first three months of 2012. Much of its money went to campaign television commercials in support of Romney and critical of his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.",

            "article_content": "Ron Brownstein: Obama could see big losses among Reagan Democrats The initial reaction in the African-American community is mixed, a pastor says Obama's announcement gives an opening for Romney, a conservative leader says Jennifer Pizer: It's \"unlikely to still be much on voters' minds six months from now.\" In the political fallout of President Barack Obama\u2019s shift to support same-sex marriage, analysts say the move may signal a remarkable change in his campaign\u2019s re-election strategy, one that no longer courts the moderate part of his Democratic base. The president could see his steepest loss of support with more conservative Democrats or the so-called Reagan Democrats \u2014 those who are typically white, older and living in rural areas, said Ron Brownstein, CNN contributor and the National Journal\u2019s editorial director. Many of them also fall into key swing states, like North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Indiana. \u201cThis is an acknowledgment that those voters are largely gone, and the president and the Democrats have to respond to a different coalition: Younger voters. More socially liberal. White collar voters,\u201d Brownstein said. \u201cThis is a reflection of his understanding that that is now the coalition that is going to elect him and that he needs to respond to.\u201d Indeed, recent congressional shifts show this sector of the party to be thinning out. Also known as Blue Dog Democrats, the group\u2019s coalition dramatically lost numbers in Congress over the years. Same-sex marriage an election hot topic Romney's record on same-sex marriage Latinos' views on same-sex marriage Prior to 2010, there were 54 members in the House Blue Dog caucus. By the end of 2011, there were 25. Two more lost primary battles in Pennsylvania last month, raising questions as to whether the more moderate Democrats will be forced to swing further to the left this cycle. While Republican and Democratic lawmakers unleashed a flurry of statements following the president\u2019s comments Wednesday, many members of the Blue Dog Coalition remained relatively quiet. Another group of concern for Obama, political observers say, may be African-American evangelicals, a section within the base that traditionally comes down socially conservative on same-sex relationships. The group played a big role this week in voting for the North Carolina ballot initiative that places a constitutional ban on same-gender marriage. Carlton Pearson, an African-American pastor from Chicago and widely known supporter of LGBT rights, said he received a wave of phone calls and texts from pastors Wednesday after the president\u2019s interview, several of whom had mixed reactions to the news. \u201cMany don\u2019t support marriage, but they support the president,\u201d Pearson said Wednesday on CNN. \u201cOthers support both, because they realize that their congregations are filled with gender loving people and their staffs.\u201d Person added the community is \u201cconflicted,\u201d not necessarily because of Biblical reasons, but because of potential economic liabilities. \u201cA lot of preachers actually don\u2019t have a theological issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a business decision. They can\u2019t afford to lose their parishioners and their parsonages and salaries. They stay quiet.\u201d In the end, however, experts doubt this will become a big wedge issue for Obama and the black community, which turned out in droves for the then-Illinois senator in 2008. \u201cI think the African American community, even those who disagree with him, will still be there,\u201d said Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and senior adviser for a pro-Obama super PAC. Most political observers argue Obama\u2019s clarified stance will undoubtedly help shore up a major part of his liberal base that has largely felt alienated by his murky language on the issue over the years. Prior to his Wednesday announcement, Obama\u2019s official position was that he was \u201cevolving\u201d on the issue, having once opposed it. Given the even split among Americans on the topic, political strategists say the president had no choice but to walk a fine line. Marriage-equality activists say they hope the president\u2019s words will have a trailblazing effect, but recognize he\u2019s still limited \u2014 both politically and legally \u2014 in making a sizable impact on the movement. \u201cI don\u2019t expect him to be out there campaigning on this every day,\u201d Evan Wolfson, president of the advocacy group Freedom to Marry, said on CNN. \u201cBut I think the president\u2019s words will reverberate across kitchen tables across the country, in the hearts and minds of people who are wrestling with this.\u201d Obama\u2019s changed position may affect not only his own campaign, but his opponent\u2019s as well. Some Republicans argue it could be a political gift for presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor has struggled throughout the campaign to animate his conservative base, as his primary opponents consistently showered him with criticism of being too moderate. The president\u2019s announcement gave Romney a chance to forcefully reiterate his opposition to same-sex marriage, even articulating a stance further to the right of former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney. \u201cMy view is that marriage itself is a relationship between a man and a woman, and that\u2019s my own preference,\u201d he told reporters in Oklahoma. \u201cI know other people have differing views.\u201d In an interview earlier in the day, he said he supports domestic partnership benefits and hospital visitation rights for same-sex couples. However, in the past, Romney has expressed support for a federal amendment banning gay marriage and has said that he, unlike Obama, would stage a legal fight for the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Tony Perkins, president of the socially conservative Family Research Council, said this issue could be a key benchmark in Romney\u2019s quest to convince those on the far-right of his conservative credentials. \u201cThe president, I think, has handed to Mitt Romney the one missing piece in his campaign, and that is the intensity and motivation that Mitt Romney needs among social conservatives to win this election,\u201d Perkins said on CNN. \u201cAnd I think this could be the piece.\u201d Whether Obama will be damaged by accusations of \u201cflip-flopping\u201d on the issue remains to be seen. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really interesting to see how this plays out,\u201d said Frank Bruni, a consumer activist and the first openly gay New York Times\u2019 op-ed columnist. \u201cDoes it make Barack Obama a flip-flopper? A little bit of one. But you show me a politician that\u2019s not a flip-flopper.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t find the flip-flop stuff when we direct it at Mitt Romney to be the most compelling line of argument because I think politics is an arena of much flip-flopping.\u201d However, recent polling shows same-sex marriage to be low on voters\u2019 minds. According to a Pew Research Center survey released in April, only 28% of voters described it as a \u201cvery important issue\u201d this election year. Jennifer Pizer, legal director at The Williams Institute, which studies sexual orientation, law and public policy at UCLA, said she would be surprised if the issue comes into play this fall, despite its appearance on states\u2019 ballots and the president\u2019s changed position. \u201cI suspect the issue might have played some role in North Carolina, which will be contested,\u201d she told CNN in an e-mail. \u201cBut with the marriage vote having happened just now, it seems unlikely to still be much on voters\u2019 minds six months from now.\u201d While Obama\u2019s comments may fuel ongoing discussion among pundits and politicos, she said, she doubts voters will view the issue as a highly important one this fall. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of Americans already enjoy the right to marry the person they wish to marry, and are not directly affected by laws prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying,\u201d she said. \u201cThose laws just don\u2019t affect their families, let alone their jobs, their children\u2019s schools, or whether they are able to take loved ones to the doctor.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Rick Santorum says \"we might as well stay\" with Obama if Romney will be similar NEW: A \"disappointed\" Romney says any Republican would be better than Obama Sen. Jim DeMint, an influential conservative, suggests  other candidates bow out The Louisiana primary Saturday is the next contest in the Republican presidential race \u201cExcited\u201d after a meeting Thursday with Mitt Romney, tea party favorite Sen. Jim DeMint urged fellow Republicans to be realistic and rally around the party\u2019s eventual nominee, making his plea the same day the ex-governor\u2019s chief rival suggested voters would be as well off with President Barack Obama as they would Romney. In addition to fundraising events, Romney was in Washington to hold talks with DeMint as well as legislators from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which hold primaries next month. The legislators included House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, according to GOP aides. \u201cI\u2019m not only comfortable with Romney, I\u2019m excited about the possibility of him possibly being our nominee,\u201d said DeMint, a well known conservative, claiming he was impressed by Romney but stopping short of giving him a full endorsement. Adding that \u201cI just think we just need to look at where we are,\u201d DeMint strongly suggested that rival candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich should drop out to end the nomination fight and focus the party\u2019s efforts on defeating Obama in November. \u201cI just hope at some point they\u2019ll realize whether they can win or not,\u201d DeMint said of Romney\u2019s top opponents. \u201cIf they can\u2019t, the best thing they can probably do is to help the one who is going to win.\u201d Etch A Sketch shakes up GOP race Romney's Etch A Sketch headache Retracing the Etch A Sketch flap Santorum: What you see is what you get This apparent call for unity contrasted sharply with the message offered Thursday by Santorum, who has been Romney\u2019s foremost challenger in large part thanks to support from conservative voters. The former Pennsylvania senator said in a San Antonio speech that the only way for Republicans to win was \u201cby giving people the choice \u2026 not someone who is just going to be a little different than the person in there.\u201d \u201cIf we are going to be a little different, we might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk in what may be the Etch A Sketch candidate,\u201d Santorum said. He was referring to earlier comments from a top Romney adviser, Eric Fehrnstrom, who said his campaign will \u201chit a reset button\u201d to take on Obama in the fall if Romney wins the GOP nomination. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again.\u201d Romney quickly blasted Santorum\u2019s remarks, saying in a statement he was \u201cdisappointed to hear that Rick Santorum would rather have Barack Obama as president than a Republican.\u201d \u201cAny of the Republicans running would be better than President Obama and his record of failure,\u201d he added. In this swift retort, Romney was able to turn the tables on an opponent who, along with Gingrich, had sought to play up Fehnrstom\u2019s Etch A Sketch remarks for a second day. They said the adviser\u2019s remarks bring into question whether Romney will drop his conservative stances, some of which are different from others he\u2019d taken earlier in his career, in favor of more moderate positions ahead of the general election. On Wednesday, Santorum\u2019s campaign posted a photo on Twitter of the candidate using an Etch A Sketch, saying it showed him \u201cstudying up on (Romney\u2019s) policy positions.\u201d A website unveiled Thursday by the Gingrich campaign features the Fehrnstrom quote above an Etch A Sketch that highlights Romney\u2019s policy shifts when viewers hit a prompt labeled \u201cshake.\u201d Written on the drawing toy is \u201cMitt\u2019s Etch A Sketch Principles.\u201d \u201cYou have this over-and-over process where he\u2019s pro-choice and then he\u2019s not pro-choice; he\u2019s pro-gun control then he\u2019s an NRA member who hunts varmints,\u201d Gingrich said of Romney at a campaign event Thursday in Houma, Louisiana. \u201c\u2026 If you\u2019re serious about changing Washington, D.C., you can\u2019t use an Etch A Sketch. You can\u2019t have a child\u2019s toy for a president.\u201d On the Tea Party Nation website, blogger Judson Phillips wrote Thursday that the Etch A Sketch image \u201cis what conservatives have been warning about for months with Romney.\u201d \u201cHe is a liberal.  He has no core convictions and as soon as he becomes the nominee, he will move far to the left,\u201d Phillips continued. Romney, who scored the prized endorsement of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Wednesday, explained the Etch A Sketch remark by saying, \u201cOrganizationally, a general election campaign takes on a different profile.\u201d \u201cThe issues I am running on will be exactly the same,\u201d he said. \u201cI am running as a conservative Republican. I was a conservative Republican governor. I will be running as a conservative Republican nominee, at that point hopefully, for president. The policies and positions are the same.\u201d The caricature of Romney as a politically motivated flip-flopper extends far beyond the Republican campaign and right-wing blogosphere. In an interview broadcast Thursday on Public Radio International, Obama said Romney was \u201cpretending\u201d the health care plan he helped institute as governor of Massachusetts differed from the national plan that Democrats in Congress passed two years ago. Santorum and other conservatives have repeatedly attacked Romney over the Massachusetts health care plan, while Romney says he never called for implementing such a program at the federal level. Romney captures key Illinois areas to win Romney: I can get us out of this mess Gingrich: Santorum didn't mean it Santorum: We don't need a manager In the radio interview, Obama pointed to similarities between the two plans without mentioning the Republican front-runner by name. \u201cWe designed a program that actually previously had support of Republicans, including the person who may end up being the Republican standard bearer and is now pretending like he came up with something different,\u201d Obama said. This week\u2019s Illinois result gave Romney at least 41 of the 54 delegates at stake in the contest to face off with Obama, increasing his total to 562, according to CNN\u2019s estimate. Santorum is second with 249, Gingrich third with 137 and Texas Rep. Ron Paul last with 69. A total of 1,144 delegates is needed to clinch the GOP nomination. Santorum said he expects to do better in coming primaries and caucuses, including Louisiana on Saturday. The former senator has made a strong showing in traditionally conservative Southern states, winning Alabama and Mississippi a week ago while Romney finished third. \u201cThis is the last chance, in a sense, for the conservative area of the country to plant their flag, and we felt very good about what Alabama and Mississippi did,\u201d Santorum said in an interview Thursday with New Orleans radio station WWL. \u201cThey restarted this race again.\u201d Another Santorum victory in Louisiana would continue the pattern of the race, while a Romney win would signal growing support from the conservative base that he needs to finish off his rivals. Gingrich, who appears increasingly unlikely to mount another comeback after two previous campaign surges, said Thursday  he is used to fighting from behind. \u201cAlmost everywhere I\u2019ve campaigned, because of the way of the money, we start behind and then we gain ground,\u201d Gingrich told about 100 supporters in Lafayette, Louisiana.

At former Boehner family bar, sister shares lack of enthusiasm for GOP field Several patrons say they haven't made up mind on candidate in Tuesday's primary Rick Santorum's backers admit Mitt Romney has superior organization in state While divided over candidates, Republicans united to defeat President Obama At Andy\u2019s Caf\u00e9, Lynda Meineke says she speaks for a lot of people here \u2013 she\u2019s unenthusiastic about the Republican presidential candidates and disgusted with the way they\u2019ve run their campaigns. \u201cIt might just be a flip of a coin,\u201d she said with a bit of a sigh. Meineke is a typical Republican voter, but her family is anything but typical. Her full name is Linda Boehner Meineke. Her brother is House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cThere\u2019s too much bashing back and forth; they need to say something positive about what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d she said, as big television screens on either end of the bar blast one political ad after another. She is the last Boehner to work in this bar opened by their grandfather some 75 years ago. What's at stake on Super Tuesday? DeWine on Santorum appeals to average voter Tuesday could be super for Romney Santorum: Romney is weakest candidate The House speaker mopped floors and worked at the bar here years ago. If he came back in today, he would find a lot of Republicans uninspired by their options in the presidential race. At a table of a half-dozen voters having drinks on the eve of Tuesday\u2019s primary, all said they had not decided on a candidate. Up and down the bar, there was similar sentiment \u2013 a lot of shoulder shrugs and even some eye-rolling. The former Boehner family bar draws the kind of voter Rick Santorum is trying to lure \u2013 working-class conservatives. Santorum needs those voters to come out in big numbers here in Hamilton County, which is rock-solid Republican territory. At Beckett Park in West Chester over in Butler County, Santorum volunteers prepare to knock on doors, hand out literature and make a final push for their candidate. Cyndi Wilkerson, a mother of six, showed up in freezing cold weather with her three youngest children, including two toddlers. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important. I think this election is really about freedom and I think with the Obama administration we\u2019re seeing our freedom stripped away, and Rick Santorum is the best person to fight for American families,\u201d Wilkerson said. Out walking a neighborhood with Margaret Delfavreau, Wilkerson said she believes Santorum is the only one \u201cto defend and protect the Constitution.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the only one I\u2019m feeling this trust with,\u201d she said. These volunteers are last-minute helpers \u2013 driven by enthusiasm for Santorum. What Romney has going for him in southwest Ohio and all over the state is a tremendous organization. The former Massachusetts governor has chairmen in all 88 Ohio counties, local leaders working their friends and neighbors. Borger: Romney would love Tennessee win Team Romney out to seal the deal Romney out front in Ohio, survey says \u201cWe have a very strong organization here. We\u2019ve spent a number of weeks and months reaching out to supporters about why Gov. Romney is the strongest candidate to face (President Barack) Obama and why he supports tax cuts, pro-growth policy that will help get our economy moving again,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a Romney spokesman on the ground in Ohio. \u201cOur phone banks have been up and running every night. People in here reaching to people on Facebook, Twitter and other social-network media and tools,\u201d Williams said. Butler and Hamilton are adjacent counties, the epicenter for the Republican presidential race in this state. Hamilton includes the city of Cincinnati and its suburbs. Alex Triantafilou, the Republican chairman in Hamilton County, said the area is truly up for grabs. \u201cMy sense is it\u2019s going to be very close. I think that although Rick Santorum was doing well a week ago, we have also noticed a really strong organized effort by Gov. Romney,\u201d Triantafilou said. The Butler County GOP chairman supports Santorum but admits Romney has a much better organization in the state. \u201cI have to be candid. (Romney) has a better operation. But the energy that Santorum people have I witnessed it at rallies \u2013 it\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said Butler County Republican County Chairman Dave Kern. His wife, Katie Kern, is on the board of the local tea party and also backs Santorum. \u201cI like the fact that he is fiscally responsible, that he believes in smaller government,\u201d she said. But her friend Susan McLaughlin, another local tea party leader, said she\u2019s supporting Romney because of his business background. \u201cIf I look at the Constitution as our business plan and our business model, I want someone to sit down and analyze what we are doing. Probably it\u2019s the biggest business in the country. I want someone that brings that business sense to it,\u201d McLaughlin said. But sitting at a table at Willies \u2013 a restaurant owned by conservative radio host Bill Cunningham \u2013 Brian Ashenbaum voiced the same indifference with the GOP field overheard at Andy\u2019s Cafe. \u201cYou have to make a choice of who is likely to upset you the least. American politics comes down to the lesser of ones I don\u2019t like,\u201d said Ashenbaum , who made it clear that Obama is the one he likes the least \u2013 by far. In fact, back at Andy\u2019s in a sea of uninspired voters, one thing that got people\u2019s blood pumping was a strong desire to defeat Obama. At a table of four, three were for Santorum and one for Romney. But one thing Republicans unite around is deep dislike of the president. \u201cNo matter who it is, if they have a \u2018R\u2019 behind them, I\u2019m going to vote for them,\u201d said Al Babey, whose three friends all nodded in agreement.",

George W. Bush carried it twice; Obama won it in 2008 Maria Zepeda-Sanchez remembers the excitement of the \u201cchange\u201d argument in 2008. \u201cThere was really a change then,\u201d she said with a nostalgic smile. \u201cPeople were really anxious to have a new person.\u201d Working the phones for President Barack Obama again four years later, though, change has a new \u2013 and to her troubling \u2013 meaning. \u201cDifferent. It\u2019s a little different,\u201d she said of the then and now reaction when calling Latino voters in Colorado. \u201cIt was more hype I think back in 2008, yes.\u201d And now? \u201cSome people are still really excited,\u201d Zepeda-Sanchez said during a brief break from her phone bank work. \u201cOthers say, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know, well, I haven\u2019t made up my mind.\u2019\u201d Obama: 'The real Mitt Romney' Romney decries 'trickle down' government Then comes the sales pitch, and the new reality of incumbency \u2013 of 2012. \u201cWell you say, \u2018he has done this, and this,\u2019\u201d Zepeda-Sanchez told CNN. \u201cAnd they say, \u2018Well he promised a lot of things.\u2019\u201d Latinos made up 13% of the Colorado vote four years ago, and 61% voted for then-Sen. Obama as he turned Colorado blue after GOP presidential victories in 1996, 2000 and 2004. But this time, battleground Colorado is tougher territory. Not that Latinos have switched loyalties and plan to give significantly higher support to GOP nominee Mitt Romney compared to John McCain four years ago. The question is not will Obama dominate the Latino vote, it is whether Latino turnout will rival 2008 levels \u2013 here and in other key battlegrounds. Zepeda-Sanchez is a little worried. \u201cYes, yes, it is a little bit harder,\u201d she says of the then and now. \u201cSometimes some of them say, \u2018Well I don\u2019t know who to vote for - these two evils, you know.\u2019\u201d She is a battle-tested volunteer. And shrugs off the idea that this time around is more discouraging. \u201cYou go, \u2018You know, you voted for this person last time. Give him another chance. \u2026 He needs four more years to do what he needs to do.\u2019\u201d The best from the Denver debate Latino voters react to debate Are the candidates 'Hispandering?' As critical as Latino turnout is for Obama in Colorado, the intensity \u2013 and strength \u2013 of the evangelical vote is a pivotal piece of Romney\u2019s path to victory in the state. \u201cHe cannot win unless he wins convincingly among evangelicals,\u201d said Pastor Gino Geraci of the Cavalry South Denver Chapel in Littleton, a close-in Denver suburb. Math backs up that assessment; white evangelicals made up 23% of the Colorado electorate in 2008. \u201cThink about life, think about liberty, think about character and then cast your ballot,\u201d was part of Geraci\u2019s Sunday sermon at Calvary South Denver. Geraci steered clear of any mention of the candidates or political party from the pulpit, though in an interview he made it clear he will vote for Romney \u2013 but not without some hesitation. \u201cI was a little frustrated because he seems to have equivocated on the issue of life, and then he has come down quite dramatically on the issue of life,\u201d Geraci said at a suburban sanctuary that was once a supermarket. In talking to many of his 1,200 congregants, Geraci said the consistent complaint is unhappiness with both major presidential candidates. \u201cThe frustration of not wanting to vote for either,\u201d Geraci said. \u201cSo I feel my role is to encourage people to vote.\u201d Will they? Geraci said his conversations convince him the combination of economic and values concerns are going to motivate a high evangelical turnout \u2013 \u201ca far greater turnout\u201d than in 2008. Visits to the competing campaign headquarters and satellite offices provide instant proof of the urgent emphasis on turnout - the so-called ground game, including nudging less reliable voters to take advantage of Colorado\u2019s early voting window, which opens October 22. \u201cWe are, I believe, at ground zero in the presidential election,\u201d is the view of veteran Democratic strategist Michael Stratton. Heading into the final four weeks, Stratton said Colorado is again up for grabs \u2013 and a new University of Denver poll released this past weekend backs that up. In the survey, Obama received 47% support to 43% for Romney. Just shy of six in 10 Coloradans said the economy was the top issue, and they gave Romney a slight edge (50%-to 45%) when asked which candidate would do a better job on the economy. Poll: Obama slightly ahead in Colorado, Romney won debate \u201cBefore the concept of red and blue, before the concept of purple, you remember they called Colorado a ticket splitter state,\u201d Stratton said in a coffee shop interview across the street from his Denver office. Bill Clinton won Colorado in 1992, but lost it in 1996. George W. Bush carried it twice, but never with more than 52% of the vote. Then Obama returned Colorado to the blue column in 2008, winning rather comfortably with 54%. Since then, however, unemployment in the state has risen a bit, from 7.2% when Obama took office to 8.2% now. In the University of Denver poll, 23% of Coloradans said their personal economic situation had improved over the past year, 41% said it has stayed the same, and 36% said it was worse. In addition to evangelicals, Stratton said Romney can safely count on deep support from the state\u2019s Mormon voters - like Romney members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. \u201cIn some places, as you know, there are concerns about Mormonism,\u201d Stratton said. \u201cPeople here all know Mormons.  They are family people. You won\u2019t hear as in some parts of the country, \u2018who are these people? Are they some weird cult or something?\u2019 \u2026 The Mormon thing helps him here.\u201d The keys for the president, he said, are healthy turnout among Latinos and a heavy focus on suburban women. On that front, Stratton believes the GOP convention gave Democrats some help. \u201cSome of this regressive rhetoric about getting rid of Planned Parenthood or taking birth control out of a women\u2019s health plan - that is troublesome to voters,\u201d Stratton said. \u201cWomen are a larger majority of voters in Colorado than they are in a lot of states.\u201d Both campaigns said having Denver as the site of last week\u2019s first presidential debate helped bring extra enthusiasm to their state organizations. \u201cIt will be close here,\u201d Stratton said. \u201cIt will be close in Colorado regardless.\u201d More battleground coverage from CNN\u2019s John King: Revived auto industry gives Obama advantage in Michigan Iowa\u2019s six electoral votes could be decisive In Ohio, swing state politics have real-life impact African-American turnout critical for Obama in Pennsylvania",

            "article_content": "Nonpartisan nonprofit tracks events where politicians, special interests meet Group advocates for greater government transparency Writer's goal: Crash as many RNC, DNC parties as he can and blog about them Keenan Steiner makes his way along Charlotte\u2019s secured streets, struggling to put on his tie and manage his monogrammed backpack at the same time. The 27-year-old is on a mission: He\u2019s looking for a party. Not just any party. He works with the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that advocates for greater government transparency. His goal at the Democratic National Convention, as it was at the Republicans\u2019 confab in Tampa: to crash as many parties as he can, then blog about them. Since 2008, his organization\u2019s Political Party Time website has been tracking exclusive, behind-the-scenes events where politicians and special interests meet, often out of the spotlight. The groups hosting these events, Steiner says, hope to influence the outcome of the November elections \u2013 as well as lawmakers\u2019 votes in Congress and state capitols. By his count, there were at least 400 parties planned during the DNC and 200 during the Republican National Convention. \u201cAll the big players are at the conventions at once,\u201d he says, \u201cso it is sort of like being in the Washington party circuit on steroids.\u201d Tonight Steiner decides to stop by Planned Parenthood Political Action Fund\u2019s \u201cSex, Politics, and Cocktails\u201d party first. The organization has been under recent attack from Republicans in Congress who have repeatedly tried to shut off federal funding for the organization\u2019s family planning efforts. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the group\u2019s political arm and official host of the party, has spent nearly $2 million during this year\u2019s election cycle \u2013 most of it on negative ads against Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. While groups like Planned Parenthood Action Fund spend millions to elect Democrats, groups like Americans for Prosperity work to put Republicans in power. Steiner has an issue with the laws that regulate these types of groups, because they\u2019re not required to reveal the names of the donors who ultimately pay for those ads. \u201cThere is a real transparency issue here,\u201d Steiner says. Steiner says he tried but failed to get into the Americans for Prosperity party in Tampa. Here in Charlotte he doesn\u2019t have a ticket, but he sees a friend outside the Planned Parenthood party who helps. He says he can usually talk his way into events. At his friend\u2019s urging, security waves Steiner and his Sunlight Foundation colleague Liz Bartolomeo through. They even let them use the velvet-lined VIP line to bypass the crowd. Inside, smartly dressed older women sit in a line on comfortable couches, checking their email on smartphones. A man wearing an Obama ball cap orders a drink called \u201cSafe Sex Champagne\u201d for his girlfriend. He\u2019s having the \u201cObamatini.\u201d A woman clutching one of the \u201cWe love Michelle\u201d banners that had been handed out on the convention floor earlier in the evening keeps knocking it into people as she joyfully dances \u201cThe Electric Slide.\u201d The giveaways here are simple and, in some cases, intended to provoke a laugh. Condoms inside hot pink matchbook covers lay on low tables around the dance floor. The front of the package says \u201cProtect Yourself From Romney & Ryan in this Election.\u201d It\u2019s an advertisement for Planned Parenthood\u2019s Women Are Watching website. \u201cThis party seems like a way to drum up enthusiasm with the base,\u201d Steiner says, as he makes his way to the bar to talk with someone he knows. \u201cIt\u2019s not a party where you will rub shoulders with governors, and people aren\u2019t necessarily sowing the seeds for laws that will be written next year here like we\u2019ve seen at some of the super-elite parties, but it still is important,\u201d Steiner says. He pulls out a small Moleskine pad and takes notes as he talks to someone by the bar. The loud disco music suddenly fades away, and the emcee tells the excited crowd that two special guests have arrived. The floor goes wild as actress Ashley Judd stands in front of a hot pink \u201cSex, Politics\u201d banner with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at her side. \u201cThe Democrats have clearly decided their work for women is a winning issue for them, and Pelosi is a rock star among the Democratic base,\u201d Steiner says. \u201cHomocon\u201d during the conventions Pelosi talks about the Democrats\u2019 support for women\u2019s issues \u2013 among the convention themes earlier that evening \u2013 then encourages the crowd to support the president. After Pelosi wraps up her speech, she does a little dance as the \u201970s hit \u201cCelebration\u201d plays her loudly off the stage. She poses for photos with Planned Parenthood Political Action Fund leaders and other VIPs. People start to dance again. Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who was in Charlotte to observe the convention, says parties such as this energize the base on particular issues. They are also mutually beneficial to the people who attend. \u201cSome will show up to these parties for nice swag or good food or to show their support for a particular political message, sure,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also aimed at the fledging county commission candidate who shows up at the convention. \u201cThe fact that Pelosi is there gives them a chance to take a picture with her and then tweet it out or put it on their Facebook page. It gives them a certain type of credibility. It makes them look important, and they\u2019ll remember an organization that made this happen.\u201d Steiner says there were several splashy events at the RNC. Though fewer in number than at the DNC, the parties were equally high profile. At the Florida Aquarium, scantily clad women dressed as mermaids floated in a tank as guests at the Distilled Spirits Council party ordered drinks from multiple bars. In \u201cA Salute to the House and Senate Energy and Commerce Committees,\u201d attendees could shag balls and take batting practice at Tropicana Field for a charitable donation. A $15,000 donation got people into a private reception with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, courtesy of the Foundation for Florida\u2019s Future. It\u2019s midnight back in Charlotte before Steiner and Bartolomeo head out past streams of other party-hoppers and make their way to a swank hotel near the convention center. The lobby has a different feel than the Planned Parenthood party. Well-dressed guests sit at a tiny table by the bar with a couple bottles of expensive Veuve Clicquot champagne. Sen. John Kerry stands in the corner having a hushed but animated conversation with two equally tall men. And more people carrying \u201cWe love Michelle\u201d signs, now somewhat crushed, make their way toward the elevator. On the hotel\u2019s second floor is \u201cCome Together: A Late Night Celebration\u201d honoring the National Black Caucus of State Legislators. Steiner doesn\u2019t have an invitation here either, but he blends into the crowd to make his way into the fancy ballroom. The event invitations advertise the party\u2019s sponsors. Steiner says he noticed their names on a giant screen next to the dance floor. Waste Management, Amerigroup, Maximus and VS2 were among the hosts. Gillespie says some people may be uncomfortable with the role corporations play behind the scenes at such events, but she thinks they are necessary. \u201cTaking corporate funding for them is a double-edged sword since you do need someone to pay for it,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to use public funds for a party. \u201cThat type of corporate sponsorship may suggest they have more influence than others with politicians, and some may take issue with it, but groups don\u2019t have the money to do this on their own and they want to attract the right people to their events. \u201cPeople won\u2019t show up if the party is boring.\u201d Men with lapel pins identifying them as state legislators or congressmen make their way into the party. Bartolomeo points out others wearing special pins she says are given to big Obama donors. Steiner ignores the live band playing James Brown\u2019s \u201cSex Machine\u201d and forgoes the red, white and blue macaroons. Instead, he talks to people and takes notes. \u201cThis is more a top-flight party than Planned Parenthood\u2019s, as the guest list is more exclusive and the food, drink and space itself is some of the most expensive I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Steiner explains later. He speaks with a county commissioner running for Congress and her husband, a lawyer at McGuireWoods \u2013 another of the evening\u2019s sponsors. The party, he says, \u201cis about building relationships with people in business and the government.\u201d Craig Holman is a political ethics expert whose nonpartisan nonprofit, Public Citizen, has teamed up with Steiner\u2019s organization in the party monitoring enterprise at the convention. He worries these parties play an outsized role at conventions. \u201cThese conventions are supposed to be merely \u2026 events to rally for these candidates,\u201d Holman says. \u201cBut the lobbyists and special interest groups are indulging in a real habit of turning these conventions instead into lobby-fests.\u201d Gillespie has a different perspective. \u201cThe conventions are really professional conferences,\u201d she said, \u201cand like most trade associations, networking is a big part of what you are doing here.\u201d \u201cYes, the delegates are here to nominate their candidate, but behind the scenes you have a lot of local candidates trying to make connections, meet potential fundraisers and backers. That may be more important to them than the activities you see on TV.  It\u2019s hard to develop a profile for yourself and a reputation if you don\u2019t know anyone.\u201d It\u2019s past 1 a.m. when Steiner leaves the party and heads off to another. He hears the actor and hip-hop artist Common is performing at a party within driving distance. He\u2019d prefer not to stay out too late if possible; he\u2019s learned that a certain Super PAC is hosting a brunch at an undisclosed location in the morning. It\u2019s supposed to be at a mansion, but he doesn\u2019t know which one. At least not yet. Puppet protesters pull no punches",

            "article_content": "To date, Gov. Scott Walker has raised 7\u00bd times that of Democrat, Tom Barrett Watchdog group expects final recall tally to be $70 million-$80 million Some 70% of Walker's donations in last month came from outside Wisconsin Outside groups backing both candidates flooded state with some $25 million Millions of phone calls have been made. Thousands of yard signs are posted on Badger State lawns. Television ads blanket the Wisconsin airwaves. All of this frenetic activity in Tuesday\u2019s gubernatorial recall in Wisconsin comes at an unprecedented price tag: Upward of $63 million, and that doesn\u2019t take into account money raised the last three weeks that hasn\u2019t been registered yet. \u201cWhen we come up with a final tally for this race, it\u2019s going to be in the $70 (million) to $80 million range,\u201d predicted Mike McCabe, who runs Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonpartisan campaign watchdog group. Walker\u2019s fate comes down to ground game The money raised in the recall already shatters Wisconsin\u2019s record of $37 million, set just 18 months ago when Republican Gov. Scott Walker was first elected. It\u2019s a mind-blowing amount of money, especially for a state as small and inexpensive politically as Wisconsin. Recall vote is judgment day for Wisconsin governor The roots of Wisconsin's recall election Wisconsin's 'Total Recall' gets ugly Politics gone wild in Wisconsin Dry run for November? Wisconsin teachers duel over recall \u201cThis is way out of proportion to a state this size,\u201d said McCabe, sitting in his Madison office surrounded by workers entering a continuous stream of fund-raising data onto his group\u2019s website. What\u2019s also out of proportion: Walker has raised 7\u00bd times that of his Democratic challenger, Tom Barrett. To date, Barrett has raised just under $4 million. Walker has pulled in $30.5 million. That wide disparity can be attributed in part to a quirk in the election law. Public officials in Wisconsin who are targeted for a recall are allowed to raised unlimited sums of money until the recall is formally set. In Walker\u2019s case, that was March. So a lot of rich Republicans, seeing the Wisconsin recall battle as a preview of the presidential race, wrote Walker huge checks. What\u2019s at stake in Wisconsin? Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks gave Walker more than $500,000. Texan Bob Perry, who bankrolled the infamous 2004 \u201cSwift Boat\u201d attacks against John Kerry, also contributed half of $1 million directly to Walker. Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and Michigan millionaire Dick DeVos each donated $250,000. In fact, 70% of Walker\u2019s donations in the last month came from outside Wisconsin \u2013 hundreds of thousands of contributors large and small from all over the country. Phil Prange has raised money for Wisconsin Republicans for 25 years. He said when former GOP Gov. Tommy Thompson was on the ballot in 2000, he had 50,000 people on his donor list. \u201cIt was actually controversial,\u201d Prange said. Walker\u2019s list of at least 250,000 dwarfs that one. Prange remembers potential donors laughing at him when he tried to raise money from out of state for a Wisconsin political campaign. \u201cAnything over $100 was a hard ask. Now apparently you can ask for a million dollars and get it in the same moment, which is amazing,\u201d Prange said. He said he knew things were different with the recall when he went to a party in Chicago several months ago and met people from Arizona, Florida, Texas and Massachusetts who had already contributed to help Walker beat back the recall. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Prange recalled. Individual contributions only tell part of the story of big bucks in Wisconsin\u2019s recall. Outside groups supporting both candidates flooded the state with some $25 million. They look like a who\u2019s who of Washington special interests \u2014 from Planned Parenthood to the National Rifle Association. When the dollars are tallied up in this category, Democratic outside groups supporting Barrett will have outspent those backing Walker. Labor unions, which have an enormous stake in the recall since the backlash against Walker began when he all but did away with collective bargaining rights for public employees, have given $8 million in traceable donations to help Barrett. It\u2019s likely unions have given much more to Democratic groups not required to disclose their donors. Opinion: Fix, don\u2019t destroy, public worker unions The Republican Governors Association is another big contributor \u2013 at least $9 million, including $1 million from GOP high roller David Koch. These groups register and advertise with names that appear to be homegrown. We are Wisconsin is organized and funded mostly by national unions in Washington. Right Direction Wisconsin is really an arm of the Republican Governors Association. Then there are the stealth super PACS whose donors are anonymous. They have given $8.5 million. The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign lists eight such groups on its website. Most, such as Americans for Prosperity and the Club for Growth, are groups on the right trying to help Walker. One, Greater Wisconsin Committee, is trying to help push Walker out. Again, the donors are anonymous. \u201cElections are being poisoned here, but the people of Wisconsin can\u2019t know who is paying for most of the poison,\u201d McCabe said. The irony is that despite the tens of millions raised and spent on the recall election, it is an open question whether it will make a real difference. Wisconsin\u2019s electorate is so polarized, that public and party polls suggest most people\u2019s minds are already made up. What both parties agree on, however, is that the extra campaign cash does help where it matters most: identifying voters and making sure they get to the polls on Election Day.",

            "article_content": "Among women, Obama holds 18-point lead over Mitt Romney in battleground states President has a 15-point advantage among women over Rick Santorum Controversy over birth control coverage, focus on social issues could be behind gap Top Republicans say gap will disappear once divisive GOP primary ends Even Mitt Romney admits that he\u2019s got his work cut out for him to reach out to female voters as he transitions from the Republican presidential nomination battle to what will most likely be his general election matchup against President Barack Obama. \u201cWe have work, we have work to do, to make sure we take our message to the women of America, so they understand how we\u2019re going to get good jobs and we\u2019re going to have a bright economic future for them and for their kids, and make sure that these distortions that the Democrats throw in are clarified and the truth is heard,\u201d Romney said Sunday in Middleton, Wisconsin. As of now, when it comes to female voters, the numbers don\u2019t add up very well for the former Massachusetts governor or for the GOP. A USA Today/Gallup poll of 12 possible battleground states (which will be contested in November) indicates that the president holds a 9-point lead over Romney, 51%-42%. Break the numbers down to genders, and it\u2019s basically all tied up among men, but among women, Obama holds an 18-point lead, 54%-36%. According to the survey, released Sunday, the president has a slightly smaller but still large 15-point advantage among women over former Sen. Rick Santorum, Romney\u2019s main rival for the GOP nomination. Speculation on Romney running mate Obama campaigns against GOP 'madness' Battle over birth control Karen Santorum on contraception Other polls also point to a gender gap: A CNN/ORC International survey released last week indicated Obama leading Romney nationwide among registered voters by 11 points, 54%-43%, up from a 5-point advantage in February. Among women, the president\u2019s lead grows to a 60%-37% margin. And according to the poll, Romney had a negative 34%-48% favorable rating among female voters, while Obama enjoyed a positive 58%-41% favorable rating among women. The CNN poll also indicated that it wasn\u2019t just the candidates affected by the gender gap. Women had a positive view of the Democratic Party by a 54%-40% margin while they held a negative view of the Republican Party by a  59%-34% margin. Are female voters turning away from the GOP? From the controversy over the birth-control exemption from health care coverage to Rush Limbaugh\u2019s controversial comments about a Georgetown University student who testified to Congress about the contraception exemption, it appears the Republican Party \u2013 and the Romney campaign \u2013 has a harder sell to make to women. \u201cTry as Romney has to stay out of some the Republican missteps, some of this has been guilt by association,\u201d CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley said. \u201cHis fellow Republicans, including Santorum, have said and done some things that have turned off female voters. \u201cBut Democrats have also milked the issue. The so-called war on women has resonance, and the Democrats appear to be winning the spin war. Their accusations that Republican are declaring a war on women has clearly seeped into the political groundwater and has hurt Romney,\u201d added Crowley, anchor of CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Top Democrats argue that what they call Romney\u2019s run to the right to try to appeal to conservatives in the GOP primaries and caucuses, including the candidate\u2019s pledge to curtail government funding towards Planned Parenthood, is hurting him with women, and they\u2019ve worked hard the past few months to leverage the gap. But the Romney campaign and other top Republicans say the gap will disappear once the divisive GOP primary battle ends. Romney\u2019s wife, Ann, has become more prominent on the campaign trail the past couple of months. On Sunday in Wisconsin, the candidate touted that Ann is \u201cgoing across the country and talking with women, and what they\u2019re talking about is the debt that we\u2019re leaving the next generation and the failure of this economy to put people back to work.\u201d The gender gap is not new. \u201cPollsters first noticed the gender gap in the 1980 election between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, and it has been a constant in American politics since then,\u201d CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. \u201cIn presidential elections, the percent of women voting for the Democrat has usually been 7 to 9 points higher than the percent of men voting for the Democrat. In 2008, for example, 49% of men voted for Barack Obama compared to 56% of women.\u201d \u201cIn terms of elections,\u201d Crowley said, \u201cRepublicans have been south of the Democrats when it comes to the women\u2019s vote for quite some time. If you look at George Bush in 2000 and 2004, he was down among women, but he made up for it by winning the male vote. So Republicans have to overperform with men to make up for the female gap. But if you are down by 15 to 20% among women, it\u2019s hard to overcome.\u201d All the more reason you\u2019ll probably see plenty of Ann Romney, and first lady Michelle Obama, on the campaign trail this summer and fall.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Newt Gingrich says the GOP race has been like \"a roller coaster\" You can trust that Romney won't tell the truth about his record, says Santorum The ex-senator leads nationally by 6 percentage points, a new poll finds He and Romney are focusing on Michigan, which polls show is neck-and-neck Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum spent Friday trading barbs and stumping for votes in Michigan, where polls show the two candidates in a virtual tie four days before what has emerged as a critical contest. A Romney loss in his childhood home state would undermine the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s claim to front-runner status and throw the GOP race into turmoil.  A Santorum win would clearly establish the former Pennsylvania senator as the main conservative challenger to Romney heading into the March 6 Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses. Top Romney adviser Stuart Stevens promised a Michigan win for his candidate after Wednesday night\u2019s CNN-sponsored debate. Newt Gingrich \u2013 who appears to have all but bypassed the February 28 Michigan and Arizona primaries \u2013 spent Friday wrapping up a trip to Washington state, which holds its caucuses on March 3. Ron Paul had no public events on Friday, but will spend the weekend stumping for votes in Michigan. While Romney and his well-financed allies are presumed to be outspending Santorum in Michigan, Santorum\u2019s campaign released a new television ad Friday slamming Romney for allegedly favoring the interests of Wall Street over those of Detroit. \u201cHe supported the Wall Street bailouts, while turning his back on Michigan workers,\u201d the narrator in the ad says. \u201cBut Rick Santorum\u2019s made in the U.S.A. plan changes everything. It cuts taxes for Michigan manufacturers to zero, so we can bring back American jobs from overseas.\u201d Romney\u2019s team dismissed the ad, saying Santorum\u2019s campaign is \u201clashing out with desperate and false attacks in order to prop up his sinking campaign.\u201d The former senator claimed in an interview Friday with CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger that it was Romney who was guilty of \u201cattacking (him) falsely.\u201d \u201cWhat you can trust is that (Romney) is not going to tell you the truth about his record, and he\u2019s going to try to distort somebody else\u2019s record for him to suggest that he is more conservative than me and more reliable,\u201d said Santorum, before attending evening events in the Michigan communities of Walled Lake and Lincoln Park. Santorum also hit back against criticism during Wednesday night\u2019s debate that he voted for former President George W. Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind education reform plan despite supposed ideological objections to the measure. \u201cIt was against the principles I believed in, but you know when you\u2019re part of the team, sometimes you take one for the team, for the leader, and I made a mistake,\u201d Santorum said at the time. \u201cYou know, politics is a team sport \u2026 Sometimes you\u2019ve got to rally together and do something.\u201d Romney said Thursday that he wondered \u201cwhich team (Santorum) was taking it for.\u201d \u201cMy team is the American people, not the insiders in Washington, and I\u2019ll fight for the people of America, not special interests,\u201d the former governor said. Asked by CNN on Friday what team that Romney is playing for, Santorum said, \u201cWell, I would say that\u2019s the left. I would say that\u2019s the problem with Gov. Romney in this election.\u201d Romney\u2019s campaign vehemently objected to claims made in a Santorum statement issued on Friday \u2013 alleging that the then governor \u201cpassed socialized medicine that included $50 dollar abortions, bragged about not lining up with the NRA-appointed liberal activist judges to the Massachusetts bench, and was hanging out at Planned Parenthood events.\u201d Meanwhile, Romney went to several cities in Michigan, where he grew up and where his father once served as governor. He discussed his plan to lower marginal tax rates for individuals by 20% in a speech at Detroit\u2019s Ford Field, then headed about 25 miles northeast to hobnob with diners at a Mount Clemens restaurant called The Mitt. In the evening, he held a town hall event in Kalamazoo. It\u2019s all part of the effort to win the Great Lakes State\u2019s hotly contested primary. An American Research Group poll released Thursday shows 38% of likely Michigan GOP primary voters backing Santorum, and 34% supporting Romney \u2013 right on the edge of the survey\u2019s margin of error of 4 percentage points. The poll was conducted before Wednesday\u2019s debate. Nationally, a Gallup Daily Tracking Poll released Friday suggested that Santorum had backing from 33% of registered Republicans, followed by Romney with 27% support. That 6-percentage point polling advantage represents a drop from the 10-point lead Santorum had Tuesday. The phone survey of 1,187 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents was conducted between February 19 and February 23, and has a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. In the same poll, Gingrich\u2019s backing stood at 16% and Paul\u2019s was at 11%. The former House speaker, in an interview Friday with CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan, aimed his fire primarily at President Barack Obama \u2013 for the government\u2019s apology for the burning of Qurans at a military base in Afghanistan, the federal bailout of automakers General Motors and Chrysler and the administration\u2019s energy policies, among other issues. As to his own campaign\u2019s strategy, Gingrich said he is focused on the 10 contests slated for March 6, or Super Tuesday, over the upcoming ones in Arizona and Michigan. He pointed out how many contenders have soared and fallen since the GOP race began, suggesting that more surprises could be in store. \u201cIf you think this race looks wild from your side, you ought to be with us,\u201d he said. \u201c(His wife) Callista and I feel like we\u2019ve been on a roller coaster \u2013 sort of like Space Mountain in Disney where it\u2019s all dark and you don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve been, where you\u2019re going, or where you are.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alan Silverleib and Gabriella Schwarz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Religious freedom is the underlying issue, Texas attorney general says The issue has become a political flashpoint in a presidential election year The lawsuit accuses the government of violating the First Amendment The Obama administration adjusted its policy in an attempt at compromise Seven states on Thursday filed a lawsuit  against the federal government requirement that religious employers offer health insurance coverage that includes contraceptives and other birth control services. The issue has become a political flashpoint in a presidential election year, and the lawsuit by attorneys general from Nebraska, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Florida and Texas was certain to keep it prominent. Private plaintiffs joining the seven states included Pius X Catholic High School, Catholic Social Services, Catholic Mutual Relief Society of America and private citizens Stacy Molai and Sister Mary Catherine. The 25-page lawsuit named the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius; the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner; and the U.S. Department of  Labor and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis as defendants. Democrats hear contraception witness Romney defends contraception stance It alleges a violation of the First Amendment and of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, saying that the requirement for employees at church-affiliated institutions such as hospitals to receive health coverage for contraceptives and other birth control services contravened constitutionally protected religious freedom. \u201cGovernment has no business forcing religious institutions and individuals to violate their sincerely held beliefs,\u201d Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThis lawsuit is about protecting religious liberty and the rights of conscience, our most basic freedoms as Americans.\u201d Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said the government rule under the health care reform law passed in 2010 \u201ccompels people of faith to act contrary to their convictions.\u201d \u201cThe very first amendment to our Constitution was intended to protect against this sort of government intrusion into our religious convictions,\u201d Abbott said. Abbott and Bondi are Republicans. Officials from the White House and the Department of Justice had no comment on the pending litigation. However, it is not the first court challenge to the Obama administration\u2019s new mandate on contraceptive coverage. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty has filed a series of lawsuits, arguing that even the revised polices on contraception access would constitute a violation of their clients\u2019 faith. Last week, the Justice Department urged judges to stay out of the controversy until a compromise can be worked out. At issue is whether religious institutions should be exempt from mandated employee coverage for birth control and other reproductive care. The administration announced a proposed compromise in the dispute earlier this month. Under its new plan, religiously affiliated universities and hospitals would not be forced to offer contraception coverage to their employees. Insurers will be required, however, to offer complete coverage for free to women who work at such institutions. In announcing the proposed compromise, Obama said \u201cno woman\u2019s health should depend on who she is or where she works or how much money she makes.\u201d He added that \u201cthe principle of religious liberty\u201d was also at stake, and \u201cas a citizen and as a Christian, I cherish this right.\u201d Female employees at churches themselves will have no guarantee of any contraception coverage \u2013 a continuation of current law. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops denounced Obama\u2019s compromise soon after the president\u2019s announcement, saying the proposal raises \u201cserious moral concerns,\u201d according to a statement posted on its website. Half of all Americans polled say they oppose the Obama administration\u2019s new policy, according to a CNN/ORC International survey. The final version of the contraception requirement goes into effect next January. The administration said that under a safe harbor provision, no group can be forced to provide birth control at least until year\u2019s end.

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama joins former President Clinton onstage, formally nominated for re-election A source says Obama wanted changes to the party platform Obama's concluding speech on Thursday night will be moved indoors because of weather Other convention speakers on Wednesday include consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren President Barack Obama offers a better path forward for the country that will promote united values rather than the winner-takes-all mentality of Republicans, former President Bill Clinton told the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night. In a highly anticipated speech before Obama was formally nominated for re-election, Clinton framed the November vote as a choice of what kind of country Americans want. \u201cIf you want a winner-take-all, you\u2019re-on-your-own society, you should support the Republican ticket,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIf you want a country of shared prosperity and shared responsibility \u2013 a we\u2019re-all-in-this-together society \u2013 you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\u201d Excerpts: Clinton\u2019s remarks at Democratic National Convention The packed Times Warner Cable Arena erupted in cheers when Obama made his first appearance at the convention by joining Clinton onstage at the end, and the two most recent Democratic presidents embraced and stood arm-in-arm waving to the crowd. Analysts called the speech vintage Clinton, blending an expert\u2019s command of figures and details with a down-home touch of language and emotion that made him one of the best communicators and politicians of his era. \u201cIf Barack Obama gets re-elected, I think tonight will be a good reason why,\u201d said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos, adding that Clinton gave a Democrats \u201ca master class\u201d on moving to the political center. In the 48-minute speech that ran well over its planned time, Clinton responded to the attack line by Republican nominee Mitt Romney that Obama\u2019s policies made things worse for Americans already confronting economic hardship four years ago. Noting the economic crises Obama inherited upon taking office in January 2009, Clinton declared to raucous cheers: \u201cNo president \u2013 not me, not any of my predecessors \u2013 no one could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years.\u201d He noted that \u201ca lot of Americans are still angry and frustrated by this economy\u201d and had yet to feel any benefits from a sluggish recovery under Obama. \u201cI had the same thing happen in 1994 and early \u201995,\u201d Clinton said, drawing a parallel between his experience and Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cWe could see it was working, that the economy was growing, but people just couldn\u2019t see it yet.\u201d Referring to last week\u2019s GOP convention, Clinton said that \u201cin Tampa, the Republican argument against the president\u2019s re-election was actually pretty simple, pretty snappy. It went something like this: \u2018We left him a total mess, he hasn\u2019t finished cleaning it up yet, so fire him and put us back in.\u2019\u201d \u201cI like the argument for President Obama\u2019s re-election a lot better,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe inherited a deeply damaged economy, put a floor under the crash, began the long hard road to recovery, and laid the foundation for a more modern, more well balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs, vibrant new businesses, and lots of new wealth for the innovators.\u201d Democratic economic policies have proven successful in the past, Clinton said, noting that Democratic administrations created 42 million jobs in their 24 years in power since 1961, compared to 24 million by GOP administrations in the other 28 years. \u201cIt turns out advancing equal opportunity and economic empowerment is both morally right and economically sound,\u201d Clinton continued. Alluding to the rough primary campaign in 2008 when Obama defeated Clinton\u2019s wife, Hillary, for the Democratic nomination, the former president said Obama showed his willingness to work with anyone by appointing her as his secretary of state and also including Republicans in his Cabinet as secretaries of defense and transportation. Clinton also listed Obama\u2019s achievements, focusing in particular on the 2010 health care reform law that he said has lowered health care costs and provided benefits for consumers such as allowing parents to keep children up to age 26 on family policies and preventing insurers from denying coverage for children due to pre-existing conditions. \u201cWe\u2019re better off because President Obama fought for health care reform,\u201d Clinton declared, \u201cYou bet we are.\u201d At the same time, Clinton criticized Republican proposals to overhaul the Medicare and Medicaid government health care programs for senior citizens, the poor and disabled. \u201cIf that happens, I don\u2019t know what those families are going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d Clinton also derided Republican deficit reduction plans, saying \u201cthe numbers don\u2019t add up\u201d because of planned tax cuts without any new revenue sources. The result will be widespread spending cuts that hurt \u201cthe middle class\u201d and other vulnerable segments of society. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever forget when you hear them talking about this that Republican economic policy quadrupled the debt in the 12 years before I  took office and doubled the debt in the eight years after I left because it defied arithmetic,\u201d he said. The Clinton speech concluded a day of some self-inflicted wounds for Democrats. First, campaign organizers announced they were moving Obama\u2019s address concluding the convention Thursday from an outdoor stadium to the smaller Time Warner Cable Arena because of possible thunderstorms. Later, the Wednesday session started with some dissension when delegates approved a change in the party platform to reinstate language recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The original platform approved on Tuesday omitted that reference, which had been part of the 2008 platform, and Republicans quickly criticized it as a snub to Israel. Another change restored the word \u201cGod\u201d to the platform after the 2012 version omitted it, though it included language on faith as part of American society. The language referring to God-given rights was the same as in the 2008 platform. DNC kicks off with big speeches Watch Bill Clinton's full DNC speech Obama: Presidency reveals who you are Watch Michelle Obama's full speech Julian Castro jabs Romney on health care It took three voice votes, with supporters and opponents of the changes strongly expressing their preference, before a clearly flummoxed Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa declared himself satisfied that a two-thirds majority backed the new language despite groans of dissatisfaction from some delegates. The delegates burst into applause minutes later when Olympic gold medalist Gabby Douglas led them in the Pledge of Allegiance. A senior Democratic source told CNN that Obama intervened to change the platform language, saying the president \u201cdidn\u2019t want there to be any confusion about his unshakeable commitment to the security of \u2026 Israel.\u201d In addition, Democratic sources said Obama also asked aloud why the word \u201cGod\u201d had been dropped. Convention floor chaos: Democrats alter platform, disagree CNN political contributor Paul Begala, who has served in Democratic administrations, called the platform flap \u201cembarrassing, stupid\u201d and \u201can unforced error by my party.\u201d Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary in the George W. Bush administration who also is a CNN contributor, said the issue reflected a split among Democrats over support for Israel. \u201cThe platform is being amended to maintain consistency with the personal views expressed by the president and in the Democratic Party platform in 2008,\u201d said a statement by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who heads the Democratic National Committee. \u201cJerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.\u201d Other Democratic leaders clearly wanted to put the flap behind them. \u201cWe repaired this platform. It shouldn\u2019t be an issue anymore,\u201d said Rep. Steve Israel of New York told CNN, conceding: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place.\u201d On the venue change for Thursday\u2019s speech, Obama campaign officials said they were disappointed but called it a public safety issue. They are encouraging those scheduled to attend at the stadium to instead organize block parties in their neighborhoods. Despite the change, campaign officials were enthusiastic about how the convention began Tuesday, with one senior official calling the program that featured powerful and at times emotional speeches by first lady Michelle Obama and others a \u201cfantastic, high energy night.\u201d CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen agreed that the opening night couldn\u2019t have gone much better, adding: \u201cIf they have two more nights like this, they could possibly break this race open.\u201d After the platform imbroglio Wednesday, though, Gergen noted Democrats started the session \u201cwith a stumble.\u201d Cheering delegates heard plentiful criticism of Romney as Democrats responded to last week\u2019s GOP convention, which sought to frame the November vote as a referendum on Obama\u2019s presidency amid high unemployment, sluggish economic growth and mounting federal deficits and debt. Romney kept up the attack Wednesday, telling reporters that the nation\u2019s $16 trillion debt level reached this week and an increase in food stamp recipients during Obama\u2019s presidency showed the failure of his policies. \u201cThere is just no way to square those numbers with the idea that America is doing better, because it\u2019s not,\u201d Romney said during a break from debate preparations in New Hampshire. Patrick: We need to grow a backbone DNC: Vet reflects on losing her legs 'If Romney was Santa, he'd fire reindeer' CNN Reality Check: 4.5M jobs created? Facing a tight race and unrelenting GOP attacks that Obama has made things worse while in office,  Democratic organizers planned a convention that emphasizes the tough decisions the president has made so far and the additional steps needed to bolster the middle class. Speeches on Tuesday and Wednesday lambasted Romney and Republicans, accusing them of being out of touch and politically divisive at a time requiring national unity. Seeking to further strengthen Obama\u2019s advantage with women, Hispanic Americans and young voters, the Democratic speakers hailed the president for promoting health care reforms, supporting gay marriage and ending deportations of some young illegal immigrants. \u201cDemocrats trust the judgment of women.  We reject the Republican assault on women\u2019s reproductive health,\u201d said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. \u201cIt\u2019s just plain wrong. When you go to the polls, vote for women\u2019s rights. Vote for President Obama.\u201d Elizabeth Warren, the consumer advocate running for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts, complained that people today \u201cfeel like the system is rigged against them.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re right, the system is rigged,\u201d Warren said to cheers, adding that Obama was fighting to \u201clevel that playing field.\u201d Sister Simone Campbell, a Catholic nun challenging the Republican budget proposal by Romney\u2019s running mate, conservative House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, said the austere plan would harm the work being done to alleviate suffering by the sick and impoverished. She called the Ryan plan an \u201cimmoral budget \u2026 that does not reflect our nation\u2019s values.\u201d Another speaker told how he lost his job in 1994 at the Ampad paper plant taken over by Romney\u2019s private equity firm, Bain Capital. \u201cI don\u2019t think Mitt Romney is a bad man. I don\u2019t fault him for the fact some companies win,\u201d Randy Johnson said. \u201cWhat I fault him for is making money without a moral compass. I fault him for putting profits before people like me. But that\u2019s just Romney economics. \u2026 Mitt Romney will stick it to working people. Barack Obama is sticking up for working people. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d First lady seeks to reignite flame for president On Tuesday, Michelle Obama offered a personal perspective on why her husband should be re-elected, telling the convention that the same values she fell in love with guide him each day in the White House. \u201cIn the end, for Barack, these issues aren\u2019t political, they\u2019re personal,\u201d she said. \u201cBarack knows the American dream because he\u2019s lived it, and he wants everyone, everyone in this country to have the same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we\u2019re from, or what we look like, or who we love.\u201d Five things we learned from Day 1 Earlier, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel recalled the litany of crises that greeted the Obama administration when it assumed office in January 2009: a Wall Street meltdown, economic recession, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a collapsing auto industry. \u201cEach crisis was so deep, and so dangerous, any one of them would have defined another presidency,\u201d said Emanuel, who was Obama\u2019s chief of staff at the time. \u201cWe faced a once-in-a-generation moment in American history, and fortunately, we have a once-in-a-generation president.\u201d On Wednesday, Emanuel said he was giving up his role in Obama\u2019s campaign to focus on fund-raising in the face of the advantage gained so far by Romney and Republicans, including super-PACs supporting him. The Romney campaign said no amount of rhetoric could mask what spokeswoman Andrea Saul called Obama\u2019s \u201crecord of disappointment and failure.\u201d \u201cOn the first night of President Obama\u2019s convention, not a single speaker uttered the words \u2018Americans are better off than they were four years ago,\u2019\u201d Saul said in a statement, adding that \u201cthe American people will hold President Obama accountable for his record.\u201d Fact Check: About those 4.5 million jobs \u2026 Romney\u2019s campaign is focused on the question of whether Obama has made life better for Americans, arguing that continued economic woes show that White House policies have failed to deliver a recovery from the recession that began during the previous Republican administration. The \u201care you better off\u201d strategy was famously employed in 1980 by Ronald Reagan, who asked voters that question when running against the incumbent Carter at a time of national economic woes. Reagan went on to win, and the Romney campaign has repeatedly invoked his name this year while seeking to link Obama and Carter as failed leaders The Romney campaign continued that strategy Wednesday with an appearance by Ryan in Iowa. \u201cWe are going to hear a lot of things in Charlotte, but we are not going to hear a convincing argument that we are better off than we were four years ago,\u201d he told supporters in Adel. Rising star in Democratic Party first Latino to deliver keynote address The back-and-forth between the campaigns is part of their struggle to define the election in the minds of voters. Republicans want it to be about Obama\u2019s presidency, while Democrats seek a choice between differing political ideologies on the size and role of government. In particular, Republicans seek to shrink the size of government and end chronic federal deficits and rising national debt through reducing spending, reforming entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and slashing taxes on businesses and many individuals as a spur for economic growth. Obama and Democrats argue that a deficit reduction plan also needs additional revenue, and they propose allowing tax rates on income of more than $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals to return to the higher levels of the 1990s. Republicans oppose any kind of tax increase, and the impasse over that issue has been the main impediment to a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement during Obama\u2019s first term. The race overall is very tight, with a new poll Tuesday showing Romney received little bounce from last week\u2019s convention intended to introduce him to voters just now turning their attention to the presidential race. The CNN/ORC International Poll also indicates that less than 40% of registered voters said the GOP convention made them more likely to vote for Romney. At the same time, Romney got a slight bump in his favorable rating, and on being in touch with the middle class and women, although he still trails Obama on those two questions. CNN\u2019s previous poll, released as the Republican convention got under way, indicated that 49% of likely voters backed Obama, with 47% supporting Romney, a statistical tie. In the new survey, which was conducted after the GOP convention, both the president and Romney are at 48%. DNC secret guests revealed \u201cThe Republican convention had at best a mild effect on the presidential race, and from a statistical viewpoint, no effect at all,\u201d said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Speaker lineups show both parties want female vote CNN\u2019s Jessica Yellin, Dana Bash, Ashley Killough, Kevin Liptak, Sarah Aarthun, Halimah Abdullah, Paul Steinhauser, Adam Aigner-Treworgy and Peter Hamby contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican Party's platform is against same-sex marriage Log Cabin Republicans invited to take part in convention for first time Some GOP groups that support LGBT community emphasize other issues A man hurrying to catch the light at a corner in muggy downtown Tampa carries a book with a rainbow of color on its cover. Its title stands out, especially here, where the Republican National Convention has officially accepted a platform that a New York Times editorial called \u201cmore aggressive in its opposition to women\u2019s reproductive rights and to gay rights than any in memory.\u201d The book is \u201cA Fundamental Freedom: Why Republicans, Conservatives, and Libertarians Should Support Gay Rights.\u201d Unconventional: Postcards from Tampa Ted McCormac is a precinct committee person for the GOP in Bradenton, Florida, and the father of a gay son. He picked up the book at a brunch co-hosted by the Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry and the Log Cabin Republicans \u2013 two of a small number of visible LGBT-supportive Republican groups at this year\u2019s convention. Republican convention: The best photos Individual members of the Log Cabin Republicans have attended previous conventions, but this year marks a first for the group: It was invited by the Republican National Convention committee to participate in the convention itself. In addition, there are many high-profile, gay-themed events this year, including the brunch McCormac attended. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to an event of theirs, but people clearly went out of their way to be nice to me,\u201d McCormac said, with a catch in his voice.  \u201cIt means so much since I\u2019m kind of new at this.\u201d Social issues and the GOP In fact, Sarah Longwell, a Log Cabin board member and one of the speakers at the brunch, began her speech by talking about McCormac. She said she teared up when she met McCormac there and he told her how proud he and his wife are of their son, Tony. Tony McCormac is getting married to Jeff Cook, who was also there working on behalf of American Unity, a political action committee that supports Republican candidates who are gay friendly. Cook is so involved in Republican politics that they\u2019ve scheduled their ceremony In New York after the November election. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is all about \u2013 events where we can talk to Republicans about why marriage matters for our community, conservative to conservative,\u201d Longwell said. Longwell\u2019s own engagement is so new she still stumbles a little when she describes Karen Bencala as her \u201cfiancee.\u201d But her message about why conservatives should back same-sex marriage comes through loud and clear.  She shared it Wednesday with all the Republicans gathered for the convention in the form of a full-page ad in the Tampa Tribune, paid for by the Log Cabin and Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry. The ad shows several photos of same-sex couples smiling under a quote from Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a Christian right think tank that is far from gay friendly. In his argument that successfully added anti-same sex marriage language to the party\u2019s platform, Perkins said, \u201cThe institution of marriage is the foundation of civil society.  Its success as an institution will determine our success as a nation.\u201d Longwell\u2019s ad goes on to say the LGBT Republican groups agree with Perkins, which is why the government should stop denying marriage licenses to gay couples. \u201cThe freedom to marry is directly in line with the core ideals and principles of the Republican Party \u2013 less government, more individual freedom, personal responsibility and the importance of freedom,\u201d it argues. \u201cWhat I want to ask Tony Perkins if I see him here is, \u2018If you believe marriage is the very foundation of society, why would you deny us this right?\u2019 \u201d Longwell said. \u201cI honestly believe it\u2019s cruel to deny us this. If you believe we are real people, that is.\u201d As she finishes speaking, Longwell recognizes a man from the Family Research Council riding an escalator into the carefully secured convention center and wonders whether she could catch up with him. Until this year, Longwell may not have had the credentials to follow him into those secured areas, at least not as a Log Cabin Republican.  One of the Log Cabin\u2019s former directors says this is the first year the RNC has credentialed the group and saved rooms for its members in official hotel space. Bob Kabel says the evolution of the roles that openly gay people play at the convention \u2013 and in the party itself \u2013 has been remarkable.  Kabel was the chairman of the Log Cabin Republicans from 1993 to 1999. He went on to be elected the first openly gay person in the nation to chair a state Republican Party, in the District of Columbia.  Early on, he says, he felt forced to stand up at a public meeting and shame the Republican National Convention chair into an official meeting with Log Cabin. \u201cThe current RNC leadership has been much better. They\u2019ve been great,\u201d Kabel said. \u201cWe feel so much more welcome, and the voices of the Tony Perkinses in the party will be drowned out as more young people come into the party. This is not a negative issue for young people in our party.  And we are more visible than ever.\u201d Proof of his statement was visible Tuesday at a GOProud dance party called  \u201cHomocon,\u201d where many young gay and straight convention danced in the shadow of buff go-go dancers wearing the LGBT group\u2019s \u201cfreedom is fabulous\u201d T-shirts. At the door on the way out of the event, attendees received a convention collector\u2019s item \u2013 a keychain with the GOProud logo. Late into the evening, GOProud co-founder Jimmy LaSalvia hushed the dancing crowd for a moment. He described how proud he was that his was the first gay GOP group to endorse this Republican presidential ticket \u2013 even if he personally disagreed with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan\u2019s stance against same-sex marriage.  To him, the gay community is so mainstream within the party that GOProud shouldn\u2019t solely be about gay issues. \u201cAs most of you know, I support civil marriage for gay couples,\u201d LaSalvia said, which drew a smattering of supportive shouts from the crowd.  \u201cAnd marriage is important.
