            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Since July 2015, Michelle Nunn has been president and CEO of CARE USA, a humanitarian organization that fights global poverty and provides lifesaving assistance in emergencies. David Gergen is a CNN senior political analyst and professor of public leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School, where he founded the Center for Public Leadership. Both are members of New Politics\u2019 newly formed Leadership Council, a national, bipartisan organization that aims to recruit, develop and elect servant leaders. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. As a sense of mounting crises spreads and the 2020 election heats up, many Americans are asking: where can we find leaders who can guide us through these storms? The answer, we believe, is in the same places where we have found them since the beginnings of the country: among talented young people who have already shown a dedication to serving others outside of politics. There must be a push, then, to recruit these committed public servants into politics at all levels and to prepare them for the rigors of elected leadership. Think about the leaders who helped to forge our republic. Washington, Abigail and John Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton \u2013 each of them knew the power of service from their own experiences building a new country. Or think, too, of the young men and women who, steeled by service in World War II, gave back their uniforms after the war and took up new mantles to build and serve the country at home. Their years fighting for freedom and protecting the country prepared them to become our \u201cGreatest Generation.\u201d They helped build the Marshall Plan, desegregated the Armed Services, founded the Peace Corps and constructed the conditions for peace and economic growth. Dems recruit female veterans to run for office In our own day, we once again have a growing community of talented, aspiring young men and women who are exploring politics as their next step in serving America. Many wore military uniforms in Iraq and Afghanistan. Others come from peace-time services in AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps. All of them can bring needed unity and a country-first attitude that can rebuild trust in our politics and revitalize our democracy. We know, too, that the leaders of the future may well look different from the leaders of previous generations. Our collective past does not reflect the strength that will come of a future political system reinvigorated with people of diverse backgrounds, reflecting the rich tapestry of America. That is why a growing number of us who see the promise of today\u2019s servant leaders are coming together to form an advisory board and provide support for an organization called New Politics, which focuses on bringing leaders with service experience into public office. The idea that drives New Politics is to prepare candidates, both Republican and Democratic who have already spent time serving in the military or national service such as AmeriCorps, to serve the country by running for office, by advising and training them on everything from leadership development to political strategy and the personal challenges of campaigns. Voters are hungry for candidates who have already shown their commitment to the common good and who are eager to advocate for their needs and priorities, and this sort of preparation is invaluable to fulfilling that wish. Why Nancy Pelosi is good for America We have both spent our lives at the intersection of service and politics. David has served as an officer in the US Navy, as an adviser to four US presidents, and as a teacher to some of our nation\u2019s brightest aspiring public servants. Michelle has spent her career leading some of our nation\u2019s foremost national service and nonprofit organizations, such as Thousand Points of Light and CARE USA, and ran for the US Senate herself. We\u2019ve seen the best of our nation\u2019s politics and its worst, and we know what real leadership looks like, in and out of politics. It\u2019s not a coincidence that as the number of leaders who have served before entering politics has fallen, our government\u2019s effectiveness and trustworthiness have, too. There\u2019s something powerful and unique about service\u2019s ability to shape a leader. As Dr. King said, \u201cEveryone can be great, because anyone can serve.\u201d What\u2019s in it for those who seek out public service? There\u2019s power in the common bonds you build \u2013 with people of every race and religion, political persuasion and socioeconomic background; in the common mission you serve \u2013 where you learn that no matter your differences, your futures are inextricable and dependent on your ability to meet the challenge together.  We need political leaders who understand the consequences of leadership \u2013 how the decisions you and your teammates make can have meaningful, sometimes life-or-death effects \u2013 whether on the battlefield or in the Congress. Our politics would work a lot better if more political \u201cleaders\u201d brought that kind of servant leadership to government \u2013 and you can count us as two Americans who are hopeful that such leaders are out there and ready to spring to action. We invite you to join a new generation of leaders forged in service to help guide our country through the tough times, together.",

            "article_content": "Hundreds of thousands of people took the streets of Puerto Rico to bring down Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3. A texting scandal involving Rossell\u00f3 sparked nearly two weeks of massive anti-government protests in the US territory after years of alleged corruption, a debt crisis and Hurricane Maria. Here are the events that led to his resignation: July 10 Two former Puerto Rico officials, the island\u2019s education secretary and the head of the health insurance administration, were arrested on corruption charges. They were accused of directing millions of dollars in government contracts to politically connected contractors. July 11 After the arrests, the governor returned home from a previously scheduled family vacation outside the US territory and a few messages from a private Telegram chat with his inner circle were leaked.  He apologized for referring to a former New York official with an expletive in those messages. \u201cI want to apologize for the expressions that I wrote in a private chat,\u201d Rossell\u00f3 told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m the governor of Puerto Rico but I\u2019m also a human being with my failures and my virtues.\u201d July 13 The Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for Investigative Journalism published nearly 900 pages of derisive and offensive private chat messages between Rossell\u00f3 and members of his inner circle. The exchanges from the messaging app Telegram ridiculed numerous politicians, journalists and celebrities in a scandal many called \u201cRickyLeaks,\u201d after the governor\u2019s nickname. The messages were sent in December 2018 and January 2019. Two Cabinet members who were part of the chats, Puerto Rico\u2019s former chief fiscal officer Sobrino Vega and Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin, resigned. July 14 Protests began to grow outside Rossell\u00f3\u2019s official residence, known as La Fortaleza, following the release of the leaked texts. The protesters called for Rossell\u00f3 to resign. July 15 Police fired tear gas into crowds of protesters calling for his ouster. July 16 Rossell\u00f3 announced he would not step down. In a news conference, he also defended the actions of police and accused protestors of unleashing tear gas and setting fires during demonstrations the night before. \u201cI will continue my work and my responsibility to the people of Puerto Rico,\u201d the governor told reporters. July 17 Puerto Rico\u2019s Justice Department issued summonses for everyone involved in the private chat group with Rossell\u00f3. Latin trap artist Bad Bunny left his European tour and joined protests in San Juan. Ricky Martin, rappers Residente and iLe also marched with hundreds of people from Puerto Rico\u2019s Capitol building to the governor\u2019s mansion. Bad Bunny, Residente and iLe released a protest anthem, \u201cAfilando los Cuchillos\u201d (\u201cSharpening The Knives\u201d) on YouTube.  \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also is mentioned in the chats, attends a parallel protest in New York City. Once again, officers used tear gas to push protesters back during an intense standoff in front of the governor\u2019s mansion. July 18 Rossell\u00f3 tweeted a statement saying he respects the people\u2019s right to protest and their actions have \u201cnot gone unnoticed.\u201d He also asked the Puerto Rican people for forgiveness. July 19 The president of Puerto Rico\u2019s House of Representatives, Carlos \u201cJohnny\u201d M\u00e9ndez, created a special committee to advise him on whether the governor committed impeachable offenses based on the leaked messages. July 21 Rossell\u00f3 announced he will not run for re-election in 2020 and resigned from his role as president of the New Progressive Party. \u201cA huge portion of the population is unhappy and I recognize it,\u201d Rossell\u00f3 said on Facebook Live. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you, I love the island and people. \u2026 Today I have the responsibility to direct my strengths to try to find alternatives so that with God we may be able to move forward.\u201d July 22 Hundreds of thousands of people shut down a major highway in San Juan and and launched an island-wide strike demanding Rossell\u00f3\u2019s resignation. Protests were ongoing for about a week but demonstrators said they were not going to rest until Rossell\u00f3 left office. They spanned many generations and political leanings. They said they were not backing up because they\u2019ve endured political corruption, high poverty rates, crushing debt and a painful recovery since Hurricane Maria struck in 2017. July 23 Rossell\u00f3\u2019s chief of staff submitted his resignation, effective July 31, according to a letter obtained by CNN. Reports saying the governor was planning  to resign by the following day started circulating. July 24 An energetic crowd awaiting the governor\u2019s anticipated announcement filled the streets outside the governor\u2019s mansion waving flags and banners throughout the day. Near midnight, Rossell\u00f3 announced his resignation \u2013 effective August 2 \u2013  in a recorded message posted on social media. The governor is two and a half years into his four-year term. July 28 Puerto Rico\u2019s Secretary of Justice Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced said on Twitter she does not want to be the US territory\u2019s next governor. \u201cI have no interest in occupying the position of Governor,\u201d V\u00e1zquez said on Twitter. According to Puerto Rico\u2019s order of succession, the secretary of state should be next in line after the governor. But the man holding that position, Luis G. Rivera Mar\u00edn resigned July 13. As a result, V\u00e1zquez was next in line. But many Puerto Ricans are wary of her because she\u2019s an ally of  Rossell\u00f3.",

            "article_content": "Andrew Johnson faced overwhelming opposition in the House and the Senate, and he stood in the way of a Reconstruction that would have done more to help former slaves. But he was still able, just barely, to survive a Senate impeachment trial. Johnson was a Southerner and a Democrat, but he stayed on the Union side during the Civil War, and that helped him secure a place running alongside Republican President Abraham Lincoln in 1864, when Lincoln was reaching out to Democrats who had stayed loyal to the Union. Why was Bill Clinton impeached? It also helped Johnson, who became President after Lincoln\u2019s assassination, stay in office when so-called \u201cRadical Republicans\u201d in the House impeached him for being too soft on the South \u2013 because seven moderate Republicans in the Senate switched sides to save him. Unlike President Donald Trump, who faces a hostile House but has a Senate majority on his side, Johnson was a Democrat running the country when most of the Democrats had been kicked out of Washington altogether. His party held a minority in both chambers of Congress, and the odds were stacked against him. Yet seven senators abandoned their party and voted for his narrow acquittal to let Johnson finish out his term. He was ultimately succeeded by Northern Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. You can read histories of the Johnson impeachment at the House and Senate websites, but here are the key details. In 1864, Lincoln was all about healing. His second inaugural address ends with words meant to bind a splintered nation together: \u201cWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation\u2019s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\u201d A month and a half later, Lincoln, the Republican, was dead at the hand of an assassin and Johnson, his Democratic vice president, was in charge. At the time, nobody in Washington was living up to the unifying goal of Lincoln\u2019s speech. Johnson took a softer view of Reconstruction than the holdovers from Lincoln\u2019s Cabinet he kept in the government. Southern states had not yet earned back their seats in Congress. And the so-called \u201cRadical Republicans,\u201d who wanted Reconstruction to do more to help former slaves and to punish the South, wanted more from their President. So they clashed. How Trump's impeachment stacks up, in four charts The partisan divide in Washington then was so epic that Johnson still has more veto overrides \u2013 15 \u2013 than any other President, ever. One of the laws for which his veto was overridden was the Tenure of Office Act, by which the Republican-controlled Congress put a new check on his power and made it impossible to fire a Cabinet official without their OK. Johnson ignored the law to fire Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who was more in line with the punitive Radical Republicans. But the tenure law was essentially an impeachment trap. After Johnson ignored the new check, the House impeached him and Johnson was headed toward a conviction in the Senate. The odds in the Senate were stacked against Johnson. He was a Democrat, remember. Back then, there were just 47 Democrats in the House, compared with 173 Republicans. Impeaching him on 11 articles was no problem, since impeachment requires just a simple majority in the House and the vote against him was along party lines. In the Senate, the odds were even worse: There were 57 Republicans, compared with just nine Democrats. The attorney general at the time, Henry Stanberry, quit his day job to represent the President full time \u2013 something that Trump\u2019s attorney general has not signaled plans to do. Stanberry helped lead a defense that centered on raising questions about Johnson\u2019s intent in violating the Tenure of Office Act and whether the offenses were actually criminal. Both of those arguments feel incredibly pertinent today, as Republicans defend Trump\u2019s actions in very similar ways. Johnson\u2019s Senate trial, which was a sensational and crowded affair, went on for months. Seven Republican senators split from the rest of their party and voted against removing Johnson from office. They became known as the \u201cRecusant Republicans,\u201d and offset the \u201cRadical Republicans,\u201d who most opposed Johnson and were pushing a stricter Reconstruction. Sen. Edmund Ross of Kansas is generally considered to have cast the deciding vote to acquit Johnson. There are some allegations that Ross may have essentially been bribed or he didn\u2019t want to elevate Benjamin Wade, the ranking senator at the time, to the Presidency. Johnson, who as vice president succeeded to the White House after Lincoln\u2019s death, had no vice president of his own. Ross got the hero treatment from John F. Kennedy in his book \u201cProfiles in Courage.\u201d His vote helped preserve the modern, powerful presidency. The Supreme Court said in 1926 that the Tenure of Office Act was unconstitutional. But Johnson\u2019s Presidential career was over after he was impeached, because he lost the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for the 1868 election, and Democrats lost the White House to Grant. The Union survived both Civil War and Johnson\u2019s impeachment and emerged with a strong executive. Johnson ultimately won back his old Senate seat from Tennessee, and a place in the history books. While Kennedy called the decision to vote to acquit Johnson a \u201cprofile in courage,\u201d the larger narrative of Johnson\u2019s presidency is not a good one. He made it easier for Southern states to reenter the Union and pardoned the Vice President of the Confederacy, perhaps helping to sew the nation back together but doing little to address the plight of African Americans in the South. He was a racist who opposed the Emancipation Proclamation and blocked efforts to help Southern blacks find their footing post-slavery. \u201cHe utterly failed to make a satisfying and just peace because of his racist views, his gross incompetence in federal office, and his incredible miscalculation of public support for his policies,\u201d wrote Elizabeth Varon, a history professor at the University of Virginia. He \u201ctried to preempt and then undermine Congressional Reconstruction by deeming the Republican experiment in black citizenship a failure, and by portraying former Confederates as victims of Republican misrule.\u201d It was also an unhappy decision for the seven Republicans who voted to acquit him. They might have saved the powerful executive system, but they lost their jobs. None were reelected to the Senate and they faced personal repercussions as well. According to a Senate history, Ross was ostracized and his family fell into poverty when they returned to Kansas.

            "article_content": "Andrew Yang may have been born online. But his presidential candidacy is coming of age in real life. Yang\u2019s once quixotic bid to be president \u2013 one during which even the businessman\u2019s family and friends asked \u201cpresident of what?\u201d when he told them of his aspirations \u2013 is now a full-fledged campaign, propelled by a devout following of liberal Democrats, libertarians and some disaffected Republicans who believe his unique policy positions are the perfect antidote to President Donald Trump. That following, known affectionately as the \u201cYang Gang\u201d (and individual members as \u201cYangsters\u201d), has the businessman polling better than most of the field. In the clearest sign of his momentum in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary, Yang announced on Wednesday that he had raised $10 million in the third quarter of 2019, a haul that dwarfs the $2.8 million he raised from April to June this year. Yang, with his non-political background and free-wheeling style, is a unique political figure. But what makes him truly singular in the Democratic field are his rallies, which appear more like concerts than political gatherings. The stage may be devoid of instruments, but Yang\u2019s stump speech has become so familiar to his devoted following that many in the audience are acutely aware with the ebbs and flows of his remarks and come prepared for their political idol to play the hits. Any mention of \u201cMATH\u201d \u2013 a pseudo rallying cry for the Yang faithful that means \u201cMake America Think Harder\u201d \u2013 elicits prolonged chants. When Yang mentions using PowerPoint during his hypothetical State of the Union, the audience chants the name of the Microsoft software. And so many questions are in the speech that members of the audience gauge their knowledge of the candidate by how quickly and easily they can shout answers back at him. 'It hurts': Yang brings own experience to bigoted comments by new 'SNL' member Shane Gillis \u201cWhen was the last time,\u201d Yang asked here in Cambridge, \u201cthat America\u2019s life expectancy declined for three years in a row?\u201d The audience, a diverse but predominantly male gathering, swelled and shouted back \u201cSpanish flu, Spanish flu, Spanish flu,\u201d chanting the name of the 100 year-old pandemic. A smiling Yang continued: \u201cThe Spanish flu of 1918 a hundred years ago. We are back in Spanish flu territory because of suicides and drug overdoses.\u201d It\u2019s an odd scene, but give-and-takes like this play out regularly throughout Yang\u2019s standard stump speech, making him \u2013 at times \u2013 feel more like a traveling musician than a political candidate. \u201cIt lets me know that they are hardcore Yang Gang enthusiasts, that they know the message, that they brought friends, that they might\u2019ve seen me speak before in some venue and they\u2019re back again, which means that there\u2019s something very powerful drawing us together,\u201d Yang told CNN during an interview in Philadelphia before a rally. \u201cThere is an element of feeling a little bit like a traveling troubadour.\u201d Yang, like a musician who knows their audiences would rather hear the hits, added: \u201cThey expect certain things.\u201d Tom McCormick, a 39-year-old who watched Yang from the front row of the businessman\u2019s Philadelphia rally, echoed the musician sentiment. \u201cHe\u2019s basically one of those little indie bands that no one knew about and played in a garage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now he is starting to get a little more mainstream. \u2026 I am just happy other people are finally catching on.\u201d Yang, the son of immigrants from Taiwan who was born in Schenectady, New York, in 1975, is the product of some of the nation\u2019s elite schools: Phillip Exeter for high school, Brown University for his undergraduate degree and Columbia Law School for his law degree. He wasn\u2019t deeply into politics as a student, but he ran to lead three different student organizations during his time in school. All three tries were unsuccessful. \u201cI\u2019m something like 0 for 3,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to be one for four. \u2026 The one big one will be president of the United States.\u201d Yang briefly worked for a law firm in New York City after graduating from Columbia, but he was quickly pulled toward the world of startups in the early 2000s. He was the vice president of a health care start up from 2002 to 2005 before he became managing director \u2013 and then CEO \u2013 of the test-prep company Manhattan Prep. After the company was bought in 2009, Yang started Venture for America, a non-profit that connects recent college graduates with start-ups. It was that experience that raised Yang\u2019s profile in Washington; in 2015, President Barack Obama named Yang an ambassador for global entrepreneurship. In photos: Presidential candidate Andrew Yang Yang, inspired by the federal government\u2019s lack of a response to automation, may have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for president on November 6, 2017, but it wasn\u2019t until February 12, 2019, when Yang sat down for an almost two-hour long podcast with stand-up comedian and TV personality Joe Rogan, that his campaign gained a national following. The podcast has been viewed more than 4 million times on YouTube and, more often than not, Yang rally attendees trace their knowledge of the businessman to it. A Yang aide said it was \u201cabsolute chaos\u201d after Yang sat down with Rogan, with support flooding into a campaign that wasn\u2019t ready to handle the influx. \u201cThere was before Joe Rogan and after Joe Rogan,\u201d Yang recalled. It\u2019s hard for him to say exactly what initially animated people, but the candidate believes that being considered a dark horse early in the contest, especially when so many voters detest \u201cpolitics as usual,\u201d was a blessing. \u201cI think Americans like to root for the underdog,\u201d Yang says, looking back on the early days of his campaign, where he says he was inspired to run after an unnamed person in Washington, DC, told him no one in the federal government would adopt the kind of radical change he was advocating unless he brought a \u201cwave crashing down on our heads from other parts of the country.\u201d \u201cAnd I said, \u2018challenge f\u2014\u2014 accepted,\u2019\u201d he bellowed to raucous applause in Cambridge. Yang was considered a gadfly early in the Democratic primary and written off by other candidates. That has since changed, with Yang now standing on stage with the Democratic Party\u2019s top politicians, sparring with a former vice president and multiple United States senators. The businessman has turned his campaign into a growing online powerhouse: Yang\u2019s fundraising number dwarfed the $2.8 million he raised in the year\u2019s second quarter, an aide said. It would be the continuing of an upward trend for his fundraising; he raised $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. And Yang\u2019s polling has followed his fundraising. A recent CNN poll found Yang at 4% among likely caucusgoers in Nevada, a survey that got him within one early state poll above 3% from qualifying for the November Democratic debate. Still, that initial rejection from the Democratic establishment and media continues to fuel Yang, who claims he has always believed his presidential run would be successful. \u201cI got to say,\u201d he told the audience, \u201cI\u2019m enjoying sticking into the people who didn\u2019t think that we were going to make it there.\u201d And in conversations with dozens of Yang supporters, the sense that Yang is still being written off by the political establishment is a powerful motivating force for his diehard supporters. \u201cThe more that happens,\u201d said Hsiu-Lan Chang, a 68-year-old retired businesswoman who was covered in Yang buttons near the front of the candidate\u2019s Cambridge rally, \u201cthe more the gang gets energized.\u201d Yang is seemingly in constant motion, his boundless energy apparent even in the dullest moments of campaigning. During CNN\u2019s interview with him, Yang shadow boxed around the hotel conference room, bouncing between high-backed leather chairs as his fists jabbed in front of him. The moment he hit the stage in both Boston and Philadelphia, he proudly danced, swaggering to the front of the stage with confidence. Yang says he considers himself \u201cconfident,\u201d not cocky, but it\u2019s clear he and his aides believe it would be difficult not to be self-assured after the unexpected success he has had. A central reason to that success is the dominant issue to his campaign: The Freedom Dividend, a plan to give every American adult $1,000 a month, a universal basic income that Yang argues would alleviate a host of social ills and eradicate poverty. Yang, as a way to demonstrate its benefits, has given a Freedom Dividend to three people for months from his personal fortune. At the September debate, he announced plans to give it to 10 more people using his campaign funds. The plan has electrified Yang\u2019s supporters, who see it as the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that only a candidate like Yang could propose. Harris says she admires Yang's cash giveaway plan \u201cI\u2019m hustling from job to job to job. $1,000 a month wouldn\u2019t sustain me, but it wouldn\u2019t let me fall down, it would be a great safety net,\u201d said Fred King, a Yang supporter who says he lost his job this year as a cameraman to automation. \u201cNow, it doesn\u2019t mean I can live off of it, but I can be able to maintain and look for other work and eventually, when I find another job, I\u2019ll be in a great place.\u201d While Yang\u2019s universal basic income isn\u2019t the only issue motivating Yang\u2019s run \u2013 his website is littered with hundreds of policy positions and he talks often about the impact automation will have on the country\u2019s work force \u2013 it is the most important to the candidate, who laughed when asked if he would trade being president for instituting a universal basic income in the United States. \u201cWho would even need to think about that,\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cI\u2019d be thrilled if we got a freedom dividend across the finish line. And, you know, I\u2019d enjoy being in the room to see it get signed into law.\u201d Yang exudes the confidence of a candidate who didn\u2019t expect to be where he is and has little to lose. He crowd-surfed at an event in September, regularly posts video of himself playing basketball and and tweeted on Wednesday, \u201cPeople who are surprised by our success to date will be really surprised by what happens next.\u201d And he believes it. Yang told CNN that when he plotted his campaign in 2017, the current trajectory he is on was among the most optimistic outcomes he could perceive. But, Yang was clear to say, he believes there\u2019s more to come: winning the presidency. \u201cI always believed that we\u2019d be successful. And when some people ask me, \u2018Are you surprised to be here,\u2019 I\u2019m genuinely not,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought we\u2019d be successful\u2026 and we\u2019re going to become more successful than we are right now.\u201d Yang \u2013 a happy warrior who is more adept at Twitter than many of his own followers \u2013 has united a group of political outsiders, many of whom supported Republicans and libertarians in the past, around his message. But, after months of success, there is a noticeable divide in Yang\u2019s movement. His appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast is so central to his rise that it has created distinctions within Yang supporters: The so-called \u201cOriginal Gangster\u201d Yang Gang \u2013 those who learned about him from Rogan or before \u2013 and those who learned about him more recently from debates or other media appearances. People who introduce Yang often tout themselves as \u201cOG\u201d members of the Yang Gang and any time spent with a group of Yang supporters often leads to questions about how each person found out about the candidate. Andrew Yang is riding a wave of support. Literally. Jason Sherfey, a 35-year old research professor at Boston University who was volunteering at Yang\u2019s Cambridge rally, said that distinction plays out online, too. \u201cI think that this is a campaign that is painting an optimistic future that could heal the country,\u201d he said, \u201cand to have been an early part of that is something that excites a lot of people.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge thing, but you can tell that people are proud.\u201d This could be an issue for Yang. In order to have any chance of winning on 2020, Yang will have to welcome in new supporters, many of whom have never listened to Yang\u2019s appearance with Rogan. And that could create rifts with some of the candidate\u2019s most diehard supporters. Yang dismissed the concerns by \u2013 once again \u2013 likening himself to a garage band that makes it big. \u201cI certainly love and appreciate all the early adopters of this campaign because they saw the vision when, frankly, it was really difficult for them to be able to convince others of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any tension between people who are very, very early and all the folks who are joining now.\u201d He added: \u201cI liken it to fans of a rock band, like Arcade Fire. Are you a little proud if you saw Arcade Fire in a little venue? Sure! But do you begrudge the fact that now other people have discovered what you love?\u201d \u201cMy hope,\u201d he said with a pause as he reflected on the rise of the Canadian indie rock band, \u201cis that I can replicate the rise of Arcade Fire\u2026 and go from clubs to arenas.\u201d This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Idaho voters approved Medicaid expansion in the fall, but Republican state lawmakers are now trying to add several restrictions to it. The move follows similar action in Utah last month, where GOP lawmakers approved legislation limiting the scope of a measure also passed in November\u2019s midterms. Voters in a total of four states have turned to the ballot box to get around Republican lawmakers who\u2019ve refused to adopt the Obamacare provision expanding Medicaid. Idaho\u2019s legislature is considering a bill that would mandate certain newly eligible enrollees to work 120 hours a month to maintain their benefits, far higher than most state work requirement proposals. The bill would also direct the state health department to ask participants about drug use so they can be referred to treatment. And it seeks to allow those just above the poverty line to get federal subsidies to purchase private coverage on the Obamacare exchange. Under the bill, the Medicaid expansion would be eliminated entirely if federal reimbursement ever falls below 90% of the program cost. Several of these measures require federal approval and would cost the state nearly $1.6 million a year, nearly all of which stems from administering the work mandate. Some 91,000 people would gain coverage and the state would receive $400 million in federal matching funds under the ballot measure, which passed with 61% of the vote in November. Expansion is set to begin next year. Butch Otter, the Republican governor at the time, endorsed the initiative days before the election, saying he supports broadening health insurance to those who need it. His successor, Brad Little, has said he will honor the will of the people, but pursue efforts to contain health care costs and move people off Medicaid and into private coverage. The goal of the bill, which will be heard by a committee on Friday and could be voted on by the House as soon as next week, is to provide residents the opportunity to escape poverty, said Rep. John Vander Woude, the bill\u2019s sponsor. He has already consulted with Little and the state Senate. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s a roadblock. I think it\u2019s assistance,\u201d said Vander Woude, noting that many recipients are likely already working. \u201cIt will move them up the income ladder to become self-sufficient.\u201d Advocates of expansion, however, said the legislation could strip coverage from more than 10,000 Idahoans and cost the state and local governments millions of dollars, in part to cover the health care needs of the uninsured. \u201cThere was a very clear message sent by voters,\u201d said Luke Mayville, co-founder of Reclaim Idaho, which led the charge on the ballot measure, noting that it won in 29 of 35 legislative districts. \u201cThere should be no question of what voters want.\u201d Utah Republicans curtail voter-approved Medicaid expansion In Utah, Republican lawmakers pushed through a measure aimed at restricting coverage to those at or below the poverty line, instead of up to 138% of that threshold, as is standard under the Obamacare provision to expand Medicaid. The poverty line is roughly $12,500 for an individual and $25,750 for a family of four. Utah\u2019s law, which is still awaiting federal approval, would also add work requirements, place a per-capita cap on spending and close the program to new enrollees if costs exceed the funds budgeted. Maine's new governor moves ahead with Medicaid expansion Medicaid expansion is proceeding in two other states where voters approved it. Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, implemented the program in January after her Republican predecessor, Paul LePage, blocked it for more than a year. And expansion is expected to go into effect next year in Nebraska after residents approved a ballot measure in November.",

            "article_content": "Utah voters approved Medicaid expansion last November, but Republican state representatives \u2013 who have long opposed broadening coverage for low-income residents \u2013 are now moving to limit the extent of the changes. The state Senate could vote as early as Monday on a bill that would restrict coverage to those at or below the poverty line, instead of up to 138% of that threshold, as is standard under the Obamacare provision to expand Medicaid. It\u2019s expected to pass the GOP-controlled Utah House and Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, is likely to sign it. It would also mandate beneficiaries to work, place a per-capita cap on spending and impose a lock-out period for those who violate certain requirements. And the bill would close the program to new enrollees if costs are projected to exceed the funds the legislature appropriated, said Republican state Sen. Allen Christensen, who sponsored the measure. The legislation would require a federal waiver that may be tough to get. Last year, the Trump administration failed to rule on a similar Utah proposal to broaden Medicaid only up to the poverty level before voters embraced a much more comprehensive expansion plan. Medicaid is expanding in 3 red states The battle over expansion in Utah is reminiscent of the fight in Maine, the first state to pass expansion at the ballot box in 2017. Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage refused to implement expansion for more than a year, defying state court orders. His successor, Janet Mills, quickly moved to expand Medicaid after taking office last month. The Utah ballot measure, which garnered 53.3% of the vote, is set to go into effect April 1 and was projected to cover as many as 150,000 residents. The more limited version would leave out 70,000 people who make more than the poverty line, which is roughly $12,000 for an individual and $25,000 for a family of four. Though they remained relatively quiet prior to the election, Herbert and GOP lawmakers now say changes are needed because the 0.15 percentage point increase in the state sales tax won\u2019t cover the costs of expansion by the third year. This new analysis negates an earlier report from the governor\u2019s office that showed that the levy would provide enough money. Christensen says those above the poverty line can get subsidized policies on the Obamacare exchanges, though many advocates argue that coverage can still be too pricey for the poor. \u201cWe are looking for a win-win consensus and making sure we follow the will of the people, but do it in a fiscally prudent way,\u201d Herbert said Wednesday on a podcast from UtahPolicy.com, an information site for state policymakers. Proponents of Medicaid expansion, however, are fighting back. Hundreds descended on the state Capitol Monday to protest lawmakers\u2019 efforts to curtail the bill. Utah Decides, which pushed for the ballot measure, is running a TV ad urging residents to call their legislators and Herbert to \u201ctell them to leave our health care alone.\u201d \u201cThey are blatantly disrespecting and disregarding what voters wanted,\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project, which helps fund grassroots initiatives in Utah and elsewhere. Republicans are moving ahead with Medicaid expansion in two other states \u2013 Idaho and Nebraska \u2013 where voters approved ballot measures in November. In Nebraska, GOP Gov. Pete Ricketts has long opposed broadening Medicaid, but said in his State of the State address last month that his budget \u201creflects the vote of the people of Nebraska\u201d and that officials are working to implement expansion. State Sen. Adam Morfeld, a Democrat, said he\u2019s not aware of any efforts in the legislature to derail expansion. \u201cImplementation is well on its way in Nebraska,\u201d Morfeld said. The Idaho Freedom Foundation is challenging the ballot measure in court, saying it is unconstitutional. The state Attorney\u2019s General Office argues the case should be dismissed. Meanwhile, Idaho Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, has included Medicaid expansion in his budget. \u201cFor months I made it clear I would honor the will of the people\u201d Little said in his State of the State address last month, noting he will also pursue plans to move people off Medicaid and into private coverage. \u201cI intend to work with you to implement Medicaid expansion using an Idaho approach.\u201d",

He is a vice president of the Aspen Institute and a senior fellow with the Bipartisan Policy Center. Follow him on Twitter: @DanRGlickman. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles at CNN. The Democratic candidates for president have been visiting Iowa in preparation for next February\u2019s caucus, as is customary at this time in the election cycle.  Iowa is a great place to visit to get a feel for a state with an independent streak. Iowa is a rural, small-town and farm-based place. For Democrats, this has been an underserved portion of the American electorate. The question is, will Democrats keep paying attention to such states in a general election, or will attention to rural issues dissipate after the Iowa caucus? There is a myth among some Democratic campaign operatives that rural voters are conservative down to their DNA, and are not worth spending the time, effort or money to pursue in the general election. The fact is, this is political malpractice. It\u2019s time for Democratic primary candidates to recognize, as many congressional Democrats have done, that the party must actively engage with rural America. In fact, rural America is not a lost cause to the party, but an important opportunity to make the case that Democratic policy ideas are good for Americans outside of the coastal cities. Democratic presidential electoral fortunes depend on it. There are 60 million people living in rural America, scattered across more than 90% of the geographic space of the United States. Rural Americans live in every state and were a crucial voting bloc in the 2016 election, especially in the Midwest. A disproportionate percentage of the men and women in our military hail from rural America, and veterans return to these communities looking for jobs, often while dealing with PTSD or combat injuries. And a raging opioid epidemic is hitting small towns and rural communities especially hard. Ernst: Farmers in 'tenuous' place amid Trump tariffs Global economic trends have had a big impact on rural communities, too. Nearly all the Democratic presidential candidates have strong beliefs and good policy prescriptions to confront these exact challenges. Yet too often, once we get past Iowa, rural voters get ignored by Democratic candidates. There is simply a belief by some in the Democratic Party establishment that rural voters are too different to make the effort worthwhile. It is true that small town and rural voters tend to be on average older than the voting populace and have a special sense of community and self-reliance.  While these qualities exist in urban and suburban America, they are necessities for living in less-populated areas. There is also a reluctance in rural America to wait for the federal government to step in. Don't kill the Electoral College. Just make it work better Often some Democrats minimize or do not understand the power of faith, family and a sense of community in small towns.  And there is a tendency to write off some of these areas because a larger percentage of these folks have more conservative positions on gun control, for example.  But the bottom line is that most people in rural America care deeply about economic issues, jobs and health care. If given a good reason, some may even vote for Democratic candidates despite disagreeing with them on some social issues. Rural voters are smart enough to discern what\u2019s important for their lives between policy ideas offered by the two parties. Democrats just need to show up and give them a choice. When I was Secretary of Agriculture during the Clinton Administration, I was instructed by both the president and a bipartisan majority of Congress to focus on the economic needs of small towns, farms and rural Americans. Beto O'Rourke: Our farmers are paying the price for our trade wars I learned that, when natural disasters like floods, droughts and tornadoes hit, rural citizens are often in the greatest need of help, and it almost always comes through the generosity of the federal government working cooperatively with state and local governments and the private sector. The same is true for political disasters, as when farmers\u2019 livelihoods are directly hit by trade distortions such as President Trump\u2019s tariff policies. The federal government has provided critical assistance for the agriculture industry and rural America since the New Deal, almost always with bipartisan support.  Rural America has also benefited tremendously from federal investment, including electrification projects, rural broadband expansion, and certainly our great land grant education system. And of course, since rural Americans tend to be older, strengthening Medicare, Social Security and other health care benefits is enormously important.  Poverty is rampant in parts of rural America, and reliance on SNAP (food stamps), reduced price school meals, Medicaid and other anti-poverty programs is an important part of the safety net for rural communities. The Medicare for All bill is a winner Presidential leadership is desperately needed to address the problems of the millions of people who live in small towns and rural areas. Presidential candidates also need to show respect and attention to rural culture. Democratic candidates need to recognize that there are a lot fewer one-issue voters in rural America than people surmise.  The bottom line for Democrats in rural America, especially our candidates for president: Show up, show respect, offer specific solutions but be collaborative in the process, and be humble.  The differences between urban and rural Americans are a lot narrower than our political class would have us believe.  We are one nation, rural and urban, indivisible, yearning for a new way forward.\u200b",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael Bennet is the senior US Senator for Colorado, and is running as a Democratic candidate for president. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. America\u2019s challenges are great and growing. The link between social mobility and economic opportunity is broken. More than 10 million American children live in poverty, while the top 0.1% of taxpayers hold 20% percent of American wealth. Millions go without health care, while millions more are crushed by rising premiums. And each day, the planet grows warmer. Instead of confronting these urgent challenges, politicians in Washington use them to divide us. Half-truths and recycled talking points masquerade for leadership. And on issue after issue, nothing changes. Unlike Washington, the American people haven\u2019t given up on our country. They refuse to hand our children less opportunity, not more. That is why I am running for President. Like most Americans, I do not accept that our economy and our politics are too broken to fix. In this election, beating President Donald Trump is essential. But it is not enough. He is a symptom of our economic and political sclerosis, not the primary cause. In 2020, we must answer a deeper question: How can we move from permanent gridlock to enduring progress? Looking ahead, our country has three courses of action. We can continue to do nothing and hope our problems will work themselves out. Recent history offers ample evidence of the effects of doing nothing.  With each year, it seems we moved closer to a system where politicians stir up controversy to raise money to win elections \u2013 all for the privilege of creating more controversies to raise money to win further elections. Here's the next political truism that Trump might overturn Given this record, it is understandable why many are tempted by one-party rule, when either Democrats or Republicans control both the legislative and executive branches and can act without compromise. Republicans achieved that after 2016, and they used their power to eviscerate environmental protections and pass a tax cut that exacerbated inequality and exploded our national debt. But even if these policies had been wise, which they were not, the one-party course would still be wrong. Passing sweeping policy on a party-line vote, only to see it reversed in the next election, is not progress. There is no two-year solution to heath care, inequality, or climate change. To make lasting progress, we have to take a third route and advance ideas that break our partisan divide. On health care, for example, instead of forcing 180 million Americans to abandon their employer-based plans for Medicare for All, we should create a true public option called Medicare-X. My proposal would provide everyone the choice to keep their existing coverage, if they want, or move to an affordable public plan. On taxes, my American Family Act is a simple but bold proposal to fight inequality and confront the high cost of raising a child. For just 3% of the cost of Medicare for All, my plan would reduce childhood poverty by about 36% and provide a typical middle-class family of four at least $2,000 a year \u2013 all without adding to the bureaucracy. How Justin Amash's one-man revolt vs. Trump could gain steam On climate change, my plan meets the emissions target set by scientists as quickly as possible by urgently engaging all Americans, instead of imposing solutions cooked up in Washington. It creates new opportunities for young people, farmers, and ranchers to shape America\u2019s climate policy. It makes historic commitments to conserve our lands and oceans, not only preserving vital carbon sinks, but also creating new opportunities for rural communities. And it engages our entrepreneurs by deploying $1 trillion in federal resources to catalyze another $10 trillion in private investment in zero-emission technologies, building new markets and jobs. Solutions like these are not only how we win; they are how we break the logjam in Washington and make real progress. Electoral victory is important, but it is not an end in itself. It is intended to set in motion a pluralist process to resolve our disputes and move the country forward. We have many points of view in our country, and rediscovering our will to navigate and negotiate them is how we correct our course. This is not a call for lazy moderation or lame bipartisan agreements that split the difference between yesterday\u2019s obsolete ideas. It is a call for the difficult, imaginative give-and-take that can produce enduring results. Some people might say that\u2019s na\u00efve. I think it\u2019s more na\u00efve to think we can keep doing what we\u2019re doing and expect anything meaningful to change for our country.  That will not be easy with a politics awash in special interest money and elected officials who quake at the first sign of a social media storm. But that\u2019s the reality. The Depression wasn\u2019t easy. World War II wasn\u2019t easy. The civil rights movement wasn\u2019t easy. We\u2019ve shown the necessary mettle before. For the sake of our country and the next generation, we need to show it again.",

His most recent book is \u201cThe Empire and the Five kings.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. This piece has been translated from French into English by Steven B. Kennedy. \u201c\u00a1Juro!\u201d exclaimed Juan Guaido, the 35-year-old leader of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly, as he declared himself the country\u2019s acting president on January 23. \u201cI swear!\u201d he said to the crowd in a definitive challenge to the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the ersatz President who has held office since the death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013. I swear, he repeated with a boldness seemingly unrealistic but clearly effective, as it was followed almost immediately by recognition from nearly every country in the region, plus more than a dozen members of the European Union, Canada and the United States. Of course, this feat of garnering the approval of so many nations would deserve neither admiration nor support were it just another episode in the long tradition of power-grabbing pronunciamentos. And, certainly, we have seen enough leaders come to power in the rubble of their country (and then confused a spot on a soapbox with constitutional compliance) to blindly credit a man elevated to power with little more mandate than approval from the crowds in Caracas. Now we must remain alert so that a cult of personality does not develop around the young leader and transform what is now an admirable popular revolution into a new occasion for Petro Caesarism. What's really going on in Venezuela Nonetheless, Guaid\u00f3 agreed to assume executive power in only the most purely formal and legal way. He acted in accord, not with the maxims of his own ambition, but with a faithful reading of articles 233 and 350 of Venezuela\u2019s constitution, under which the president of the national assembly takes the reins if the head of state is unable to function. And he assumed executive responsibility solely on an interim basis \u2013 that is, for the time it takes to organize free elections and to re-establish the people\u2019s right to make decisions in accordance with the values, principles and guarantees enshrined in the country\u2019s fundamental law. Few dictatorships have violated those values, principles and guarantees more than Maduro\u2019s. Few presidents have been so dubiously elected as this blend of Augusto Pinochet and Fidel Castro, that Maduro, in advance of the 2018 election, took the precaution of banning the opposition coalition and ensuring that most of its leading figures, such as Antonio Ledezma and Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, were either in jail, in exile or otherwise incapacitated. Venezuela isn't Syria: Why the US shouldn't overreact to Putin's bluff Few have relied so heavily as Maduro on shadowy police operations, primly redubbed Operation Humanistic Liberation of the People in 2017. Among those police actions, Amnesty International has found countless cases of arbitrary arrests, disappearances, and bloody violations of human rights. Moreover, what are those rights worth when, according to the Encovi (a polling firm in Venezuela) study carried out by a consortium of universities, 87% of the country\u2019s households are living below the poverty line? When the average Venezuelan citizen has lost 24 pounds?  When health and mortality indicators have reached levels normally observed only in countries at war? I will not rehash here the eternal debate between legality and legitimacy. But one has to wonder by what right a regime remains in office when it has been so dishonest, greedy and inept, managing only to foment massive inflation and starve the countryside and the working-class suburbs. Government tries to hide hospital's 'shameful secrets' One cannot but wonder what is left of a \u201cBolivarism\u201d that, with its petrodollars, has succeeded only in building soviets without electricity and creating a people lacking not only freedom but also water, milk, eggs and meat. And does there not come a point in the marathon of mendacity and mismanagement when one must summon the courage to say that a government that has forced between 2 and 5 million of its people into exile is no longer either legitimate or legal? Which brings us to a choice. We can weigh rousing the ghosts of President James Monroe and his 1823 speech, of the United Fruit Company, the Chicago Boys and Operation Condor \u2013 these symbols of the so called brutal American interventionist policy during the 1960s and the 1970s, in Chile, Guatemala and other countries of Latin America. We can, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, express a discomfort at seeing bumbling President Donald Trump return to America\u2019s backyard, where his predecessors so often showed a lack of judgment and morality. Trump's right in backing Guaido in Venezuela -- but he needs to proceed with caution We can, like some leftists followers, claim to see in Guaid\u00f3\u2019s oath of office the outcome of a reactionary plot, without considering a few crucial realities: First, that the plotters in this case are millions of ruined, starved and tormented Venezuelans; and, second, that when it comes to interventionism, the most brutal, criminal and imperialistic intervention today is coming not from the United States but from China, which finances the regime, from Russia, which protects it, and from Cuba, which patrols Caracas. But the simple truth is that Venezuela cannot wait any longer for the international community to act. And that is why the only possible choice, today, for a true liberal, is to echo the call of French President Emmanuel Macron and his European counterparts for free and open elections \u2013 preceded, of course, by the immediate and nonnegotiable departure of Maduro. Remember those pictures of him as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s guest in Turkey in September 2018, enjoying a steak in the world\u2019s priciest meat restaurant?  Without realizing it, he was aping the autumnal patriarch immortalized by yet another writer, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, feasting in his palace, wild, impulsive and on the edge of madness. Well, here we are again: The emperor has no clothes. Mired in his hell, he no longer has a future. What remains to him are his little sword and his pathetic fear of losing the power to torture his people. And that is why he must go without delay.",

            "article_content": "Labor unions seem to be a critical topic right now. Teachers, medical professionals, digital media employees and e-commerce workers have all entered the national conversation in recent months, either for their attempts to unionize or their calls to strengthen workers\u2019 rights. The blood and sweat behind Labor Day In theory, their demands are well supported by the American public. According to a recent Gallup poll, 64% of Americans approve of labor unions. That\u2019s a five-year high, and the third-highest approval number since 1970. However, actual union membership rates are relatively low. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals the general union membership rate for 2018 was 10.5%, which is about even with the numbers from 2017. However, that percentage represents a precipitous overall decline in union membership since comparable data was first released in 1983. That year, more than 20% of workers belongs to a union. Over time, that number has dropped steadily by almost half. What kind of picture do these numbers paint?  In general, high support for labor unions is seen as a good thing. \u201cAmerica\u2019s approval of labor unions tends to go higher at times when the economy is doing well,\u201d said Mohamed Younis, Gallup editor-in-chief. \u201cWhen the economy is really struggling, people across the board, regardless of their partisanship, see unions less favorably.\u201d Younis contrasts the recent figures to low union support seen in 2009-2012 and other periods of economic weakness. What these numbers may or may not reflect is the recent turmoil brewing within groups of unionized workers fighting for better rights and non-unionized workers attempting to organize. Early in 2019, unionized teachers across the country organized strikes and walkouts over concerns about pay, staffing and class sizes. Teacher: 'I'm not being as effective as I could be' The continued growth of Amazon has sparked several labor concerns in recent months. The retail behemoth\u2019s plan to offer one-day delivery sparked an intense debate with the leader of a major workers\u2019 union who argued such demands could put workers in danger if Amazon didn\u2019t increase their staffing to match the new workflow. During Amazon\u2019s much-feted Prime Day in July, groups of Amazon workers and allies walked out to protest what they claim are unfair working conditions. While Younis says the major factor of Americans\u2019 view of labor unions seems to be the economy, he says the prevalence of labor stories in the news could also play a part, as does one\u2019s proximity to labor unions and their issues. \u201cWhile the short-term news cycle is not at play as much as reflections of how the economy is doing, we have found within our polling, generally, that the news does tend to affect people\u2019s awareness and opinions of unions.\u201d He points out that because the percentage of Americans involved in a union is very small \u2014 10.5% \u2014 most people who have opinions on unions aren\u2019t in one themselves. \u201cLiterally 90% of people involved in this poll aren\u2019t members of a union, so they form their opinion on unions from other sources, whether it\u2019s the news or a family member who belongs to one,\u201d Younis said. In fact, Gallup\u2019s data finds non-union people who live in a household with a union member are much more likely to view unions positively. This is how hard it is to find workers for a dairy farm There\u2019s one more wrinkle in the tricky relationship between labor activity and people\u2019s views of it. Younis says that while union membership is generally not related to party affiliation, those with pro-labor views are likely to view unions more favorably if they are being undermined in some way. \u201cPeople will react to a lot of these very politicized terms and institutions,\u201d he says. \u201cA very liberal person who is pro workers\u2019 rights, who happens to be living at a time when workers\u2019 rights are being violated, or when there is a president that may be colliding with unions, that\u2019s going to affect their outlook.\u201d While unionization and workers\u2019 rights are bound to stay at the forefront of the conversation through the 2020 election, there are other economic factors that could affect how such issues are perceived. Younis says tariffs and trade wars could have a big impact on union perception if they were to affect jobs or labor opportunities.",

            "article_content": "Lori Lightfoot did something during her victory party last week that once would have been considered obscene. As Chicago\u2019s beaming mayor-elect stood at a podium, she turned toward her wife, Amy Eshleman, and kissed her in full view of a roomful of jubilant supporters while photographers snapped away. The images of that moment looked like a sneak preview of a New America breaking through \u2013 a black, gay woman kissing her white wife before a mini-rainbow coalition of onlookers. And nobody raised an eyebrow. But focus on just the black supporters in that room and another image emerges. The black vote \u2013 especially members of black churches who mobilized on her behalf \u2013 was crucial to Lightfoot\u2019s victory. What if Lightfoot had been standing in the pulpit of one of those black churches when she kissed her wife? \u201cIn probably 90% of the black churches, she would be put out or asked to leave,\u201d says the Rev. Martha Simmons, a scholar on black preaching and a consultant to an upcoming PBS special on the black church. There is a cruel irony in Lightfoot\u2019s election that few, if any, are talking about. Many of the same black voters who asked her to lead their city wouldn\u2019t dare ask her to lead their own churches because she is a gay woman. Women and LGBTQ members are still treated like second-class citizens in many black churches across America. Two of the nation\u2019s largest black church groups still do not officially accept women clergy or bishops. And while largely white denominations like the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterian Church (USA) affirm gays and lesbians, most black churches in America still have a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy that forces its LGBTQ members to live in the closet or be consumed by self-loathing. Lori Lightfoot on the challenges facing Chicago Yet Lightfoot was able to get many of the same churchgoers, including many who declare that \u201cGod didn\u2019t make Adam and Steve,\u201d to vote for her. She won the key endorsement of a black Gospel recording mogul reared in a church that considers homosexuality a sin. She converted skeptics while campaigning at black churches. One of the city\u2019s most prominent black pastors said she couldn\u2019t have won without the strong support of Chicago\u2019s black church community. Her victory is bigger than Chicago or politics. How did she do it? The answer to that question can be found in a peculiar way of thinking in the black community that is at once \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cterrible.\u201d Ask many gifted, ambitious women who attend traditional black churches, and they can tell you about something terrible. Black women are the heart and muscle of the black church. More than two-thirds of a typical black congregation are women. But click on the web sites for groups like the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. or the Church of God in Christ, Inc. and you\u2019ll see that virtually all their leaders are solemn-looking black men staring intently at the camera. The pictures look as out of date as those black-and-white photos of all-white NBA teams from the 1950s. Ask these black church groups about their attitude toward women and LGBTQ people, and you\u2019ll hear everything except a full-throated affirmation of both groups as equals. The National Baptist Convention won\u2019t come out and officially say women cannot be ordained as pastors. Instead, its web site says it \u201cdoes not offer specific support for female ministers at this time.\u201d The Church of God in Christ is more straightforward. It does not allow women to become senior pastors or bishops, though it accepts some as \u201cevangelists.\u201d Both church groups cite a battery of scriptures to defend their treatment of women and their stance that homosexuality is a sin. That\u2019s another cruel irony: Both employ a literal reading of the Bible to justify exclusion, even though that same approach was used to justify the enslavement of their ancestors with scriptures like \u201cSlaves, obey your earthly masters. \u2026\u201d Lightfoot to Chicago: You did more than make history Some of these men are threatened by barrier-breaking women leaders like Lightfoot, says Simmons. Don\u2019t talk to them about changing times or the changing faces of politics. \u201cThey think, \u2018Why would I believe that women\u2019s roles have changed when it doesn\u2019t serve me.\u2019 Why would I believe that, especially given how many women are in seminary. There are now more women in seminary than men,\u201d says Simmons. \u201cDo you really believe that men are going to help women get jobs that only men were once able to get?\u201d And then there\u2019s another terrible tradition in the black church that I saw first-hand \u2013 the many LGBTQ members who were humiliated by their congregations. I once attended a black Baptist church where the senior pastor wouldn\u2019t allow women to preach and taught that homosexuality was a sin. There was one catch \u2013 his right-hand man was gay, and virtually everybody in the church seemed to know it. This man was a pillar in the church. He was one of those unsung heroes who make a church function \u2013 attending dull late-night meetings because somebody has to, bringing meals to shut-ins, arranging the pastor\u2019s schedule. I can\u2019t think of a moment when he didn\u2019t have a smile on his face. He was killed, though, by a young man he\u2019d invited to his home.  I thought the grief would break the unspoken agreement in the church to never talk about his sexuality. But when I asked a buddy of mine who attended his funeral if they had finally talked openly about who he was, he reacted with scorn. Real prize is taking down 'old, entrenched Chicago machine,'  Lightfoot says \u201cOf course not. It was completely whitewashed,\u201d he said. \u201cSome speakers even pretended that he liked women.\u201d As to why so many black churches are like this, the answers could fill a book. Here\u2019s one from the Rev. Otis Moss III, senior pastor of one of the largest predominately black congregations in Chicago. He points to how often blacks have been told by America they aren\u2019t welcome. \u201cThose who have been traumatized pass on their trauma, and for some it makes them feel powerful to hold power over someone,\u201d he says. \u201cThose who have been held back are able to say to another, \u2018You are not fully human.\u2019 \u201c Lightfoot, though, somehow marched into this black subculture of trauma, repression and contradictions and convinced enough black churchgoers to vote for her. She made a believer out of the skeptics because of another tradition in the black church that isn\u2019t terrible. It\u2019s \u201cbeautiful.\u201d Moss, pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ, knows about this side of the black church, and he points to how it operates in politics. His father was a close aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Former President Barack Obama used to attend Trinity, and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, whose fiery sermons almost derailed Obama\u2019s first presidential bid, led the church for over 30 years. Moss says there is a tradition of pragmatism in the black church in which congregants ultimately care more about a leader who can deliver than one who can quote doctrine. He tells the story of a politician who tried to answer questions about his sexual orientation before a black church elder cut him off: \u201cChild, I could care less who you date,\u201d the elder told him. \u201cI just wanna\u2019 know what your policy is going to be.\u201d This vein of pragmatism is what Lightfoot tapped into. Black women govern only 4% of the biggest US cities. But their numbers are growing Moss says he was impressed with how Lightfoot showed up in so many black churches and took on every question. He says she couldn\u2019t have won without strong support from the black church. Lightfoot ran as an outsider. She wasn\u2019t part of the political machine in Chicago that many blacks distrusted. She had never held political office before. Turns out a lot of black churchgoers felt like outsiders in Chicago, too. A former federal prosecutor, she capitalized on the outrage sparked by a white police officer\u2019s fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager,  to launch her campaign as a reformer. \u201cRacism is a great equalizer,\u201d Moss says. \u201cRegardless of your sexual orientation, we are still hit by the same political machine that attempts to marginalize people of color.\u201d A crucial moment for Lightfoot came when she gained the endorsement of one of the most well-known figures in Chicago\u2019s black church community. Willie Wilson is a prominent businessman and gospel music impresario with a following among older black churchgoers in Chicago. He placed fourth in the mayoral primary, winning the highest percentage of black votes. Wilson is also the \u201cdevout product\u201d of a socially conservative black church that teaches that homosexuality is a sin, according to a Chicago Sun-Times story. But he threw his support behind Lightfoot even as others sought his endorsement. Wilson echoed the church elder from Moss\u2019 story \u2013 Lightfoot\u2019s policy positions were ultimately more important than her piety. He said her sexual orientation wasn\u2019t a primary concern for him. Three Chicago police officers found not guilty of cover-up in Laquan McDonald's shooting death \u201cThis thing\u2019s about working with me, and should be about economic and social issues. It should not go outside of that,\u201d he said in a Chicago Tribune story. Now here\u2019s the sticky part. Some say that the pragmatism of many black churches is really just a fancy word for hypocrisy. How, for example, are black churchgoers\u2019 voting habits any different than those of white evangelicals who support Trump and oppose gay rights? Moss doesn\u2019t see it that way. He has another term to describe the difference between what black churchgoers profess and what they practice. He calls it a \u201cbeautiful contradiction\u201d \u2013 black churchgoers can embrace a doctrine that excludes a group of people but jettison those scriptures once they get to know and love such a person. He recalls a story he heard from another black pastor. The man had conducted the funeral for a person in his congregation who was transgender. A deacon stood up during the service and said he couldn\u2019t abide by the ceremony because the person they were saying goodbye to dressed as a woman. Then another group of deacons stood up and talked about how that same person had been a force in the church who had done so much to help people. \u201cShe will be buried with full honors,\u201d one deacon said before sitting down. Relationships take precedence over doctrine in many black churches, Moss says. \u201cWhen you have a relationship with someone, you see the sacredness of God flowing through them versus a doctrine that\u2019s been stuck in the back of your head,\u201d Moss says. 'Representation matters.' Tributes as Chicago elects first black gay woman as mayor Jonathan Walton, a professor of religion and society at Harvard Divinity School, amplified Moss\u2019 point. He says it\u2019s simplistic to say most black churches are homophobic and anti-women. He says those black churchgoers who voted for Lightfoot weren\u2019t defying black church tradition; some were acting within it. \u201cAre we really changing when we go into the voting booth or are we just as pragmatic in our religious spaces,\u201d Walton says. \u201cDo I wish we would actually challenge homophobia, sexism? Absolutely? But do I think black churches are just bastions of homophobia and sexism? No, not quite.\u201d Still, what about the gifted women who will never be able to preach or become bishops? What about the members of the LGBTQ community who cannot be recognized for their full humanity \u2013 like the aide to the pastor who was gay? I tell Walton about the aide, and he says that even that story has some hope in it. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s beautiful and terrible at the same time about our community,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful because that brother who everybody knew who was gay probably found life in that community and had authority in that space he probably wouldn\u2019t have anywhere else. \u201cWhat\u2019s terrible, though, is the conspiracy of silence around a certain aspect of his identity, and that people felt like they had to love him in spite of his sexual orientation.\u201d This \u201cbeautiful contradiction,\u201d though, could be changing. Simmons, the PBS consultant, says a new generation of black churchgoers and pastors aren\u2019t preoccupied with issues of gender and sexual orientation. Too many of them, she says, are struggling to pay student loans and worrying about getting gunned down in the streets. \u201cThey don\u2019t have time for this foolishness about who loves who,\u201d says Simmons, who hosts a live discussion every Monday on her Facebook page about black church issues. \u201cThe young folks look at all that and say, \u2018No, no. We outta\u2019 here. We don\u2019t have time for this hypocrisy and for majoring in minor stuff while we continue to die.\u2019\u201d Lightfoot\u2019s election could be a sign of that change. Moss is confident the black church will eventually grow to fully affirm women and members of the LBGTQ community. He envisions a day when Lightfoot, or a politician like her, could actually kiss her partner during a victory celebration in a traditional black church. And the cheers wouldn\u2019t stop. \u201cI look forward to it,\u201d he says. Some might think such a barrier-breaking moment would be terrible. But for others, one word would describe such a moment: It would be beautiful.",

Kamala Harris and billionaire Tom Steyer. \u201cI want somebody that comes from the middle class, from the working American to be our president that understands what it is to try to make it in America as a family, working in a factory, on a construction job, or in an office, trying to put together the necessary resources to educate their kid, to provide their health care.

Garamendi said he views Biden as \u201cabsolutely\u201d the most viable candidate to face off against President Donald Trump in the general election. Biden has so far received support from a number of other members of Congress, including Democratic Reps. Dina Titus of Nevada, Tim Ryan of Ohio, G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, as well as Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chris Coons and Tom Carper of Delaware. California moved up its presidential primary this election cycle to March 3, also known as Super Tuesday, allowing the large, diverse state an earlier say in the nomination process.",

            "article_content": "Tune into Erin Burnett OutFront at 7 p.m. ET for more on this story. The Trillbilly Workers Party is a leftist comedy podcast that denounces capitalism, ridicules the Democratic Party and loves Bernie Sanders. Each week, its three hosts record inside a log cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of Eastern Kentucky. There is no intro, they just start talking. \u201cDolly\u2019s the No. 1 most unimpeachable hillbilly. You\u2019re a close second,\u201d Tom Sexton tells his co-host, Tanya Turner, on a recent episode, referring to Dolly Parton. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d the third co-host, Tarence Ray, agrees. They then riff on the inadequacy of the Democratic presidential candidates, the inner life of President Donald Trump and a local funeral service at which Turner and her girlfriend were informed \u201cwe were going to burn in hell for millions of years.\u201d The Trillbillies, as they call themselves, sit at the intersection of two trends: a podcast boom and a generational divide between older people who are more centrist and young leftists who ridicule them. It\u2019s a dynamic most visible on Twitter, and a point of frustration for the Joe Biden campaign. But Turner, Sexton, and Ray upend expectations about what those young leftists sound like and where they come from. \u201cWe\u2019re not as well-read as your average, like, Brooklyn socialists, I don\u2019t think,\u201d Ray says. (His cabin is stacked with books.) Fans tell them their podcast offers \u201ca kind of really detailed accounting of people living in late capitalism,\u201d he adds. \u201cReally, we just wanted to describe what our lives are like here, but more than that, we have an analysis of the country, the way things are, that\u2019s informed by our very specific struggles and experiences here \u2026 And I think that it benefits the left at large to hear that perspective.\u201d The podcast, which launched in early 2017, gets more than 100,000 downloads a month, largely from people in Brooklyn, Chicago and San Diego. The Trillbillies think those listeners might be people born in places like Eastern Kentucky, but who moved elsewhere to find jobs. They make about $9,000 a month in donations on Patreon, a site that allows people to donate, like a subscription. \u201cWe\u2019re not rich podcasters yet,\u201d Ray says. In practice, their podcasts are full of stories about their lives told through a political lens, punctuated by Turner\u2019s wild laugher. In October, their guest was Matt Jones, a Kentucky sports radio host who at the time was flirting with a run against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Jones pitched himself as someone able to speak the language of working class people \u201cYou beat Mitch McConnell, it changes the United States of America. It just does,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd in my heart of hearts, I believe I\u2019m the person who could do it.\u201d After the 2016 election, places like Letcher County, Kentucky, were ground zero for the angry white working class voter that, in the conventional wisdom, elected Trump. \u201cAt that time, I feel like a lot of journalists were writing stories where they lived, in big cities, and calling down here to plug in a name,\u201d Turner says. \u201cIf it were one or two, it would have been funny. But it became increasingly sad and offensive. And of course, we\u2019re not new to piss-poor narratives about Appalachia \u2026 but it was a pretty big onload for us to deal with.\u201d Trump won 62.5% of the vote here in 2016. But, Turner notes, her neighbors were not the ones making big donations to his campaign: \u201cHis wealth and power is coming from other places.\u201d The three aren\u2019t shy about their criticisms of the left, though. They say the Democratic Party, both nationally and locally, has made too many moral compromises. And that those compromises haven\u2019t brought them much in return. \u201cThe Kentucky Democratic Party should win awards in losing. Olympic level losers. Absolute gold medal losers,\u201d Turner said in a November episode. The hosts also have contempt for most of the 2020 presidential candidates. Biden is \u201ca cardboard cutout,\u201d Tuner says, one that, Sexton adds, \u201cis falling apart before our very eyes.\u201d Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro is \u201cvery far down on the list of good Castros,\u201d Ray says. Billionaire Tom Steyer, Ray says, is \u201cpart of a rising class of billionaires \u2026 who understand that pitchforks are coming. \u2026 I think he\u2019s probably trying to get out in front of it.\u201d Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren? \u201cShe\u2019s a true believer in capitalism,\u201d Ray says. Sexton cuts in: \u201cBy her own admission!\u201d Still, they show real affection for Vermont\u2019s senator, Sanders. And they say that this, too, is based on their own experiences. \u201cWe are in the unhealthiest congressional district in the country,\u201d Turner says. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here that doesn\u2019t support health care for all people. You would have to be a criminal \u2013 an absolute billionaire class sociopath \u2013 to not want the sick and dying people around you in this community and in your family to not have access to quality health care. And very few people here do.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has tapped Kenneth Braithwaite, his ambassador to Norway, to replace ousted Navy Secretary Richard Spencer amid unprecedented tensions between top military leaders and the White House over a controversial case involving a Navy SEAL accused of war crimes. The President announced his decision to nominate Braithwaite, a retired Navy rear admiral, shortly after Defense Secretary Mark Esper forced Spencer to resign for circumventing the chain of command by working on a \u201csecret agreement with the White House\u201d to reinstate Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher despite resistance from the Pentagon. \u201cSecretary of the Navy Richard Spencer\u2019s services have been terminated by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. I thank Richard for his service & commitment. Eddie will retire peacefully with all of the honors that he has earned, including his Trident Pin,\u201d the President wrote Sunday on Twitter. \u201cAdmiral and now Ambassador to Norway Ken Braithwaite will be nominated by me to be the new Secretary of the Navy. A man of great achievement and success, I know Ken will do an outstanding job!\u201d he added. While Braithwaite\u2019s military background, diplomatic credentials and experience in legislative affairs qualify him for the role of Navy Secretary, the events that facilitated his nomination pose inherent challenges that \u201cmake it impossible for anyone to serve in that job,\u201d according to former Navy Secretary Ray Mabus. \u201cHe is in uncharted territory,\u201d Mabus told CNN, referring to the hyper-politicized environment that has consumed the Pentagon and long-term damage Trump\u2019s involvement in the Gallagher case will likely inflict on the military chain of command more broadly. Braithwaite, 59, is a Michigan native who graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1984 and was the first of his class to earn a flag rank, after 21 years of military service. A trained Naval aviator, Braithwaite flew missions tracking Soviet submarines throughout the Northern and Western Pacific Ocean regions, according to his online biography. Braithwaite later became a public affairs officer, serving in a variety of strategic communications and legislative affairs roles before leaving active service and entering the reserves in 1993. Braithwaite deployed on several occasions while in the Navy reserves. He served in a support role for the fleet involved in the initial invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was deployed again in 2005 to assist with relief efforts following a major earthquake in Pakistan. His final post before retiring from the reserves as a decorated rear admiral in 2011 was Vice Chief of Information for the Navy. In addition to his military experience, Braithwaite previously worked as a senior adviser to former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter from 1997 to 2000, while Specter was in the Republican Party. A Navy commander will have to clean up the SEAL mess He has also spent time in the private sector as an executive for American oil and health care companies. In March 2007, Braithwaite was named Vice President of Government Affairs for Ascension Health, the largest health care system in the US, and executive director of its Delaware Valley Healthcare Council lobbying group. Following the 2016 election, Braithwaite became a member of Trump\u2019s transition team and was nominated by the President as ambassador to Norway, a NATO ally, in February 2018, filling a post that had been vacant for nearly two years. During his confirmation hearing, Braithwaite emphasized the importance of reaffirming the US commitment to NATO and pledged to strengthen trade ties with Norway. But during Braithwaite\u2019s tenure as ambassador, that effort has been at times complicated by Trump\u2019s repeated demands that Norway, and other NATO partners, ramp up defense spending under threat of the US shifting its military presence in Europe if they do not. NATO members committed to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on national defense at a 2014 summit in Wales, and Trump has repeatedly bemoaned that NATO allies have not fulfilled this commitment. While some defense officials, including former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, have tried to reassure NATO allies, both publicly and privately, amid Trump\u2019s attacks over burden sharing, Braithwaite seemed to side with the President in September when Trump criticized Norway failing to fulfill this pledge. \u201cNorway is both a founding member of NATO and a key member of the alliance, and is financially capable of meeting these commitments,\u201d Braithwaite said at the time. \u201cI have emphasized that it is important for Norway to show leadership and reach the 2% goal well before 2024.\u201d On Monday, Esper essentially said that Gallagher\u2019s case had become so fraught that any decision about it would come in for criticism. The defense secretary said he wanted the Navy to move on. Speaking of senior Naval officers, Esper said that no matter what they decided, \u201cthey would be criticized from many sides, which would further drag this issue on, dividing the institution. I want the SEALs and the Navy to move beyond this now and get fully focused on their warfighting mission.\u201d Gallagher had been convicted of bringing discredit to the armed services after posing next to a dead ISIS fighter\u2019s body, which is against regulations. He was demoted for that offense and acquitted of a separate murder charge. Esper 'flabbergasted' to learn of Navy secretary's secret White House outreach about Navy SEAL Last week, Trump reversed Gallagher\u2019s demotion and ordered Esper to allow the Navy SEAL to keep his status in the elite service \u2013 a move critics say completely undermined the military\u2019s chain of command structure. And that decision could have lasting consequences, according to Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cThe White House\u2019s handling of this matter erodes the basic command structure of the military and the basic function of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\u201d he said in a statement Monday. \u201cIt signals to people that they can operate outside the rule of law and the Geneva Convention.  Frankly, this is reminiscent of what happened leading up to Abu Ghraib, where the Bush Administration signaled that the rules don\u2019t apply. They were wrong then and President Trump is wrong now,\u201d he added. Mabus, who served as Navy Secretary during the Obama administration, echoed that sentiment. \u201cHow do you tell the force that what sets the US military apart is following the rule of law and chain of command,\u201d he added, noting that Trump\u2019s handling of the Gallagher case has completely undercut Braithwaite\u2019s credibility on a core principle of the armed services.

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday knocked Michael Bloomberg\u2019s decision to enter the 2020 race for the Democratic presidential nomination, saying his new opponent is \u201cnot going to get very far in this election\u201d and continuing his attacks on the former New York mayor\u2019s billionaire status. \u201cWe do not believe that billionaires have the right to buy elections, and that is why we are going to overturn Citizens United, that is why multi-billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg are not going to get very far in this election, that is why we are going to end voter suppression in America,\u201d Sanders said during a town hall in New Hampshire following Bloomberg\u2019s announcement. Earlier Sunday, Bloomberg officially announced his late-entry Democratic presidential bid, unveiling a campaign that the former New York mayor said will be squarely aimed at defeating President Donald Trump. The billionaire, who made his fortune creating technology that bankers and traders use to access market data, has already placed at least $37 million worth of television advertising over the next two weeks, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG. Michael Bloomberg is the latest 2020 Democratic hopeful Sanders and other Democrats have repeatedly taken shots at a Bloomberg candidacy since there were rumblings of the former three-term mayor potentially entering the crowded 2020 Democratic field. Bloomberg\u2019s wealth and influence is a perfect juxtaposition to Sanders\u2019 message about the 1% overpowering working-class Americans. In an interview with CNN, Faiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, also blasted Bloomberg\u2019s entry into the race, saying he \u201c(doesn\u2019t) think his candidacy is going to go anywhere.\u201d \u201cI mean I just think the American public do not see a billionaire running for president as the kind of change that they so desperately want,\u201d Shakir said Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a system that\u2019s already stocked with enough billionaires and enough power, and here comes another one who feels like deserving of even more power because I\u2019m smarter and have more wealth than the rest of you.\u201d Earlier this month, Sanders and a number of other Democratic candidates criticized Bloomberg with the Vermont senator saying at a campaign even in Iowa: \u201cTonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry you ain\u2019t gonna buy this election.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is also vying for the party\u2019s nomination, said prior to Bloomberg\u2019s announcement that she doesn\u2019t think \u201cwhen people look at the White House and they see this multi-millionaire (President Donald Trump) \u2026  I don\u2019t think they say, \u2018Oh, we need someone richer.\u2019\u201d \u201cI think you have to earn votes and not buy them,\u201d Klobuchar said. Businessman Andrew Yang also offered a dubious analysis of Bloomberg\u2019s prospects should he enter the race, saying earlier in the month that it\u2019ll be \u201cvery, very difficult for him to jump in right now\u201d and that \u201cthere are limits to what money can do.\u201d CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer, Ryan Nobles, Dan Merica, Cristina Alesci, Jake Tapper and Hannah Sarisohn contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Fiona Hill, President Donald Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser, testified publicly on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Hill, a former national security adviser until she left the administration this summer, told lawmakers that US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland was involved in a \u201cdomestic political errand\u201d in Ukraine, while she and others were trying to stay involved in \u201cnational security foreign policy.\u201d She told Congress that it was obvious to her that when Trump\u2019s aides mentioned \u201cBurisma,\u201d a Ukrainian energy company, that they were really thinking about former Vice President Joe Biden. And she forcefully rejected and dismantled the notion that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election to harm Trump, calling it a \u201cfictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.\u201d 'I think this is all going to blow up': Witness says EU ambassador was running 'domestic political errand' In April 2017, Hill took a leave of absence from the Brookings Institution to join the Trump administration, lending her extensive knowledge and expertise on Russia as the deputy assistant to the President and senior director for European and Russian Affairs. She was initially hired by former national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn, his then-deputy KT McFarland, and then-chief of staff to the National Security Council Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg. \u201cI \u2013 and they \u2013 thought I could help them with President Trump\u2019s stated goal of improving relations with Russia, while still implementing policies designed to deter Russian conduct that threatens the United States, including the unprecedented and successful Russian operation to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d Hill recounted Thursday. During her time with the National Security Council, she oversaw rocky Washington-Moscow ties, and her views sometimes seemed at odds with Trump\u2019s desire to improve relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin who he has praised on multiple occasions. According to The Washington Post, Hill\u2019s relationship with Trump got off to a rocky start. During a meeting prepping for a call with Putin, Trump mistook Hill for a member of his clerical staff and instructed her to rewrite a memo, which led Hill to respond with a \u201cperplexed look,\u201d officials recounted to the newspaper. Trump was irritated by the exchange and told then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster to intervene, the Post reported. Hill accompanied Trump to the 2017 G20 meeting, though she was left out of Trump\u2019s first formal meeting with Putin. The Post reported in January that Hill had sought more information beyond a readout of the meeting, which Trump had instructed his interpreter not to speak about and had taken the interpreter\u2019s notes. And she traveled with Trump to Helsinki last year for his infamous summit with Putin, where he appeared to side with the Russian strongman over his US intelligence community. The former adviser testified before Congress last month that she officially turned in her badge in September, though she had handed over most of her responsibilities in July. Her departure in July came about a week before Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky that prompted the whistleblower complaint alleging Trump abused his office by soliciting \u201cinterference\u201d from a foreign country in the 2020 presidential campaign. A critical biographer of Putin, Hill has authored or co-authored a number of books on Russia, including two editions of a book titled \u201cMr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin.\u201d \u201cFrom the KGB to the Kremlin: a multidimensional portrait of the man at war with the West,\u201d a description of the book reads. From 2009 to 2017, Hill did a long stint at the Brookings Institution, where she directed the Center on the United States and Europe. Before joining the think tank, Hill worked in the US intelligence community under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. She served as a national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia with the National Intelligence Council for three years. She also oversaw strategic planning at The Eurasia Foundation, a nonprofit supported by USAID that was born out of an effort to help former Soviet Union nations. Hill testified that she began her university studies in 1984. She holds a master\u2019s in Russian and modern history from St. Andrews University in Scotland, spending some time studying in Moscow. During the 90s, she held a number of roles directing research at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government, while she completed a master\u2019s in Soviet studies and a doctorate in history. Fiona Hill's extraordinary answer distills what impeachment is about During her testimony on Thursday, Hill shared that she grew up in the northeast of England \u2013 the same region that George Washington\u2019s ancestors came from. \u201cThe men in my father\u2019s family were coalminers whose families always struggled with poverty,\u201d Hill said, adding that her father started working in the mines at 14 \u201cto help put food on the table.\u201d When the local mines closed in the 1960s, her father, who \u201cloved America, its culture, its history and its role as a beacon of hope,\u201d had dreams of emigrating to the US, but stayed in England to care for his mother, who was in poor health. Hill made clear that America \u201chas offered for me opportunities I never would have had in England.\u201d She said she \u201cgrew up poor with a very distinctive working-class accent\u201d that would have \u201cimpeded my professional advancement\u201d in England. \u201cI am an American by choice,\u201d said Hill, who became a naturalized US citizen in 2002. She also confirmed an anecdote that had been reported by The New York Times that when she was 11, a school boy in her class set fire to one of her pigtails while she was taking a test. She put the fire out with her hands and continued finishing the exam. Hill said the incident resulted in her mother giving her a bowl haircut and joked that she ended up looking like King Richard III in her school pictures. This story was updated with additional information after Fiona Hill\u2019s testimony. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen, Kevin Liptak and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Wednesday that if American voters think a woman can\u2019t beat President Donald Trump in next year\u2019s presidential election, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u201cdoes it every single day.\u201d The senator, speaking at\u00a0the fifth Democratic debate,\u00a0hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post in Atlanta, cast herself as the product of working-class roots who can get bipartisan support and help Democrats win back the Midwestern cities and towns that drifted toward Trump in 2016. The senator touted legislation she passed through Congress and her political wins in Republican and independent congressional districts before attempting to answer one of the central questions of Democratic voters following Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in 2016. \u201cI govern with both with my head and my heart and if you think a woman can\u2019t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day,\u201d Klobuchar said, citing the tensions between Pelosi and Trump, which have escalated since the House speaker announced an impeachment investigation\u00a0into Trump and his contacts with Ukraine. During the debate, Klobuchar argued that women are held to a different standard. \u201cOtherwise we could play a game called name your favorite woman president, which we can\u2019t do because it has all been men,\u201d the senator said. Klobuchar on Buttigieg: women held to different standard The three-term senator previously told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that she doesn\u2019t believe the women running for the Democratic nomination would have made the debate stage if they had the same level of experience as 37-year-old South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg leads a city of a little over 100,000 people and was elected by just a few thousand votes. He was overwhelmingly defeated when he ran for a statewide office in Indiana in 2010. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re held to a different standard,\u201d the senator said earlier this month on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d At Wednesday\u2019s debate, Klobuchar said that Buttigieg, who has been mayor of South Bend since 2012 and was deployed to Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2014 as an intelligence officer, is qualified to be on the debate stage. \u201cI am honored to be standing next to him,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cBut what I said was true: Women are held to a higher standard.\u201d Klobuchar said that women, including the six running for president, have to work harder, \u201cand that\u2019s a fact.\u201d Buttigieg defended his experience at the debate and said: \u201cI get that it is not traditional establishment Washington experience, but I would argue we need something very different right now.\u201d He said he has a \u201cdifferent kind of experience,\u201d which involves \u201csolving problems working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The tumultuous impeachment hearings and the string of GOP election losses this fall underline the electoral risks Republicans are courting as they allow President Donald Trump to refashion the party in his combative image. In overlapping ways, the election results and the hearings \u2013 in particular Trump\u2019s characteristically belligerent response to them \u2013 have highlighted each of his three greatest potential electoral vulnerabilities in 2020, as well as the offsetting strengths that may allow him to surmount those weaknesses. The three biggest challenges looming in 2020 for Trump, many analysts agree, are: Trump\u2019s principal political assets on the other side of the ledger are his success at consolidating and energizing the Republican base and deepening the GOP\u2019s dominance among white voters who live outside of major population centers, identify as evangelical Christians or lack college degrees, especially the men in each of those groups. As the impeachment struggle and the off-year elections have simultaneously unfolded this fall, they have illuminated all of these dynamics. But the events are underscoring the trends that threaten Trump even more powerfully than those that benefit him. Of these ominous trends for the President, the clearest this fall is the GOP\u2019s continued erosion in well-educated and prosperous suburbs around the country, where Trump\u2019s message of resistance to cultural and demographic change has alienated voters otherwise drawn to Republican economic policies. Sharp declines for Republican candidates in white-collar suburban areas were a common feature this month of the Democratic takeover of both chambers of the Virginia state Legislature and the party\u2019s gubernatorial victories in Kentucky and Louisiana, two states that have leaned strongly toward the GOP. (The effect was less pronounced in ruby red Mississippi, one of the nation\u2019s most resolutely conservative states, where Republicans maintained control of the governorship this month.) \u201cThey are just losing large parts of their previous electorate and they don\u2019t quite know what to do about it,\u201d says veteran Democratic strategist James Carville, who is based in New Orleans. Tom Davis, a former Republican US representative from suburban Northern Virginia who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee, notes that GOP candidates this fall generally performed well in suburban areas in races lower on the ballot, such as the other statewide offices in Kentucky and state legislative seats in Louisiana. But he said the party can no longer brush off the declines it suffered in the top-of-the-ticket races in those well-educated suburbs. \u201cThey can\u2019t ignore it,\u201d said Davis, now a Washington lobbyist. \u201cIt accounted for both of those (gubernatorial) losses, and it accounted for the loss of the Legislature in Virginia. They are bleeding in the suburbs at this point.\u201d The suburban realignment predates Trump. The parties have been shifting their class support since the early 1990s, with Democrats improving their performance among well-educated white voters and the GOP establishing a growing hold over working-class whites without college degrees. (Democrats continue to dominate among nonwhite voters at all education levels.) But this process \u2013 what I\u2019ve called the class inversion \u2013 has significantly accelerated under him. In the 2018 midterm elections, Republicans were routed in suburban districts across the country, including those in metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Houston and Dallas, that had resisted the general shift in such places toward the Democrats earlier. The biggest message of the 2019 elections has been that the suburban recoil from Trump\u2019s definition of the GOP has continued to spread beyond traditionally Democratic-leaning terrain. Democrats this fall consolidated their advantage in Washington exurbs and Richmond suburbs that not long ago leaned Republican; made gains during the Kentucky governor\u2019s race in white-collar northern suburbs in the state that function as bedroom communities for Cincinnati; and posted big advances in more affluent white communities around New Orleans and Baton Rouge in Democrat John Bel Edwards\u2019 Louisiana gubernatorial win last weekend. When Bel Edwards was first elected in 2015, he lost the predominantly white suburban communities of East Jefferson Parish outside New Orleans by nearly 20 percentage points; on Saturday he ran even there, according to calculations by J. Miles Coleman, an analyst for the University of Virginia\u2019s Crystal Ball website. Carville notes that the suburban communities of East Jefferson Parish that moved away from the GOP on Saturday was where the Republican Party first put down roots in the state. The same pattern, he noted, was true in Texas, where Dallas suburbs that marked the GOP\u2019s first beachhead there in the 1960s moved sharply Democratic in the 2018 Senate race. \u201cThat\u2019s the birthplace of Louisiana Republicanism, Jefferson Parish,\u201d Carville said. \u201cLook at the north side of Dallas, west side of Houston, suburbs of Atlanta. Look at northern Kentucky. Boom. They are hemorrhaging.\u201d Given those trends, Carville and other Democrats note, the party could win more suburban House seats across the South in 2020, including opportunities outside Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Austin, and potentially in North Carolina, as state courts force the GOP-controlled Legislature to draw new maps there. The flip side of the GOP\u2019s suburban erosion under Trump has been its strengthening hold on small-town and rural communities. This year, with the exception of some decline for Republican Gov. Matt Bevin in a few rural eastern Kentucky counties, GOP candidates have continued to enjoy big margins and robust turnout from the rural and small-town voters Trump has predominantly targeted in his visits to the states holding elections. The problem for Republicans has been that Trump\u2019s polarizing presidency \u2013 reinforced by the highly combative message he\u2019s delivered on his campaign visits to these states \u2013 has inspired at least as much turnout among key Democratic constituencies, particularly in urban centers. In Kentucky, Andy Beshear, the Democrat who won the gubernatorial race, attracted a stunning 283,000 more votes than the party\u2019s last governor candidate in 2015, Jack Conway. Nearly two-thirds of that increase came from the state\u2019s major cities and counties; Kentucky\u2019s two largest population centers alone, Louisville and Lexington, accounted for 40% of the Democratic vote increase, according to calculations by Bill Bishop, editor of the website The Daily Yonder. Similarly, in Louisiana on Saturday, heavily African American Orleans Parish (New Orleans) gave Bel Edwards a net margin of nearly 102,000 votes; in 2015, he carried New Orleans by about 70,000 votes. As Louisiana election analyst Edward Chervenak told veteran political reporter Tyler Bridges from The Advocate in New Orleans, the results show that \u201cTrump is as likely to galvanize opposition \u2026 as he is to mobilize supporters.\u201d One GOP strategist, who asked not to be identified while discussing internal party calculations, said that privately there is growing concern among Republican political professionals about the implications of Trump improving the party\u2019s standing in smaller places that are losing population while eroding its position in urban centers and inner suburbs that have been growing. \u201cRural places are becoming less Democratic, but the suburbs, which are way more populated, are becoming much less Republican,\u201d said the strategist. \u201cGiven the natural flow of how population is moving and migrating, you are trading out 8 (Republican) votes for 10 (Democratic ones), maybe 9 votes for 10, but never 11 votes for 10. Never. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d Mike Murphy, a longtime GOP strategist who has been critical of Trump, says the GOP may be able to regain ground in suburban areas in 2020 if the Democrats nominate a vanguard liberal candidate, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who some of those voters  consider a threat to the economy. But absent that, he says, Republicans and Trump may not have reached the bottom of their suburban decline. That\u2019s partly, he says, because college-educated voters, who polls show pay the most attention to the news, may be most likely to sour further on Trump from the revelations in the impeachment process. \u201cThere\u2019s room for it to get worse, because I think impeachment will have a growing effect with higher-educated suburban voters,\u201d Murphy said in an email. The impeachment process has highlighted an offsetting strength for Trump: the depth of his hold on his hard-core supporters. Polls have not found any meaningful decline in his approval rating since the controversy began, particularly among Republican voters. That unshakeable support in the party base has encouraged the nearly undivided loyalty that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have displayed during the hearings. In turn, the refusal of almost any Republican elected officials to question Trump\u2019s conduct in Ukraine has helped him retain his solid support among GOP voters, who have not heard criticism of the President from partisan officials they trust, much less the conservative information transmission system centered on Fox News. The problem for Trump is that his standing has stabilized at a point with his approval rating consistently 40-45% at best and a majority of Americans saying they disapprove of his performance. Most worrisome for the President is that compared with his showing in the 2016 election, polls consistently report that he\u2019s lost ground among two key groups of white voters who usually lean Republican: college-educated white men and white women without college degrees. Impeachment may complicate Trump\u2019s position with each of those groups. College-educated white men are heavy consumers of political news, polls show, and as such may be especially sensitive to revelations that emerge from the hearings about Trump\u2019s actions. Working-class white women may be even more important to Trump\u2019s fate. They were critical to his 2016 win: Every major data source shows he won them by at least 20 percentage points. Exit polls found that in the three Rust Belt states that tipped him the election \u2013 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2013 Trump won significantly more of those women than Mitt Romney had in 2012. But exit polls in 2018 found strong evidence those women had pulled back at least somewhat from the GOP. Almost all surveys show continued cracks in his standing with these blue-collar women. In Wisconsin polling by the Marquette University law school, Trump\u2019s approval rating among non-college white women averages just 42% through his presidency; the latest Muhlenberg College survey in Pennsylvania found that he led Democratic Joe Biden among them by just 5 percentage points (after beating Hillary Clinton by 20 points with them there in 2016, according to the exit polls). Recent state surveys by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report likewise put Trump\u2019s approval among non-college white women at just 42% in Michigan, 43% in Wisconsin and 46% in Pennsylvania. Nationally, an average of the weekly polls conducted since July by the Nationscape project, launched by the Democracy Fund and UCLA political scientists, found that Trump\u2019s approval among non-college white women who are not evangelical Christians \u2013 who account for most non-college white women in the Rust Belt \u2013 stood at just 41%. These non-college white women have been much less likely than their college-educated white counterparts to say in polls that Trump did something wrong in Ukraine or that he deserves to be removed from office. But polling and focus group research alike have consistently found that many of them are uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s demeanor, language and belligerence. The danger for Trump is that his typically confrontational response to the impeachment threat, while thrilling many men in his base, may be exacerbating those concerns among some blue-collar women. Stanley B. Greenberg, the veteran Democratic pollster, says he believes Trump\u2019s disparaging attack on former Ambassador Yovanovitch could galvanize concerns among female voters about both his overall behavior and his specific treatment of women. \u201cI bet we will look back on this and say this is when things took another turn in which you end up with a gender tsunami, that crossed every group and that includes the white working-class women, turning against him,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cIt was already happening, obviously. My guess is it accelerates that trend.\u201d Demeanor isn\u2019t the only problem for Trump with blue-collar women, Greenberg believes. Polls show they reacted badly to his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. Greenberg, like many party strategists, believes that the Democratic support for expanding Medicaid to more of the uninsured \u2013 a key element of the party campaigns in Virginia, Louisiana and Kentucky alike this year \u2013 was especially resonant for women, including those in the white working class. \u201cI\u2019d bet it was the women more than anyone who reacted\u201d to the Democratic support for expanding Medicaid, he said. The GOP strategist who asked not to be identified agrees that Republicans face a problem with these women but believes it is rooted much more in personal than policy issues. In focus groups, the strategist said, it is common to hear from blue-collar white women that they agree with many of Trump\u2019s policies but cannot accept his personal behavior. \u201cEven when you look at downscale white women they might love what he is doing but there is significant reticence about his style and also the drama,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cThere is fatigue at the drama of it all.\u201d The likelihood that the House will impeach Trump, like the 2019 election results, does not ensure that he will be defeated next year. But they are shaping the pathways to another term that are realistically available to him. Even if the impeachment hearings are not splintering the minority of voters who approve of Trump\u2019s performance, there\u2019s evidence they are hardening resistance to him among the majority who don\u2019t: Among voters who say they disapprove of Trump\u2019s job performance, for instance, more than 90% said in a recent Quinnipiac survey that he was pursuing his personal interest, not the national interest, in Ukraine. Such trends suggest that to win another term, Trump likely will have to motivate another turnout surge among his core supporters of blue-collar, evangelical and non-urban whites, without provoking the offsetting mobilization among Democrats evident in elections in 2017, 2018 and again this fall. Trump might manage that feat in just enough of the few genuine swing states to win an Electoral College majority. But the events of the past few weeks \u2013 both on the campaign trail and in the congressional hearing room where the impeachment inquiry is unfolding \u2013 underscore how narrow a tightrope he\u2019s walking.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez capped her debut on the Iowa hustings in support of Bernie Sanders last week with a blunt call to action. \u201cThis is not about something that we allow to happen to us. We don\u2019t let this race happen to us,\u201d she said at a rally for the Vermont senator in Council Bluffs. \u201cWe don\u2019t watch the presidential race. This is not a movie, this a movement.\u201d And yet, there has been a certain cinematic quality to the last six weeks of Sanders\u2019 second Democratic presidential campaign. Nearly sidelined, or worse, by a heart attack in Las Vegas on the first night of October, Sanders has charted a remarkable revival. It\u2019s been powered by a run of invigorating endorsements, new poll results that showed him gaining steam in New Hampshire and Iowa, and the sense \u2013 fueled in part by the massive crowds that welcomed him during recent rallies in New York and Minnesota \u2013 that his \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d was, after a trying summer, back on the march. There are also, as Sanders joked following his Saturday climate summit in Des Moines, the stents to thank. \u201cI\u2019ve got three arteries that are working right now \u2013 that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d he deadpanned, while practicing mid-range jumpers on a basketball court at Drake University. \u201cBetter than one blocked artery, so I\u2019m feeling really good.\u201d His supporters and staff are saying much of the same. The backing of Ocasio-Cortez, along with fellow \u201csquad\u201d members Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, news of which broke before and during the most recent debate last month in Ohio, bolstered an argument that Sanders has been making for months \u2013 that his campaign is steadily attracting a racially diverse, young and working class coalition ready to make an unapologetic case for his democratic socialist vision. Democratic voters, too, have made it clear that Sanders remains front of mind as the primary season approaches. About two weeks after the debate, a CNN poll of Democrats in New Hampshire showed Sanders with a narrow lead over the emerging top tier of candidates, with 21% to Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 18%. Former Vice President Joe Biden came in at 15%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, placed fourth with 10%. No one else touched double digits. Recent surveys of Democrats in Iowa show the same group jockeying, mostly within the margin of statistical error, for the top position. For an elected leader famously disinclined to discuss his own inner life, and whose campaign slogan \u2013 \u201cNot me, us\u201d \u2013 is both a comment on his view of politics and a criticism of how its practice is covered by the press, Sanders wry assessment of his arterial functions felt like a revolution in its own right. \u201cBernie\u2019s back,\u201d as his campaign puts it, but the person at the center of it all seems just a little bit different. As if he\u2019s been freed, finally, to return the embrace of an increasingly influential leftist movement \u2013 the largest the country has seen in nearly a century \u2013 that has vaulted him to within a relative whisper of the White House. Sanders entered the current Democratic primary in February with the same message he has championed for the better party of four decades. It\u2019s one that he pushed in 2016, when he challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and lost. This time, the world around him had changed, and so too had the expectations surrounding his campaign. No longer an underdog, Sanders began his 2020 bid amid a new round of harrowing questions. In photos: Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders What if his supporters in 2016 fled for a fresh face, like former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke? How would he fair in a more crowded field, with fellow progressive icon Elizabeth Warren now another option for Democrats? Would his appeal wane without Clinton around to play his moderate foil? Could he expand his base beyond the diehards and ideologues, and actually turn out the tuned-out voters \u2013 so many young and working class \u2013 that so often go underrepresented on Election Day? The answers, to date, are either mixed or inconclusive. There are still nearly three months to go before the Iowa caucuses kick off a primary that is shaping up to be among the messiest in a generation. O\u2019Rourke faded and dropped out of the race. But Warren is firmly entrenched among the frontrunners. Clinton\u2019s shadow still lingers, for better or worse, and Biden offers a similar contrast, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has emerged a formidable centrist foe. The Bernie base remains firmly in place. Whether he can grow it \u2013 and if he can, by how much \u2013 is open for debate. In the meantime, Sanders is taking on the most recent source of doubt \u2013 his health \u2013 with the kind of alternately droll and punchy sense of humor he is traditionally loathe to display in public. \u201cThis is not a beauty contest,\u201d Sanders said of the primary during his first trip to Iowa after the heart attack, back in October. \u201cWhich obviously I would win, I know that.\u201d During his brief convalescence at home in Burlington, Vermont, Sanders invited television cameras and reporters inside to answer more detailed questions about his health. But since the most recent primary debate in Ohio, and a rousing rally in New York with Ocasio-Cortez and other young progressive leaders, he\u2019s taken a lighter tone. \u201cBrothers and sisters, I thank you so much for your support, but this is what I want to say. This comes from the bottom of my heart,\u201d Sanders said at a festive gathering in Detroit, where he was officially endorsed by Tlaib, before pausing for effect. As his smile widened, Sanders delivered the punchline: \u201cAnd by the way, my heart is doing just fine.\u201d Sanders has also injected some of those waggish asides into the sharper stretches of his stump speech. \u201cToday we tell Donald Trump,\u201d Sanders said, before stopping himself. \u201cWhat can we tell Donald Trump?,\u201d he asked, in mocking exasperation. \u201cSee, if I use a profane word, I\u2019ll get in trouble. All right, all right, he\u2019s an idiot. You made me say it. But in this case, I\u2019m going to tell the media you made me say it. It\u2019s their fault.\u201d Some things do not change. Sanders\u2019 leadership team, as it did in 2016, operates in a near-constant state of vigilance when it comes to mainstream press coverage of his campaign. \u201cAs we have said from the beginning, this is a campaign built to win and planning to win,\u201d campaign manager Faiz Shakir told CNN last month, as Sanders returned to the trail. \u201cWe\u2019ve been steadily and consistently executing our strategy, even while the media analysis of our campaign has been in disarray.\u201d But all is not status quo inside the Sanders campaign. During a recent visit to his campaign office in Washington, DC, Sanders sat and chatted with a group of lower-level staffers. When others began to migrate from across the room for a closer listen, a top aide recalled, Sanders decided to stick around a little longer and give a similar pep talk to those who missed out on the first round. The aide, who has been with the senator since 2016, acknowledged that a candidate \u2013 Sanders included \u2013 talking to his the staff was not out of the ordinary. But in the aftermath of Sanders\u2019 heart attack, the tone of those conversations has changed. \u201cThere was a moment of time where his voice, his vision, his fight was taken away. And that was something that jarred people into realizing that there\u2019s this amazing opportunity that we have to fight for the progressive future that we all want,\u201d the aide told CNN. That newfound ability to pull his devoted team closer should not be confused with a softening of the edges. Sanders the progressive pugilist welcomed news of billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s prospective run as one might expect: acidly. \u201cOh, my goodness. How important, how monumental that he\u2019s running for president,\u201d Sanders said, mimicking a credulous broadcaster, at Drake University. If a candidate with fewer resources entered the race, Sanders added, his voice turned down, \u201cnobody would give a damn.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tim Ryan endorsed Joe Biden\u2019s presidential bid Wednesday, saying the former vice president has the ability to win swing states President Donald Trump won in 2016. \u201cThis election for many, many Democrats, regardless of where you live, is about who can beat Donald Trump. And the key to that is who can beat Donald Trump in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Western Pennsylvania, in Ohio. And I\u2019m convinced that that\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d Ryan, who represents Ohio, said on MSNBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to beat Donald Trump. And to me, it\u2019s clear as you go round and round and think about all of these great candidates that that\u2019s Joe Biden. And I\u2019m going to support him, I\u2019m going to do everything I can for him in the early states and in the Midwest to help him become the nominee and beat Donald Trump,\u201d he said. Ryan, who dropped his presidential bid in late October, said the remaining Democratic contenders are \u201call good candidates,\u201d but argued that \u201cin Joe Biden\u2019s bones is a connection to the working class people of this country\u201d and that he\u2019s \u201cgot the touch\u201d needed to \u201cbring some stability to the country.\u201d Home state allies, moderates in Congress quickly endorse Joe Biden's bid The endorsement could prove to be beneficial for the former vice president should he still be in the race when Ohio\u2019s primary takes place in March. The state, which Trump carried by 8 percentage points in 2016, will be one of the closest-watched during next year\u2019s election. Ryan had previously expressed misgivings about Biden\u2019s candidacy, saying in September that he didn\u2019t believe the former vice president has the stamina to beat Trump, Bloomberg reported. \u201cI just think Biden is declining. I don\u2019t think he has the energy. You see it almost daily. And I love the guy,\u201d Ryan said during a phone call he had thought was with a donor, according to Bloomberg. The congressman did not walk back his comments later during an interview with CNN in which he pointed to Biden\u2019s \u201clack of clarity\u201d on issues and argued that Democrats need a candidate who \u201ccan be very aggressive against Donald Trump\u201d and \u201carticulate a very clear vision for the country in a very forceful and firm way.\u201d During his own campaign, Ryan touted himself as a \u201cprogressive who knows how to talk to working class people,\u201d and he hoped to convince once reliably Democratic voters that \u201cthe progressive agenda is what is best for working families.\u201d But the Ohio Democrat\u2019s campaign failed to gain any traction in a large field of better-financed and better-known Democrats, and he pulled out of the race, saying he would again run for his long-held House seat. Biden has so far received support from a number of other members of Congress, including Democratic Sens. Chris Coons and Tom Carper of Delaware, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Doug Jones of Alabama, as well as Democratic Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden renewed his attacks against Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Monday, pointing to her advocacy for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and saying it comes from an elitist belief that Americans shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make up their own minds on health care. The former vice president\u2019s comments came at a CNN town hall in Iowa. During the town hall, Biden also discussed how he has connected with Americans on the campaign trail about grief. Additionally, he said he isn\u2019t worried about potential political blowback from House Democrats\u2019 impeachment proceedings. He offered a contradictory view on Republicans, insisting they\u2019ll be more willing to work with Democrats after President Donald Trump leaves office \u2013 while telling a story about them refusing to cooperate before Trump had even become the GOP presidential nominee. Here are four takeaways from Biden\u2019s town hall: Biden continued to characterize Warren as \u201cangry\u201d and \u201celitist,\u201d saying her health care plan is driven by a belief that \u201cpeople can\u2019t make up their own mind.\u201d The former vice president also said he\u2019s merely been responding after \u201cshe attacked me.\u201d He was referring to Warren jabbing at him for his opposition to Medicare for All, suggesting without naming the former vice president that he is running in the wrong party\u2019s presidential primary. Biden has escalated his criticism of Warren over that comment in recent days. In a Medium post published last week, he wrote that Warren, without naming her, was \u201ccondescending\u201d and \u201crepresentative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share.\u201d Biden said his criticism wasn\u2019t about Warren personally, and he went on to describe the attitude he said was behind advocating the health care plan she backs. This time mimicking Medicare for All proponents, Biden said Monday that what he\u2019s been calling elitist was \u201cthe attitude that we know better than ordinary people what\u2019s in their interests. \u2018I know more than you, let me tell you what to do.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe attitude is elitist that people can\u2019t make up their own mind,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou like your health insurance,\u201d he said, then dropped to a lower voice: \u201c\u2018But you shouldn\u2019t like your health insurance, you should have to give that up. I\u2019m going to demand you not have that. We\u2019re going to give you something better.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not about her, it\u2019s about the attitude out there \u2013 the attitude that we know best, you do it my way.\u201d He added: \u201cI resent that. And I wasn\u2019t talking about her, I was talking about the attitude that if you don\u2019t agree with me, get in the other party.\u201d The strongest connections Biden makes on the campaign trail often come when opening up about the tragedies he has faced \u2013 and hearing about the deep losses of others. Asked what it meant to have people take comfort in sharing some of their deep personal tragedies with him, Biden said, \u201cWell, you know, I have \u2013 a lot of people have suffered more than I have as loss, and I have been really \u2013 sounds bizarre to say \u2013 lucky in the sense that I had an incredible family.\u201d Biden\u2019s wife and infant daughter died in a car crash in 1972 and his sons were injured. His son, Beau, died of brain cancer four years ago. He went on to explain how his family stepped up to help him raise his children. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the recipient of someone\u2019s understanding and empathy, you understand how it can help and it\u2019s just impossible, although sometimes it\u2019s hard to not share it with others. When people come up to me often, as you\u2019ve observed, is they come up and they\u2019ll walk up to me and all of a sudden a man or woman will just grab me and hug me and say, \u2018I just lost my son, lost my daughter, tell me, am I going to be OK, am I going to be OK?\u2019 \u201d Biden said the best way to overcome tragedy is to find purpose in life. \u201cPurpose. And a purpose is best utilized if it relates to something that related to what the person you lost cared about,\u201d he said. He continued: \u201cThere will come a time if anybody of you are going through it where the thought of the person you lost will bring a smile to your lip before it brings a tear to your eye. That\u2019s when you know you\u2019re going to be able to make it. That\u2019s when you know. But it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard. It gives me some \u2013 it gives me some sense of purpose when I\u2019m able to be of some help.\u201d Biden repeated a belief he often expresses on the campaign trail: that Republicans will be more willing to work with Democrats if President Donald Trump loses the 2020 election. But he also offered a contradictory example \u2013 one that showed, as Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals have frequently pointed out, that GOP lawmakers refused to cooperate with Democrats well before Trump became the party\u2019s standard-bearer. Biden pointed to then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court in March 2016. Senate Republicans refused to give Garland a hearing. \u201cI called 12 Republicans and said, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 \u201d Biden said. \u201cI said, \u2018You realize what you\u2019re doing to the Constitution?\u2019 They said, \u2018We know, Joe, but here\u2019s the deal: Joe, I\u2019m in a state where if in fact the Koch brothers drop in $10, $12 million, I will lose the primary.\u2019 \u201c Garland was nominated to fill the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death. Trump was elected later that year. Still, Biden said, \u201cI honest to God believe, with Trump out of the way, you\u2019re going to find people screwing up a lot more courage than they had before to say, \u2018OK, OK, I can move now, I have more leeway.\u2019\u201d Biden didn\u2019t explain why, if Republicans had been unbending before Trump due to concerns that they\u2019d anger their conservative base, they\u2019d be more willing to work with Democrats after his departure. That missing link is part of what Biden\u2019s opponents have used against him: As he argues for a return to pre-Trump normalcy, his Democratic rivals \u2013 including Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who bemoans the \u201cold normal\u201d \u2013 say that era wasn\u2019t working for progressives, either. Biden expressed no worries about potential electoral backlash on Monday, saying that impeachment proceedings against Trump could help convince independents and Republicans to oppose the President. Asked whether impeachment proceedings would help or hurt Democrats in the 2020 election, Biden answered that \u2013 no matter the political outcome \u2013 Trump\u2019s actions have left the House of Representatives with no choice but to proceed. \u201cThe House has no option. It has to enforce the Constitution, whether or not \u2013 whether or not \u2013 it turns out to work or not work, or whether or not it turns out that he should or shouldn\u2019t be kicked out of office,\u201d he said. Biden added that if Democrats make a strong case that Trump violated his oath of office, \u201cyou\u2019re going to find that those areas that are independent and Republican areas saying, whoa, whoa, we got to do something, we got to do something.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s going to change their view. Let\u2019s see where the facts lead us,\u201d Biden said. He added: \u201cMy job is just to go beat him.\u201d Veronica Rocha contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The impact of impeachment faces a test on Tuesday as Kentucky voters head to the polls to select their next governor. Incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has cast himself as a close ally and defender of President Donald Trump, in a state the President won in 2016 by nearly 30 points. Republicans here hope that Trump\u2019s popularity in the state can carry Bevin, who is widely seen as unpopular, to victory over his Democratic challenger Andy Beshear. Democrats, on the other hand, hope that Bevin\u2019s unpopularity and a focus on local \u2013 not national \u2013 issues can lead them to victory on Tuesday. Key races to watch Tuesday in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia As the impeachment process ramps up in Washington, the Kentucky election will test whether Trump\u2019s base is energized enough to reelect an unpopular Republican incumbent. The governor has said a vote for him is a vote to punish the Democrats in Washington currently going after the President. On Monday night, Bevin attended a big get-out-the-vote rally with the President in Louisville, where impeachment was front-and-center. Behind Trump, supporters wore T-shirts with \u201cRead The Transcript\u201d written on them, a reference to the White House line that the partial readout of the President\u2019s call with the Ukrainian President absolves him of any crime. Democrats have pinned their hopes on Bevin\u2019s struggles. Bevin\u2019s popularity has dipped during his time governor after high-profile battles with public school teachers and supporters of Medicaid expansion passed into law by Bevin\u2019s predecessor Steve Beshear \u2014 father of the current Democratic nominee. CNN followed one Beshear-backing operative as he tried to convince swing voters to cast their ballot for the Democrat. Soren Norris is a professional organizer with Working America, the political arm of the AFL-CIO. His group focuses on working class, independent voters. They\u2019re not affiliated with any political party, but they support pro-union candidates which means if they\u2019re working in a race, it\u2019s probably on behalf of a Democrat. On the Sunday before Kentucky voters go to the polls in a hotly contested gubernatorial race, Norris was knocking doors, just has he has for the past 11 weeks or so. He said if Democratic nominee Beshear is going to win, it will be because the conversation is about local politics and not the impeachment fight echoed in Washington. \u201cFor this election, I don\u2019t think its changed much. It\u2019s not really on the forefront of the typical voters mind here in Kentucky, again they\u2019re focused on their kitchen table issues,\u201d Norris said . It\u2019s Republicans who\u2019d rather talk about Trump over anything else. As the impeachment inquiry has ramped up, Bevin has continued to tie himself to Trump . The Beshear supporters Norris connected with uniformly expected the Bevin strategy to work. \u201cProbably not here in Kentucky,\u201d Beshear supporter Rick Wanalista said when asked if the impeachment inquiry would help the Democrats. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad it\u2019s coming out.\u201d Teachers have proven to be among Bevin\u2019s toughest critics. Sharonda Morton is a middle school math teacher, and said many of her fellow educators are really hoping Bevin is replaced. But like many Beshear supporters on Norris\u2019 route Sunday, she wasn\u2019t expecting a Democratic win. Morton joked that no matter what the outcome, students in Kentucky should expect a day off Wednesday \u2014 either because teachers are staying home to celebrate a Bevin defeat or sulk because he was reelected. Norris focus is on working class swing voters, people who might consider themselves independents. MaryAnn Truman is one of those voters. She said she leaned Republican, but after some persuasion from Norris, she said she might change her mind. She voted for Trump and Bevin but now she doesn\u2019t like either one. Impeachment is far from her mind. \u201cImpeachment whatever, they\u2019re gonna do what they\u2019re gonna do,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want someone who is gonna stand up for us.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rep. Tim Ryan dropped out of the 2020 presidential race on Thursday, ending a campaign that failed to gain any traction in a large field of better-financed and better-known Democrats. In a video sent to his supporters, Ryan also announced that he will instead run for reelection to the House of Representatives. \u201cI am announcing today that I am withdrawing from the presidential campaign,\u201d Ryan said in the video. \u201cAfter seven long months of hard work I will be returning home to my family and friends and community in Ohio to run for reelection for my congressional seat.\u201d In photos: Former presidential candidate Tim Ryan Ryan had hoped his candidacy would re-focus Democrats on the needs of working-class Americans in the Midwest, a group of people who largely drifted towards President Donald Trump in 2016. The Ohio Democrat touted himself as a \u201cprogressive who knows how to talk to working class people\u201d who hoped to convince once reliably Democratic voters that \u201d the progressive agenda is what is best for working families.\u201d \u201cAs a congressman from Youngstown, Ohio for almost 20 years, I\u2019ve watched the American Dream slip through the fingers of many Americans,\u201d Ryan said during his 2020 announcement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am running for President. It\u2019s time to do something.\u201d But that never happened for Ryan, who failed to make the debate stage in both September and October and struggled to raise money. Ryan raised a paltry $889,000 in the second quarter of 2019, a haul that paled in comparison to his competitors, some of whom raised in the tens of millions. \u201cI got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country: The workers who have been left behind, the businesses who have been left behind, the people who need health care or aren\u2019t getting a quality education, or are saddled by tremendous debt,\u201d Ryan said in the video. \u201cI\u2019m proud of this campaign because I believe we\u2019ve done that. We\u2019ve given voice to the forgotten communities and the forgotten people in the United States.\u201d Ryan\u2019s campaign announced in October that they raised $425,000 in the third quarter, another small haul that raised questions about how Ryan was able to keep paying his staff. Ryan only raised $1.3 million throughout his entire presidential bid, according to Federal Election Commission reporters. Ryan, who has served in Congress since 2003, began considering a 2020 bid in 2018, as he traveled across the country stumping for Democrats running for office and, indirectly, testing the waters on a presidential bid. Ryan entered the presidential race as a longshot candidate with less name recognition than most candidates and a far smaller political network, two issues that eventually sunk his campaign. Ryan will now return to the House, where he had previously made a name of himself because of his opposition to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi holding a leadership position. But those efforts have failed, and even Ryan voted for Pelosi earlier this year when Democrats picked their next House leader after taking back the chamber in 2018. \u201cWhile it didn\u2019t work out quite the way we planned, this voice will not be stifled. I will continue to advocate and fight for the working people of this country \u2013 white, black, brown, men, women,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThere\u2019s people who get up every day, take a shower after work sometimes, that are working really hard. And we\u2019re going to continue to fight for making sure that those workers are treated fairly, and that they have access to good health care, that they have a solid pension to retire on.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In the wake of a recent \u201cKeep America Great\u201d rally in Minneapolis, President Donald Trump tweeted this: \u201cWe are going to fight with all of our heart and soul and we are going to win the great state of Minnesota in 2020.\u201d But probably not actually, at least according to a new poll conducted for the Minneapolis Star Tribune and released Monday. In it, Trump trails both former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren by double-digits in the state while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders holds a 49% to 40% edge over the incumbent. Those wide margins are a far cry from Trump\u2019s near-miss in Minnesota in 2016 when he lost by\u00a044,000 votes out of more than 2.6 million cast \u2013 one of the closest margins in the country. Now, it\u2019s currently October 2019, not November 2020. And as J. Patrick Coolican of the Strib noted in a recent piece that Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign\u00a0is already spending heavily in a state that has two things that should work in Trump\u2019s favor: 1) A large number of white, working-class voters and 2) a booming economy. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Even so, these poll numbers have to put something of a damper on the Trump campaign\u2019s much-publicized hopes of putting Minnesota in their column. That same Star Tribune poll put Trump\u2019s job approval at just 40%, a very tough starting place to begin a winning campaign. To be clear: Trump doesn\u2019t need to win Minnesota to get reelected. He didn\u2019t win the state in 2016 and won the Electoral College relatively easily. The bigger issue here for Trump is whether his numbers in Minnesota are indicative of a broader weakness across the industrial Midwest \u2013 Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin \u2013 where he won the 2016 election.\u00a0Trump\u2019s job approval numbers in these states has been consistent with the numbers in the Star Tribune poll for at least the last year. If that trend continues, his path to a second term narrows significantly. The Point: Trump\u2019s 2020 electoral map is already quite narrow. If his Minnesota numbers indicate a broader softening in the region, look out.",

            "article_content": "As details emerged Thursday about the tentative United Auto Workers agreement with General Motors, one thing became clear: The shuttered GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that President Donald Trump hoped to save will stay closed for good. The President cast himself in 2016 as a savior for workers, taking the unusual tack of publicly pressuring corporations like Carrier into changing their plans for moving or changing production. But despite months of demands, Trump has been unable to get GM to keep jobs at Lordstown. Trump zeroed in on the Ohio plant because of his promise to working-class voters that he would revive US manufacturing, keeping jobs in the United States. With that promise, Trump won Ohio and did well with voters in Mahoning Valley \u2013 a key to securing the election in 2016. In 2017, Trump went to Youngstown, 15 miles down the road from the Lordstown plant, and promised residents that manufacturing jobs would be returning to the region, telling the crowd: \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t sell your house.\u201d GM worker Ernie Long heard that speech while he was still at the Lordstown plant. \u201cHe said don\u2019t sell your house, and look, now I got to sell my house that I just built three years ago,\u201d said Long, who was at the plant for 11 years. He\u2019s still a member of his union \u2013 Local 1112 \u2013 but is injured and not currently working. Lordstown, which manufactured the Cruze sedan, closed on March 6, leaving 1,600 people without jobs. GM says it has relocated 1,300 hourly employees \u2013 but some moved hoping their old plant would reopen under a new union contract with GM. The deal reached this week, however, doesn\u2019t include any provision for that. \u201cSo many people left the community with the thought in their mind that, you know what? Our union\u2019s strong and our union\u2019s going to get us back to work in Lordstown one day,\u201d said Tommy Wolikow, a former Lordstown worker. \u201cTo hear this news that we might not get another General Motors product, it\u2019s just devastating.\u201d Administration officials heralded the end of the GM strike Thursday, sidestepping the Lordstown issue. White House Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro told CNN on Thursday that the agreement will \u201cimprove the lives of working men and women throughout the Midwest and beyond for where the supply chain spreads.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to get it (an agreement) right for both sides, and I think they did that. They did a great job,\u201d he said. Lordstown is one of four GM plants slated to close by the end of 2020. The tentative agreement saves only one, a plant in Detroit. \u201cIt is with sadness that, with this agreement, three of those four facilities will close,\u201d said the union\u2019s summary of the deal\u2019s terms. Manufacturing activity in September fell to its lowest point in a decade.  The Rust Belt states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, which Trump flipped, have all lost manufacturing jobs since June. Many of those jobs have moved overseas.  In the last decade, GM has shifted jobs and product lines to Mexico because of lower manufacturing costs. \u201cGM is committed to future investment and job growth in the state of Ohio,\u201d GM said in a statement. \u201cProjects planned for the Mahoning Valley include the opportunity to bring battery cell production to the area, which would create approximately 1,000 manufacturing jobs.\u201d But Trump has been specific about the Lordstown plant itself. \u201cI want jobs to stay in the U.S.A. and want Lordstown (Ohio), in one of the best economies in our history, opened or sold to a company who will open it up fast!\u201d Trump tweeted in March shortly before the plant closed. He also called GM CEO Mary Barra to discuss Lordstown. \u201cJust spoke to Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors about the Lordstown Ohio plant, I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING,\u201d Trump said in another March tweet. \u201cI asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW Union \u2014 I don\u2019t care, I just want it open!\u201d Navarro pointed to the battery production facility as an encouraging sign and the administration anticipates, he said, that \u201cGM will do its best to make the Workhorse Group\u2019s plan to produce EV pickup trucks within the Lordstown facility footprint a UAW success story.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Polls show that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination. And on Tuesday night in Ohio, her 11 rivals acted like it. The party\u2019s fourth presidential debate, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, showcased the shifting dynamics of the Democratic primary. Warren was under attack all night \u2013 though it\u2019s far from clear whether anyone dented her status at the top of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the other front-runner, stayed out of the fray for much of the event \u2013 until a late clash with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that featured the same one-on-one, progressive-against-moderate battle that defined the 2016 Democratic contest. And moderate candidates \u2013 some, like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, fighting to climb into the top tier; others, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, just desperate to make the next debate stage \u2013 dropped the euphemisms and pressed their progressive foes in direct and sometimes personal terms. Here are seven takeaways from Tuesday night\u2019s debate: Warren\u2019s months-long march to the front of the polls finally put her in the position of being the most heavily targeted and scrutinized candidate on stage. Buttigieg and Klobuchar led the charge, assailing Warren over her answers on health care. Warren supports Sanders\u2019 proposal for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d \u2013 replacing private insurance with everyone receiving coverage through a government-run plan. And while Sanders has acknowledged that Americans\u2019 taxes would need to increase to pay for the plan, Warren refused to say whether the middle class\u2019s taxes would go up \u2013 instead only saying that, because deductibles, premiums and co-pays would be eliminated, overall costs would decrease. Buttigieg accused her of dodging a yes-or-no question. \u201cYour signature is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in,\u201d he said. Klobuchar accused Warren of being dishonest. \u201cWe owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice,\u201d she said. Warren later addressed the question of taxes, when former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke asked her \u2013 during a discussion about Warren\u2019s proposed wealth tax and child care coverage \u2013 whether she would raise middle-class taxes. \u201cNo,\u201d she said \u2013 but the moment was mostly lost amid cross-talk. And it had nothing to do with what happened on stage. In the debate\u2019s final moments, the Washington Post broke the news that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans to endorse Sanders. CNN then reported that two other members of the \u201cSquad,\u201d Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, will do the same. The pick-ups are huge. Some Democratic strategists think that outside of the Obamas, Ocasio-Cortez represents the most influential potential endorsement of the 2020 primary race. It also comes at a key moment for Sanders. Warren\u2019s months-long ascent, fueled in part by progressives as she advocated some similar policies to Sanders, was on display Tuesday night, when the rest of the field treated her as the front-runner. If Ocasio-Cortez had supported her, it could have been the beginning of the end of Sanders\u2019 chances. Instead, he gets a major injection of energy \u2013 and sends the signal that he\u2019s far from done yet. For most of the night, as Warren wore the biggest target, Biden slipped into the background. That changed near the end of the debate, when the field\u2019s top tier \u2013 Biden, Warren and Sanders \u2013 finally unloaded on each other. The question that loomed over their: Biden has a lengthy record \u2013 but is it one that\u2019s in line with where the Democratic electorate is now? It began when Biden touted his record in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, pressuring Republicans to vote for measures such as the federal stimulus package. \u201cWe all have good ideas. The question is who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done?\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not suggesting they can\u2019t, but I\u2019m suggesting that\u2019s what we should look at.\u201d That\u2019s when Sanders pounced, attacking Biden \u2013 in a moment that felt similar to the Vermont senator\u2019s 2016 debates with Hillary Clinton \u2013 over legislation Biden had supported and Sanders opposed over the last three decades. \u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what, you also got done, and I say this as a good friend,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like NAFTA and (trade relations) with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.\u201d Then Warren jumped in. Responding to Biden\u2019s assertion that he is best able to get things done, she pointed to her role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration. Seemingly miffed to be denied a share of the credit, Biden interjected, nearly shouting, \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Warren responded by thanking Obama \u2013 but notably omitting Biden. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,\u201d she said. For the former vice president, fading into the background of a debate is a troubling sign because of what it suggests: that his foes view him as less of a threat than they once did. But just as the good news had come late for Sanders, the real bad news for Biden\u2019s campaign came even later Wednesday night. In a scheduling oddity, reports covering the third quarter of 2019 were due in to the Federal Election Commission by midnight \u2013 an hour after the debate ended. Biden\u2019s report revealed that his campaign ended September with just $9 million on hand. That\u2019s far short of Sanders\u2019 $33.7 million, Warren\u2019s $25.7 million and Buttigieg\u2019s $23.4 million \u2013 and is even below California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 $10.5 million. The South Bend, Indiana, mayor had made it obvious he planned to come out swinging. In the days before the debate, he\u2019d launched an ad that was critical of Warren and Sanders over Medicare for All, criticized Warren\u2019s grassroots fundraising strategy for the general election as being reliant on \u201cpocket change,\u201d and attacked O\u2019Rourke over his support for mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles in an interview on Snapchat\u2019s \u201cGood Luck America.\u201d The exchanges with Warren over health care might be the night\u2019s most memorable. But he also got a chance to tout an element of his own biography \u2013 his military service \u2013 in clashing with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, the only other military veteran in the field, over her call to end \u201cendless wars.\u201d \u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this President of American allies and American values,\u201d he said. Buttigieg also sharply criticized O\u2019Rourke \u2013 at one point, in personal terms \u2013 over the former Texas congressman\u2019s proposed mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles. Buttigieg to O'Rourke: 'I don't need lessons from you on courage -- political or personal' \u201cYou just made it clear that you don\u2019t know how this is going to take weapons off the street,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can develop the plan further, we can have a debate. But we can\u2019t wait.\u201d O\u2019Rourke responded that mass shootings are a \u201ccrisis\u201d and that Democrats should make the case for farther-reaching gun control measures. \u201cLet\u2019s decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and let\u2019s bring this country together in order to do that,\u201d he said. Buttigieg shot back: \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the polls, the problem is the policy. And I don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care what that meant to me or my candidacy,\u201d O\u2019Rourke replied. But to survivors of gun violence, and March For Our Lives, the gun control advocacy group founded by students after the Parkland, Florida, shooting last year, \u201cthat was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups,\u201d he said. Moments later, the organization tweeted praise for O\u2019Rourke\u2019s position. With the Democratic National Committee raising its fundraising and polling thresholds for the November debate, Klobuchar walked on stage facing the real possibility that this debate could be her last. Her response: Go hard at the Democratic primary\u2019s most ascendant candidate, Warren. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,\u201d she said of Warren at one point, as she criticized her support for Medicare for All. Klobuchar\u2019s performance on Tuesday stands in stark contrast to her first three debate performances, which were more muted. And there is a reason for that: After qualifying for the first four debates, Klobuchar is on the verge of not qualifying for the fifth Democratic debate in November. While Klobuchar has the required number of donors, she has yet to reach the polling threshold, something that her team believes she can boost with a well-reviewed debate. Then there\u2019s the portion of her approach that\u2019s in the eye of the beholder: One of her trademarks as a candidate \u2013 goofy humor \u2013 continued on Tuesday night. \u201cVladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t meddling. That\u2019s what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Andrew Yang launched his presidential campaign in 2017 with a plan to give every American $1,000 a month to combat job losses and automation \u2013 and very little attention from media and voters. Almost two years later, Yang\u2019s plan for a universal basic income, which he\u2019s calling a \u201cfreedom dividend,\u201d remains his signature policy proposal. But his impact on the race has increased dramatically \u2013 a reality that was on display on Tuesday night when the candidates on stage debated a universal basic income and job losses to automation in depth on national television. \u201cWe have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month, it recognizes the work in our families and communities. It helps all Americans transition,\u201d Yang said. \u201cWhen we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle up economy from our people, our families and our communities up. It will enable us to do the work that we want to do. This is the sort of vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace.\u201d Yang has talked about his universal basic income at previous debates. What made Tuesday different was that other candidates \u2013 some of whom largely ignored Yang in previous debates \u2013 began to seriously debate automation and a basic income. \u201cI believe that we need to address a community being impacted by automation,\u201d said former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. \u201cI agree with my friend Andrew Yang. Universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so people can make choices that they want to see,\u201d Gabbard said. But what clearly cemented Yang\u2019s rise is that the debate over universal basic income got him into a direct argument with Warren, who said the issue is broader. After the debate, Yang told CNN that Warren \u2013 who, with Biden, is at the top of the Democratic field \u2013 had asked him to send her details on his proposal. \u201cShe said she wanted to see the data,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders raised more than $25 million over the past three months, his campaign said Tuesday morning. The haul \u2013 up more than $7 million from his second quarter total \u2013 underscored Sanders\u2019 continued strength with small dollar donors. The campaign announced last week that it had received contributions from more than a million people. \u201cBernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations \u2013 both in the primary and in the general,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement celebrating the new figures. He also took aim at the press coverage of the campaign, which has struggled in recent early-state polling amid internal tensions over its strategy and spending. \u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign,\u201d Shakir said, \u201cand yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\u201d The campaign in a press release said that September had been its strongest fundraising month to date. Sanders spokesman Mike Casca also told CNN on Tuesday that about 130,000 people had signed up to make monthly recurring contributions and that 99.9% of its total donor base had not yet given the individual maximum of $2,800 per election \u2013 further signs that Sanders is well-positioned to keep up his current fundraising pace. Individuals who listed their occupation as \u201cteacher\u201d were the most frequent donors to Sanders, according to the campaign, which said \u201cthe three most common employers (of its contributors) were Starbucks, Amazon and Walmart.\u201d The average donation during the third quarter, the campaign said, was $18.07. Since entering the race in February, Sanders has raised $61.5 million, according to the statement. He also transferred an additional $2.6 million to his presidential coffers from other campaign accounts during the third quarter. On September 19, when the campaign announced that it reached the million donor mark, it highlighted contributions from voters in counties that backed former President Barack Obama in 2012 before flipping to President Donald Trump four years later. Sanders received 81,000 donations from those potentially decisive regions, the campaign said. Sanders recently concluded his \u201cBernie Beats Trump\u201d tour of Iowa counties that backed Obama twice before turning to Trump three years ago. Sanders raised $18.2 million from more than a half-million donors during the first 41 days of his campaign, nearly $6 million of it coming in on the day he entered the race. His pace slowed in the second quarter, which concluded at the end of June, but still brought in another $18 million. The impressive Sanders fundraising total comes on the heels of polling that suggests his campaign is stuck in neutral, as progressive rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren steadily gains ground on former Vice President Joe Biden. Shakir told CNN last week that the campaign was prepared to refocus its efforts to Iowa and New Hampshire, where Sanders has shown signs of fading. Despite the acknowledgment of a strategy shift, Shakir made it clear that Sanders\u2019 travels across the country, and the campaign\u2019s investment in resources beyond the early states, were key to his ability to keep his base activated \u2013 and giving. \u201cWe have a support network that is nationwide and is vital to our success,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cIt is important that we remain engaged with them and that they continue to feel vested in our campaign.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Unless you\u2019ve lived on another planet for the last five years, you know that Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t a big fan of the uber-wealthy. He\u2019s been railing against the detrimental effects of millionaires and billionaires on the nation\u2019s economy for years. But on Tuesday afternoon, Sanders took it even a step farther. In a tweet touting his newly unveiled plan to tax the ultra-wealthy, the Vermont senator wrote this: \u201cThere should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! No billionaires! As in, Sanders is going to tax them out of existence? That\u2019s not, at least according to my reading of the plan, what Sanders is actually proposing. Here\u2019s the basics of his ultra-wealth tax, according to his website: \u201cIt would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5 million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000. \u201cThe tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for singles. \u201cUnder this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class.\u201d So, Sanders\u2019 plan would significantly reduce the number of billionaires. It would not get rid of billionaires entirely. Except that, at least according to the tweet, the elimination of all billionaires is the end goal of Sanders\u2019 plan. Which is a political problem for Sanders. \u201cWait, what??\u201d tweeted Andy Lassner, an executive producer of \u201cEllen\u201d and a prominent liberal voice on Twitter, in response to Sanders\u2019 tweet. \u201cSo folks like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet who have committed their vast wealth to providing clean water around the world and obliterating Polio shouldn\u2019t exist? Oprah shouldn\u2019t exist?\u201d If that is the reaction from the liberal left, can you imagine what President Donald Trump and his allies will do with a line like, \u201cThere should be no billionaires?\u201d Trump, even at the United Nations on Tuesday, made his oft-repeated pledge that \u201cAmerica will never be a socialist country.\u201d Polling suggests that most Americans view billionaires suspiciously \u2013 a Bloomberg poll showed just 31% said they admired billionaires \u2013 but there is very little support for seeking to eliminate billionaires entirely or a large number of people who view the existence of billionaires as a policy failure by this country. Sanders\u2019 lean-in to this sort of treatment of the wealthy provides a real contrast not just to the likes of former Vice President Joe Biden but also to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has proposed her own tax on the extremely wealthy. \u201cI am a capitalist,\u201d she told CNBC\u2019s John Harwood in 2018. \u201cCome on. I believe in markets.\u201d Make no mistake: There is a segment within the Democratic primary who will love the idea of taxing billionaires into oblivion. But almost all of those people are already for Sanders. For everyone else in the party, they will likely see this for what it will be in the context of a general election in which Sanders is the nominee: The reddest of red meat for Donald Trump.",

            "article_content": "Even as he continues to publicly tout the strength of the US economy, President Donald Trump privately has begun to express concern over what has thus far been his strongest political asset. In recent weeks, Trump has instructed aides with increasing urgency to develop proposals to fortify Americans\u2019 flagging confidence in the economy, according to a half-dozen officials familiar with the matter. On the table are new tax cuts, a fresh push for final approval of the new North American trade pact and increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. In what officials describe as an \u201call hands on deck\u201d initiative, Trump and top aides \u2013 including son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner \u2013 have phoned business leaders to update them on the state of China trade talks and other economic efforts in an attempt at reassurance. Trump has instructed aides to have plans ready to roll out this fall in case the economic warning signs take a turn for the worse. At the same time, the President has taken new and at times confusing steps to project confidence on the issue he knows will likely determine his chances for a second term. And there are concerns time is running short. The new scramble reflects a reality setting in at the White House: The humming economy Trump has ceaselessly touted during his time in office may not last until Election Day in 2020. The irony is that much of the recent warning signs showing up in the economy are the result of the President\u2019s own trade war. New rounds of tariffs announced on China in the past few weeks have spooked markets and heightened uncertainty amid what were already declining levels of business investment. Bad economic news raises political risks for Trump On Friday, the government announced US companies added 130,000 jobs in August, a solid number but one that was still below expectations. While wages continued to rise, the total number of jobs added during the previous two months were revised down by 20,000. The economy has gained jobs for 107 consecutive months, but the pace of hiring has slowed recently. Eager to project confidence, Trump on Thursday tweeted \u201cReally Good Jobs Numbers!\u201d \u2013 despite the monthly jobs report coming out 24 hours later. The message was later explained away by aides as a reference to a separate report which showed private employers\u2019 payrolls growing, though initially officials admitted they weren\u2019t sure to what Trump was referring. The episode carried echoes of his claims a week earlier to have held phone conversations with Chinese officials that didn\u2019t happen in the way he claimed \u2013 a boast aides were initially confused by, and later admitted was meant to boost markets. Even as Trump presses aides to develop plans to strengthen consumer confidence, there is little sign he is willing to take the one step that could have the greatest effect: easing the trade war with China. Instead, he\u2019s insisted the US is well positioned to prevail in the standoff, even as there are emerging signs of trouble. Numbers out this week showed American manufacturing shrank for the first time in three years this summer. Although one month is not a trend, it was yet another data point that suggests a steady downturn at American factories. On Wednesday, US and Chinese negotiators spoke by phone to arrange the next round of talks, now expected in early October. It was taken by Wall Street as a sign of progress, even though the negotiations were originally meant to happen a month earlier. The development came after weeks of apparent stalemate, with neither side able to settle on dates or terms for the next meeting. Trump has pressed his trade team to make headway in the talks, even as he\u2019s shown no willingness to cede to China\u2019s demands that he lift tariffs. Instead, Trump has privately raised the idea of drastically increasing duties on China in a bid to force the country\u2019s hand, according to people familiar with the conversations. Even some of Trump\u2019s aides tacitly acknowledge that ending the trade standoff would be the single biggest step toward reinforcing the economy. In private, Trump has begun acknowledging that the protracted trade war may not be a winning political strategy, but is nonetheless the right thing for the country, according to a person who has spoken to him. But there are few people left in the President\u2019s inner circle willing to warn against escalating the trade war, according to current and former administration officials, leaving the loudest voices \u2013 like trade adviser Peter Navarro \u2013 with the most influence. Those who opposed a tariff regime, like then National Economic Council chairman Gary Cohn or Council of Economic Advisers chairman Kevin Hassett, have departed. Kushner and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who have taken a moderate position in internal debates over China, are now more likely to temper their arguments in front of Trump, according to people familiar with the matter. \u201cI think there is also a sense of reality that you can\u2019t change the opinion of someone on something they\u2019ve believed for 30 years and isn\u2019t really interested in listening to facts,\u201d one former senior administration official said. Trump now finds himself pulled in separate directions on China: either cede to a lesser deal and appear weak, or remain firm on tariffs and cause further economic uncertainty. Both options could be politically damaging, which has led Trump to order up other ways of boosting the economy. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to notch some wins and give stability to the economy in other ways, but stay with China until you get it right,\u201d said Clete Willems, a former White House trade official and partner at Akin Gump. The problem is that many of those wins require an act of Congress. That\u2019s true with the President\u2019s renegotiated North America trade deal, the  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which has been awaiting congressional ratification for months. Republican allies and congressional aides have privately expressed hope that amid economic uncertainty, Democratic members in districts Trump won will pressure House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to advance the new North American trade pact after lawmakers return from recess. Trump's NAFTA replacement would have modest but positive impact, report finds Inside the White House, there is a growing consensus that unless the measure is passed before November, 2020 political concerns will forestall any movement until Election Day. \u201cI think the longer we wait, the harder it gets,\u201d said Phil Cox, co-chair of the bipartisan Trade Works for America, which has worked to pressure lawmakers on USMCA\u2019s passage. \u201cWe certainly want to avoid getting into the heart of the presidential campaign, which means we need to get it done in the next few months and certainly before the end of the year.\u201d For much of the year, White House aides have said the passage of USMCA is their top legislative priority \u2013 only to see the agreement languish in a Democratic \u201cworking group\u201d as members pore over provisions they don\u2019t like. White House aides view successful passage of USMCA as an easier win than striking a trade deal with China \u2013 and believe it could provide leverage with the Chinese talks by demonstrating Trump\u2019s negotiating prowess. Still, while Trump himself advocates for the North American trade deal periodically, it\u2019s without the same fervor as his public comments about trade with China. That\u2019s intentional, according to people familiar with the matter, who said having Trump as the public face of the agreement would likely alienate the very Democrats needed for its passage. Instead, Trump has spent his time criticizing the Federal Reserve and intensifying his war with its chairman as markets fluctuated wildly in August. \u201cWhere did I find this guy Jerome?\u201d Trump tweeted Friday of his Fed chairman, Jerome \u201cJay\u201d Powell, who came recommended by Mnuchin in the fall of 2017. \u201cOh well, you can\u2019t win them all!\u201d Trump has demanded the Fed cut interest rates further, and the central bank will have an opportunity to do so at its next meeting in mid-September \u2013 which could buy Trump some time as his team works through ideas to stave off a slowdown. Among those ideas is a new tax plan, though one more focused on the middle class. After the 2017 tax cut was cast as a boon for the wealthy, Trump has insisted any new steps be seen as more beneficial for working people. That\u2019s led some advisers to explore a payroll tax cut, which would have a greater impact on working Americans. Trump hasn\u2019t signed off on the move, but has been engaged on debates over whether the cut might be necessary in the coming months. Aides have also weighed a proposal by Sen. Rick Scott, the Florida Republican who suggested reducing taxes by the same amount taken in from tariffs on China. But the specifics of that measure aren\u2019t final, and like other steps that would seek to reduce taxes on working Americans, would likely request congressional approval. While this all gets hashed out, the White House continues to project a public sense of \u201cWhat, me worry?\u201d when it comes to the economy. \u201cWe have no immediate urgency,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the National Economic Council Kudlow said on Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s no anti-recession policy-making because we don\u2019t see a recession.\u201d",

            "article_content": "More than $15 million. That\u2019s what Tom Steyer has spent on television and digital advertising in less than two months as he has raced to make a name for himself as a Democratic presidential contender. But on Thursday, the results were clear. Despite filling the television airwaves and the Facebook feeds of voters in early voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the billionaire hedge-fund founder had not cleared the last remaining obstacle to join next month\u2019s nationally televised debates: earning at least 2% support in four polls sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee. Steyer\u2019s troubles underscore a hard truth about politics: Money doesn\u2019t always matter \u2013 even if, like Steyer, you spend $365.6 million on political activities over the course of nearly a decade. The graveyard of American politics is littered with the doomed ambitions of the very rich. Just consider Linda McMahon, who spent a combined $99 million on two failed Senate bids. Or Meg Whitman, who plowed $144 million of her fortune into campaigning for California governorship in 2010 and still lost to Democrat Jerry Brown. Or, more recently, Bob Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive from New Jersey, whose $36 million investment failed to oust Democratic incumbent Bob Menendez from the US Senate last year. \u201cPart of it is that Americans fundamentally don\u2019t trust rich people,\u201d said Thad Kousser, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cAnother part of that is: They don\u2019t have that reservoir of familiarity and good feeling that some politicians enter any race with.\u201d But, as tax data released by his campaign on Thursday shows, Steyer is in a class of his own as a political donor-turned-politician. Tom Steyer likely to miss September debate stage after failing to hit 2% in new polls Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor, earned nearly $1.2 billion in gross income between 2009 and 2017 and plowed $365.6 million into political activities over that nine-year period, his campaign disclosed. That includes the millions he has invested into political organizations Steyer has created to fight climate change, engage young voters and, more recently, to encourage a reluctant Democratic establishment to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. His Need to Impeach organization alone has drawn the support of more than 8 million people \u2013 voter contacts he\u2019s now using to advance his presidential ambitions. But the spending that made Steyer one of the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest donors in recent years hasn\u2019t always translated into results at the ballot box. In the 2014 midterm elections, for instance, Steyer deployed tens of millions of dollars into seven Senate and governors\u2019 races. Just three of his favored candidates won. Two years later, he became the largest disclosed donor to outside groups active in federal races, according to a tally by the Center for Responsive Politics. Republicans won the White House and retained their grip on Congress. \u201cSteyer is kind of famous for spending lots of money on lost causes,\u201d said John Feehery, a Republican political strategist in Washington. \u201cI just don\u2019t think he has a constituency: There\u2019s only a certain number of billionaires who want to impeach Trump.\u201d Steyer\u2019s campaign officials did not immediately respond to an interview request this week. But Steyer and his allies have long argued that his behind-the-scenes work has paid off for his party. In the run-up to the 2018 elections that saw Democrats win back the House, Steyer boasted he had built the largest grassroots operation in the country, much of it focused on turning out the youth vote. His political groups employed 750 people during the midterms with operations on 420 college campuses. And Steyer himself has increasingly schooled himself in the art of retail politics. In photos: Presidential candidate Tom Steyer Ahead of the midterms last year, Steyer, a 62-year-old with still-sandy blond hair and a penchant for argyle ties, hit the road to headline dozens of town hall meetings, introducing himself to voters and working to become the face of the impeach Trump movement. Now, Steyer\u2019s aides say he has committed spending at least $100 million on his presidential bid in the hopes of toppling another billionaire, Trump, who defied political conventions to win the White House in 2016. Trump plowed $66.1 million of his real-estate and branding fortune into his presidential race, but his unorthodox campaign and his fame from \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d reality-show franchise set him apart from other wealthy contenders of years past. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bold to assume that you can come out of nowhere, never having held public office, and win the highest office in the land,\u201d Kousser said. \u201cOne person has done that, but that person came in with just a huge reputation.\u201d (Trump also didn\u2019t rely entirely on his real estate and branding fortune to win either. His money accounted for fewer than $1 out of every $5 that flowed into his campaign coffers in the 2016 election.) The other self-funder in the 2020 race for the Democratic nomination, former Maryland congressman John Delaney, didn\u2019t make the Houston debate stage, either \u2013 despite kicking off his campaign as early as 2017 and spending more than $19 million of his own money. Just 10 candidates will debate on a single night next month: former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar,  New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and businessman Andrew Yang. But Steyer\u2019s spending spree still could pay off later this fall ahead of a planned October debate. He\u2019s just one survey shy of the requirement that candidates register at least 2% in four DNC-sanctioned polls. On Wednesday night, his campaign aides expressed dismay that the the national Democratic Party did not include any qualifying polls from the early voting state of Nevada. The Facebook ads Steyer has run this week echo that theme, asking Democrats in states like Iowa and Nevada to sign a \u201cpetition\u201d with this message for the national party: \u201cWe need more polls.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Watch the Democratic presidential debates on CNN and CNNGo at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, July 30, and Wednesday, July 31. The second round of Democratic debates kicks off Tuesday night in Detroit with the primary\u2019s leading progressives, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sharing a stage with a handful of their most vocal moderate rivals. Warren and Sanders are both running on the promise of a universal health care program run by the federal government (\u201cMedicare for All\u201d) and a crackdown on powerful business interests, from Wall Street to the pharmaceutical giants. But they will be flanked at the Fox Theatre by a range of skeptics, from Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. The debate could also be the last best chance for former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke to deliver on the early promise of his campaign, which has floundered in the polls and with donors. O\u2019Rourke has signaled he will try to revive his bid with a more aggressive approach in Detroit as he tries to channel the excitement that drove his near-miss 2018 Senate campaign. Here\u2019s what to watch for in Tuesday night\u2019s debate: If it\u2019s debate night drama you\u2019re craving, both of these campaigns have a warning: look elsewhere. Sanders and Warren will be the highest-polling candidates onstage Tuesday. The pair run about even in a handful of early state surveys, and they share a similar message. While the demographic look of their support is different, it skews predictably left. If either is going to bring together a winning majority next year, they will need to build it up from a bedrock of dedicated progressive voters and activists. Your guide to where the 2020 Democrats stand on the issues That big picture imperative makes a dust-up over their real but relatively minor policy differences \u2013 like whether to forgive all student debt (Sanders) or much-but-not-all of it (Warren) \u2013 that much more unlikely. The better bet is that Sanders stresses his direct action approach to politics while Warren leans in to her detailed policy proposals. And the surest assumption might be that both are targeted by the moderate candidates lined up on either side of them. If the past few months have been any indication, Medicare for All will come under attack by the likes of Hickenlooper, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, Klobuchar and others. Buttigieg and O\u2019Rourke, too, could seek to contrast their support for modified takes on the plan \u2013 which allow some room for private insurers to operate \u2013 with the progressive standard, which does not. O\u2019Rourke roared into the campaign with a massive first quarter fundraising haul and the affection of Democrats around the country following his energetic and innovative, albeit unsuccessful, Senate campaign. But after a few months on the national stage, the energy is running low and O\u2019Rourke will need to turn it up to reinsert himself into the heat of the primary fight. That means a dialed up debate prep regimen and the promise of a more aggressive performance than the one he put on during the last debate in Miami. How to accomplish that without risking his generally affable, optimistic brand will be a challenge \u2013 and remains a mystery. He is ideologically to the left of the other low-polling candidates onstage, but to the right of Sanders and Warren, most notably on health care. How to watch the second Democratic presidential debate on CNN O\u2019Rourke could choose to zero in on Buttigieg, with whom he\u2019s sparred a bit over the last few weeks. But his most intense recent rhetoric has focused on President Donald Trump. With Trump\u2019s continued racist attacks on members of Congress, the Texan could try to direct his sharpest barbs at the White House \u2013 something no Democrat will hold against him. Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, free college, student debt forgiveness, stricter financial regulation, new taxes on the wealthiest Americans, trade and US policy in the Middle East \u2013 it will all come under intense scrutiny Tuesday night. The issues that Sanders mainstreamed during his 2016 presidential run and Warren has spent years advocating for have galvanized the base but also created clear dividing lines within the party. Tuesday night, with Sanders and Warren (literally) center stage, could turn into a referendum on the direction Democrats take going into their general election showdown with Trump. The arguments are familiar by now. Moderates like Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, Klobuchar, Hickenlooper and Delaney are warning that a turn left would allow Trump and the Republicans to label Democrats  as socialists. Progressives like Warren and Sanders argue that embracing the grassroots and turning out new voters is the way to win. And Buttigieg and O\u2019Rourke, whose views on the question seem to cut down the middle, are pushing for a more cautious move to the left. The fireworks, then, could come when the moderate faction begins to throw darts at Sanders and Warren, trying to poke holes in their agenda and convince Democrats that their path is doomed. Those broadsides will be met with equal and opposite force \u2013 embracing the fight is as core to the progressives\u2019 brand as the policies themselves. It\u2019s a debate-within-the-debate both Warren and Sanders will be glad to take on. Given the state of the horse race, there will also likely be jockeying among the moderates to land the harshest, or most memorable, blow. Their risk: drowning each other out. Their opportunity: emerge as a moderate alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden figures to have his hands full on night two, but he will also be present \u2013 as conjured up by his rivals \u2013 on Tuesday, especially when it comes to health care. The Sanders campaign has directed the lion\u2019s share of its attacks at the former vice president, who has been openly, and sometimes mockingly, skeptical of the party\u2019s move left and, specifically, the political prospects of Medicare for All. His objections and stated concerns have occasionally been misleading \u2013 like when he suggested a transition to single-payer could leave people with gaps in coverage \u2013 and quickly met with a series of stinging rebuttals from the Sanders team. Warren has been less obviously in search of fronts for engagement with Biden, but their history is no secret. He remains the standard-bearer for a Democratic Party she argues is out of touch with working-class voters and too closely aligned with the financial industry. Whether she calls out Biden by name or keeps her message more general, Warren \u2013 separated from him by a random draw for a second straight round \u2013 could still use the big audience to cast herself as the progressive wing\u2019s best answer to his politics. Biden\u2019s absence is less of a conundrum for the rest of the field, which is closer to him ideologically but far off his pace in the polls. For those candidates, the goal will be to offer up a similar policy agenda in what they hope is received as a more appealing \u2013 or at least younger \u2013 package. Buttigieg\u2019s candidacy is at a crossroads. The South Bend mayor is printing campaign cash, but his embrace of big dollar donors to supplement his grassroots support makes it difficult to measure precisely where he stands. Despite the strong fundraising numbers, he\u2019s mostly seen his polling flatten out. His campaign, though fundamentally strong so far out from Iowa caucuses, has yet to carve out a clear base of support. Amid that uncertainty, Tuesday\u2019s debate could represent a turning point. Buttigieg\u2019s politics don\u2019t fit neatly into the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive-moderate-centrist divisions. He has repeatedly rejected the most popular line of attack against Sanders, that the Vermont senator\u2019s democratic socialism would be used against the whole party. Buttigieg\u2019s rationale is that Republicans will lodge those charges against the nominee whomever it is, so the wiser path is, as he said recently in Iowa, to \u201cjust do what we think is right, make the case for it, and then let (the GOP) do what they want.\u201d But he does not support Medicare for All and has rejected the idea of free college. Buttigieg will have every opportunity to carve out his place on Tuesday to make his generational argument for change \u2013 and why he\u2019s the one to deliver it. In a campaign that has begun to see some consolidation of support around Biden, Sanders, Warren and Harris, it\u2019s an opportunity he simply can\u2019t pass up. Some of Buttigieg\u2019s most animating moments have come when he discusses his own faith and how it has guided his worldview. Those moments have distinguished him from the rest of the Democratic field. There will be one new face on the stage over these next 48 hours: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock. Bullock\u2019s late entry into the race saw him closed out of the Miami debates, but he qualified for the Detroit stage and will, on Tuesday night, be given his introduction to a national audience of Democratic voters. Even a cursory glance at his Twitter feed makes clear the message he\u2019s banking on to break through: that as the popular Democratic governor of a red state, he knows firsthand what it takes to operate effectively in a politically divided government. Whether that record will be enough to stir up the Democratic primary voter base is another question. Hickenlooper, a popular former governor from another Western state, has so far failed to catch on and the crowded debate stage will make Bullock\u2019s task that much more difficult. But all it takes, with so many months still before the first ballots are cast, is a moment \u2013 that one viral clip or exchange that so many candidates are after, but few can will into reality. Bullock is no firebreather, further complicating the task, so expect him to lean heavily on his status in Montana and hope that viewers come away wanting to know more.",

            "article_content": "Watch the Democratic presidential debates on CNN and CNNGo at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, July 30, and Wednesday, July 31. Six years after Detroit filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history, the Motor City is roaring back to life. The bankruptcy is in the rearview mirror. New development, spearheaded by Quicken Loans\u2019 billionaire founder Dan Gilbert, has transformed the downtown core. Fiat Chrysler recently announced plans to open the first auto assembly plant in Detroit in nearly three decades, bringing 5,000 jobs to the city. And this week, Detroit will get fresh attention when 20 Democratic candidates descend on the city for the second set of presidential debates of the 2020 election \u2013 putting a spotlight on its rebirth and the struggles it still faces. The Democratic National Committee-sanctioned debates, airing over two nights on CNN, also underscore the political clout of this Rust Belt state. Michigan twice voted to send Democrat Barack Obama to the White House before backing Republican Donald Trump by the narrowest of margins in 2016. Detroit\u2019s rebound \u201cis one of the most underrated stories in the nation,\u201d said veteran Michigan Democratic consultant Joe DiSano, who grew up outside Detroit in Macomb County, a traditional bellwether that backed Obama before flipping to Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s an amazing pride among Michiganders in the resurgence of Detroit because as Detroit goes, so goes the state,\u201d he said. The rapid economic growth, centered on downtown Detroit, has not touched all parts of the city, however. It still ranks as one of the nation\u2019s poorest large cities, with roughly 38% of its residents living in poverty. In some of its struggling neighborhoods, residents still grapple with foreclosures or having running water shut off over delinquent bills. In 2017, Detroit\u2019s violent crime rate ranked second among big cities, behind only St. Louis, Missouri. \u201cDetroit is not as bad as it used to be, but it\u2019s still not where it should be,\u201d said Luther Keith, a former Detroit News editor and columnist who now runs ARISE Detroit!, a neighborhood revitalization group. The Democratic presidential candidates \u201care coming to the epicenter of hope and despair at the same time,\u201d Keith said. In 2016, Trump became the first Republican presidential contender to win the state since 1988, defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by fewer than 11,000 votes out of 4.8 million cast. The road to the White House in 2020 runs through Michigan and the other Rust Belt states Trump captured to score an Electoral College victory even as he lost the popular vote to Clinton. Most political observers agree the Democratic presidential nominee likely would have to carry Michigan and its 16 electoral votes to deny Trump a second term. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that Republicans and Democrats are gearing up for an epic battle in the state. Priorities USA Action, the main Democratic super PAC focused on the presidential race, plans to spend $100 million to persuade voters in Michigan and three other battlegrounds \u2013 Florida, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2013 to reject Trump. This month, it launched a new round of digital ads in Michigan and other targeted states. The Michigan Republican Party, meanwhile, says it\u2019s now building its largest field operation ever in a presidential election, as it works to tie the state\u2019s economic recovery to Trump and his policies. \u201cBoth sides are treating (Michigan) as though it\u2019s absolutely critical,\u201d said Tom Shields, a Republican consultant in Lansing. \u201cDemocrats can\u2019t afford to lose it, and Republicans would love to win it.\u201d In his attempt for another campaign victory in the state, Trump could face stiff headwinds. Michigan Democrats made big strides in the 2018 midterm elections, winning the offices of governor, attorney general and secretary of state and picking up two US House seats. Macomb County, which swung to Trump in 2016, backed successful Democrat Gretchen Whitmer in last year\u2019s governor\u2019s contest. One of the new faces in Michigan politics this year is a top Trump target: liberal Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who was elected from a Detroit district long represented by John Conyers. Tlaib, one of just two Muslim women elected to Congress, has repeatedly called for Trump\u2019s impeachment. He\u2019s repeatedly attacked her and three other freshmen House members. This month, he tweeted that the four women of color \u2013 known as the \u201csquad\u201d on Capitol Hill \u2013  should \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries, drawing a formal rebuke from the House of Representatives. This week\u2019s debate, in Detroit\u2019s historic Fox Theatre, will take place in Tlaib\u2019s district, which includes parts of east Detroit, some of city\u2019s western suburbs and a chunk of downtown. Gilbert, whose Quicken Loans is the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lender, is central to Detroit\u2019s resurgence. The Detroit native bet big on the city in 2010 when he decided to move his corporate headquarters and 3,400 jobs to the heart of Detroit. Crime was so bad in the beginning that the company set up its own security \u201ccommand center\u201d to ensure workers\u2019 safety, said Bill Emerson, the vice chairman of Quicken Loans and CEO of Bedrock, the real-estate arm of Gilbert\u2019s empire. Today, Gilbert\u2019s network of companies employs 17,000 people in Detroit, and Bedrock owns more than 100 buildings in the city, most of them in the downtown core. \u201cDetroit is just a tough, gritty city,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cDan has said this for years: \u2018It\u2019s at the intersection of muscle and brains.\u2019 It\u2019s an area of the country where folks understand hard work \u2026 They are passionate about and committed to their city.\u201d Nowhere is Detroit\u2019s resurgence more evident than along the downtown stretch of Woodward Avenue, Detroit\u2019s main thoroughfare. National chains, such as eyeware retailer Warby Parker and fragrance store Le Labo, now occupy storefronts that struggled to attract shoppers a decade ago. Tucked among them, in a Bedrock-owned building: D\u00e9troit is the New Black, a sleek boutique and exhibition space owned by local designer Roslyn Karamoko. The Seattle native moved to Detroit in 2013, following stints in Washington, DC, Singapore and New York, where she was a fashion buyer. When she first relocated, friends told her, \u201d \u2018Detroit\u2019s so scary. Why are you moving there?\u2019 \u201d Karamoko recalled. \u201cBut it\u2019s great,\u201d she said. \u201cThe American Dream story is still possible here.\u201d \u201cI started this literally selling a few T-shirts to friends,\u201d she said, standing in the middle of her store, where she carries everything from the $29 T-shirts that bear her brand\u2019s name to $2,300 couture dresses. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can do this in any other city,\u201d Karamoko said. The redevelopment also is changing other close-in parts of Detroit. The QLINE, a street car funded by Quicken and a cluster of other businesses and private foundations, now connects the city center to Midtown, another rapidly transforming area.  A former skid-row district once known as Cass Corridor, Midtown today is dotted with loft apartments, a bar promoting its \u201cartisanal ale\u201d and a fashionable farm-to-table restaurant where diners can sip craft cocktails and eat seared octopus and beef tartare. Gilbert isn\u2019t the sole investor in Detroit. The Ilitch family, which made its fortune with the Little Caesars Pizza chain, is a longtime force in the city. The family owns the Detroit Tigers, the Red Wings, Little Caesars Arena, and the opulent, 1920s-era Fox Theatre. The Fiat Chrysler plant, slated for the city\u2019s east side, is just one of the new automotive investments headed to Detroit. Ford Motor Co. is undertaking a $350 million rehab of the city\u2019s iconic, and long-abandoned, central train depot \u2013 all part of an \u201cinnovation\u201d hub the company is developing in Corktown, a neighborhood west of downtown Detroit. Waymo, the self-driving car subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, recently announced it had picked Detroit for the final assembly work on autonomous vehicles. Chad Livengood, a senior editor at Crain\u2019s Detroit Business who has covered the city\u2019s bankruptcy and recovery, said some are wary of Detroit\u2019s heavy reliance on the auto industry and two wealthy families. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of basing the future on a few specific industries: Motors, mortgages and pizzas,\u201d Livengood told CNN. \u201cMy concern is that we are just going to be susceptible to the same boom-and-bust cycles that have afflicted Detroit in the past. We haven\u2019t quite diversified our economy enough to handle another long recession.\u201d The Detroit business community also is closely attuned to health news about Gilbert, who had a stroke in May. In the interview with CNN, Emerson said Gilbert, 57, is \u201cmaking great strides\u201d in his recovery. \u201cDan will be back, fully functioning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when.\u201d A drive through Detroit reveals a patchwork of prosperity and poverty. Newly built luxury apartments and stately Tudor mansions erected by auto barons in the last century sit within a mile or two of burned-out frame houses. On some streets, empty lots \u2013 overrun with tall grass and brush \u2013 outnumber homes, giving pockets of inner-city Detroit a strangely rural feel. The two-apartment house where Keith, 68, grew up in Detroit\u2019s near west side, is gone, lost to fire years ago. On the neighboring lot, runaway ivy scales the walls of a crumbling house. In his day, the working-class neighborhood was \u201can urban Mayberry,\u201d Keith said, filled with children playing baseball in the alley as parents headed to the auto plants for work. His father was a postal clerk. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see what this has become,\u201d he said, standing in the middle of his old street. Decades of setbacks \u2013 the long decline of the auto industry, riots in 1967, white flight to the suburbs, the collapse of city services \u2013 dramatically altered both Keith\u2019s street and what was once the nation\u2019s fourth largest city. Paige Field, 30, grew up across the street from the lot where Keith\u2019s home once stood and still lives there with her mother as she studies to become a licensed practical nurse. Amid all the decay, she sees signs of change. \u201cWe see people coming in and buying the houses,\u201d she said, gesturing to one abandoned home where a new owner has boarded up the windows and front door. A few miles away, two other native Detroiters, Darryl Chatman and Mike Nolan, sit outside a neighborhood soul food restaurant, taking a late-afternoon breather from their cleaning and construction business. Business for the duo is booming, Nolan said, as investors \u2013 some of whom live overseas \u2013 buy houses \u201cin bulk\u201d all over the city. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how great Detroit is,\u201d said Chatman, who returned to the city three years ago after 15 years in Birmingham, Alabama. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard-working city. You can always get your hustle on here. I think of it as a diamond in the rough.\u201d Keith has high hopes for his native city, too. The weekend after the presidential debate, ARISE Detroit! will stage its 13th annual neighborhood action day. It\u2019s a chance, Keith said, for people in all parts of Detroit to put their stamp on the city\u2019s revival. Events range from school-supply drives and painting projects to helping to weed urban gardens. \u201cThe Detroit comeback story is still being written,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Watch this story on The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer at 6 p.m. ET and on Anderson Cooper 360 at 8 p.m. ET. New documents obtained exclusively by CNN reveal that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange received in-person deliveries, potentially of hacked materials related to the 2016 US election, during a series of suspicious meetings at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. The documents build on the possibility, raised by special counsel Robert Mueller in his report on Russian meddling, that couriers brought hacked files to Assange at the embassy. The surveillance reports also describe how Assange turned the embassy into a command center and orchestrated a series of damaging disclosures that rocked the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States. Read the Spanish-language version of this story at CNN en Espa\u00f1ol Despite being confined to the embassy while seeking safe passage to Ecuador, Assange met with Russians and world-class hackers at critical moments, frequently for hours at a time. He also acquired powerful new computing and network hardware to facilitate data transfers just weeks before WikiLeaks received hacked materials from Russian operatives. These stunning details come from hundreds of surveillance reports compiled for the Ecuadorian government by UC Global, a private Spanish security company, and obtained by CNN. They chronicle Assange\u2019s movements and provide an unprecedented window into his life at the embassy. They also add a new dimension to the Mueller report, which cataloged how WikiLeaks helped the Russians undermine the US election. An Ecuadorian intelligence official told CNN that the surveillance reports are authentic. The security logs noted that Assange personally managed some of the releases \u201cdirectly from the embassy\u201d where he lived for nearly seven years. After the election, the private security company prepared an assessment of Assange\u2019s allegiances. That report, which included open-source information, concluded there was \u201cno doubt that there is evidence\u201d that Assange had ties to Russian intelligence agencies. UC Global did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Assange, a native of Australia, has always denied working for the Kremlin and has insisted that the source of the leaks \u201cis not the Russian government and it is not a state party.\u201d He also said he would have published damaging information about then-candidate Donald Trump if he had received it. The US announced criminal charges against Assange earlier this year for his role in the 2010 leaks of secret diplomatic cables and Pentagon war logs, which WikiLeaks got from then-US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. British police yanked Assange from the embassy in April. He is now serving a one-year prison term in London for skipping bail in the UK, while aggressively fighting extradition to the US. WikiLeaks did not respond to requests for comment. Assange\u2019s lawyers declined to comment. Assange maintains his innocence and WikiLeaks says the charges are \u201cthe worst attack on press freedom in our lifetime.\u201d Assange sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in June 2012 to apply for political asylum and avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced sexual assault allegations, which he denies. The decision to offer Assange asylum was made by then-Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, who claimed he was protecting Assange from \u201cpolitical persecution.\u201d The asylum also served two larger purposes: It heightened Ecuador\u2019s status on the world stage and brandished Correa\u2019s credentials as a leading US antagonist in Latin America. Initially the diplomats hoped to take Assange swiftly to Ecuador. But that plan stalled amid British refusals to allow Assange safe passage outside the embassy. So he settled in for a protracted stay. Though confined to a few rooms inside the embassy, Assange was able to wield enormous authority over his situation. From the outset he demanded (and was granted) high-speed internet connectivity, phone service and regular access to professional visitors and personal guests. This arrangement enabled him to keep WikiLeaks active, the documents said. Assange also issued a special list of people who were able to enter the embassy without showing identification or being searched by security. He was even granted the power to delete names from the visitor logs. To avoid surveillance cameras, Assange occasionally met guests inside the women\u2019s bathroom, according to the security reports. This all leaves open the possibility that additional sensitive meetings took place but are still secret. Quickly, the once-mundane diplomatic mission in the heart of London became a hotbed of tension and suspicion. Throughout Assange\u2019s stay at the embassy, Ecuador employed three security companies to conduct constant surveillance. Assange installed his own recording devices and used noise machines to stymie the snooping, according to the documents obtained by CNN. The task of controlling Assange proved difficult. Fistfights broke out between Assange and the guards. He smeared feces on the walls out of anger. Assange also maintained direct contact with senior officials in Ecuador, including former Foreign Minister Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, and regularly used those connections to threaten embassy staff, according to the surveillance documents and two Ecuadorian government sources who spoke to CNN. He claimed he could get people fired, even the sitting ambassador. Assange\u2019s authority appeared at times to rival that of the ambassador. In December 2013, Ambassador Juan Falcon\u00ed wrote a letter to Assange and said that \u201cyou cannot give instructions contrary to mine.\u201d CNN reached out to the four ambassadors who overlapped with Assange\u2019s time at the embassy. Only Falcon\u00ed would comment, saying the Ecuadorian government had never pressured him to give Assange special treatment and that he had established rules for Assange to follow. Several current and former Ecuadorian government officials, including Correa and Pati\u00f1o, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. While Correa was in office, he responded to criticism over harboring Assange by doubling down on the asylum offer and holding Assange up as a symbol of Ecuador\u2019s commitment to freedom of the press. Referring to Assange, Correa pointed out that \u201cthe icon of freedom of expression chooses to take refuge in the embassy of Ecuador,\u201d in a 2012 interview with RT en Espa\u00f1ol, a Spanish-language network controlled by the Kremlin. The Russian government operates television networks around the world to spread propaganda, and it reaches American audiences on its flagship English-language station, RT. Despite the years of strife, Assange was allowed to stay and prepared to wield his power when the moment was right. That moment came in summer 2016, a pivotal time in the US presidential campaign. By June, Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had emerged as the de facto nominees of their parties and were gearing up for what would be a bruising general election. The campaign took a historic turn on June 14, when the Democratic National Committee announced that it had been hacked and blamed Russia \u2013 which Trump dismissed as a farce. Assange was busy back at the embassy. That month, members of the security team worked overtime to handle at least 75 visits to Assange, nearly double the monthly average of visits logged by the security company that year. He met Russian citizens and a hacker later flagged in the Mueller report as a potential courier for emails stolen from the Democrats. Also in June, WikiLeaks secretly communicated with Russian hackers and Assange publicly announced plans to release new material about Clinton. The Mueller report says the Russian hackers obscured their identities by using online personas for all their communications with WikiLeaks, which included emails and direct messages to WikiLeaks\u2019 account on Twitter. Assange took at least seven meetings that month with Russians and others with Kremlin ties, according to the visitor logs. Two encounters were with a Russian national named Yana Maximova, who could not be reached for comment. Almost nothing is known about Maximova, making it difficult to discern why she visited the embassy at key moments in June 2016. During her two visits that month, she met with Assange in the middle of the day in the embassy\u2019s conference room. Assange also had five meetings that month with senior staffers from RT, the Kremlin-controlled news organization. US intelligence agencies have concluded that RT had \u201cactively collaborated with WikiLeaks\u201d in the past and played a significant role in Russia\u2019s effort to influence the 2016 election and help Trump win. For several months in 2012, Assange hosted a television show on RT. In June 2016, RT\u2019s London bureau chief, Nikolay Bogachikhin, visited Assange twice, and gave him a USB drive on one occasion, according to the surveillance reports. That five-minute visit was hastily arranged and required last-minute approval from the Ecuadorian ambassador. In an email to CNN, Bogachikhin said, \u201cRT has produced multiple programming featuring Mr. Assange. Within that process, everything that is intrinsically involved in the production of content took place.\u201d The RT bureau chief previously mocked reports about his visits with Assange, jokingly tweeting that he gave the WikiLeaks founder \u201ca whole bag of Novichok,\u201d the chemical weapon used last year to poison a traitorous ex-Russian spy who lives in the UK. Since Bogachikhin\u2019s post last year, he has remained silent on Twitter. Shortly after WikiLeaks established contact with the Russian online personas, Assange asked his hosts to beef up his internet connection. The embassy granted his request on June 19, providing him with technical support \u201cfor data transmission\u201d and helping install new equipment, the documents said. This was the same day Assange and his lawyers met with then-Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Guillaume Long, according to the surveillance reports. Long declined to comment for this story. It\u2019s unclear whether Assange told the Ecuadorians that WikiLeaks was working behind the scenes to acquire documents related to the US election. The US government has never publicly accused Ecuador of knowingly helping Assange or the Kremlin. As the election approached, security officials at the embassy noted that Assange released some of the hacked emails \u201cdirectly from the embassy,\u201d according to the surveillance documents. The Mueller report explicitly referenced that \u201cAssange had access to the internet from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, England.\u201d The rest of that paragraph is heavily redacted. It\u2019s unclear whether Mueller ever obtained these surveillance reports as part of his investigation. Mueller concluded that hackers from Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, known as the GRU, attacked Democratic targets in spring 2016 and removed hundreds of gigabytes of information. They created online personas \u2013 Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks \u2013 to transfer some of the files to WikiLeaks and publicly claim responsibility for the hacks, falsely disavowing any Russian ties. Mueller\u2019s team noted that it \u201ccannot rule out that stolen documents were transferred to WikiLeaks through intermediaries who visited during the summer of 2016.\u201d Assange has said a small group of associates helped him from the outside, but only to sift through the emails. The special counsel named one of those associates, German hacker Andrew M\u00fcller-Maguhn, and said he \u201cmay have assisted with the transfer of these stolen documents to WikiLeaks.\u201d The Mueller report appears to contain additional details about this possibility, but those portions were redacted because they contain classified information about sensitive investigative techniques. Assange has known M\u00fcller-Maguhn for years. The hacker even showed up as a featured guest on Assange\u2019s short-lived television show on RT in 2012, discussing the future of the internet and digital privacy. M\u00fcller-Maguhn is also involved in mainstream technology groups, and served on the board of ICANN, the international organization that governs internet domains. When contacted by CNN, M\u00fcller-Maguhn declined to comment about his meetings with Assange. He previously told The Washington Post that he was never in possession of the hacked materials before they were posted online. According to the surveillance reports, M\u00fcller-Maguhn visited Assange at the London embassy at least 12 times before the 2016 election. During a few of those meetings, M\u00fcller-Maguhn was accompanied by another well-known German hacker, Bernd Fix, the reports said. CNN was unable to reach Fix for comment. The Mueller report says that on July 6, WikiLeaks reached out to the Russian online personas with a request to send anything \u201chillary related\u201d as soon as possible, \u201cbecause the (Democratic National Convention) is approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind her after,\u201d referring to her opponent in the Democratic primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The trio of hackers \u2013 Assange, M\u00fcller-Maguhn and Fix \u2013 then gathered on July 14 for more than four hours on, according to the security logs. The special counsel\u2019s report indicates that on this date, Russian hackers posing as Guccifer 2.0 sent encrypted files to WikiLeaks, with the title \u201cbig archive.\u201d Days later, on July 18, while the Republican National Convention kicked off in Cleveland, an embassy security guard broke protocol by abandoning his post to receive a package outside the embassy from a man in disguise. The man covered his face with a mask and sunglasses and was wearing a backpack, according to surveillance images obtained by CNN. The security company saw this unfold on surveillance footage and recommended that the guard be replaced. But the Ecuadorian government kept him on the job. On that same day, according to the Mueller report, WikiLeaks informed the Russian hackers that it had received the files and was preparing to release them soon. It\u2019s not clear if these incidents are related, and the contents of the package delivered to the embassy are unknown. WikiLeaks released more than 20,000 files from the Democratic National Committee on July 22, and the emails exposed how top officials preferred Clinton and tried to undermine Sanders. The party\u2019s convention days later in Philadelphia dissolved into a chaotic mess. A week that had been designed to engineer party unity transformed into a near-mutiny and the DNC chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, was forced to resign. As Democrats tried to manage the fallout, Trump quickly upped the ante. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said on July 27, referring to Clinton\u2019s private server. Mueller said the Russians were listening after all, and tried for the first time to hack Clinton\u2019s office within hours of Trump\u2019s comment. While Trump and Clinton crisscrossed the country in the final weeks of the campaign, the Russians ramped up their efforts, and Assange was toiling away on another major project. Russian hackers, posing as DCLeaks, had reached out again to WikiLeaks and offered more materials, writing that \u201cyou won\u2019t be disappointed, I promise,\u201d according to the Mueller report. They later transmitted 50,000 emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s inbox. The special counsel report pinpoints a potential date for the data transfer: September 19. On that day, Assange met again with M\u00fcller-Maguhn and the security guards observed Assange installing new computer cables in his room, according to the documents obtained by CNN. WikiLeaks started releasing Podesta\u2019s emails on October 7 and released new batches nearly every day before the November election. The media covered all the embarrassing details, including transcripts of Clinton\u2019s closed-door Wall Street speeches, sniping from staffers about her \u201cterrible\u201d instincts and frustrations about overlap between business and charity, which they dubbed \u201cBill Clinton Inc.\u201d Trump touted the new leaks at nearly every stop on the campaign trail in the final weeks of the race, sometimes reading directly from emails and seizing on thinly sourced conspiracy theories. \u201cThis just came out \u2013 WikiLeaks! I love WikiLeaks,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state that he carried by less than 1% of the 6.1 million votes cast statewide. Kremlin-backed outlets, including RT, breathlessly amplified the leaks on social media. On at least two occasions, RT even published articles detailing the new batches of emails before WikiLeaks officially released them, suggesting that they were coordinating behind the scenes, which they deny. Not long after the Podesta emails began trickling out, with the election fast approaching, the US government raised concerns with Ecuadorian officials that Assange was using their diplomatic mission in London to help the Russians interfere in the 2016 election, a former US official familiar with the matter told CNN. The US protest came with an implicit warning: Stop Assange or there will be consequences for Ecuador, just like there would eventually be consequences for the Russians for meddling in the election, and for Assange too, according to the US official and documents obtained by CNN. Facing this ultimatum, Ecuadorian officials in the capital city of Quito decided on October 15 to cut Assange off from the outside world, shutting down his internet access and telephone service. Even this didn\u2019t stop the deluge of email releases, which WikiLeaks continued pumping out every day until the election. Ecuador soon released a public statement condemning WikiLeaks\u2019 involvement in efforts to interfere with the US election but reaffirmed its commitment to protecting Assange. As this geopolitical saga unfolded, the Ecuadorian Embassy received calls from other countries asking about potential US retribution and Assange\u2019s physical safety, the security reports said. The situation intensified three days later. The security documents lay out a critical sequence of events on the night of October 18. Around 10 p.m., Assange got into a heated argument with then-Ecuadorian Ambassador Carlos Abad Ortiz. Just before midnight, Abad banned any non-diplomatic visitors to the embassy and left the building. Behind the scenes, Assange communicated with the foreign minister in Quito. Within an hour of Abad\u2019s departure, he called the embassy and reversed the ban. By 1 a.m., two WikiLeaks personnel arrived at the embassy and started removing computer equipment as well as a large box containing \u201cabout 100 hard drives,\u201d according to the documents. Security officials on site wanted to examine the hard drives, but their hands were tied. The Assange associates who removed the boxes were on the special list of people who couldn\u2019t be searched. The security team sent a memo back to Quito raising red flags about this late-night maneuver and said it heightened their suspicions about Assange\u2019s intentions. US intelligence agencies have said from the very beginning that WikiLeaks got the stolen emails from the Russian government, which Mueller also alleged in his indictment against a dozen Russian hackers. But the suspects are all living safely in Russia, so the US will likely never publicly produce a smoking gun or prove in court that Russia worked with WikiLeaks. Trump was inaugurated in January 2017 and continued to question whether Russia had meddled in the election. Assange\u2019s internet access was restored after the election, and he continued to meet with hackers as well as an American lobbyist representing a prominent Russian oligarch. In Ecuador, Correa\u2019s presidential term ended in May 2017 and he was succeeded by Len\u00edn Moreno, a close ally who had been his vice president for more than six years. But after Moreno was elected, he quickly turned against Correa and started undoing many of his policies, including his friendly relationship with Assange. Justice Department lawyers secretly prepared a criminal case against Assange for the Chelsea Manning leaks. Federal prosecutors even turned to a controversial law to target Assange for actively soliciting and publishing classified materials, which is typically protected under the First Amendment. In April of this year, Moreno revoked Assange\u2019s asylum and said Assange had \u201cviolated the norm of not intervening in internal affairs of other states.\u201d This cleared the way for British police to forcibly remove Assange from the embassy when the first US charges were unsealed. Assange hasn\u2019t been accused of any crimes related to his actions in 2016. He remains in a UK prison, awaiting what will likely be a grueling battle over his extradition to the US, where he could face spending the rest of his life in prison. Meanwhile, he still has allies in Russia. Within hours of Assange\u2019s arrest, senior officials from President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government rushed to Assange\u2019s defense and slammed the US for infringing his rights, declaring that, \u201cThe hand of \u2018democracy\u2019 squeezes the throat of freedom.\u201d CNN\u2019s Laura Weffer, Alfredo Meza and Evan Perez contributed to this report.Timeline graphics by Tal Yellin.

            "article_content": "Tune in to \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d at 7 p.m. ET for more on this story. Sen. Bernie Sanders is a top contender in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, but for most of his career in public life, he was a fierce critic of the party and its standard-bearers. In one speech in 1989, Sanders said that the Democratic Party could not be turned around and that it was impossible to build a progressive movement within the party. More than two decades later, in 2011, he suggested that the party should change its name to the \u201cRepublican-lite\u201d party. Sanders\u2019 derision of the Democratic Party was discussed during his unsuccessful 2016 presidential run. But the little-known1989 speech reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile reveals the depth of Sanders\u2019 criticisms of the party he has now pledged to represent if he becomes the Democratic nominee in 2020. And though Sanders has endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate in every election the 1980s, including campaigning to elect Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, his past criticism of Democrats has fueled some of the continued skepticism of his candidacy from the more establishment wing of the party. But his comments also highlight how much the Democratic Party has shifted to the left in recent years \u2013 and the central role Sanders himself has played in that transformation. Before seeking the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, Sanders said he would not run as an independent, saying he refused to be \u201ca spoiler\u201d who would elect a Republican. When he was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination that year, he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press he no longer believed politics had to be changed from outside the Democratic Party. And, his stronger-than-expected challenge to Hillary Clinton showed that an insurgent, progressive movement could drive the conversation around policy and politics within the party. \u201cThere was a rightward drift in the Democratic Party in the \u201980s and \u201890s,\u201d Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign, told CNN. \u201cThe rank and file of the party has rejected\u201d that ideology. Weaver added that Sanders had been \u201cworking within the institution of the Democratic Party since he\u2019s come to Washington, DC. I don\u2019t think that this is something new for him. I think the critiques that he has leveled are critiques that many Democrats, including other contenders for the nomination, are leveling at this time, as well.\u201d Sanders leveled some of his most pointed critique at the Democratic Party in remarks he made to the National Committee for Independent Political Action in New York City on June 22, 1989. \u201cI know that there are people, good and honorable people, people who are friends of mine, who believe that the Democratic Party can be turned around. I don\u2019t,\u201d Sanders said, according to an edited transcript published in the December edition of Monthly Review, an independent socialist magazine. \u201cIt is absolutely imperative that the progressive movement raise the issues and the analyses which will educate the people of our nation to begin to understand what the hell is going on,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I honestly don\u2019t believe that that can take place within the Democratic Party.\u201d When Jesse Jackson ran for president in 1988, Sanders backed him but said he did not agree with Jackson about working within the party system. \u201cIs Jesse Jackson\u2019s presence good or bad?\u201d Sanders said to The Gadfly, a student newspaper of the University of Vermont, in 1987. \u201cI think you would have to be crazy not to understand that Jackson has had an important impact on the American political scene. I am not a member of the Rainbow Coalition. I am a member of the Progressive Coalition. I do not agree with Jesse Jackson on all of his issues by any means and I disagree with working within the Democratic Party, okay?\u201d Throughout much of the 1990s, Sanders struck a similar tone when talking about the Democratic Party. \u201cNow my own view, and it has been my view for many, many years, is that what we need in this country is what Jackson calls a Rainbow Coalition, but it has to be done outside of the Democratic Party,\u201d Sanders told a local Democratic Socialists of America group in 1991. \u201cI think that nationally, the party has on issue after issue sold out so many times that if you go before the people and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m a Democrat,\u2019 you don\u2019t usually generate a lot of enthusiasm.\u201d In a C-SPAN appearance from 1995, Sanders addressed a caller\u2019s concern that the Democratic Party strayed too far from its roots by saying that Democrats are so conservative they would no longer fit into President Harry Truman\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cRead what Harry Truman said in 1948,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cTruman was a moderate Democrat. The progressives were upset about him because he was too conservative. He said things about the class structure of America in 1948 virtually no Democrat will say today. And what has been said often enough \u2014- you don\u2019t need another Republican Party. We need a party to speak for the vast majority of the people whose standard of living is in decline. The gentleman makes a very good point.\u201d During the 2000 election, Sanders initially declined to say if he would support Vice President Al Gore. In May 2000, he introduced Ralph Nader at an event during the candidate\u2019s swing through Vermont when he was seeking the Green Party nomination. \u201cHe\u2019s an old-fashioned guy who believes that maybe the ordinary people should be running this country rather than the multinational corporations,\u201d Sanders said as he introduced Nader at an event in Montpelier, according to the Associated Press. In August of that year, Sanders called the Democratic ticket the most conservative put forth by Democrats in many years. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that there is great dissatisfaction on the part of progressives,\u201d Sanders said, according to the Associated Press. \u201cThe Democratic ticket is probably the most conservative ticket that the Democrats have brought forth in many years.\u201d Still, Sanders declined to say if he was supporting Gore or Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the race, saying he feared George W. Bush could get elected to the White House. \u201cIs that the right decision or is it the right decision to vote for the ideologically weaker candidate, in terms of Gore, but make sure that a guy like George Bush does not get elected president and we don\u2019t run the possibility of Republican control of the House, the Senate and the White House,\u201d Sanders said. In the last week of the election, Sanders said in a radio debate he would support Gore. After the election became contested, he criticized Nader for playing spoiler to Gore. In his Senate races in 2006, 2012 and 2018, Sanders ran for the Democratic nomination in Vermont, but declined it after winning to run as an independent without a Democratic Party \u2013 a move supported by the Vermont Democratic Party. Still, he maintained his sharp criticism of the party, attacking the party over any cuts to social programs and saying he might encourage a primary challenge to President Obama in 2012. In November 2011, Sanders criticized Democrats for their response to the Budget Reform Act of 2011, saying the super committee to develop a deficit reduction plan shouldn\u2019t look at cuts in social security or Medicare. \u201cMy suggestion was literally to the Democratic leadership, simply change the name of the party from the Democratic Party to the Republican-lite versus Republicans and say, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re bad, but we\u2019re not as bad as these guys,\u2019\u201d said Sanders on the Thom Hartmann Program. Speaking with WNYC radio in January 2013, shortly after Obama\u2019s reelection, Sanders said he didn\u2019t believe that Obama was a progressive. \u201cNo. Oh, I think he\u2019s a pretty honest guy and the president, as you may recall, just a few weeks ago said that if we were in the 1980s, he would have been considered something like a moderate Republican,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s kind of a centrist somewhere in the middle of the Democratic Party. But no, I don\u2019t think he is a progressive.\u201d \u201cI was very disappointed in terms of his unwillingness to be more aggressive in standing up to what has increasingly become a right-wing extremist Republican Party,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd he really hasn\u2019t, to my mind, done that effectively.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders has long bathed in the antipathy of his political enemies. Now, he\u2019s using their unkind words to bolster his progressive credentials in the heat of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. The Sanders campaign on Wednesday unveiled a new page of \u201canti-endorsements\u201d on its website \u2013 a list of a dozen wealthy businessmen and one centrist think tank \u2013 who have publicly criticized him and his agenda. In a speech last month, Sanders quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who once said of his industrialist rivals, \u201cThey are unanimous in their hate for me \u2013 and I welcome their hatred.\u201d Throughout the campaign, Sanders has channeled that sentiment, highlighting attacks from wealthy adversaries and establishment figures in fundraising pitches and stump speeches. Their opposition, Sanders argues, is evidence that he can be trusted to fight against their interests, whether it means taxing Wall Street or agitating for higher wages at companies like Walmart. \u201cIt should come as no surprise that corporate CEOs and billionaires have united against our movement. These people have a vested interest in preserving the status quo so they can keep their grip on power and continue to exploit working people across America,\u201d Sanders said in a statement following the rollout. \u201cWe welcome their hatred.\u201d Not included on the initial launch page was billionaire media mogul Haim Saban, who flayed Sanders in a profile published earlier Wednesday by The Hollywood Reporter, calling the Vermont independent a \u201cdisaster zone.\u201d \u201cI profoundly dislike Bernie Sanders, and you can write it,\u201d Saban, who got his wish, told the magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t give a hoot. He\u2019s a communist under the cover of being a socialist. He thinks that every billionaire is a crook. He calls us \u2018the billionaire class.\u2019 And he attacks us indiscriminately.\u201d The Sanders campaign, as promised, welcomed Saban\u2019s opinion, with a number of staffers happily amplifying his statement on social media. By later in the afternoon, the website was updated \u2013 and Saban\u2019s face was at the top of the list. Quoting Roosevelt again, Sanders on the new page asks \u201cyou to judge me by the enemies I have made.\u201d The roster promoted by the campaign includes billionaire Home Depot co-founders Kenneth Langone and Bernie Marcus; Bob Iger, the Disney CEO Sanders clashed with over worker pay; and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whom Sanders zeroed in on last month as among the prime beneficiaries of \u201ccorporate socialism.\u201d The roster also names former Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and Third Way, a centrist group whose leaders have denounced Sanders\u2019 platform, dismissing it as outside the mainstream and warning against his potential nomination to lead the Democratic party into the 2020 general election. Responding to a recent broadside from Third Way \u2013 which isn\u2019t backing a candidate yet \u2013 Sanders declared in a tweet: \u201cThe cat is out of the bag. The corporate wing of the Democratic Party is publicly \u2018anybody but Bernie.\u2019 They know our progressive agenda of Medicare for All, breaking up big banks, taking on drug companies and raising wages is the real threat to the billionaire class.\u201d Sanders has been consistent over the years in his desire to name and shame powerful interests, particularly those he views to be seeking outsized or undo influence on the political process. When the candidates at an October 2015 primary debate were asked by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper to name the enemy they were \u201cmost proud of,\u201d Sanders offered up a familiar slate. \u201cAs someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in Washington,\u201d he said, \u201cI would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my list of people who do not like me.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The extended battle over the Affordable Care Act will push deeper into uncharted waters Tuesday, when lawyers from a coalition of Republican-controlled states and the Trump administration argue for overturning the law in a federal court. With this legal challenge \u2013 and promises from President Donald Trump that he will try again to rescind the law if he\u2019s reelected in 2020 \u2013 Republicans are prolonging the political struggle against the Affordable Care Act to an unprecedented extent. These new threats to the ACA are coming more than nine years after then-President Barack Obama signed it into law in March 2010. None of the other pillars of the American social safety net \u2013 Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid \u2013 faced efforts to repeal them nearly so long after they were instituted. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t a precedent for this kind of long-range battle,\u201d says Donald F. Kettl, a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. The political and policy stakes in this struggle are enormous. If the Trump administration and Republican-controlled states win their legal effort to completely invalidate the law, 20 million people would lose health insurance, and hospitals and other health care providers would be forced to provide $50 billion more in uncompensated medical care in just the first year, according to projections by the nonpartisan Urban Institute. \u201cIt would be a devastatingly disruptive change to both health care providers and to consumers,\u201d says Linda Blumberg, an institute fellow at the Urban Institute. Here's how Obamacare has changed America The political consequences could be just as seismic. In 2018, Democratic promises to defend the ACA \u2013 particularly its provisions guaranteeing coverage for patients with preexisting conditions \u2013 were key to the gains that swept them back into control of the House of Representatives. Now the Trump administration and an 18-state coalition led by Texas are appearing before the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday to argue that those protections, and the rest of the ACA, should be invalidated. If the 5th Circuit agrees, the Supreme Court likely would be forced to decide the law\u2019s fate next June \u2013 with the presidential campaign in full swing. \u201cIt is Trump\u2019s nightmare, that at the height of the 2020 campaign he could be in the Supreme Court trying to overturn protections for people with preexisting conditions,\u201d says Democratic consultant Jesse Ferguson, in a verdict privately echoed by many GOP strategists. \u201cI think people underestimate what this could all mean.\u201d In addition to the administration\u2019s legal challenge, Trump has repeatedly declared that he will again try to legislatively repeal and replace the law if he\u2019s reelected and Republicans regain unified control of Congress in 2020. That means the GOP will almost certainly run in 2020 on repealing the ACA for the third consecutive presidential election, after Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012 pledged to undo the law. The Republican-led House voted repeatedly to repeal the law during Obama\u2019s final years in office, and in 2017 Trump and Republican leaders passed repeal through the House and came within one vote of rescinding the law in the Senate. The latest challenge crystallized when a conservative federal district judge last December upheld the argument from the coalition of GOP states that the entire law should be dismissed after Congress effectively eliminated the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0 in the 2017 tax law. After initially taking a narrower position, Trump\u2019s Justice Department has now joined the states in arguing to the appellate court that the entire law should be thrown out. A coalition of 20 states led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is spearheading the legal effort to defend the law. Nothing like this prolonged trench warfare followed passage of the social safety net\u2019s other central strands. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Social Security into law in 1935, for instance, the 1936 Republican presidential nominee, Alf Landon, called the new law \u201ca cruel hoax\u201d and ran on repealing it. But after Landon won only two states, Republicans essentially conceded the fight. The next GOP nominee, Wendell Willkie, ran in 1940 on expanding Social Security. And while Republicans in Congress continued guerrilla efforts to retrench the law through the 1940s, the party never again seriously contemplated trying to eliminate it. The fight over Medicare, the giant federal health care program for the elderly, fizzled even more quickly. Barry Goldwater, the staunchly conservative GOP presidential nominee in 1964, fiercely opposed Medicare. But once Congress created it \u2013 with 13 Republicans in the Senate and 70 in the House voting yes \u2013 and President Lyndon Johnson signed it into law in 1965, opposition collapsed almost immediately. Richard Nixon, the GOP presidential nominee in 1968, treated Medicare as settled law and did not propose to repeal it; indeed, no Republican presidential nominee ever ran on repealing Medicare. Medicaid, the federal-state partnership to provide health care for the poor, was more controversial, but within seven years of its passage, every state except Alaska and Arizona had committed to participate \u2013 and both of them joined later. Starting with Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency, Republicans have repeatedly sought to transform the program from an entitlement that guarantees benefits to a block grant operating under a fixed budget. But they have not sought to fully repeal the program. The ebbing of resistance to these other safety net programs reinforced the belief of politicians and political scientists alike that it is virtually impossible to revoke benefits once the government has provided them. \u201cThe bottom line is it\u2019s very hard politically to give people something then to tell then later you\u2019re doing them a big favor by taking it away,\u201d says Kettl. The potential impact of repealing the ACA is magnified because it has become woven into the expectations of not only patients, but also the vast medical industry of doctors, hospitals, drug companies and medical device manufacturers. \u201cThere\u2019s not a place in the health care system that wouldn\u2019t be affected by this repeal, and that\u2019s why, in a lot of ways, it\u2019s very difficult to even imagine how you even implement the full repeal at this point,\u201d says Blumberg. In two recent reports, the Urban Institute tried to quantify some of the potential impacts if the courts completely invalidate the law, as Trump and the coalition of Republican states are seeking. It projected that the number of Americans without health insurance would rise from about 30 million under the ACA to about 50 million. That\u2019s an increase of almost two-thirds. Simultaneously, it projected that the amount of uncompensated care that hospitals and other providers must provide to patients without health insurance would soar by 82%, from about $60 billion under the ACA to over $110 billion without it. Both of these dynamics would reverberate powerfully through the states that both sides see as the potential tipping points of the 2020 election. The Urban Institute forecast that the number of uninsured would more than double in Michigan and Pennsylvania and would rise by about two-thirds in Florida, two-fifths in North Carolina and Arizona, and a little over one-third in Wisconsin and Texas. The amount of uncompensated care facing providers would roughly double in Pennsylvania and Michigan, rise by about 90% percent in Florida and increase by half or more in Texas, Arizona and North Carolina, the institute projected. In a second study last month, the Urban Institute found that whites would account for nearly half of those who would lose coverage if the courts invalidate the ACA, while adults without four-year college degrees would compose more than four-fifths of the losers. Those numbers carry stark implications for the GOP at a time when it has grown increasingly dependent under Trump on the votes of whites without college degrees. It\u2019s not only coverage losses that might threaten key Trump constituencies if the ACA is repealed. The lawsuit would also invalidate the law\u2019s requirements that insurers provide coverage to patients with preexisting conditions at affordable costs. That poses the greatest risk to older and less affluent patients, including working-class whites, who tend to have the greatest health needs. Political strategists in both parties agree that the promise to defend the ACA\u2019s guarantees for patients with preexisting conditions was critical to the Democrats\u2019 gains in the 2018 midterm elections. In exit polls, nearly three-fifths of voters said they believed Democrats would do a better job protecting patients with preexisting conditions \u2013 and almost 90% of them supported Democratic candidates for the House. The issue appeared especially important in propelling a modest but measurable Democratic recovery among working-class white voters, especially women. White women without college degrees have been a reliably Republican constituency in recent elections; their support in states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio was key to Trump\u2019s victory in 2016. But in 2018, those women divided almost in half over whether Democrats or Republicans would do a better job protecting preexisting conditions, according to detailed exit poll results provided by Edison Research, which conducts the survey for a partnership of media organizations that includes CNN. Fully 90% of the working-class white women who trusted Democrats more on that issue also voted Democratic for the House. And while working-class white men were less likely to trust Democrats to protect preexisting conditions (only about 40% did so), those who did broke overwhelmingly toward the party in the House elections. Democrats also enjoyed a commanding lead on the question among college-educated white men and women, as well as minority voters, Edison found. Trump has shown that he believes it helps him with his base to be seen as fighting without reservation for conservative causes, whether he wins or not. In that sense, his camp believes he will benefit from challenging the ACA in court, even if the case fails, as most legal analysts still expect. How the continuing Republican efforts to repeal the ACA affect 2020 will turn at least in part on what Democrats are proposing. The call by several leading Democratic contenders \u2013 particularly Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris \u2013 to create a single-payer \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system that eliminates private insurance means that each of them, in effect, is also proposing to scrap the Affordable Care Act. That prospect has opened perhaps the most important policy fissure in the Democratic Party. Liberal legislators and activists alike insist that a single-payer system is the sort of bold change that will inspire a massive turnout from young people and minorities who sat out the 2016 election. But Democratic centrists worry that calling for replacing the ACA with an entirely new government-run system could alienate the same voters who have recoiled from the repeated GOP effort to repeal the law. That anxiety was compounded when the Democratic candidates in last month\u2019s debates all appeared to indicate that they would allow undocumented immigrants into the system, as Obama refused to do. \u201cOur message is if you work hard and have health insurance, not that we\u2019re going to improve it, we\u2019re going to take it away; but if you are undocumented we are going to give it to you,\u201d said former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who led the drive for the ACA\u2019s passage as Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, in an interview. Sanders, Warren and Harris are in the minority: Most of the Democratic field has rejected the idea of replacing the ACA with a single-payer system that eliminates private insurance. But those three are among the top four contenders in virtually all state and national polls. Among the top-tier candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden is the only one who has called for maintaining the ACA and rejecting single-payer. Though he was somewhat muted in his opposition to the single-payer proposals during the recent Democratic debates, Biden denounced the idea more forcefully in his post-debate interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. In excerpts airing Monday night, Biden sharply separated himself from the Democrats who would replace the ACA. \u201cStarting over would be, I think, a sin,\u201d Biden said. At a moment when Trump has drawn a clear line by continuing his legal campaign against the law, \u201cstarting over\u201d on the ACA would also represent a huge political gamble for Democrats.",

            "article_content": "Michelle Obama on Saturday recalled her life as a mother, wife and the first lady of the United States while speaking with CBS \u201cThis Morning\u201d co-host Gayle King before an audience gathered at the Essence Festival in New Orleans. The wide-ranging interview saw Obama share broadly her frustrations with the Trump administration and the current political climate, but also speak in deeply personal terms about her children, husband and the \u201cemotional time\u201d around leaving the White House after Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in office. The former first lady was frank about how she felt looking out at the crowd during Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the way she and former President Barack Obama are \u201crediscovering each other\u201d and what it was like for her daughters, Malia and Sasha, to grow up in the White House. Here are some of Michelle Obama\u2019s most notable quotes from the interview: On marriage: \u201cMarriage is all nice and cute but then kids show up and they take up all the oxygen in the land,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they make the babies cute because you would leave them at the Post Office.\u201d She later added: \u201cMy husband is my teammate and if we are going to win this game together, he has to be strong and he has to be OK with me being strong.\u201d On the role men played in her life: \u201cMy father and my brother had the greatest impact on my self-esteem because I grew up in a household with men who loved me and respected me very early on, who told me how beautiful I was, who treated me as an equal,\u201d she said. \u201cSo even at an early age because I had a father and a brother and the men in my life who didn\u2019t hurt me, who took care of me, the bar for what I expected for myself was set by the men in my life.\u201d Michelle Obama: 'Barack and I are going to support whoever wins the primary' On the extra difficulties for Sasha and Malia: \u201cImagine having Malia and Sasha come to your house for a sleepover. This is the call: It\u2019s like, \u2018Hello. OK, we\u2019re going to need your Social Security number, we\u2019re going to need your date of birth. There are going to be men coming to sweep your house, if you have guns and drugs, just tell them yes because they are going to find them anyway. Don\u2019t lie, they\u2019re not going to take them, they just need to know where they are. And, uh, thank you for having Malia and Sasha over. Oh and by the way, there is going to be a man with a gun sitting outside all night,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you let him use the bathroom, that would be nice.\u2019\u201d On being an empty-nester: \u201cThis is the beauty of finding a partner you really love and respect \u2013 because after all the highs and lows, the ups and downs we\u2019ve been through, we have each other, which makes the journey worth it,\u201d she said, adding that her and Barack Obama are \u201crediscovering each other\u201d now. On campaigning alongside her husband: \u201cFor a minute there, I was an angry black woman who was emasculating her husband. As I got more popular, that\u2019s when people of all sides \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 tried to take me out by the knees and the best way to do it was to focus on the one thing people were afraid of: the strength of a black woman,\u201d she said. On defining her role: \u201cI would have to earn my grace and I knew I would have to quickly define myself and I want all young girls out there to know \u2013 we all struggle with that, people of color, working class folks, women of color \u2013 people try to define us in a negative way before we get a chance to get out there and tell our own stories.\u201d On the night before: \u201cThe truth is, on that day I was moving my children out of the only house they had really grown up in,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that gets lost on people.\u201d On the emotional morning: \u201cSo anyway, the girls didn\u2019t get up, I\u2019m like get up and get out of here, and they\u2019re all crying and they have their teddy bears and they\u2019re moving slow and I\u2019m like, you\u2019ve got to get up and get out of this house. And I don\u2019t know where these kids are going, but they had to get up and out of that house. So you\u2019ve got tears and I\u2019m pushing people out of freight elevators and my kids are crying \u2013 I don\u2019t know where they going \u2013 all of that was happening and the staff was crying.\u201d On the crowd: \u201cSo look around of a crowd that was not reflective of the country and I had to sit in that audience, one of a handful of people of color, all that I had sort of held on to for eight years watching my husband get raked over the coals feeling like we had to do everything perfectly so that by the time I got on that plane it was a release of eight years of having to show up as we all know we have to do not only perfectly,\u201d she said, \u201cbut a little bit better than perfect to even be considered equal.\u201d On \u2018going high:\u2019 \u201cIt has to be true \u2013 you know, look, that\u2019s the one thing people ask me about, in this climate, how do you find it in yourself to go high and here\u2019s the thing, going high is a long-term strategy \u2013 because the truth is, going high is about thinking about trying to really get to the real answer, because a lot of time the low answer is our immediate instinct. It\u2019s just, I\u2019m mad, I want to punch you in the face, but it doesn\u2019t solve anything.\u201d On her guiding principles: \u201cAnd if we\u2019re thinking about what the agenda is, which is getting to a place where we all live in a country where we\u2019re proud to pass on to our kids, going high is the only way we get there. It\u2019s our patience, our tolerance, it\u2019s our belief in honesty and truth, it\u2019s our belief in hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about getting somebody back, it\u2019s not about the immediate clapback. The immediate clapback is just for your own selfish purpose right there in the moment and rarely does it solve anything.\u201d On where the race is now: \u201cI mean that\u2019s one of the things that we learned in the campaign. It is early,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to figure out who is going to win the World Series on the first seven games, I mean that\u2019s where we are right now. It is so early and things will change.\u201d On not endorsing a candidate in the primary: \u201cThe general election is so important that we have to get behind whoever comes out of that primary, so we\u2019re watching everyone, we\u2019re supporting everyone, we\u2019re giving advice to whoever seeks it,\u201d she said. On the Biden-Harris spat over race and busing: \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this rodeo far too long,\u201d she said to a laughing crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2013 no comments.\u201d CLARIFICATION: This story\u2019s headline has been updated to reflect that Obama\u2019s interview took place at Essence Festival.",

            "article_content": "In the midst of one of the most heated stretches of the 2020 Democratic primary, 21 candidates wearing matching T-shirts flashed smiles as they shared a stage here at Rep. Jim Clyburn\u2019s Fish Fry on Friday night. It was the first time most of the sprawling Democratic field has appeared together on one stage. Clyburn\u2019s grand gathering was short on private moments \u2013 or quiet spaces \u2013 as the candidates bounced up against each other as the program stretched late into the Columbia night. By the time host kicked off the speeches, the fish was out of sight and the beating sun was a memory. As the humidity lingered, thousands of onlookers shuffled toward the stage for the candidates they liked \u2013 and away when some of the lesser known hopefuls took their turn. Former Vice President Joe Biden spoke early in the Friday night program, and briefly, but not before a more intriguing \u2014 but inaudible \u2014 conversation with Sen. Cory Booker offstage. Earlier this week, Booker asked Biden to apologize for his recollections of working with an old segregationist senator. But the tensions that marked the week seemed to disappear on this balmy South Carolina night. The evening began in earnest with representatives from 21 campaigns standing in a backroom, Clyburn presiding, trying to hash out the Democratic Party\u2019s most pressing issue: The speaking order. Beto O\u2019Rourke, lagging in the polls, emerged at the top of this contest. It was the second random draw a week that began with a lottery that decided how the 20 qualifying candidates would line up, and when, during next week\u2019s hotly anticipated debates. Most of the 2020 Democratic field all on one stage pic.twitter.com/jcMsWeSNAg Friday night, though, was mostly an argument-free zone. The banter flowed freely. In a primary contest where the tension seems to tick up with each passing day, the scene on banks of the Congaree River was loose and jokey. Maybe it was the T-shirts. The candidates \u2013 minus Bernie Sanders who spoke without one, before putting one on for the group photo finale \u2013 all received and wore blue tops with Clyburn\u2019s name emblazoned across their chests. If there was a clear winner on this night, it was Clyburn. The third-ranking House Democrat\u2019s Fish Fry is a long-running rite of election season, but the turnout \u2013 of candidates and voters \u2013 seemed to exceed even his most optimistic prediction. Asked if he\u2019d ever planned for the scenes all around him, Clyburn\u2019s couldn\u2019t hide his delight. \u201cNo!,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought so. But I always hoped!\u201d On the side of the stage, packs of men and women-who-would-be-president, many of them already presiding over massive, multistate political operations worth millions of dollars, gathered to wait, watch and mingle. Sanders made a cheeky note of his senate colleague Kamala Harris\u2019 place deep in the lineup of speakers. \u201cYou are 33, or what?\u201d he asked. Harris laughed and confirmed it: \u201cI am the caboose!\u201d Earlier, in a similar deadpan, Sanders had inquired about the air conditioning to Amy Klobuchar, who later noted jokingly that the House members in the field had an advantage here: they, after all, were accustomed to giving brief remarks. The Senate, on the other hand, is a notorious saucer of circumlocution. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, the first person to enter this race, drew attention from at least two guys in the crowd, though not for his political message. \u201cHe looks pretty jacked,\u201d one remarked to the other, who confirmed his friend\u2019s take: \u201cHe\u2019s buff,\u201d the man said. \u201cGood god.\u201d Kirsten Gillibrand, the junior senator from New York and this class of candidates\u2019 most likely to be seen having a good time, drank up the occasion. She embraced her pal, Booker, in a tight grasp \u2013 and informed a young party intern of the salutary effects of a good whisky. The festivities carried on in Columbia\u2019s Liberty Tap Room and Grill, where Elizabeth Warren and her husband sat alone in a booth. A brief bit of quiet duly ended when two women approached for (yet another) selfie. Warren, still wearing her blue Clyburn shirt, obliged with a smile and went on to peruse the late-night menu. Before the crowd dispersed, there were flashes of applause and chanting. \u201cBeat Trump!\u201d was their final message.",

He\u2019s not from Pennsylvania. I guess he was born here, but he left you folks. He left you for another state,\u201d President Trump said. Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania in 2016, becoming the first Republican to do so since 1988, which contributed to his overall victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The Scranton-born Biden and his family moved in 1953 from Pennsylvania to Claymont, Delaware, where his father found a job. Biden often talks about his own family\u2019s struggles as emblematic of the concerns of the middle class. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: this isn\u2019t just about me. This is proof that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t understand the struggles working folks go through,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to worry you will lose the roof over your head. He doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to wonder if you\u2019ll be able to put food on the table.\u201d \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t understand that the longest walk a parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to their child\u2019s bedroom to sit on the end of the bed and say, honey, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. We have to move. You can\u2019t go back to your school. You won\u2019t see your friends. You can\u2019t play on that team. You can\u2019t be in the choir because Daddy lost his job or Mommy lost her job,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cMy dad had to make that walk in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It wasn\u2019t until I was older that I realized how hard it must have been for him.\u201d At his Pennsylvania campaign rally, Trump repeatedly knocked Biden on his trade policy, past comments on China, and relations with foreign leaders. As the 2020 race heats up, the President has directed much of his attention towards Biden despite concerns among his advisers that tweets and comments about the former vice president could elevate his standing in the Democratic field. Biden, who is leading Trump by 11 points in a recent head-to-head matchup in Pennsylvania, has framed much of his campaign as a rebuke of the President. In a speech in Philadelphia Saturday, Biden said Trump is taking credit for a strong economy \u201cthat was given to him, just like he inherited everything else in his life.\u201d \u201cAnd just like everything else he\u2019s been given in his life, he\u2019s in the process of squandering that, as well,\u201d Biden said.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is set to shift into a new \u2013 and riskier \u2013 phase of his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. After entering the race three weeks ago as a stronger-than-expected front-runner, the former vice president is set to deliver a speech at his first major rally of the race Saturday in Philadelphia. Then, Biden and his aides have said, he\u2019ll begin rolling out policy proposals. And, he said, he will soon likely begin preparing for the Democratic presidential debates. It all comes with higher stakes than the small events in early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire that Biden has held so far, and will test his status as the front-runner, as his 2020 competitors seek to knock him off his perch and reshape the primary race. Biden\u2019s entry has already forced other candidates to shift their own tactics and made the former vice president a target of criticism on the campaign trail. After Biden made attacking President Donald Trump central to his campaign roll out, California Sen. Kamala Harris is now speaking much more about Trump on the trail. Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke is now doing nationally televised interviews, including a CNN town hall next week in Des Moines, after months of avoiding them to focus instead on intimate campaign stops and town halls. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is highlighting his contrasts on policy issues like trade and climate change with Biden. As other candidates attempt to catch up, Biden is now moving into what his aides view as a new phase of his campaign. Instead of focusing squarely on Trump, the coming weeks will see Biden forced to engage more forcefully in the debates driving the Democratic primary contest. He\u2019ll face more criticism from opponents, particularly if his policy proposals are not seen as sufficiently progressive. His crowd sizes will be seen as a gauge of voters\u2019 enthusiasm for his candidacy. Biden takes aim at Trump as he enters Iowa the Democratic front-runner \u201cThis race, lot can happen. But the one thing that I know is that I don\u2019t yield anybody on my liberal credentials, whether it\u2019s on women\u2019s issues, on LGBT issues, on speech, on all those issues,\u201d Biden said Tuesday in New Hampshire. \u201cThere are very loud voices on the very new progressive side of the agenda and I think it\u2019s useful. I think they\u2019re good. They\u2019re smart people and they should be able to be making their case,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the idea that somehow the Democratic Party has gone so far to the left that it is not recognized by most Democrats who consider themselves liberal is not factually what\u2019s happening.\u201d After a relatively low-key start to his first swing through the early-voting states with smaller crowds and sometimes-meandering stump speeches designed to highlight his swings at Trump and minimize clashes with other Democratic contenders, Biden this week began taking questions \u2013 both from his crowds and the reporters following him \u2013 in New Hampshire. Biden\u2019s strong position in the polls have placed him at the center of most Democratic debates \u2013 and forced the other candidates to react to him. There were moments of conflict with his competitors \u2013 including Biden\u2019s insistence Tuesday that the 1994 crime bill \u201cdid not generate mass incarceration,\u201d which prompted Harris to fire back that Biden was wrong about the bill\u2019s effects. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is even pre-butting Biden\u2019s speech on climate change, which he will deliver before the end of this month \u2013 though aides would not specify when or where. \u201cI was concerned, like most everyone was, of the comments coming out of this campaign,\u201d Inslee said, referring to a recent Reuters report in which a Biden adviser touted a possible approach that seeks a middle ground on climate policy. Biden\u2019s campaign has since challenged the accuracy of that report. Referring to the Republican majority leader of the Senate, Inslee said that if Biden thinks he will \u201cwalk in and have a cup of tea with Mitch McConnell and convince him that the climate crisis demands a full mobilization of the US economy, there\u2019s some other Mitch McConnell in the world.\u201d Biden will next grab the spotlight on Saturday in Philadelphia, with a speech at his first large rally of the 2020 race. Saturday\u2019s speech will emphasize a theme of \u201cchoosing unity over division and making sure we have a president for all of us,\u201d a Biden aide said. The choice of Philadelphia \u2013 where his presidential campaign will be based \u2013 carries both personal and political importance: The Scranton-born Biden, who represented neighboring Delaware in the Senate, is emphasizing his connection with the region. And Pennsylvania \u2013 along with Wisconsin and Michigan \u2013 are likely the most important states in Biden\u2019s vision of a 2020 election in which Democrats win back a share of the white, working-class voters, particularly those who backed former President Barack Obama and then voted for Trump and cemented his victory in 2016 by narrowly tipping those three states in Trump\u2019s favor. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week found Biden leading Trump 53 to 42 percent in a potential head-to-head matchup in the state. Then, Biden is expected to begin rolling out policy proposals over the next several months. He has already said at campaign events he plans to detail his approach to climate change before the end of May, and will also soon be releasing a plan to address student debt, as well as other proposals. He is also devoting more time than most Democratic candidates to fundraising \u2013 holding at least one fundraising event nearly every day he\u2019s been on the campaign trail, and allowing reporters to attend. One source familiar with the Biden campaign\u2019s approach said it has been much more aggressive in asking major Democratic donors to host events and raise specific amounts of money than other candidates \u2013 many of whom entered the race focusing almost entirely on small-dollar fundraising and expecting to face the wrath of progressives for spending too much time with wealthy donors. Because of Biden\u2019s later entry into the race, the end-of-June conclusion of 2019\u2019s second quarter will be the public\u2019s first detailed glimpse at his fundraising so far. Biden also said this week he expects to begin preparing for the Democratic debates, the first of which take place June 26 and 27. \u201cI won\u2019t say I\u2019m looking forward to it because I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to work\u201d with so many candidates on stage, Biden told reporters this week. \u201cBut I\u2019m anxious to be able to stand before people and say what I think and why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has offered its first response after President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he would make a now-canceled trip to Ukraine to urge the country to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see all these strong progressive voices stand up to this attempt at a blatantly political smear which in and of itself reflects the urgent need for change and to restore the soul of the country,\u201d a Biden campaign official told CNN. Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke were among the 2020 Democratic contenders to express concern about Giuliani\u2019s efforts. \u201cI just think it is highly unethical for the President\u2019s personal lawyer to go meet with officials from foreign government to see if they can influence somehow the upcoming presidential election,\u201d Warren said in Kermit, West Virginia. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough of that and Rudy Giuliani should just back off.\u201d Giuliani's canceled Ukraine trip caps a whirlwind week previewing his freelancing role in 2020 In New Hampshire, O\u2019Rourke said Giuliani\u2019s proposed trip to Ukraine was \u201cso very troubling, very disappointing, and and yet not a total surprise, given this President\u2019s behavior and the pattern that he\u2019d already set.\u201d Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill also chimed in with criticism of the proposed trip. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning that the Trump administration is going down the same tragic path they did in 2016. Here you have the President\u2019s lawyer seeking help from a foreign government again to influence a presidential election. It\u2019s just appalling,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Friday. \u201cAnd his defense that he\u2019s not seeking a foreign government\u2019s help in the election, just an investigation \u2013 yes, it\u2019s an investigation designed to affect one of the candidates they fear the most. I think it\u2019s reprehensible.\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, who called for a Senate query on Giuliani\u2019s proposed trip to Ukraine before it was canceled, tweeted, \u201cI know we\u2019ve become numb to the corruption of this Administration, but this story should be the total focus of the political class today. The President is openly asking a foreign government to investigate his political rival. This is next level.\u201d Giuliani revealed his intention to travel to Ukraine on behalf of his client in a Thursday interview with The New York Times, but by Friday night, that plan was canceled. Giuliani planned to meet with the country\u2019s president-elect to encourage him to pursue two matters of interest to Trump: restarting an investigation into a Ukrainian company linked to Biden\u2019s son, and looking into whether Ukrainians worked with Democrats to prompt the FBI investigation into Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Giuliani reverses course, says he's no longer going to Ukraine to press Biden investigation Earlier Friday, Giuliani had defended going to Ukraine to press for an investigation into Biden\u2019s call to remove a top Ukrainian official in 2016, when Biden was vice president. Biden called for the removal of the top Ukrainian prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company connected to Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Within a year of the prosecutor\u2019s removal, Ukraine\u2019s new prosecutor general dismissed the case against the company, Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company controlled by one of Ukraine\u2019s top oligarchs. Other Western governments also called for his removal, and no evidence has indicated that the move by Biden was inappropriate. The Biden campaign has previously referred CNN to a statement a spokeswoman provided to The New York Times, which said Biden acted on Ukraine \u201cwithout any regard for how it would or would not impact\u201d Hunter\u2019s business interests. As Democrats criticized the trip as politically motivated, Giuliani insisted to CNN earlier Friday that the trip to Ukraine to seek to influence potential investigations would not have been meddling because the 2020 election is still 18 months away. \u201cI don\u2019t want any favors. I just want this investigated,\u201d Giuliani said. Giuliani had previously told CNN that a \u201cwell-regarded investigator\u201d he\u2019s known for years put him in touch last November with current and former Ukrainian officials, who he says he\u2019s interviewed over Skype and in person. In 2017, both the Democratic National Committee and a contractor denied working with Ukrainians. But in a Friday night interview with Fox News, Giuliani said he won\u2019t go to Ukraine, \u201cin order to remove any political suggestion.\u201d \u201cI will step back and I\u2019ll just watch it unfold,\u201d he said. That news came hours after President Trump told Politico in an interview that he planned to speak with Giuliani about the trip. CNN\u2019s Michael Warren, Caroline Kelly and Kyle Feldscher contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "His aides are wooing bundlers, and his campaign this week openly embraced a super PAC that is racing to collect millions. As President Donald Trump gears up for a re-election battle in 2020, Team Trump is deploying all the instruments of a traditional campaign apparatus that he mocked during his first, unconventional bid for the White House. In 2015, for instance, Trump tweeted that the \u201cwhole super PAC scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all PAC\u2019s & is self-funding.\u201d This week, in sharp contrast, his campaign backed a super PAC, declaring in a statement that \u201cthere is one approved outside, non-campaign group, America First Action, which is run by allies of the President and is a trusted supporter of President Trump\u2019s policies and agendas.\u201d In his first race, the real-estate mogul also was highly critical of deep-pocketed donors. \u201cI don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money,\u201d Trump said in 2015 during his campaign launch speech. And in 2016, he told CNN that candidates become \u201cpsychologically\u201d beholden to donors: \u201cThey owe them.\u201d Trump won the White House despite trailing far behind rival Hillary Clinton in fundraising, a deficit the campaign does not intend to run this time. \u201cThe people who were on the 2016 campaign, they like to say that they were building the airplane while it was in flight,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u2019s communication director, told CNN. \u201cTo their everlasting credit, they landed that airplane.\u201d \u201cThe main difference between 2016 and 2020 is President Trump is the incumbent President of the United States, and we are building a campaign befitting an incumbent president,\u201d he added. The campaign is already amassing a historically large war chest in preparation for the battle. A senior campaign official said the campaign is on track this quarter to outpace its haul from the first three months of this year year, when it took in more than $30 million. At the same time, the pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, and its nonprofit arm are planning to raise and spend $300 million during the 2020 election cycle \u2013 far exceeding the $78 million the groups plowed into the 2018 midterm elections. On May 20, the nonprofit group, America First Policies, will kick off a tour of key electoral battlegrounds with an event in Jacksonville, Florida, featuring Vice President Mike Pence. The tour is aimed at building public support for Trump\u2019s update of the North America Free Trade Agreement. This week, Trump\u2019s top aides huddled with roughly 200 potential fundraisers at the President\u2019s hotel in downtown Washington as they worked to woo establishment figures who could tap their friends, family and business associates to \u201cbundle\u201d together donations to support what could grow to a $1 billion operation. The six-hour event rolled out a bundling program aimed at tapping into the GOP donor class that partly avoided Trump during the last presidential cycle. Growing 2020 Democratic field triggers a mad dash for donors -- and complaints from campaigns The prospective bundlers heard from campaign manager Brad Parscale, Pence, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, and other party leaders, who spelled out a strategy for raking in what the Trump team hopes will be roughly three times the amount raised in 2016. The new bundling program already has about 200 enrollees and others who attended the kick-off this week have signed up or referred friends, a senior campaign official said. One donor who joined the gathering this week said he went into the meeting skeptical that it would be a good use of time by the campaign\u2019s top brass. But he said he left impressed with the level of organization and detail in the presentation, including tips on how to raise money and a rundown of how the fundraising team would function. Veteran GOP fundraiser Jack Oliver, who created former President George W. Bush\u2019s bundling operation, is helping to structure the Trump bundler program. \u201cThe Trump campaign has done a great job of working to capture people who might have sat out during the last cycle, or gave to other people,\u201d Oliver told CNN. Campaign officials and people familiar with the operation said Parscale and Todd Ricketts, finance chair of the RNC, have targeted donors who declined to open their checkbooks for Trump during the last presidential race. \u201cThe Trump campaign in 2016 was like a startup,\u201d Oliver said. \u201c2020, the President\u2019s campaign, led by Brad, recognizes that this is a very large operation, to take on what will be the best-funded Democratic attack machine in modern American history.\u201d Under an agreement announced earlier this year, Trump\u2019s campaign and the RNC merged their field operations and fundraising efforts \u2013 giving the President a re-election machine unprecedented in modern politics. In 2016, Trump \u201cran on the idea that he was some sort of reformer, that he could drain the swamp and would not be beholden to the big-money donors and lobbyists,\u201d said Larry Noble, the former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission and a CNN contributor. \u201cHe seems to have forgotten that. He\u2019s pulling out all the stops.\u201d The campaign is taking other cues from traditional fundraising operations. Bundlers working on the Trump 2020 effort, for instance, will unlock an increasingly lavish set of perks as they climb the ladder of fundraising levels established in the Trump Victory program. People who bring in at least $25,000 in donations will reach the \u201cTrump Train\u201d level and gain access to a retreat, two leadership dinners and a quarterly conference call, according to fundraising documents obtained by CNN. The highest tier \u2013 the \u201cBuilders Club,\u201d whose members must collect at least $100,000 \u2013 will score \u201ccommemorative Trump Victory gifts\u201d and invitations to a host of campaign events. Throughout his first White House bid, Trump argued that his wealth allowed him to avoid relying on special-interest groups and establishment donors for contributions. \u201cI\u2019m not using the lobbyists. I\u2019m not using donors. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m really rich,\u201d Trump said the day he kicked off his 2016 campaign in the Trump Tower lobby. Indeed, Trump plowed a significant chunk of his own money \u2013 more than $66 million \u2013 into his first White House bid. Much of it went into the primary campaign as he battled a crowded field of Republicans for the nomination. A campaign official said it is \u201cnot the expectation\u201d of the team that Trump will need to self-fund his re-election effort. The campaign\u2019s embrace of America First this week was no surprise. Trump\u2019s allies made no secret that it was the campaign\u2019s official outside vehicle by stocking it with key allies since its inception. Trump has been a guest of honor at events raising money for the group. Linda McMahon, a longtime Trump ally, recently left her Cabinet-level post as the head of the Small Business Administration to help oversee the organization. But the campaign\u2019s move to publicly embrace America First came as Team Trump worked to implicitly shun the political operation of another longtime ally, David Bossie, who served as Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager in fall 2016. Bossie runs a political organization, the Presidential Coalition, that raised millions while purporting to support Trump. Trump was \u201clivid\u201d when he found out Bossie\u2019s group was soliciting funds from Trump supporters and only spending a fraction on direct political activities, several people familiar with the President\u2019s reaction told CNN earlier this week. Bossie did not respond to interview requests, but has dismissed questions about his activity \u2013 reported by Axios and the Campaign Legal Center earlier this week \u2013 as \u201cfake news.\u201d The Trump campaign\u2019s embrace of America First prompted a Federal Election Commission complaint on Thursday from the Campaign Legal Center and End Citizens United, groups that support more limits on campaign spending. They argue the campaign\u2019s statement amounted to an improper solicitation of unlimited donations for the super PAC. Federal rules bar candidates from asking donors to contribute more than $5,000 to such groups. A Trump campaign official said there was no solicitation of funds in the statement naming America First Action, and said the team ran the statement by its legal counsel before releasing it. In the 2016 race, all outside groups spent a little more than $100 million to elect Trump, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The $300 million fundraising goal set by the America First groups underscores the enormous growth of Trump\u2019s money machine since his victory. The America First groups will target six key states: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, America First spokeswoman Kelly Sadler told CNN on Thursday. The buildup, Sadler said, shows that Trump \u201cis serious about re-election, that he\u2019s serious about continuing the economic prosperity that he\u2019s unleashed with his policies, and that\u2019s he\u2019s going all in.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Whoever wins the US presidential election in about 18 months and how they do it will depend on a bunch of different factors, but probably the most important is the one President Donald Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff laid out Tuesday. \u201cYou hate to sound like a cliche, but are you better off than you were four years ago? It\u2019s pretty simple, right? \u2018It\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u2019 I think that\u2019s easy,\u201d Mick Mulvaney told an audience at the Milken Conference in Los Angeles. \u201cPeople will vote for somebody they don\u2019t like if they think it\u2019s good for them.\u201d That backhanded endorsement summarizes the challenge Democrats face. Their vast field of candidates offers everything from transformational democratic socialism to a return to normalcy. And we haven\u2019t yet gotten to the portion of the primary season where they point out their own differences and get serious about making their pitches on who should win the right to face Trump in 2020. A report card for Trump's economy But it\u2019s a matter of fact that some Democrat will face Trump and after that, there will be a Democratic president or, barring something completely unforeseen, there will be Trump. And the reality is, voters don\u2019t like to punish incumbents when the economy feels fine. Remove Gerald Ford, who was never elected in his own right and had just pardoned Richard Nixon, and you have only three incumbents who\u2019ve lost reelection in the last 100 years. The other three each had an economic calamity they were dealing with. Herbert Hoover had the Great Depression. Jimmy Carter had a recession. George H.W. Bush had a recession. Even Ford\u2019s loss in 1976 was in part thanks to stagflation and the weak recovery from the energy crisis. What\u2019s Trump got? He\u2019s overseeing a strong economy, near-low unemployment, unexpectedly strong growth in the gross domestic product, a surprising lack of consequences for the trade war he\u2019s tempted with China and Europe, and a strong dollar. It\u2019s been nearly 10 years of nonstop growth for the US economy, an expansion that will set a record starting in July. In March, 71% of Americans said the economy was in good shape and a majority, 51%, approved of Trump\u2019s handling of it. That his overall approval rating remains well under 50% despite this economy will test the second part of what Mulvaney said \u2013 that people will vote for somebody they don\u2019t like if they think it\u2019s good for them. Trump has already proved he can get people who don\u2019t like him to vote for him. In 2016, according to exit polls, 60% of voters had an unfavorable view of Trump. Fifteen percent of those voters chose him anyway. The idea that Donald Trump will win easily in 2020 is ridiculous Not all Americans feel like the economy is working for them. Most voters (60%) think the economic system benefits those in power rather than all people, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll out Monday, although less than a third of Republicans (32%) said the economy benefits those in power as opposed to all people. Strong majorities of Democrats and independents said the opposite. A larger majority of all voters (72%) said the US system of government benefits those in power. In a separate poll, conducted by Monmouth University, just 12% of Americans said their families have benefited a great deal from the current economy and 31% said they had gotten some benefit. A combined 54% said they had been helped not much or not at all. That should signal an opening to Democrats. In the populist pitches from Democratic presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, senators from Vermont and Massachusetts, is a promise to give more Americans the economic security already felt by the wealthy. They want to divert American wealth that already exists to providing better health care coverage for everyone, college tuition for everyone and, in Warren\u2019s case, child care for everyone. But these are transformational ideas that skirt Mulvaney\u2019s question. They\u2019re asking voters to creatively think about a different United States. More conventional is Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner. He\u2019s certainly arguing to Americans that they are worse off under Trump, but for moral reasons, not economic ones. He made his first pitch as a candidate arguing to voters in an internet video that he would be the antidote to Trump\u2019s incendiary speech and commiseration with white nationalists, not that he would make voters\u2019 lives materially better. That\u2019s a message that will resonate with the many voters who dislike Trump \u2013 92% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said in a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS that selecting a candidate who has a good chance of defeating Trump is important to their Democratic primary decisions. It might not resonate as much with those whose focus is on their daily lives, not politics. Here's who's winning under Trump's tax law And according to Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s pitch is going to stay that simple. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the economy, we\u2019re talking about health care, we\u2019re talking about trade and we think we\u2019ve got a very compelling argument heading into 2020. We also think we have a lot of really weak competitors, which is fun,\u201d Mulvaney said. We\u2019ll have to see how much Trump\u2019s Twitter feed gets in the way of that messaging. Otherwise, it could be a compelling argument for the President, who rode the economic recovery overseen by his predecessor into the White House. Frustration among voters in the Rust Belt with the collapse of manufacturing and other working-class trade \u2013 among other things \u2013 helped Trump win in 2016. Fear of economic apocalypse and frustration with bailouts for big banks played a bigger role than people might now remember in Barack Obama\u2019s victory over John McCain in 2008. The dot-com bubble that went poof in the late 1990s made voters hesitant about Al Gore, who had bragged about taking initiative in creating the internet. Did that help George W. Bush squeak into the White House? Sure. Bill Clinton, clearly, preyed on the economy as his top issue in 1992. And in fact, Clinton\u2019s commanding Electoral College defeat of George H.W. Bush 27 years ago with just 43% of the national vote in a three-way race is the last time an incumbent president lost. What was his mantra? \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid!\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump, known for his troubled relationship with facts, was right on every count when he tweeted about the economy Friday morning. \u201cJust out: Real GDP for First Quarter grew 3.2% at an annual rate. This is far above expectations or projections. Importantly, inflation VERY LOW. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d Just out: Real GDP for First Quarter grew 3.2% at an annual rate. This is far above expectations or projections. Importantly, inflation VERY LOW. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The US economy won\u2019t quit. And Trump needs it to keep chugging along \u2013  so much the better for him if that\u2019s in spite of the dour economists who keep hyperventilating about a slowdown. Despite their warnings, the headline numbers \u2013 growth and jobs \u2013 remain strong, and Trump is more than happy to take credit and stick it to the experts. While countries in Europe and Asia are posting troubling gross domestic product reports, the US roars on, and the importance to Trump cannot be overstated. He\u2019ll need to own the record-setting economic expansion that has been underway for just about a decade. Especially if he\u2019s going to defy his own low approval ratings and the inflamed Democratic voters who\u2019d like to see him impeached for obstructing justice. A report card for Trump's economy The experts and economists will add asterisks and \u201cbuts\u201d to the strong preliminary 3.2% annualized GDP growth rate published Friday, pointing out it might be deceptive in the long run for a variety of reasons, and they\u2019ll say they still see a slowdown on the horizon. But for now, Trump has promised growth. And the economy has grown. Full stop. He\u2019s overseen two years of an economic expansion that began early in the Obama administration and yet he won election in 2016 because so many Rust Belt voters felt left behind. Now, as Democrats vying to take on Trump in 2020 are talking about how they\u2019ll address inequality, he\u2019ll need to convince those same Rust Belt voters he\u2019s delivered for them and that his permanent corporate tax cuts will help them too. Take Erie, Pennsylvania. Trump narrowly won the area in 2016 but Democrats took it back in the 2018 midterms. The macro indicators like GDP growth and job gains might not resonate there, but help-wanted signs do. That\u2019s why Dick Crosby, who owns the Girard Dinor diner in the borough of Girard outside Erie, sees Trump as unbeatable in 2020. \u201cYou can go to almost every business around here and you\u2019ll see a sign in the window for help wanted. They can find people to work. So that tells you that something\u2019s going good,\u201d Crosby told CNN\u2019s Miguel Marquez. Others in Erie might not like the President, but that\u2019s not going to keep them from voting for him. \u201cHe\u2019s not a guy that I would go and want to have a beer with, or go golfing with,\u201d said Chris Trott, a 28-year-old two-time Barack Obama voter who chose Trump in 2016 and says he\u2019ll vote for him again \u201cbecause what he\u2019s doing seems to be working.\u201d Trott is looking at the possibility of hiring the first full-time employee for the vehicle modification business, Erie Fleet Solutions, he opened four years ago. That\u2019s Trump\u2019s path to a second victory no matter how many deceptive Facebook ads find their way from Russia into the political conversation. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in March, Trump\u2019s approval rating was, as it has always been, below 50%. But more than two-thirds of Americans feel really good about the economy, CNN Polling Director Jennifer Agiesta wrote at the time. \u201cOverall, 71% say the nation\u2019s economy is in good shape, the highest share to say so since February 2001, and the best rating during Trump\u2019s presidency by two points,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA majority give the President positive reviews for his handling of the nation\u2019s economy (51% approve), and his overall approval rating has ticked up to 42% in the new poll. The 51% who say they disapprove of the President\u2019s job performance overall represent the lowest share to do so in CNN polling since the start of his presidency.\u201d Nearly a quarter of voters said the economy was the most important issue facing the country in exit polls conducted alongside the 2018 midterms, in which Democrats took back control of the House of Representatives. Republicans won them 63% to 34%. If Trump can get more voters to polls on that issue instead of health care, it will be a very good thing for him. And Democrats clearly know it. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s entire argument for running is that he can rebuild the Democratic blue wall in the Rust Belt and take the country back to a pre-Trump mindset. Notably, in announcing his candidacy with a web video, Biden didn\u2019t talk about the economy. Instead, he spoke at length about Trump\u2019s moral shortcomings and how it was unacceptable that the President \u201cassigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it\u201d regarding a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia. Democrats, who lost the Rust Belt and the White House in 2016 because white working-class voters in the Rust Belt felt behind, got it back in 2018 because those same voters were afraid that maybe they\u2019d lose their health care. But what will be their argument if those voters feel good about Trump\u2019s economy?",

            "article_content": "After months of deliberation, former Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday announced his decision to run for president for a third time, answering one of the biggest outstanding questions about the makeup of the 2020 race. The announcement came in a campaign video released Thursday morning. In his campaign announcement video, Biden rebuked the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 and President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the aftermath. \u201cHe said there were quote some very fine people on both sides,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWith those words, the President of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it. And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime.\u201d Biden framed the 2020 race as a \u201cbattle for the soul of this nation.\u201d \u201cThe core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America, America, is at stake,\u201d Biden said in the video. \u201cThat\u2019s why today I\u2019m announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.\u201d Later Thursday, Biden will attend a fundraiser in Philadelphia before appearing on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d for his first television interview since the announcement on Friday. On Monday, he will hold his first official event in Pittsburgh, followed by a swing through early voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina in the coming weeks. On May 18, Biden will host a rally in Philadelphia where he will \u201clay out his vision for unifying America with respected leadership on the world stage,\u201d according to his campaign. Biden fights for old soul of Democratic Party with campaign launch Biden, 76, enters the crowded Democratic primary field of 20 candidates as the presumptive front-runner sitting atop the most recent polls. But his more than four-decades-long career is set to undergo an unprecedented level of scrutiny as he seeks to win the Democratic nomination to take on Trump in a general election. Biden, a centrist Democrat who often touts his relationships with those across the aisle, also will grapple with a Democratic Party that is increasingly feeling a pull from the left with a number of progressive candidates, like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, in the 2020 race. \u201cI\u2019m told I get criticized by the new left,\u201d Biden said at an event in Delaware last month. \u201cI have the most progressive record of anybody running for the United \u2026 anybody who would run.\u201d Trump has described a general election match-up against the former vice president as a \u201cdream,\u201d while some Republicans cast Biden, who has crafted a political brand aimed at appealing to working-class voters, as the most feared potential Democratic opponent for the President. The President taunted Biden soon after his announcement Thursday morning. \u201cWelcome to the race Sleepy Joe,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign. It will be nasty - you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick & demented ideas. But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate!\u201d The states Biden will need to flip for 2020 Shortly after jumping in the race Thursday morning, Biden picked up endorsements from Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Chris Coons of Delaware. One notable Democratic heavyweight, however, did not immediately throw his support behind the former vice president. A person close to former President Barack Obama told CNN that Obama is \u201cexcited\u201d by the growing field, but he is \u201cunlikely\u201d to come out in support of a candidate this early in the primary season. In recent weeks, Biden indicated he was close to mounting a 2020 campaign after gaining approval from his family to run for president for a third time. But he also acknowledged there were a number of other hurdles he still needed to work through, including fundraising, digital strategy, assembling a diverse campaign team and ensuring there is an appeal for a Biden run. \u201cI can die a happy man never having lived in the White House, but what I don\u2019t want to do is take people\u2019s time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot that I could be the nominee,\u201d Biden said in late February. \u201cIt is something that I have to make sure I could run a first-rate effort to do this and make clear where I think the country should go and how to get there.\u201d But it appears those concerns were assuaged. As they awaited a decision, Biden\u2019s political team has worked quietly for months to lay the preliminary groundwork for a campaign, court donors and talk to potential staff. Biden\u2019s announcement comes in the wake of allegations he has made women feel uncomfortable in their encounters. The former vice president has maintained he does not believe he has acted inappropriately in his interactions with voters but said he\u2019s willing to listen to women\u2019s experiences and will be more \u201cmindful about respecting personal space in the future.\u201d The debate over his interactions highlights the new reality for candidates running in a post #MeToo era. As he dealt with the fallout of the allegations, Biden\u2019s aides said the issue would not dissuade him from entering the 2020 race, but his team is aware his contact with voters on the campaign trail could be scrutinized throughout a presidential campaign. Analysis: The case for and against Joe Biden's 2020 chances This will mark Biden\u2019s third attempt for the White House after two failed bids in 1988 and 2008. His first presidential run was plagued by charges he plagiarized in law school and in campaign speeches. In 2008, he dropped out of the presidential contest after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, placing fifth with less than one percentage point. Biden came close to making a late entrance into the 2016 campaign to challenge Hillary Clinton and Sanders in the Democratic primary, but ultimately decided against a run, in large part due to the emotional toll his son Beau\u2019s death took on him and his family in 2015. Biden has described himself as an \u201cObama-Biden Democrat,\u201d a sign he would embrace the mantle of the Obama administration in a presidential campaign. The former vice president has led most early polls of potential Democratic contenders and has enjoyed high name identification and favorability ratings, which rose in the years since leaving public office. Late last year, Biden declared himself the \u201cmost qualified person in the country to be president,\u201d with his supporters pointing to his more than four decades of political experience as a boon for a possible campaign. Throughout his career in Washington, Biden has embraced a blue-collar, middle-class message, delved into foreign policy debates and talked about the need to engage in bipartisanship. On the campaign trail last fall, he cast the election as a \u201cbattle for America\u2019s soul,\u201d a theme that will be central to his presidential campaign. But his more than four decades in public service also carry some political baggage as several areas of his career are set to come under fresh scrutiny in a possible campaign \u2013 including his handling of Anita Hill during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, his work related to the financial services industry \u2013 which has a base in his home state of Delaware \u2013 his past views on school busing and even his gaffes. \u201cI am a gaffe machine, but my God what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can\u2019t tell the truth,\u201d Biden said in December. \u201cI\u2019m ready to litigate all those things. The question is, what kind of nation are we becoming? What are we going to do? Who are we?\u201d Biden tried to head off some of the expected criticism earlier this year, expressing regret for his handling of criminal justice issues \u2013 particularly the 1994 crime bill he helped authored, which critics argue led to an era of mass incarceration. Bernie Sanders is the new #1 in our 2020 Democrat rankings \u201cI haven\u2019t always been right. I know we haven\u2019t always gotten things right, but I\u2019ve always tried,\u201d Biden said at a Martin Luther King, Jr. breakfast in January. Biden has also repeatedly expressed regret for his handling of Hill\u2019s testimony at the Thomas hearings, though critics say he could have done more in his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time. \u201cTo this day, I regret I couldn\u2019t come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us,\u201d Biden said at an event in New York last month. In recent months, Biden defended his work with Republicans as he came under fire for praising a GOP congressman from Michigan during a paid speech weeks before the midterm elections. \u201cBless me father for I have sinned,\u201d Biden said as he made the sign of the cross while speaking to the United States Conference of Mayors earlier this year. \u201cFrom where I come from, I don\u2019t know how you get anything done. I don\u2019t know how you get anything done unless we start talking to one another again.\u201d But he\u2019s also been confronted by the realities of the current political environment. In a speech in Omaha, Nebraska, this year, Biden called current Vice President Mike Pence a \u201cdecent guy,\u201d a comment that drew furor from the left due to Pence\u2019s stance on LGBTQ rights. After he was called out by actress and activist Cynthia Nixon, Biden quickly walked back his comments on Twitter, writing, \u201cthere is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President.\u201d Biden will be among the oldest candidates in the Democratic primary field, and he has acknowledged his age would be a \u201clegitimate issue\u201d for voters and opponents to raise. Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1942, Biden, who overcame a stutter as a child, often touts his upbringing in Pennsylvania and Delaware as emblematic of the concerns of working-class families. At the age of 29, Biden was elected to represent Delaware in the US Senate. where he served for 36 years. During that time, he sat on the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees, including stints as chair on each of them. Among his proudest legislative accomplishments \u2013 authoring the Violence Against Women Act. After Biden\u2019s failed presidential bid in 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama asked the Delaware senator to join the Democratic ticket as his running mate, an offer Biden initially resisted. Just before leaving office in 2017, Obama surprised Biden by awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor. \u201cTo know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without self-regard, and to live life fully,\u201d Obama said at the time. Biden, a devout Catholic who suffered two brain aneurysms in 1988, bears an emotional personal story, publicly enduring more tragedy than most political figures. Weeks after he was elected to the Senate at the age of 29, Biden\u2019s wife Neilia and 13-month-old daughter Naomi were killed in a car accident, which also seriously injured his young sons Beau and Hunter. Biden was later sworn into the Senate at his son Beau\u2019s bedside. Several years later, Biden married Jill Jacobs, and the two had a daughter, Ashley. Tragedy struck the Biden family a second time in 2015 when Beau, the attorney general of Delaware and an Iraq War veteran, passed away after a battle with brain cancer \u2013 a time the former vice president recounted in his memoir, \u201cPromise Me, Dad.\u201d Since leaving the White House, Biden has built a network of initiatives, including his American Possibilities PAC, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy & Global Engagement, the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware, the Biden Foundation and the Biden Cancer Initiative.  The Biden Foundations was planning to suspend operations once Biden announced his presidential campaign. Biden also served as one of the most high-profile Democratic surrogates during the 2018 midterm elections, previewing arguments for a possible presidential campaign at campaign rallies across the country.

            "article_content": "Tennessee has one of the lowest voter registration rates in the country, according to Pew\u2019s Election Performance Index. Soon, it could get a lot harder to help people there register to vote. Tennessee has a registration rate of 78.52%. While that would be a passing grade at school, it puts Tennessee at 45th among the 50 states for its voter registration rate. A bill currently making its way through the Tennessee legislature would impose new restrictions on groups that hold voter registration drives and subject them to potential jail time and massive fines. Under one of the provisions, individuals or organizations that submit 100 to 500 \u201cdeficient\u201d voter registration applications, meaning forms that are incomplete or contain incorrect information, could be hit with a $150 to $2,000 fine. Submitting more than 500 \u201cdeficient\u201d forms could result in a fine of up to $10,000. Forms would have to be delivered or mailed within 10 days of being collected, or by the state\u2019s voter registration deadline. Tennessee cuts off voter registration at 30 days before election day. The bill would also make it more difficult to hold a voter registration drive in the first place. Before holding a drive, an organization registering 100 or more people would have to: provide the county elections coordinator with contact information for the people conducting the drive, notify the coordinator about where the drive is being held, complete voter registration training through the elections coordinator and file a sworn statement stating it\u2019ll abide by all voter registration laws and procedures. Violating any of those rules \u201cintentionally and knowingly\u201d would constitute a Class A misdemeanor \u2013 the most serious misdemeanor, punishable by up to 11 months and 29 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $2,500. The rules wouldn\u2019t apply to volunteers who sign up voters or to organizations that rely solely on volunteers to register voters. But the law is vague about what organizations count as having paid staff. In the Tennessee state Senate, the bill has made its way through local and state committee and has been referred to the calendar committee for scheduling. In the state House, it has advanced through committees and is on the calendar for April 15. Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, whose office is behind the legislation, wrote in an op-ed for the Tennessean that the law is intended to preserve the integrity of the election process. \u201cWhile we strive to register Tennesseans to vote, it must be done responsibly and in a manner that does not compromise the security of elections,\u201d Hargett wrote. \u201cGroups that seek to register large numbers of voters, while typically doing so with good intentions, potentially put legitimate voter registrations at risk.\u201d But scholars and civil rights groups argue that the law targets disenfranchised communities and say it would have a chilling effect on those trying to help others vote. \u201cVoter registration drives have long been used to empower communities that are historically disenfranchised, including students, immigrants, people of color and seniors,\u201d Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee told CNN. \u201cThis legislation would inhibit access to the ballot and undermine civic engagement.\u201d Discriminatory voter laws have surged in last 5 years, federal commission finds Sekou Franklin, a professor of political science at Middle Tennessee State University, called the proposed law \u201cdraconian\u201d and said it was a response to heightened mobilization among African-American voters in the last election. \u201cYou don\u2019t jail people for trying to politically participate in a democratic way unless you have other motives,\u201d Franklin said. Franklin said he was troubled that individuals and organizations could potentially incur fines for inconsistencies or errors in voter registration forms. \u201cThere\u2019s always deficient applications,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an organization and you register three or four thousand voters, and you have 100 deficient applications, that could be a $10,000 hit. That\u2019s a one percent rate.\u201d In his op-ed, Hargett wrote that deficient applications cost the two largest counties in the state thousands of taxpayer dollars. In Shelby County, the election administrator estimated the cost to be more than $200,000. In Davidson County, the administrator said it cost $35,000 to process and correct forms with insufficient information. Hargett also cited a last-minute surge in voter registration applications as reason for requiring forms to be submitted within 10 days of collection. Tequila Johnson says the bill is a direct attack on the work done by the Tennessee Black Voter Project, for which she served as a statewide manager in the last election. The project was a coordinated effort across several organizations and turned in about 90,000 voter registration applications last year. It also focused on educating voters and building coalitions. \u201cThis project highlighted some really, really big topics here in the state and brought a lot of people together across party lines, across race lines,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I personally think that that is a threat for what our state stands for right now.\u201d Even though the bill could subject her to potential fines and other consequences if passed, Johnson said it wouldn\u2019t discourage her from working on voter registration. \u201cIt would be cowardly of me to give up now because Tre Hargett wants to figure out how to continuously oppress young people, people of color, women and elderly people\u2019s right to vote.\u201d Hargett\u2019s office has not yet returned a phone call for comment.

            "article_content": "Listening to Joe Biden, you might come away with the sense that he is out of touch with the Democratic Party\u2019s electorate, which many believe is younger, further left and better educated than it used to be. Indeed, the party\u2019s voters may be all of these things. But, as HuffPost\u2019s Kevin Robillard wrote, the former vice president seems to be making a bet that there are still plenty of older, more moderate and less educated Democrats who can help him win the nomination. That might not be a bad bet. There\u2019s a case to be made that Democrats are younger than they were at the beginning of the decade. Those younger than the age of 40, for example, made up 6 more points of the Democratic vote in the 2018 midterm than they did in the 2010 midterm, according to a Catalist (a Democratic firm) estimate of the national voter file. The exit polls illustrate a similar trend. A Biden 2020 candidacy would confront Democratic Party with its past But even if Democrats are younger than they once were, Millennials and Generation Z voters (roughly those younger than 40) are still very much the minority of Democrats. They made up just about 29% of all Democratic voters in the 2018 midterm, per Catalist. In fact even when you add in those 40 to 49 years old, you still only account for about 44% of Democratic voters in 2018. In other words, the AARP demographic (age 50 and older) were the majority (56%) of 2018 Democratic voters, per Catalist. And in case you were wondering, those ages 65 and older (27%) made up about double the percentage of Democrats who were younger than 30 (14%). The exit polls can differ slightly on the exact level each age group makes up of the electorate, though all sources agree that a majority of Democratic voters are age 45 and older. That\u2019s a big deal when age was the No. 1 predictor of vote choice in the 2016 primary and continues to be a primary driver of vote choice in early 2020 polling. A candidate who is receiving the bulk of their support from older voters \u2013 like, for example, a Biden \u2013 is in a considerably better position than a candidate who does best with younger voters. It\u2019s how Hillary Clinton won last time, despite Bernie Sanders swamping her among younger voters. Whether it be the exit polls, Gallup or the Pew Research Center, there\u2019s no doubt Democrats are more liberal than they once were. In the exit polls, for example, the percentage of Democratic voters who identify as liberal rose by double-digits between the Democratic midterm blowouts of 2006 and 2018. Still, moderates and conservatives make up about 50% of all Democrats. In the 2018 midterms, the exit polls found that moderates and conservatives made up 54% of those who voted Democratic. Pew similarly put moderate and conservative Democrats as 54% of all self-identified Democrats and independents who lean Democratic voters in 2018. Gallup\u2019s 2018 figures had moderates as 47% of all adults who self-identified as Democrats. And while liberals make up about 50% of Democrats, many of them are only \u201csomewhat liberal.\u201d In a Quinnipiac University poll taken last month, people who identified as \u201cvery liberal\u201d were only 19% of all Democrats and independents who leaned Democratic. Very liberals made up the same 19% of those who said they were voting Democratic in Suffolk University\u2019s final 2018 pre-election poll. The 2016 primary exit polls discovered that about 25% of Democratic primary voters called themselves very liberal. Put another way: the moderate/conservative wing of the Democratic Party likely still makes up at least 2 times as much of the party\u2019s voters than the very liberal flank. Again, this is probably good news for Biden, given that his support in the last Quinnipiac University poll among moderate and conservative Democrats (37%) was more than double his support from very liberal Democrats (14%). It further suggests that Democrats who run far to the left may be misreading where the electorate is. Democratic voters are more likely to have a college education than they used to. Catalist, Pew and Gallup all show a trend toward Democrats being more educated than they used to be. Despite this growing education, however, Democratic voters are still more likely to lack a college degree. According to Catalist, about 59% of voters who cast a ballot for the Democrats in 2018 didn\u2019t have a college degree. Gallup and Pew have the percentage of self-identified without a college degree well into the 60s. The exit polls, which historically have painted a better educated electorate than other sources, found about 55% of 2018 Democratic voters lacking a college degree. Even among white Democrats, there are still many voters who have no college degree. Among whites, Catalist calculates the percentage of 2018 Democratic voters without a college degree at about 54%, compared to 46% who had a college degree. Gallup and Pew have the percentage of self-identified Democrats without a college degree in the high 50s among whites. The exit poll had them as a slight minority at 48% of voters who went for the Democrats in 2018. As the Washington Post\u2019s David Byler put it, \u201cDemocrats should stop chasing Trump\u2019s base. They have their own white working-class voters.\u201d When you broaden it out to look at all Democratic voters, all the sources I could find have whites with a college degree as less than a third of all Democrats. Most have them at less than 30%. Currently, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a large education divide in Democratic primary polling. A candidate who is able to tap into the large working class vote within the party, however, will have a big time advantage. All together, a Democratic candidate of the old, moderate and working class stands a better shot of winning the primary than one of the young, left and college educated.",

            "article_content": "Presidential Democratic hopeful Pete Buttigieg said he believes that if America leads on human rights and LGBT issues, \u201cother country leaders would actually be, to some extent, forced by world opinion to make some advancements.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s one example of why American moral authority, even today, is so important, because other models are being held up right now,\u201d Buttigieg, who married his husband Chasten last year, said in an interview with Van Jones on \u201cThe Van Jones Show\u201d airing on CNN Saturday at 7 p.m. ET when asked about how other world leaders would respond to America having a gay couple in the White House. \u201cWhen we show leadership, people respond, and that includes when we show by an election that we\u2019re an inclusive country \u2014 whether that\u2019s about an LGBT leader or in some other way \u2014 that other country leaders would actually be, to some extent, forced by world opinion to make some advancements. It\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s at stake right now if America is not trusted, is not respected, then it won\u2019t much matter what we have to say about that or any other human rights issue,\u201d the South Bend, Indiana, mayor said. This week Buttigieg scored his highest Democratic primary national poll number to date, at 4% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. \u201cThere\u2019s this intangible energy you can just feel when I walk into a room,\u201d Buttigieg said. But to win in 2020, Buttigieg says Democrats can\u2019t just point to the \u201cchaos\u201d of the Trump administration, calling for a serious look into what Trump voters and the President himself are saying. \u201cIf [President Donald Trump] is saying the system is rigged \u2014 and the way he\u2019s saying it is twisted and not really true, but there\u2019s a kernel of truth in there \u2014 and we look like we\u2019re the ones saying, \u2018oh no, the system is perfectly fine,\u2019 then we\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThe problem is normal wasn\u2019t working for a lot of people,\u201d he said. Buttigieg, 37, said his background as a small-city mayor in a red state allows him to reach voters \u2014 particularly in the industrial Midwest \u2014 in a different way than other candidates. \u201cThey just haven\u2019t heard from us in a while.  And I think coming from that part of the country, as well as the generational background that I have \u2014 and the background of being a mayor, which just puts you in a different headspace, I think \u2014 than if you go to work in Washington every day. I think that that just might create a way to reach people differently,\u201d he said. Buttigieg discussed diversity among the 2020 Democratic candidates and slammed Trump\u2019s rhetoric as sowing division in the country. \u201cRight now, identity as means of division is being mastered by this White House. We\u2019re in a moment of peak white identity politics. And it\u2019s being used to divide us across the working middle class, to divide us regionally, to divide us on partisan lines,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to use political rhetoric to make people feel big-hearted and secure and forward-looking. But it can be done and then that\u2019s one of the reasons to get into this in the first place.\u201d Tune in to \u201cThe Van Jones Show\u201d at 7 p.m. ET Saturday for the full interview.",

            "article_content": "Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive turned government official, is leaving her post as administrator of the Small Business Administration. McMahon is leaving President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to join his outside political group, America First, two sources familiar with the move confirmed to CNN. The President deemed McMahon a \u201csuperstar\u201d in a send-off from his Mar-a-Lago club on Friday. He said her new role would help him win re-election after she leaves her post. \u201cThe fact is that I\u2019ve known her for a long time. I knew she was good but I didn\u2019t know she was that good. She has been one of our all-time favorites,\u201d he said from Mar-a-Lago, where he was seated on a sofa alongside his outgoing official. \u201cShe\u2019ll be leaving. She\u2019s going to go help us with a very, very important year and a half we have coming up,\u201d he said. \u201cThe re-election as they call it.\u201d He said he would announce a replacement soon who fits in \u201cvery beautifully.\u201d One of the highest-ranking women in government \u2013 and one of the richest \u2013 McMahon had served largely under the radar in her more than two years at the agency. Unlike some of her Cabinet counterparts, she has not drawn the ire of Democrats in Congress or of ethics experts. Politico first reported McMahon\u2019s plans. Instead, she\u2019s quietly led the unassuming agency in its lending programs and disaster relief efforts, working to increase loans to women-run businesses and traveling with the President when he visited hurricane-struck areas. Linda McMahon picked to be Small Business administrator \u201cPOTUS loves her,\u201d one source familiar with the matter said. The President and his political allies have been looking for someone close to the President and with credibility among the GOP donor class to go take a senior role at America First. She will primarily help with fundraising, the sources said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that ties it all together,\u201d a second source familiar with the move said. Nick Ayers, the former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, was at one point talked about to head up the group, as was Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the second source said. It is not clear yet what exactly McMahon\u2019s title will be at the organization. A longtime friend of the President\u2019s, McMahon and Trump first encountered each other in the 1980s, when the President was developing casinos in Atlantic City and McMahon was launching what would become World Wrestling Entertainment, a $1 billion enterprise she ran with her husband Vince. Trump made a string of appearances on WWE programs over the course of his career as a business executive, perhaps never more memorably than when he body-slammed Vince McMahon before shaving his head. The couple were major donors to Trump, but Linda McMahon did not arrive at her Cabinet position without some political experience. She ran unsuccessfully for US Senate in Connecticut twice. Over the course of Trump\u2019s campaign, McMahon at moments distanced herself from his more inflammatory language, including what she said were \u201cdeplorable\u201d words about women. But she returned to the fold after he won, and accepted the position at the Small Business Administration. The agency isn\u2019t well known, which probably helped McMahon keep a low profile in an administration where outshining the President can be treacherous and ethics scandals have been rampant. She has instead worked to boost the agency\u2019s loans to women-run businesses, and acted as a proponent for the Republican tax cut package as it moved its way through Capitol Hill last year.",

            "article_content": "He\u2019s trashed the British Prime Minister. He\u2019s cheered protesters in France. And now he\u2019s handed Israel\u2019s embattled leader a win days before a re-election. When it comes to other countries\u2019 domestic politics, President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t hesitated to put his thumb on the scale. When he first met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office weeks after his inauguration, Trump heard out the Israeli prime minister\u2019s appeal to recognize Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. But Trump didn\u2019t immediately deliver. Instead, he waited until less than three weeks before the most consequential election of Netanyahu\u2019s political career to announce \u201cit is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\u201d Combined with the warm embrace Trump will offer Netanyahu in Washington next week and the White House\u2019s silence on the timing of the announcement, experts quickly identified Trump\u2019s recognition of the Golan Heights as a brazen attempt to boost Netanyahu\u2019s re-election chances, giving him a foreign policy achievement to tout in the final stretch of the campaign. Trump says it's time for US to recognize 'Israel's Sovereignty over the Golan Heights' And while it was perhaps the most blatant attempt by the Trump administration to wade into a foreign contest, it was not the only time the President or his team has weighed in on the domestic politics of other countries. From undercutting British Prime Minister Theresa May during a visit to the United Kingdom to calling attention to protests against French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump has repeatedly sought to influence the internal affairs of the US\u2019s closest allies \u2013 in full public view. \u201cIt\u2019s not without precedent that United States leaders have said things that affect politics in other countries, but it is without precedent for them to do it as brazenly as Trump has done,\u201d said Joseph Nye, the former dean of Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cHis style and the degree to which he intervenes are both unprecedented.\u201d American administrations have long sought to quietly sway the domestic politics of other countries, whether through covert influence campaigns or military support. But rarely has a US president so eagerly voiced his opinions or taken steps to influence another country\u2019s internal affairs, particularly among close US allies. Instead \u2013 even when an administration\u2019s preferred outcome was widely known or assumed \u2013 the White House maintained an officially neutral stance. A country\u2019s internal affairs were off-limits, at least as a matter of stated position. With the Israeli elections approaching and Netanyahu damaged by a pending indictment stemming from a corruption investigation, it became increasingly clear that Trump would look to bolster one of his closest international partners. Netanyahu in recent weeks had begun to renew his push for the US to recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel. Earlier this month, he brought US ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, to the Israeli-occupied territory, touting its strategic importance. Graham, a close ally of the President\u2019s, promised Netanyahu he would personally lobby Trump to deliver. The Israeli ambassador\u2019s visit was a precursor to Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday, a senior administration official told CNN. The Golan Heights recognition had been in the works for several weeks, the official said, and culminated in a series of meetings between the President and his senior staff this week. US officials have offered no explanation as to why Trump decided to take this step now, rather than wait until after Israel\u2019s April 9 elections. \u201cThe timing is bad. There\u2019s no question about it that making a move like this that would even give the appearance of support to the incumbent prime minister is \u2013 it will be viewed by some as problematic,\u201d said Jonathan Schanzer, an expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who has previously called for the US to recognize the Golan Heights. But Schanzer pointed out that past US presidents have also sought to sway Israeli elections. President Bill Clinton, for example, invited Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres to the White House to sign an anti-terror pact at the White House just under a month before Peres faced reelection. Trump, though \u2013 who enjoys sky-high popularity in Israel \u2013 will welcome Netanyahu to the White House for meetings and a dinner over two days just two weeks before Israeli elections. And he is handing Netanyahu an achievement sought by successive Israeli administrations. Trump has sought to leave his imprint on the politics of another close US ally, the United Kingdom. After openly advocating for the United Kingdom to vote to leave the European Union as a presidential candidate, Trump as president has done little to disguise his views of UK\u2019s May and her handling of the matter, which has drawn scorn from all sides in the United Kingdom. Hours before he met May at her Chequers estate outside London in July, the Sun newspaper published an interview with Trump in which he undercut his counterpart and suggested one of her political rivals, former London mayor Boris Johnson, might perform the job better. \u201cI would have done it much differently. I actually told Theresa May how to do it, but she didn\u2019t listen to me,\u201d Trump told the tabloid. \u201cThe deal she is striking is a much different deal than the one people voted on.\u201d Trump apologized in private to May, one of the rare times he\u2019s admitted wrong. And though he\u2019s expressed a desire to remain diplomatically impartial \u2013 \u201cI think we will stay right in our lane,\u201d he said last week when questioned about Brexit \u2013 he has nevertheless bemoaned May\u2019s handling of the issue over and over. \u201cI\u2019m surprised at how badly it\u2019s all gone from the standpoint of a negotiation,\u201d he said in the Oval Office last week, moments after suggesting he wouldn\u2019t offer an opinion on the issue. \u201cI gave the prime minister my ideas on how to negotiate it. And I think you would\u2019ve been successful. She didn\u2019t listen to that, and that\u2019s fine.\u201d A few weeks before, Trump spoke briefly with one of the UK\u2019s most visible pro-Brexit campaigners, Nigel Farage, on the sidelines of a conservative conference outside Washington. And he\u2019s maintained close ties to the hardline conservatives who have bemoaned May\u2019s handling of the matter. Trump wasn\u2019t alone in his criticism. Two of his top confidants \u2013 son Donald Trump Jr. and national security adviser John Bolton \u2013 both offered critical views this week of May and her plan to try and delay Britain\u2019s exit from Europe. \u201cThe people of Britain have voted. When is the political class going to give effect to that vote?\u201d Bolton said in an interview with the British broadcaster Sky. Trump Jr. was more forceful in an opinion article published in the Telegraph, comparing the Brexit referendum to his father\u2019s election and asserting both were subject to interference by a class of political elites. \u201cWith the deadline fast approaching, it appears that democracy in the UK is all but dead,\u201d wrote Trump Jr., who hasn\u2019t weighed in previously on foreign matters and isn\u2019t a known expert in British politics. \u201cWhy is this important for us Americans? Because Brexit is an example of how the establishment elites try to subvert the will of the people when they\u2019re given the chance.\u201d The White House declined to say whether Trump Jr.\u2019s op-ed reflected the views of the administration, or whether he consulted with the White House about his message. On Brexit at least, Trump was not completely breaking from presidential norm. His predecessor President Barack Obama traveled to London in the months leading up to referendum and encouraged voters against a decision to leave the EU, saying such a move would leave them at the \u201cback of the queue\u201d for a trade deal with the US. Across the English channel, Trump has also not hesitated to undercut his French counterpart, hailing the Yellow Vest protests in France as an endorsement of his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. \u201cHow is the Paris Environmental Accord working out for France? After 18 weeks of rioting by the Yellow Vest Protesters, I guess not so well! In the meantime, the United States has gone to the top of all lists on the Environment,\u201d he wrote last week. That was quickly followed by a phone call from President Emmanuel Macron, who began his tenure as a fast friend of Trump\u2019s only to see the relationship sour over perceived slights and divergent views. While the France protests were spurred in part by anger over rising fuel prices, they are not an explicit opposition to the climate deal, which Trump withdrew from early in his presidency. That hasn\u2019t seemed to matter to the President, who claimed on Twitter starting late last year the sometimes-violent protesters were clamoring for a Trump-like leader. \u201cThe Paris Agreement isn\u2019t working out so well for Paris,\u201d tweeted Trump in December. \u201cProtests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting \u2018We Want Trump!\u2019 Love France.\u201d Later, it was determined that a widely circulated video of protesters uttering that chant were from a far-right protest in London, not the yellow vest protests in France. Trump has even struck out at his French counterpart by highlighting his unpopularity, even though the President himself has suffered from sluggish approval ratings. \u201cThe problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%,\u201d Trump tweeted in November. \u201cMAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",

            "article_content": "Before Joe Cunningham won his race to represent the South Carolina Lowcountry, a coastal House district not held by a Democrat in nearly 40 years, former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed him, campaigned for him \u2013 and picked up his tab for fried chicken and a jalape\u00f1o-flecked waffle at Page\u2019s Okra Grill in Mount Pleasant. The day after Cunningham\u2019s upset victory, Biden called to congratulate him. The Point | Why Joe Biden's 'inevitability' campaign may be a mistake There aren\u2019t too many nationally recognized Democrats who can go to a district that President Donald Trump won by over a dozen points. But Biden is one them. While all of the major potential presidential candidates crisscrossed the country in 2018 to help Democrats take back the House, Biden was unique in that he could go almost anywhere. \u201cI think he has a way of talking to people and connecting with folks,\u201d said Cunningham in an interview. \u201cHe knows South Carolina well.\u201d For moderate Democrats on Capitol Hill facing re-election in competitive races, the idea of Biden running for president is comforting. They know that nominating a presidential candidate too far to the left \u2013 even if it is what the base craves in a primary \u2013 could jeopardize their own political futures. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who won his race by just a few points in a state Trump won by more than 40, said moderate Democrats \u201care very concerned.\u201d \u201cIf they are going to be stamped and perceived to be the far left, then that creates a tremendous challenge for them,\u201d he said. Joe Biden readies major endorsements and message of strength ahead of likely 2020 run So far, Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont have dominated the race\u2019s initial polls from states holding the opening contests, representing two distinct parts of a party torn both by ideology and tactics. Sanders\u2019 style of politics \u2013 including support for single-payer health care and a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d for environmental policy \u2013 has defined the Democratic debate since he lost the primary to Hillary Clinton in 2016. While Biden recognizes the wide income gap in the country, and called for making college free, he would not be expected to wage class warfare like Sanders, a democratic socialist, in a presidential run. That cheers Democrats who worry that Sanders could imperil their re-election races either by becoming the nominee himself or pulling the rest of the presidential candidates to the left. Rep. Katie Hill of California, a leader of the House Democratic freshman class, has already endorsed her home state senator, Kamala Harris. She\u2019s impressed by Harris\u2019 way of being both \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201cpragmatic.\u201d Hill said that she understood that a presidential candidate must carefully navigate the primary and general elections to win. But she is also worried that her own candidate now sounds too liberal. \u201cI do want to see some form of moderation,\u201d said Hill. \u201cHer talking points have clearly moved to the left.\u201d \u201cI respect her and I understand, but I am also a little bit like \u2026 it makes me a little bit nervous,\u201d she added. Analysis | Joe Biden's not so secret weapon: Barack Obama Biden doesn\u2019t have that problem. Some freshmen congressmen who played a pivotal role in helping Democrats win the House majority believe the presidential field needs centrist candidates like Biden to give voice to the concerns of voters in swing states and districts. They think the Delaware senator for 36 years, and President Barack Obama\u2019s Vice President for another eight, could appeal to voters in the Midwest that Clinton lost in 2016. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania told CNN that she is \u201cexcited to see somebody like Mr. Biden get into the race.\u201d The congresswoman emphasized that it\u2019s important for the party to have a \u201cpragmatic voice\u201d in the 2020 campaign, though she added that there are other candidates who could also represent that type of political approach. \u201cI think that two-thirds of the people who were elected in this last Congress as Democrats as freshmen represent those sort of purple places like where I come from where a more pragmatic voice needs to be heard,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that the path to the presidency for a Democrat needs to go through places like Pennsylvania or Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio.\u201d Rep. Steven Horsford of Nevada, said \u201csix or seven\u201d presidential candidates have been in his state in recent weeks, he\u2019d met \u201cvirtually\u201d all of them and that Biden would do well after coming to the state so many times over the years, including to campaign for him in 2018. \u201cI think the vice president has a very strong record on fighting for working families,\u201d Horsford said. \u201cHe would make a very strong showing should he decide to get into the race.\u201d While many Democratic lawmakers are still drawn to the glow of that Obama-Biden ticket, their record \u2013 expanding health care insurance to millions through the Affordable Care Act, passing a stimulus package to dig the country out from the Great Recession, overhauling the financial services industry through the Dodd-Frank Act, creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to protect young immigrants who illegally came to the country \u2013 will be both applauded and scrutinized by Democratic primary voters. Sen. Chris Coons, who took Biden\u2019s Delaware seat, said Biden \u201cbridges\u201d the \u201cfake divide between progressive left and centrist Democrats.\u201d Even though Biden has yet to announce a run, Coons and Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware said last week that it looks like he will. \u201cI probably want him to run for president more than he wants to run \u2013 and I think he\u2019s almost there,\u201d Carper said. \u201cI am optimistic that Joe Biden will soon announce his candidacy to be president,\u201d Coons added. If he decided to run, Biden would join a dozen current and former Democratic officials shooting for the highest public office, all of whom are vying for the support of those from early state primaries. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the healthiest field of candidates we\u2019ve had in my lifetime,\u201d said Cunningham, who has begun to develop relationships with other presidential candidates besides Biden. He and his wife Amanda have received advice on how to cope with the complete lifestyle change that comes with being elected to Congress from former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and his wife Amy. He also held an event for veterans with South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg last year. Rather than take the most liberal track in a crowded Democratic primary, Cunningham advocated to follow the path struck by his fellow new House Democrats who won in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Joe Biden's experience sets him apart. It could also hurt him in 2020. \u201cI think you take a look at those elections, the common thread was pragmatic, common sense,\u201d he added. \u201cIn our race, putting Lowcountry over party and putting people over politics.\u201d One of those establishment-favored candidates who emerged from a fierce Democratic primary, freshman Rep. Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, said that Biden had a path to the presidency, but noted that some Democrats will make the argument that it\u2019s time for a new generation to take the White House. \u201cThere are a lot of voters that respect the service of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders but are looking at some of the younger candidates who represent a fresh perspective,\u201d he said. If Biden ran, younger Democratic opponents \u2013 Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Harris, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, O\u2019Rourke, Buttigieg, etc. \u2013 could all highlight his pre-Obama era views on banking and criminal justice legislation, and his handling of Anita Hill\u2019s sexual harassment allegations during Clarence Thomas\u2019 Supreme Court confirmation hearing, to say he is out of step with party. When asked about those who helped him during the 2018 campaign, Pappas noted Booker\u2019s event at the University of New Hampshire brought out a \u201chuge crowd\u201d and registered \u201ca lot\u201d of voters. \u201cI think voters are interested in (candidates\u2019) positions on a variety of issues, but I think the bottom line continues to be they want a winner,\u201d Pappas said.",

            "article_content": "On Sunday, President Donald Trump sent out 29(!) tweets and retweets. Which, in and of itself, is a remarkable thing to say about the chief executive of the United States. (A prolific tweeter and retweeter myself, I sent out 15 tweets on Sunday. And, relatedly, I am not the president of the United States.) But, it\u2019s not just the sheer quantity of Trump tweets and retweets that are so mind-boggling. It\u2019s what he said in them.  Here\u2019s a brief summary: All of this \u2013 and lots, lots more \u2013 in the space of a single day. Now. Trump has had lots of oh-my-God-did-you-see-what-he-just-tweeted days. I still remember when he took to Twitter, with no proof, that President Barack Obama had ordered Trump Tower wiretapped during the 2016 election. Or when Trump said that MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski was bleeding badly after a face lift. But, for the most part, these were one-offs \u2013 a single nutty tweet amid Trump\u2019s usual daily mix of propaganda and mistruth. Never before \u2013 or at least not as far back as I can remember \u2013 have we seen such a sustained day of wildness and wackiness from Trump. Which is saying something. Because Trump has long turned to Twitter as his preferred method of communicating \u2013 with his supporters, with the media and with the country. And Twitter \u2013 I\u2019ve long argued \u2013 is where the truest form of Trump comes out. It\u2019s his Twitter feed \u2013 not official White House statements or signing ceremonies \u2013 where we find out what is on Trump\u2019s mind and what he really thinks about his presidency and the world. When you think of it that way, what we witnessed on Sunday is somewhere between concerning and absolutely terrifying. The most powerful man in the country \u2013 and maybe the world \u2013 spent his day touting unproven conspiracy theories about stolen elections, suggesting collusion between Democrats and comedians, attacking a military hero and Republican senator, and trying to program his favorite cable network\u2019s broadcasts. And he did all of this while failing to send even a single tweet about the tragic mass shooting in New Zealand. George Conway, the husband of White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, tweeted an image to the diagnosis for \u201cNarcissistic Personality Disorder\u201d and said bluntly of Trump: \u201cHis condition is getting worse.\u201d Brian Klass, a political scientist at UCL, was slightly more expansive: \u201cWe have a seriously dangerous normalcy bias, where we move on because we desperately want to pretend it\u2019s okay. Trump\u2019s Twitter meltdown today\u2014which shows a deranged and unhinged person\u2014will just be forgotten by Monday afternoon. But the deranged man will still control the nukes.\u201d Trump\u2019s critics questioning his decision-making \u2013 or mental heath \u2013 isn\u2019t all that new. What was new, however, was that the White House felt the need to mobilize some of its most senior officials to push back on the idea that Trump was slipping mentally. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t share those concerns,\u201d Kellyanne Conway told reporters Monday of her husband\u2019s worries about Trump\u2019s mental health. Conway\u2019s assertion came less than 24 hours after acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was forced to insist that \u201cthe President is not a white supremacist.\u201d Mulvaney also said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can say the President is anti-Muslim.\u201d When, in the space of 24 hours, two of the top officials in the White House are going public to claim that the President isn\u2019t a) crazy b) a white supremacist or c) anti-Muslim, you know Trump is going through a very rough patch. And, as with many of Trump\u2019s problems, this latest series is self-created. His willingness to take to Twitter to air grievances, promote conspiracy theories and, well, just riff rightly raises questions in the mind of any thinking person about how he thinks, what he cares about and how all of that impacts his leadership of the country. If Trump\u2019s Sunday on Twitter doesn\u2019t raise some concerns for you, you aren\u2019t paying close enough attention.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders advocated for the nationalization of most major industries, including energy companies, factories, and banks, when he was a leading member of a self-described \u201cradical political party\u201d in the 1970s, a CNN KFile review of his record reveals. Sanders\u2019 past views shed light on a formative period of his political career that could become relevant as he advances in the 2020 Democratic primary. Many of the positions he held at the time are more extreme compared to the more tempered democratic socialism the Vermont senator espouses today and could provide fodder for moderate Democrats and Republicans looking to cast the Democratic presidential candidate and his beliefs as a fringe form of socialism that would be harmful to the country. Aspects of Sanders\u2019 plans and time in the Liberty Union have been reported before, but the material taken together, including hundreds of newly digitalized newspapers and files from the Liberty Union Party archived at the University of Vermont, paint a fuller portrait of Sanders\u2019 views on state and public-controlled industry at the time. CNN Poll: The strengths and the weaknesses of the Democrats in Iowa In a statement to CNN, Sanders campaign spokesman Josh Orton said, \u201cThroughout his career, Bernie has fought on the side of working people and against the influence of both the powerful ultra-rich and giant corporations who seek only to further their own greed. The record shows that from the very beginning, Bernie anticipated and worked to combat the rise of a billionaire ruling class and the exploding power of Wall Street and multinational corporations. Whether fighting to lower energy prices or expand access to capital for local development, Bernie\u2019s first priority has always been \u2013 and will always be \u2013 defending the interests of working people across the country.\u201d After moving to Vermont in 1968 several years after graduating college, Sanders became an active member of the left-wing Liberty Union Party. Under the Liberty Union banner, Sanders, then in his early 30s, ran for governor of Vermont in 1972 and 1976 and as a candidate for US Senate in 1972 and 1974. Sanders, also served as chairman of the party from 1973-1975. During this time, Sanders and Liberty Union argued for nationalization of the energy industry, public ownership of banks, telephone, electric, and drug companies and of the major means of production such as factories and capital, as well as other proposals such as a 100% income tax on the highest income earners in America. Sanders also rejected political violence and criticized the anti-democratic nature of communist states such as the Soviet Union. \u201cI favor the public ownership of utilities, banks and major industries,\u201d Sanders said in one interview with the Burlington Free Press in 1976. In his career as a US Senator, Sanders has backed away from such ardent calls for nationalization, but maintained similar rhetoric on wealth inequality. In one 2015 speech, he said he didn\u2019t want the government to take over private business or \u201cown the means of production.\u201d But his early views are notable because they are far to the left of the current Democratic party and most candidates running for office. Sanders left the Liberty Union Party in 1977, over what he said was the party\u2019s lack of activity between elections. Sanders said in his farewell that workers would need to take control for the country to be sustained. \u201cThe function of a radical political party is very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is to create a situation in which the ordinary working people take what rightfully belongs to them. Nobody can predict the future of the workers\u2019 movement in this country or the state of Vermont. It is my opinion, however, that if workers do not take power in a reasonably short time this country will not have a future.\u201d In 1973, during his time as chairman of the Liberty Union Party, Sanders took to a Vermont paper to oppose Richard Nixon\u2019s energy policy and oil industry profits, calling for the entire energy industry to be nationalized. Consumers at the time had been facing steep price increases and heavy shortages as a result of the OPEC oil embargo. \u201cI would also urge you to give serious thought about the eventual nationalization of these gigantic companies,\u201d Sanders wrote in a December 1973 open letter to Vermont Sen. Robert Stafford that ran in the Vermont Freeman. \u201cIt is extremely clear that these companies, owned by a handful of billionaires, have far too much power over the lives of Americans to be left in private hands. The oil industry, and the entire energy industry, should be owned by the public and used for the public good \u2013 not for additional profits for billionaires.\u201d Efforts to push for public ownership of Vermont\u2019s utilities like telephone and electric companies played prominently in Sanders\u2019 political career in the 1970s. Sanders ran for Senate in a January 1972 in the special election and governor in that year\u2019s November election, registering in the low single digits in both races. When he launched his first campaign for the Senate in 1971, Sanders said state utilities needed to be run by the state of Vermont on a nonprofit basis and that if revenues exceed expenditures they could be used to fund government programs and lower property taxes. In 1976, Sanders went even further: calling for the state to seize ownership of Vermont\u2019s private electric companies without compensation to investors. He defended his proposals routinely by pointing out that municipally owned utilities, not uncommon throughout the country, often had lower consumer prices. Utilities like the Green Mountain Power company and the New England Telephone company had been steadily pushing, successful and unsuccessful at times, for approval from state regulators for rate increases. Sanders was particularly incensed by a proposed 27% rate hike by the New England Telephone company, and it became a rallying cry for his political campaigns. In 1973, as chairman of the Liberty Union Party, Sanders had organized boycotts to stop proposed rate increases from New England Telephone company. Sanders\u2019 efforts through the \u201cThe Vermont Telephone Boycott Committee\u201d \u2013 a committee he coordinated that year \u2013 proved successful in blocking NET rate increases. Newspapers commended Sanders for efforts when the rate increases were blocked by the state\u2019s utility regulators. Sanders would declare for the Senate again the following June in 1974 and for governor in 1976, and Vermont\u2019s utilities would remain a major focus point of his campaigns and Liberty Union Party. Sanders\u2019 rhetoric was strongest during his 1976 campaign for governor of Vermont, his last before he left the Liberty Union Party. In a press release on his policy positions, Sanders campaigned on the public ownership of the state\u2019s electric companies, without compensating the banks and stockholders. \u201cI will be campaigning in support of the Liberty Union utility proposal which calls for the public ownership of Vermont\u2019s private electric companies without compensation to the banks and wealthy stockholders who own the vast majority of stock in these companies,\u201d he said in a July 1976 press release. \u201cI will also be calling for public ownership of the telephone company \u2013 which is probably the single greatest rip-off company in America.\u201d Sanders argued utility companies engaged in \u201ceconomic blackmail,\u201d saying the state gave the companies the right to charge \u201coutrageous\u201d rates for utilities or have consumers suffer from poor service. Sanders\u2019 comments went beyond the Liberty Union\u2019s proposal for public takeover of state utilities, which said investors and bondholders with more than 100 shares would have to convert their holding to non-voting stock and income bonds which carry no fixed claim to dividends or interest payments. Sanders\u2019 policy proposals that year also included an ambitious plan to deal with companies attempting to leave towns. \u201cWe have got to begin to deal with the fact that corporations do not have the god-given right to disrupt the lives of their workers or the economic foundation of their towns simply because they wish to move elsewhere to earn a higher rate of profit,\u201d Sanders said in a press release in August 1976. Sanders\u2019 plan would require large businesses attempting to leave cities to get permission from the towns and the workers in them. If the company did not get that approval they would be required by law to pay a guaranteed two years of severance for workers and 10 years of taxes for the town. Nationally, Sanders said, legislation corporations leaving cities would have to be dealt with by turning the means of production over to the workers. \u201cIn the long run, the problem of the fleeing corporations must be dealt with on the national level by legislation which will bring about the public ownership of the major means of production and their conversion into worker-controlled enterprises,\u201d he said. Campaign literature that year from Sanders, including a 1976 brochure for the party, said, \u201cI believe that, in the long run, major industries in this state and nation should be publicly owned and controlled by the workers themselves.\u201d Public control of the economy would become the key issue in his race. Speaking at one forum, Sanders called for workers to control of capital, factories, banks and corporations. \u201cThere is a handful of people sitting at the head of the main banks controlling the destiny of underprivileged nations, the country as well as Vermont\u2019s economy,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat is not tolerable. That control cannot be held by them. We need public control over capital; and the capital must be put to use for public need not for the advancement of those who made the investments.\u201d In an interview with the Burlington Free Press, Sanders argued the richest two or three percent should not control capital. \u201cI favor the public ownership of utilities, banks and major industries. In Vermont we have some $2 billion of deposits in our banks,\u201d Sanders told the paper. \u201cIn Vermont, as well as nationally, it is not tolerable to me that the control of capital would remain in the hands of the richest two or three percent of the population to do with it as they like.\u201d Sanders called that year in a policy paper for Vermont\u2019s banking laws to be \u201cradically\u201d revised, so that the public and the state \u201cdetermine in what manner our savings are invested so as to make Vermont a better place to live.\u201d Asked about healthcare, Sanders said there would need to be publicly-controlled drug companies. \u201cI believe in socialized medicine, public ownership of the drug companies and placing doctors on salaries. The idea that millionaires can make money by selling poor people drugs that they desperately need for highly inflated prices disgusts me,\u201d he said. Heavy taxation of wealthy people played prominently into Sanders\u2019 plans to pay for expanding government services. In February 1976, Liberty Union put out a state tax proposal calling for a radical revamping of the system, including the removal of all taxes of sales, beverages, cigarettes, polls, and the use of telephones, railroads or electric energy. Tax rates for those earning more than $100,00 would be 33.47%, $50,000-$99,999 would be 19%, $25,000-$49,000 would be 13.56%, and $10,000-$14,999 would be 4%. Anyone earning less than $10,000 would pay no state income tax. But Sanders\u2019 rhetoric at times went much further. During his 1974 Senate run, Sanders said one plan to expand government included making it illegal to gain more wealth than person could spend in a lifetime and have a 100% tax on incomes above this level. (Sanders defined this as $1 million dollars annually). \u201cNobody should earn more than a million dollars,\u201d Sanders said.",

            "article_content": "Of course there\u2019s a way to buy your way into college, thought everyone who ever wondered how an admissions board separates one kid from another. Now a raft of indictments against actors, business executives, doctors and lawyers suggests a nationwide conspiracy of very powerful and wealthy people paying exorbitant amounts to cheat their kids\u2019 way into college \u2013 a scandal that hits squarely at America\u2019s striving middle class. The episode offers yet another clue about why policy proposals many Democrats call progressive and some Republicans call radical have gotten such traction this year. Jobs guarantees, baby bonds, Medicare for All and free college tuition are just some of the ideas Democrats have proposed to take privileges from the wealthy and try to offer them to everyone else. What\u2019s behind the appeals that Democrats, including some 2020 presidential contenders, are making is that the cards are stacked against anyone who follows the rules, and there\u2019s a side game only the rich are allowed to play. The college admissions scandal offers up some indication that they\u2019re right \u2013 and what makes it so surprising is that, this time, the rich might have to pay a price. The alleged scam has yielded headlines for implicating the actresses/overeager college moms Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin and Loughlin\u2019s husband, Mossimo founder Mossimo Giannulli, in criminal behavior. FBI: Parents paid up to $6.5M for guaranteed admission The details of the indictments paint an unpleasant picture of college coaches and administrators playing along at cheating on college entrance exams. While many American high schoolers and their parents are agonizing over whether they can even pay for college, there\u2019s a subset of the country apparently agonizing over whether they can pay the $500,000 they\u2019ll need to sneak into the right college. That\u2019s $500,000 on top of the more-than-$50,000 tuition. There are, of course, also many stories of wealthy people whose children found their way into top-flight schools despite nonstellar careers in high school. ProPublica and The Guardian wrote a very interesting tale about how the father of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s now-son-in-law, pledged to give $2.5 million to Harvard, paid in installments. Both of his sons got in. The payments were discovered by ProPublica from a subpoena by federal authorities of his charitable giving. At the end of the day \u2013 and there\u2019s no direct evidence these three pieces of information are linked \u2013 Harvard got a $2.5 million pledge. Jared Kushner got accepted. His dad got access to a tax deduction. Trump once tried to sell the idea of Trump University to students who wanted his real estate know-how. He ultimately settled for $25 million with students who said they\u2019d been defrauded. While he thought his own image was enough to sell students on Trump U, he likes to brag that he got his own undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania, what a great school it is and how smart he was to get in. Harvard admissions case could end affirmative action \u201cI went to a great school \u2013 Ivy League school \u2013 all of that stuff. Did well. Smart guy,\u201d he said at Liberty University in January 2016. It was a riff on a line that was often included in his stump speech during the campaign. Trump transferred to Penn after attending Fordham University in New York. College acceptance was a very different thing in the 1960s, but that didn\u2019t stop Trump from trying to make sure his high school and early college records remained private years later, according to his former lawyer. \u201cI\u2019m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores,\u201d Cohen recently said at a hearing on Capitol Hill. Note: Cohen is headed to jail for earlier lying to Congress. It\u2019s not exactly clear how much Trump has given to Penn over the years. A 2016 Daily Pennsylvanian review of university reports found pledges of more than $1.4 million from Trump to the school, though there\u2019s no way to tell if the pledges were fulfilled. Three of his four adult children have degrees from there. This is not meant to be a partisan knock. Huffman, who authorities say paid $15,000 to grease the wheels for her daughter, is a longtime Democratic donor. To a good portion of the country, those sums are so out of reach as to be the stuff of fairy tales. But the story of what government should do to help people pull themselves up is being written, in part, this campaign season. Some Democrats, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is paying loans on her Boston University degree and was until pretty recently working at a bar, are talking about the idea of a federal jobs guarantee. She was shut down by Ivanka Trump, who presumably did not have to pay for loans on her Penn degree, and said during a recent interview that she doesn\u2019t think people want that kind of guarantee. \u201cPeople want to work for what they get,\u201d said Trump, a White House adviser to her father. \u201cSo I think this idea of a guaranteed minimum is not something most people want. They want the ability to be able to secure a job. They want the ability to live in a country where there\u2019s the potential for upward mobility.\u201d Education is key to upward mobility and an important investment Americans can make in themselves. The median weekly wage of an American without any college education was $712 in 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The median wage of a person with a bachelor\u2019s degree was about two-thirds more than that \u2013 $1,173, according to the BLS data. But it is an expensive investment, indeed. The US had more student loan debt than credit card debt in 2017, more than $1 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve. Most students who go to college take on some debt, and, according to the Fed\u2019s annual report on the economic well-being of US households, 20% of Americans with student debt were behind on it. Younger Americans were more likely to have taken on debt, which suggests the problem of student debt will only get worse. In Pew polling, just before the 2016 election, 52% of Americans said the affordability of a college education was a very big problem. In Pew\u2019s poll just before the 2018 midterm elections, a much higher 63% said it was a very big problem. Eighty-six percent said it was a very or moderately big problem in 2016, compared with 90% of voters in 2018. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who\u2019s running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, introduced a proposal for federal and state governments to subsidize tuition and give all American kids access to free college. A number of states, including New York, are experimenting with the idea. The idea of leveling the playing field extends beyond college and debt. Several Democratic candidates, including Sanders, want to end the private insurance market to give everyone access to the same health insurance market. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey would give every American child a nest egg at birth and contribute to it with tax money, giving more to the less fortunate. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts want new taxes on the wealthy in order to create social programs for the middle class and poorer Americans. Sen. Kamala Harris of California wants new tax cuts for the middle class. Proposals like these have drawn accusations of plans for a socialist takeover from Republicans, including President Trump. But what\u2019s at the bottom of each one is trying to do something about the frustration people feel that the capitalist society is doing a lot more for some people than for others.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump claims full credit for the strong economy and stock market. In his telling, everything was set to tank when he moved into the White House and took over from President Barack Obama. Assessing that argument requires giving Trump\u2019s current economy a sort of report card as well as comparing what he\u2019s done with what Obama did. Let\u2019s get started. \u201cWhen I took over this economy, this economy was ready to crash,\u201d he said on Fox News in October. \u201cWe were at 1% GDP. Now we\u2019re at 4.2%. It was ready to crash. It was the worst. If you look from Depression \u2013 from the Great Depression \u2013 it was the worst recovery in the history of our country.\u201d Trump deflates Obama\u2019s numbers here: The gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and at 2.9% for the year. It did achieve a 4.2% growth rate for a single quarter earlier in 2018. But growth was 1.8% in the fourth quarter of Obama\u2019s last year in office and 1.6% over his last year in office, not the 1% Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably had the greatest first two years of any President in our history in terms of what we\u2019ve accomplished with employment, with GDP, with everything,\u201d he told Laura Ingraham on Fox News in February. More recently, at a convention for Republican activists, he said that if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, the stock market would be down 50%, and he inflated how much it\u2019s up on his own watch. \u201cInstead of being up almost 50% with the stock market, you would have been down 50%,\u201d he said. The market is actually up about 23% since he became President. But despite some warning signs like surprisingly few jobs created last month, it\u2019s clear that Trump will argue Obama was doing it wrong, he\u2019s doing it right and he turned it all around. The story of the current US economy is actually the Obama-Trump economic boom, according to Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He noted that the current economic expansion, at 116 months, is among the longest in history (second only to Bill Clinton\u2019s 120-month expansion). And taking stock of the various ways that economists worry about expansions ending, Blinder doesn\u2019t see any of them happening in the US, at least not in the next few months. Don\u2019t look for Democrats to suddenly embrace Trump\u2019s tax cuts or his trade bravado, and don\u2019t look for the President to suddenly embrace Obama\u2019s gift of dropping unemployment and a growing stock market he was able to continue. But the current boom needed both Obama\u2019s extraordinary measures to end the Great Recession and, perhaps, Trump\u2019s efforts to give American companies tax breaks. These two very different ideologies wove together to shepherd the country for the past 10 years. Now for a general look at some of the economic indicators Trump can brag about and some signs of concern and unfulfilled promises he\u2019ll have to answer for: Trump will have to hope a record run of job creation continues. He won\u2019t be helped by jobs reports like the one released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which showed the US economy adding only 20,000 in February, the fewest since September of 2017. When Obama took office, the US economy was shedding jobs at a frightening pace, more than 700,000 per month. The cuts eventually slowed and the US has added jobs every month since October of 2010, the second year of Obama\u2019s first term. That started a record-breaking streak in March 2018 that continues to this day, even with February\u2019s surprise drop-off. So the boom has come under both presidents. It\u2019s hard to compare Trump\u2019s and Obama\u2019s job creation, since Obama took office when the economy was in dire straits and Trump took office when the economy \u2013 despite his claim it was on a precipice \u2013 appeared to be doing well. Trump promised to create 25 million jobs in 10 years, and his economy did see about 4.9 million created in his first 25 months in office. That\u2019s just a smidge fewer than the 5.3 million jobs Obama saw created in the last 25 months he was in office, and also a touch below the pace of job growth promised by Trump. Republicans pledged sustained and remarkable economic growth as a result of Trump\u2019s economic policies and in particular as a result of his tax cuts. The US gross domestic product \u2013 the total value of all US goods and services produced in a year \u2013 has grown between 1.6% and 2.9% every year since 2010. The 2.9% growth in 2018 was very good, the highest since 2015. But it is not the 4% Trump promised as a candidate or the 3.2% the White House predicted more recently with the President\u2019s 2020 budget proposal. Trump is right that the stock market has continued to build value. But it\u2019s hard to argue it was on the verge of collapse when he took over the White House. There have been some ups and downs, but the market has been on a remarkable bull run for 10 years. It was in March of 2009, three months into Obama\u2019s administration, that the S&P 500 hit its Great Recession low of 676. Today it is just under 2,750. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which Trump uses as his yardstick, is similarly up. It was less than 8,000 when Obama took office and is at more than 25,000 today. The unemployment rate has been generally falling since 2009, after Obama took office. The current rate is an incredibly low 3.8%. That\u2019s even better than what economists generally consider \u201cfull employment.\u201d But like the rising stock market, this trend began well before Trump\u2019s 2016 win. Another way to look at it is to apply the employment rate for the prime working age population, 25 to 54. While this view of employment also shows sustained improvement since 2009, it does not yet reflect a complete return to pre-Great Recession levels. The general trend of this metric has been upward since just after the end of the Great Recession in June 2009 through the majority of the Obama administration and all of Trump\u2019s. The growth in American wages is up every year since 2010, but those gains have been focused recently on higher wage earners, exacerbating the real problem of income inequality in the US. That means, after accounting for inflation, that in real dollars Americans\u2019 wages have barely budged in decades, as Pew recently noted. Economists would generally tell you that with unemployment as low as it is, wages should be growing by more. Trump accuses the Federal Reserve of trying to tank his economy by raising interest rates, but that ignores that the Fed kept the rates low for so long to help the economy recover from the Great Recession \u2013 not because Obama was President. While wages generally have grown, the federal minimum wage has not risen since early in the Obama administration, almost 10 years ago, and there\u2019s no indication Trump intends to increase it, although Democrats hoping to replace him want to. Now at $7.25 an hour, it would have to rise to $8.47 immediately just to keep pace with inflation. Many states have raised their minimum wages. House Democrats are moving toward a vote to ease the minimum wage up to more than $15 per hour by 2024, but that proposal faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Specifically, for some of the workers Trump promised to help \u2013 auto workers and coal miners in the Rust Belt, \u2013 wages have fallen. CNN\u2019s Lydia DePillis and Jeremy Moorhead recently profiled the closure of a GM plant in Ohio and the inability of some workers there to take part in government programs to retrain them for new careers. As DePillis wrote, \u201cAs recently as the early 2000s, a job in an auto plant could be a launchpad to the middle class, but those jobs are increasingly rare. During the Lordstown plant\u2019s heyday in the 1970s, GM was one of the biggest private sector employers in the United States, with more than 618,000 employees. That number is now down to about 103,000. And the jobs that remain are not all what they once were. Since 1990, wages for US auto workers have declined 18%, adjusted for inflation. Retirement benefits have declined as well. As of 2017, only 8% of factories offered pensions.\u201d And the share of the US economy dedicated to manufacturing jobs has not risen and it likely won\u2019t since the US economy has moved away from manufacturing, which used to be the largest portion of the US workforce, but now accounts for less than 10%. Part of Trump\u2019s argument in favor of nixing some trade deals and reworking others is that the US should be making more things to export and buying fewer from other countries. Shrinking that trade deficit \u2013 the amount more that the US imports than exports \u2013 is what\u2019s behind his off-again trade war with China and his promise to improve the North American Free Trade Agreement. It\u2019s what\u2019s behind the tariffs he\u2019s threatened or levied on more than $250 billion in goods from China and other countries. The jury is still out on the NAFTA replacement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement he\u2019s proposed; Congress still has to ratify it. But the US trade deficit has continued to grow. In fact, it has spiked more than $100 billion since Trump took office, according to the Census Bureau, which tracks the trade gap. That\u2019s the largest since 2008, before Obama was President. During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to eliminate the federal debt within eight years. With six years left to fulfill his promise, the debt is exploding, largely because of the tax cuts he signed into law. The federal budget deficit, the annual shortfall between what the government brings in with taxes and what it spends on services, is up 77% in the first four months of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period last year, according to new data released by the Treasury Department. Taxes are down. Spending is up. The debt, as a result, is unlikely to be eliminated. The opposite will occur. If existing laws remain the same, the Congressional Budget Office projects the annual deficit could hit more than $1 trillion per year starting in 2022.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic National Committee has chosen Milwaukee as the site of the Democratic National Convention in July 2020, the committee announced Monday after sources confirmed the pick to CNN. The decision means the world of Democratic politics will head to Wisconsin, a state the party failed to win during the 2016 election, to pick their 2020 nominee. The move is a signal that the party believes winning back the upper Midwest could be central to their plans to oust President Donald Trump. \u201cThis choice is a statement of our values, and I\u2019m thrilled Milwaukee will host the 2020 Democratic National Convention,\u201d DNC chairman Tom Perez said. \u201cThe Democratic Party is the party of working people, and Milwaukee is a city of working people. We saw in this last election what we can accomplish when we come together, invest, and fight for working people, and that was proven right here in Wisconsin.\u201d Milwaukee was one of three finalists and the city defeated Miami Beach and Houston. \u201cI want to thank the leaders in Houston and Miami for all their hard work throughout this process. They both put forward competitive proposals that I\u2019m sure will lead them to hosting future conventions,\u201d Perez said. According to one Democratic source familiar with the process, Houston made a strong pitch and the logistics of the event would have worked, but it wasn\u2019t picked because of a dispute between Mayor Sylvester Turner and Houston Professional Fire Fighters Association, the fire fighters union in the Texas city. The same aide said logistics were the primary issue for Miami Beach. \u201cThis is a great day for the city of Milwaukee and for the state of Wisconsin,\u201d Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said in a statement. \u201cMilwaukee is a first-class city, and we are ready to showcase Milwaukee on one of the largest stages in the world.\u201d Exclusive: Democrats, anticipating heated primary, set earlier 2020 convention date The Democratic National Convention is slated to take place from July 13 to July 16, 2020, almost two weeks earlier than the 2016 convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Democrats moved the convention up out of anticipation of a crowded and contentious primary. \u201cThe Democratic Party is committed to organizing everywhere and holding the convention in mid-July allows us to continue our work doing exactly that,\u201d Perez said in a statement when he announced the early convention. \u201cMy priority is to ensure that the 2020 nominating process is the most open, fair, transparent and inclusive in our party\u2019s history.\u201d Here are the Democrats who have said they're running for president So far, over a dozen Democrats are running for President and a handful more, including Vice President Joe Biden and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, are considering a bid. An earlier convention also allows the eventual nominee to spend general election funds earlier in the race. While candidates can raise money for both their primary and the general election during the primary, they cannot spend the general election money until they secure the nomination, according to Federal Election Commission rules. Republicans will host their national convention more than a month later in Charlotte, North Carolina, from August 24 to August 27, 2020. This story has been updated.

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg on Sunday made the case for generational change in the Oval Office. Tulsi Gabbard advocated against US military intervention. And John Delaney dove deep into policy specifics. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Gabbard, a US congresswoman from Hawaii, and Delaney, a former US congressman from Maryland, participated in back-to-back-to-back CNN town halls at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, on Sunday night. Here are the top takeaways from the town halls: Buttigieg, 37, used his hour on CNN to burnish his liberal policy credentials and a composure that belies his age. And voters responded: Reviews of his performance on social media were laudatory and he got the best reception of the night inside the theater. After the mayor\u2019s hour on CNN, it was clear he came into the town hall wanting to deliver a series of crowd-pleasing lines that hit the Trump administration, something he accomplished on Sunday. I have rarely seen a candidate make better use of televised Town Hall than @PeteButtigieg is on @CNN tonight.  Crisp, thoughtful and relatable.  He\u2019ll be a little less of a long shot tomorrow. Buttigieg played to the Democratic crowd on Sunday, answering questions with a series of attacks on the Trump administration, including both the President and Vice President, something that was well received by the voters in the audience and online. Buttigieg spent much of his time lambasting the Trump administration, particularly Vice President Mike Pence, a man he worked with when the VP was the governor of Indiana, and John Bolton, the National Security Adviser. \u201cHow would he allow himself to become the cheerleader for the porn star presidency? Is it that he stopped believing in scripture when he started believing Donald Trump?\u201d Buttigieg asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d The comment was direct and combative for the mayor, but his calm delivery seemed to blunt the attack. \u201cHis interpretation of scripture is pretty different than mine to begin with,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cMy understanding of scripture is that it\u2019s about protecting the stranger and the prisoner and the poor person and that idea. That\u2019s what I get in the gospel when I\u2019m at church and his has a lot more to do with sexuality.\u201d Buttigieg also turned his fire on Bolton, who has long advocated and defended the invasion of Iraq. (Buttigieg served during the war in Afghanistan.) \u201cI don\u2019t understand how somebody leading us into the Iraq war is allowed that near the situation room to begin with,\u201d Buttigieg said in an answer about conflict in Venezuela, where Bolton has suggested military force could be an option. Bolton was an early support of the Iraq War and pushed for the initial invasion during his time, after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, as President George W. Bush\u2019s undersecretary of State for arms control and international security. Buttigieg also rebutted questions about his age by saying he has the experience to be president. Buttigieg appeared at the town hall without a jacket, the decision that made him look even younger than he does, a fact he often jokes about on the campaign trail. When asked why he thinks, at 37 years old, he is qualified to be President, Buttigieg replied he had the experience, another answer that hit the Trump administration. \u201cI have more years of government experience under my belt than the President. That\u2019s a low bar. I know that. I also have had more years of executive government experience than the vice president,\u201d he said. \u201cI get I\u2019m the young guy in the conversation, but experience is what qualifies me to have a seat at this table,\u201d he concluded. Gabbard would not say Sunday whether she believes Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad is a war criminal \u2013 the latest in a string of skeptical comments about whether Assad was, as the United Nations concluded, behind an April 2017 chemical weapons attack. \u201cI think that the evidence needs to be gathered and, as I have said before, if there is evidence that he has committed war crimes, he should be prosecuted as such,\u201d Gabbard said. Gabbard also would not say whether she would trust the American intelligence community as president. \u201cLike I said, we have, in our recent past, a situation where our own government told lies to the American people, and to the United Nations for that matter, to launch a war,\u201d she said. Gabbard did not condemn Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar from Minnesota for remarks in recent weeks that critics have called anti-Semitic. \u201cI think that what Congresswoman Omar was trying to get at was a deeper issue related to our foreign policy, and I think there\u2019s an important discussion that we have to be able to have openly even though we may end up disagreeing at the end of it. We\u2019ve got to be able to have that openness to have the conversation,\u201d Gabbard said. Pressed again on whether Omar\u2019s remarks have been anti-Semitic, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe her intent was to cause any offense.\u201d Gabbard sought Sunday to explain her shift from advocating anti-gay policies in the early 2000s, saying her time in the military caused her to \u201cgo through some soul-searching.\u201d \u201cI was raised in a very socially conservative home. My father is Catholic, he was a leading voice against gay marriage in Hawaii at that time. Again, I was very young, but these are the values and beliefs that I grew up around,\u201d she said. CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported that Gabbard\u2019s father led an anti-gay organization that advocated for conversion therapy. She touted her involvement in the group during a state legislative run. But on Sunday, Gabbard said she \u201cpersonally never supported any kind of conversion therapy. I never advocated for conversion therapy. And frankly, I didn\u2019t even know what conversion therapy was until the last few years.\u201d Tulsi Gabbard won't say whether Syria's Assad is a war criminal Gabbard said her views shifted when she deployed to the Middle East, \u201cwhere I saw firsthand the negative impact of a government attempting to act as a moral arbiter for their people, dictating in the most personal ways how they must live their lives.\u201d \u201cRace or religion or orientation, these were things that didn\u2019t matter, because we were focused on our mission of serving,\u201d she said. Gabbard was asked Sunday to name the biggest policy mistake the United States had ever made. Rather than citing slavery or the genocide of Native Americans, she pointed to the march toward what she warned could be \u201cnuclear catastrophe.\u201d She pointed to a cell phone alert \u2013 which turned out to be a false alarm \u2013 last year warning people in Hawaii to take shelter because a missile was incoming. She described residents of the state facing agonizing decisions about how to seek shelter and who to spend what they feared could be their last minutes with. \u201cThis alert turned out to be false, but the reason we reacted the way we did is that the threat is real,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cOur leaders have failed us and brought us to this point. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We have to correct our course. We have to end this new cold war and nuclear arms race that is currently being waged that threatens our very future and that costs us trillions of our taxpayer dollars \u2013 dollars that need to be spent and invested to serve the needs of our people here at home.\u201d Delaney has not held back on the campaign trail when asked about the Green New Deal, the sweeping policy proposal to combat climate change that is supported by a host of liberal lawmakers. On Twitter, Delaney once said the plan was \u201cas realistic as Trump saying that Mexico is going to pay for the wall.\u201d On Sunday, he defended that position. \u201cIt is a time for bold solutions. But we also have to put our shoulder behind things that can actually get done,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause climate, Jake, is not like other issues. We have an infrastructure issue in this country. But if we wait five years to deal with our infrastructure, it\u2019s a missed opportunity. But it doesn\u2019t get exponentially worse, so we have to deal with climate change right away.\u201d Delaney said he would get a bipartisan carbon tax bill passed in his first year as president. \u201cWe have to have a goal around climate that\u2019s realistic,\u201d he said on Sunday. Delaney also got personal at times, like when he reflected on his Catholic faith by arguing despite those beliefs, he still doesn\u2019t think religion should inform public policy. \u201cI firmly believe in the separation of church and state, full stop,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said Sunday when asked how his religion would shape his approach in office. He said his \u201csocial justice orientation\u201d comes from his Catholic faith \u201cto some extent.\u201d But he said he doesn\u2019t think his church\u2019s doctrine \u201cshould decide public policy in this country.\u201d John Delaney searches for a middle lane in a crowded 2020 Democratic field \u201cI also believe strongly in the freedom of religion, right, and I believe strongly in the separation of church and state. So I don\u2019t believe religious doctrine should inform public policy,\u201d he said. Delaney, who is independently wealthy after starting two separate companies, similarly opened up at the outset of the town hall when he discussed his own roots in a working class neighborhood in New Jersey, something he has not done much on the campaign trail, a decision he admitted to CNN earlier this year was a mistake. \u201cI grew up in a time when we had institutions in our society that really supported people. And I don\u2019t think we see that here today,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I grew up in a blue collar family. My dad was an electrician. Neither of my parents went to college. I needed scholarships from my dad\u2019s union to give me the opportunity to get the education that I have received. And I had this amazing kind of American dream-type life where I worked hard and played by the rules.\u201d Like Buttigieg, Delaney played to the crowd by using his answer to slam the Trump administration, the most forceful coming when he was asked about Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cI believe them over Putin, so I will start with that,\u201d Delaney said when asked about Russian intervention in the 2016 election. Former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe said in an interview with 60 Minutes that Trump dismissed the intelligence agencies\u2019 finding of the threat posed by North Korea\u2019s missiles by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I believe Putin.\u201d Trump has said in 2018 that he holds Putin responsible for election meddling, but he has also attacked the intelligence community and undercut their findings.

Indeed, Trump\u2019s economic approval ratings are one big reason he could win re-election. But despite his strong economic scores, Trump\u2019s overall approval remains stuck in the low 40s. Why? It could be that Americans don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s economic policies are put forth to help them. This should worry Trump because it could hurt his chances of winning a second term. Earlier this week, Quinnipiac University asked voters whether Trump \u201ccares about the average American.\u201d Just 39% of voters said that he did, compared to 58% who said that he didn\u2019t. The 39% of voters who registered approval of Trump\u2019s overall job performance was very similar to the 38% overall job approval rating Trump received in the same poll. When you break it down by demographic (i.e. age, race, education, etc.), you see that there is pretty much a perfect correlation by group between how Americans view Trump overall and whether they see him as caring for the average American. Since the beginning of his presidency, the percentage of Americans who approve of the job Trump is doing as president has been closely linked to the percentage who think he cares about the average American. The average difference between the two statistics has been only 4 points. Over time, the relationship between the percentage of Americans who approve of Trump and believe he cares about the average American has only become stronger. The difference over the last year has averaged only 2 points, according to Quinnipiac. These numbers match up with other polling that inquired into whether Trump\u2019s policies were helping the middle class. Only 38% of voters said in an August 2018 Quinnipiac poll that the Trump administration was doing enough to help the middle class. The vast majority of Americans (61%) said in a December 2017 Marist College poll that Trump\u2019s policies are directly mainly towards helping the wealthy. The correlation between Trump\u2019s approval rating and Trump caring about the average American is much stronger than it is with his economic approval rating. In the Quinnipiac poll, movement in Trump\u2019s economic approval rating and his overall approval rating has not been statistically significant. If anything the relationship has become weaker over time. Since last year, the average difference between Trump\u2019s economic and overall approval rating has been 8 points. That\u2019s four times the difference that his overall approval rating has had with voters thinking he cares about the average American. A look at history suggests we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that voters care about whether presidents understand them and their problems. The last three presidents likely saw their re-election chances increased because voters saw them as caring about them. In a late October 2012 CBS News poll, 59% of likely voters thought that Barack Obama \u201cunderstood the needs and problems of voters\u201d like them. Eight years prior, 51% of likely voters told Newsweek that the phrase \u201ccares about people like you\u201d accurately described President George W. Bush. And all the way back in October 1996, 65% of voters said President Bill Clinton understood the needs and problems of voters like them. Perhaps not surprisingly, all three of these presidents won re-election. Not only that, but the more voters believed that these presidents were on their side, the larger their re-election margins (i.e. Clinton\u2019s was larger than Obama\u2019s, which was larger than Bush\u2019s). Bush\u2019s and Obama\u2019s fates are particularly interesting in the context of Trump. Unlike Trump, their economic approval ratings were lower than their economic disapproval ratings. In other words, they had negative net economic approval ratings. In the 2004 and 2012 exit polls, Bush and Obama respectively lost among voters who said the economy was their most important issue. In spite of that, they won. It turned out that it mattered more that voters believed these presidents cared about their problems than whether or not the voters approved of their performance on the overall economy. We don\u2019t have enough elections in which this question was asked to say in any definitive way that if voters don\u2019t think the president is on their side that they won\u2019t re-elect him. Still, it seems likely that if voters believe a president doesn\u2019t care about the average American then they aren\u2019t likely to re-elect them. This, of course, is bad news for Trump given that voters have continuously said he doesn\u2019t care about the average American. The last president who had polling close to Trump on a remotely similar question was George H.W. Bush in 1992. Voters did think Bush cared about them, but they didn\u2019t think he understood their problems. Bush lost. The 1992 election is a great example of the issue facing Trump. When voters feel like the president has lost touch, they are more likely to go in another direction. Trump needs voters to believe he is working for, cares and understands them. Otherwise, he\u2019ll probably only serve one term.",

            "article_content": "Former Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid has some advice for the Democrats running for president in 2020: It\u2019s not all about Donald Trump. \u201c[They] need not talk about how bad President Trump is, they just need to talk about what\u2019s good for the country,\u201d he said. Reid said even voters supporting the President know what problems he has, and he hopes people understand that the Trump presidency has been bad for the country. During an exclusive interview in Reid\u2019s office at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas, we went through some of the 2020 hopefuls. If former Vice President Joe Biden decides to run, Reid says other candidates will have to catch up with him. He says former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke hasn\u2019t been tested yet. And he says Sen. Kamala Harris is somebody to be \u201clooked at closely.\u201d Harry Reid wishes for George W. Bush again 'every day' A potential candidate he is not to fond of: former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, whose potential independent bid Reid said could end up being an asterisk in history. Reid takes great pride in being one of the first of Barack Obama\u2019s Senate colleagues to encourage him to run for president. \u201cI called him into my office and told him he should take a look at it. He was stunned because I was first to suggest it to him,\u201d Reid told us a few years ago. With that history of picking a winner, it\u2019s no surprise that several would-be and declared 2020 presidential contenders have checked in with Reid. \u201cI\u2019ve had the good fortune of having a number of them come and see me at my home, the people that are considering running,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that we have this wide range of talented people,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s been to my home, spent an hour and a half with me. I think so much of him \u2026 His life story is something that is tearful. We were flying from Indianapolis to Reno, Nevada. I\u2019ll never forget that story of Joe Biden telling me about his wonderful love that he met on a beach in Florida some place. And the tragic accident where his daughter was killed, his wife was killed. His two boys, he and his sister raised them. I just admire him so very, very much, and his government service has been very,  very significant. And still feel for him, his loss of Beau. That was tragic.\u201d Reid said running for president is a \u201cpersonal decision\u201d for Biden, and if he did choose to run he thought the other candidates would \u201chave to catch up with him.\u201d Reid thought if Biden did get into the race he would have a chance at winning. \u201cI think any Democratic candidate that\u2019s on that list of 23 or whatever it is can win, and certainly Joe Biden\u2019s on that list,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed somebody for my debt commission, and I\u2019d read about her, looked at one of her books and I invited her down to my office, she and her daughter. Harvard professor, very academic looking woman. She\u2019s just been remarkable, everything that she\u2019s touched \u2026 I certainly would not, have not, nor would not ever discourage her from running for president.\u201d Reid respects the fact that Warren is engaging so actively with the President. \u201cCory\u2019s mom lives here [in Nevada]. Cory\u2019s dad died here. So I know Cory Booker very very well. I admire him, a Rhodes scholar. Tight end at Stanford. You know, he\u2019s quite a guy. So, and I talked to him I guess day before yesterday \u2026 We haven\u2019t sat down face to face for a while. We\u2019ll do that again. He\u2019s coming out soon to visit his mom, and he\u2019ll set some time aside for me.\u201d When asked whether Booker would be a good president, Reid replied, \u201cI can\u2019t think of any one of the Democrats that have put their name up for consideration that would be a bad president.\u201d Reid has been impressed with Klobuchar over their years of serving together in the Senate, he even suggested she be nominated for the Supreme Court if Hillary Clinton had won the election in 2016. \u201cHer background is stunning. Yale, law review. Her background is a prosecutor out of the state of Minnesota. She was Senator. I thought she was perfect to go on the Supreme Court.\u201d When asked whether there was any truth to the story that Reid had to pull Klobuchar aside and say, \u201cGo easy on your staff,\u201d he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know where stuff like that comes from. If I did that, I have honestly no memory of it. It doesn\u2019t sound anything like I would do.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve talked. I met her, I\u2019ve met her. We\u2019ve talked on the telephone, and I think she\u2019s somebody to be looked at very closely. Why? For a number of reasons. Number one, she has a great story. Number two, she comes from California. And that state has a very early primary now. They moved it up significantly, and she comes out of that state. She could come out of California almost 30% of the delegates. You have 49 states to pick up another 21%.\u201d \u201cI think Mike Bloomberg, who I\u2019ve talked to, I think he has an outstanding chance to really reshape America. Here\u2019s a man who has the resources to help parties. One of the strengths I developed over the years into that was I focused on grassroots in Nevada and build up a tremendously strong political organization in Nevada. He has the resources to do that all over the country. I think he has a lot of potential.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know the man. I don\u2019t know Beto O\u2019Rourke. I think when you\u2019re a new candidate like Beto O\u2019Rourke, you have to be tested because you, the press, love to have virgins out there, and they go after them pretty quickly. So he\u2019s not tested yet.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve met Howard Schultz \u2013 don\u2019t like his independent streak. I think that he\u2019ll wind up being another asterisk in an article in some history book. I think that we\u2019ve tried that in recent years and it just hasn\u2019t worked very well.\u201d \u201cI worked hard to get him to run for the Senate. I\u2019m glad that he did. He has a stunningly impressive wife. I think she won a Pulitzer Prize. I think he would be a good president, and I think he would sell. He\u2019s kind of the working class kind of guy.\u201d \u201cMichael Bennet is one of my favorite senators \u2026 He\u2019s such a nice man. I wish I could give you other traits of Michael Bennet, but he has traits like the first President Bush, his strength was just was nice to everybody, and I think that\u2019s Michael\u2019s greatest asset.\u201d \u201cKirsten Gillibrand is a tremendously competent person. Kirsten Gillibrand, look at her political work up. She started on heavily Republican district, she won that, she\u2019s now very, very strong in New York which is not a very conservative place. And I think that she\u2019s spending a lot of time talking about the importance of feminism in politics. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a waste of time. I think it\u2019s good she\u2019s doing that.\u201d Reid spoke about Bernie Sanders in the context of the new invigorated liberal wing of the party. When asked whether it makes him nervous or excited he replied, \u201cI think that my perspective as you look at the Democratic caucus that leader (Nancy) Pelosi has, everyone thinks it\u2019s gonna be a left leaning, oh so much different from the past. But remember her strength has come from Democrats picking up Republican seats. So I think Pelosi, she hasn\u2019t told me this, it\u2019s just my opinion, I think her caucus is gonna be a fairly centrist caucus. I think that these people who are out with all these ideas, that\u2019s wonderful, that\u2019s good. Because I know that Bernie Sanders, I think they\u2019re ideas that were really on the fringe that he sort of started talking about, people are now accepting them as brave, good ideas. Doing something to make sure it\u2019s easier for young men and women to go to college. Make sure that we do something to take care of health care.\u201d The fact that so many members of the Democratic Senate caucus are either already running for president or may be soon could pose a challenge for Reid\u2019s successor, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. But Reid says, no. \u201cI think that would be really easy,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid to miss many votes so they rarely do that. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big problem at all,\u201d he added. He remembers when he was leader and had to deal with members of his caucus running for president. But not this many people, he admits. \u201cThis is a lot,\u201d he said with a smile.",

            "article_content": "Amy Klobuchar\u2019s bid to prove she\u2019s the most electable of the Democratic presidential aspirants began with a message to voters in this swing state Saturday: She\u2019ll get right what Hillary Clinton got wrong in 2016. In a symbolic departure from the usual path through early-voting states, the Minnesota senator made a coffee and bicycle shop in western Wisconsin her first campaign stop after announcing her bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination. She told a packed-in crowd she planned to \u201cgo to places that maybe we didn\u2019t focus on enough in the last few years.\u201d A day earlier, Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman now weighing a run for president, made two stops at colleges in Wisconsin. \u201cI want to make sure that I\u2019m listening to everyone \u2013 not just those that I know in El Paso and in Texas, but everyone, including going to places that are forgotten or overlooked or have not been visited enough or are only thought about in calculations as you accumulate electoral votes or you think about the next election,\u201d he said Friday in Madison. Klobuchar and O\u2019Rourke never used Clinton\u2019s name. But their visits were an implicit rebuke of Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. President Donald Trump cracked the \u201cblue wall\u201d of traditionally Democratic states long viewed as essential to the party\u2019s path to the presidency \u2013 winning Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 and Clinton\u2019s campaign was faulted for spending too little time and money on the latter two.  The most straightforward path to a Democratic victory in 2020 goes through those three states: The party would win the White House by reclaiming all three and holding onto the other states Clinton won. 'I'm not going to miss this moment': Pete Buttigieg is running to make history And last year\u2019s midterm elections have given Democrats hope that the party can rebound from Clinton\u2019s losses. Democratic candidates went six-for-six in races for governor and the Senate in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania last year \u2013 a run that included ousting Wisconsin\u2019s two-term GOP Gov. Scott Walker. \u201cI want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018,\u201d Klobuchar told reporters Saturday. \u201cNo one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.\u201d Democrats have other ways to reach 270 electoral votes. The more diverse Sun Belt\u2019s political landscape is evolving, with Democrats winning a Senate race in Arizona and coming close but still falling short of statewide wins in Georgia and Texas last year.  But Klobuchar and several other candidates or potential candidates \u2013 former Vice President Joe Biden looming largest among them, with Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown as part of the group, too \u2013 are arguing that the road to the White House runs through the Midwest. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who has launched an exploratory committee as he weighs a presidential bid, said on CNN Thursday that the Democratic Party \u201cseemed to have lost touch in the last election with the middle of the country.\u201d \u201cMaybe it makes sense to have more voices from the industrial Midwest,\u201d Buttigieg said. Brown launched what he\u2019s calling a \u201cDignity of Work\u201d tour. He\u2019s touted his re-election victory last year in Ohio \u2013 which is rapidly slipping out of the swing-state category after Trump cruised to victory there in 2016 and Republicans won the governor\u2019s race last year \u2013 as proof of his \u201cprogressive populist\u201d appeal to a group of white, working-class voters who have slipped away from Democrats in recent cycles. Polls have shown Democratic voters are more focused than in previous cycles selecting a candidate who is electable \u2013 meaning a candidate who can make the case that he or she can perform best against Trump could have an advantage in the primary. Sherrod Brown makes the case for a Democrat to win back the Midwest in 2020 Klobuchar has a long history of outperforming other Democrats in Minnesota. She won re-election last year by 24 percentage points, two years after Clinton won the state by just two points, which left Democrats worrying it would be a new target for Republicans in the 2020 presidential election. Klobuchar told the crowd Saturday that she hails from a \u201cgrassroots tradition of politics that people don\u2019t understand we have in the Midwest.\u201d She bragged about campaigning with Paul Wellstone, the iconic progressive former Minnesota senator. She touted an aggressive plan to expand broadband service in rural America and said she was focused on bridging a rural and urban divide. \u201cThat was one of the points I wanted to make by coming to Eau Claire,\u201d Klobuchar said, noting that the city sits in the middle of vast farmland. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s approach is different to the likes of Klobuchar and Buttigieg who are focused on playing up their Midwestern ties but it\u2019s aimed at a similar goal: Showing a broad appeal to Democratic voters who are concerned about their nominee\u2019s electability. After speaking to students at the University of Wisconsin, the El Paso native said he comes \u201cfrom what very often feels like a forgotten place\u201d and highlighted his road trips \u2013 to all 254 counties in Texas during a Senate race last year, and then through rural portions of Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado and New Mexico in January. \u201cI really want to just meet people where they are,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI\u2019m going everywhere to listen to everyone.\u201d",

Tim Ryan is \u201cseriously considering\u201d a run for president and doesn\u2019t have a timeline for making his decision, he told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett Wednesday night. Though he is not sure when he will make a decision, Ryan said on \u201cErin Burnett Out Front\u201d Wednesday night that he is looking at making a bid. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any pressure for any timeline at this point but I am seriously considering it,\u201d Ryan said when asked about his 2020 aspirations. \u201cThe country is divided. We can\u2019t get anything done because of these huge divisions that we have.\u201d The Democratic congressman was once considered a possible challenger to Rep. Nancy Pelosi for the House speakership and ran against her in 2016, falling short of the required votes. If Ryan enters the race he will join an ever expanding slate of Democratic candidates looking to thwart President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election bid. Included on that list is a current House colleague of Ryan\u2019s \u2013 Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u2013 and a former one as well in John Delaney. This is not the first time Ryan has suggested he is interested in a presidential run. Last week an adviser to the congressman told CNN that Ryan is planning visits to Iowa and New Hampshire in the coming months as he considers his bid. The congressman will start his trip to the early primary states in New Hampshire before speaking at an agriculture forum in Iowa next month. In 2018 Ryan hired a former Bernie Sanders adviser as a consultant on Iowa as he considered a run. Later that year Ryan said that he was caught between challenging Pelosi for the speakership or running for president. Ryan ultimately did not run against Pelosi to be speaker of the House The five-term congressman from Ohio would likely present himself as a candidate able to connect to Midwestern voters who have drifted from the Democratic Party. Ryan said Wednesday his primary motivations for running would be unifying the country helping the working class. \u201cPeople in communities like the ones I represent are suffering because of this division,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cYou can\u2019t win the future divided. A divided country is a weak country and I\u2019m concerned about that.\u201d Ryan referenced disparities in wealth between the richest and poorest Americans as an example of those divisions. \u201cWorkers want cut in on a deal here and they haven\u2019t been for 30 years.

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders has a plan to add more than 50 years of sustainability to Social Security, the New Deal-era program that\u2019s facing a looming cash crunch. The proposal would shore up Social Security with payroll taxes on income above $250,000, the Vermont independent announced Wednesday. It\u2019s the latest in a flurry of ambitious legislation being floated by lawmakers with their eyes on the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The 2020 Democratic field is more liberal than past years It is the second plan to tax the wealthy that Sanders, who previously made a 2016 run, has introduced in the last two weeks, the first targeting the estates of the richest Americans. Sanders, who\u2019s also preparing to introduce a Medicare for all proposal in the coming weeks, is looking to solidify \u2014 and boost \u2014 one of the country\u2019s most popular social safety net programs by having the rich pay more. \u201cAt a time when more than half of older Americans over the age of 55 have no retirement savings, our job is to expand Social Security to make sure that everyone in this country can retire with the dignity they have earned and everyone with a disability can live with the security they need,\u201d Sanders said. The Social Security Expansion Act, which Sanders first introduced in 2017, is also being introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon. Several declared and potential 2020 Democratic candidates are co-sponsoring the legislation, including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who have announced their bids, as well as New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who is exploring a run, and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, who is also considering running. It would increase benefits for all recipients, with low-income seniors receiving a boost of nearly $1,300 a year. It would also make the annual cost of living adjustment more generous by shifting the formula to take into account health care and prescription drug costs, which rise faster than inflation. To pay for it, Sanders would subject all income above $250,000 to the existing 12.4% Social Security payroll tax, which is split between workers and employers. Currently, the payroll tax is only applied to wages up to $132,900. Plus, the senator would levy a new 6.2% tax on single people with investment income above $200,000 and couples above $250,000. This extra revenue would extend the health of Social Security by 52 years, according to Sanders\u2019 office. As it stands now, the system will no longer be able to pay out full benefits starting in 2034, according to the 2018 annual report from the Social Security and Medicare trustees. Democrats campaigned relentlessly \u2014 and successfully \u2014 in both red and blue states across the country in 2018 on a pledge to preserve programs like Social Security, which Republicans suggested could face cuts to make up for the revenue shortfalls caused by their tax cuts. Days before the midterm election in November, Sanders laid out the stakes, tweeting: \u201cLet us not forget that (earlier in October 2018), Mitch McConnell stated he wants to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security if Republicans keep one-party rule in Washington. We must expand, not cut, these programs that are life and death for the working class in this country.\u201d Let us not forget that just 2 weeks ago, Mitch McConnell stated he wants to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security if Republicans keep one-party rule in Washington. We must expand, not cut, these programs that are life and death for the working class in this country. McConnell signaled in a pair of interviews weeks earlier that the Republican plan to address the deficit, which ballooned by about $2 trillion under their watch, would require reforms to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 the package of social programs he described as \u201cthe real driver of the debt.\u201d Sanders slammed Republicans for saying benefits must be curtailed. \u201cThey have their priorities backwards,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to tax the billionaires and expand Social Security.\u201d Lawmakers have long grappled with how to address Social Security\u2019s solvency issues. Republicans generally favor increasing the retirement age or tinkering with the formula to make payouts less generous, but President Donald Trump has promised not to touch benefits. Democratic lawmakers in both chambers are looking to boost seniors\u2019 checks and ask the rich to pay for it. Connecticut Rep. John Larson, along with more than 200 lawmakers, last month reintroduced the Social Security 2100 Act, which would raise benefits and payroll taxes on everyone, but place an additional levy on those earning more than $400,000. It would extend Social Security\u2019s solvency beyond 2092. Scrapping the payroll cap, however, would fundamentally change the way Social Security operates. Benefits are based on how much retirees contributed to the system while they were working, a formula that was key to the support for the law\u2019s enactment in 1935. Under Sanders\u2019 bill, the wealthy would not receive credit for the additional payroll taxes. The proposals are the most significant effort to reshape to Social Security since former President George W. Bush tried to introduce private investment accounts into the system in 2005.",

            "article_content": "Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown wasn\u2019t aiming for the biggest crowd on the opening stop of his four-state tour to explore a presidential run \u2013 and on a frigid night, he didn\u2019t get one. He was drawn to this northern Iowa town by a different set of numbers: President Donald Trump won this county with 57% of the vote in 2016. Four years earlier, Barack Obama carried it by 60%. That dramatic shift \u2013 a pattern repeated over and over across the industrial Midwest and the Great Lakes, from Iowa to Pennsylvania \u2013 is one of the most vexing challenges facing Democrats in 2020. And it\u2019s the central argument for Brown as he considers whether to join the party\u2019s growing field of presidential candidates. \u201cDemocrats learned a lot of lessons, but the most important lesson is we write off no place in the country,\u201d Brown said in an interview here. \u201cI\u2019m weary of Democrats that say you only talk to progressives to win and excite the base.\u201d He is testing a potential presidential candidacy through what he\u2019s calling the \u201cDignity of Work\u201d tour. One handshake at a time, he\u2019s presenting himself as a true populist to voters in visits to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, all of which open the Democratic nominating season a year from now. Along the way, Brown is touting his Ohio roots and his re-election to a third term in the Senate. It was a stand out Democratic victory in an increasingly red state, which Trump won by eight points in 2016. \u201cAn outspoken progressive can win \u2013 and win decisively \u2013 in the heartland,\u201d Brown said, an example of why he believes Democrats should not ignore Trump country and how his race last fall could be a model for the party. Sherrod Brown calls Howard Schultz 'a total idiot' over possible independent campaign for president He is one of at least nine senators ambitiously eyeing a bid for the Democratic nomination. He tells voters he hasn\u2019t spent a lifetime thinking of being president like many of his colleagues, even dusting off this self-effacing line he\u2019s used over the years: \u201cThe only cure for the presidential virus in the US Senate is embalming fluid.\u201d After shaking hands with a few dozen Democratic activists who braved sub-zero conditions here Thursday night to see him, Brown made clear the party\u2019s field of presidential hopefuls is missing an argument for why blue-collar workers should vote Democratic. \u201cI think that voice needs to be stronger,\u201d Brown said. It\u2019s a tepid, yet unmistakable critique as the Democratic lineup takes shape. After his fellow senator, Cory Booker of New Jersey, jumped into the race on Friday, Brown was asked by reporters about his potential rivals. He could have delivered a standard response, as most Democrats do, singing the praises of his colleagues. Instead, Brown said this: \u201cI like all of my colleagues that are running. I like some more than others. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d He quickly added: \u201cBut I like Cory and more power to him. He\u2019s been looking at this for a while. He\u2019s my friend.\u201d But Brown does not mince words as he pointedly makes the case that Democrats must carefully choose a nominee to confront the President. He doesn\u2019t back away from a progressive agenda \u2013 in many ways, the party has moved leftward toward Brown \u2013 but he said it must be presented with a non-condescending message for rural and working-class voters. Asked whether he believes Democrats should nominate a candidate from the middle of the country, rather than the East or West coast, he replied: \u201cOur party needs to nominate somebody who can win the industrial Midwest, the heartland, the Great Lakes states, the plains states from Pennsylvania to Iowa. We\u2019ll see how the voters decide that.\u201d Mary Weaver, who sat beside Brown on Friday afternoon during a roundtable discussion at the library in the town of Perry, is one of those voters. She told him she would meet every candidate who comes within a 50-mile radius of her home in central Iowa. \u201cI want a candidate that brings me hope and brings me ideas that can beat Donald Trump,\u201d Weaver said, looking him squarely in the eye. \u201cIn that order?\u201d Brown said. \u201cI think we need hope first,\u201d she responded. On his listening tour, Brown did just that \u2013 listened to concerns, without offering many ideas, solutions or hope. As he left the room, Weaver said she enjoyed meeting Brown and had a positive impression, but quickly added that he had not won her over: \u201cWe need to meet them all.\u201d For two years, Democrats have been united in their overwhelming opposition to Trump. But the divisions inside the party \u2013 over policy and even personality preferences \u2013 are bubbling just below the surface. Brown met with several farmers, including Weaver, her husband and son, at the gathering in Perry. The meeting offered an early window into the obstacle course Brown likely faces on trade. He was among the staunchest critics of NAFTA, which largely benefited Iowa farmers who are now caught in the middle of a costly trade war with China. \u201cFull disclosure. I supported the tariffs originally,\u201d Brown said Friday, noting that he and Trump share some views on trade. \u201cThey are a temporarily tool to get to a certain point \u2013 not a long-term trade policy. Trump has made them a long-term trade policy.\u201d If he runs for president, this topic will be explored in far more depth than Brown made time for on Friday afternoon \u201cThis clearly wasn\u2019t enough time to get into anything very deeply,\u201d said Warren Varley, a lawyer and farmer who sat across the table from Brown and noted that he had a positive initial impression, but far more questions. As the senator made his way to the door, making small talk on the way out of the library\u2019s meeting room, Varley said he is still sizing up the large Democratic field. \u201cYou need a scorecard to keep up,\u201d he said. \u201cI share Senator Brown\u2019s concern that we not go off the rails trying to please progressives. It\u2019s important to keep progressives enthused, but we need to have a big tent too.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m more inclined to support a more moderate candidate like Amy Klobuchar,\u201d Varley added, raising the name of the Minnesota senator without prompting. \u201cI\u2019d sure like to see her run.\u201d And Klobuchar is strongly considering it, several confidants say, a move that would add not only another senator to the mix, but another formidable candidate who believes Democrats should not cede Trump country.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat weighing a run for president, announced Tuesday he will launch a listening tour of early primary states starting later on this month based on his \u201cdignity of work\u201d message that he used to win his third straight statewide election in a political battleground state. \u201cI want to hear from people around (the country) and I want this conversation and this dignity of work tour to encourage my colleagues running for president that this should be the narrative,\u201d Brown said in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes.\u201d The tour will begin at the end of January in Brown\u2019s home state, before moving on in February to stops in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Brown said he still hadn\u2019t made up his mind on whether to launch an exploratory committee \u2013 a step several Democrats have taken in recent weeks. Brown said he and his wife, journalist Connie Schultz, had not yet made up their minds on a presidential run. \u201cWe will make that decision in the weeks ahead,\u201d he said. Brown, 66, is unabashedly progressive but with a Midwestern, populist bent that could appeal to Democratic voters who found Trump\u2019s message \u2013 which is fairly aligned with Brown\u2019s own beliefs on issues like trade \u2013 not just appealing, but animating. Brown outran 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 15 points and bested Richard Cordray, the Democratic nominee for governor who lost his race, by nearly 300,000 votes. He will carry a message into the early primary states on his tour that has resonated in three consecutive statewide election wins in a crucial battleground state \u2013 a message that helped him ride to victory in 2018, a year nearly all of Ohio\u2019s other statewide elections went squarely into Republican hands. The state, which then-candidate Donald Trump won by eight points in 2016, has trended so firmly red in recent years that some Democratic operatives have questioned whether it remains firmly in the top tier of presidential battlegrounds for Democrats. States like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin also fell out of Democratic column \u2013 creating the road map to Trump\u2019s stunning electoral victory. Brown\u2019s re-election immediately drew attention from Democrats eying that path and the Democratic collapse in the Midwest \u2013 and he has said he has been fielding calls from supporters and allies urging him to run ever since. \u201cBecause Ohio is in so many ways the number one swing state in the country, a message that works there, the dignity of work, works everywhere,\u201d Brown said. Still, in a field that is seemingly growing by the day with a diverse group of candidates \u2013 many of whom are Brown\u2019s colleagues in the Senate \u2013 with national fundraising networks and operations \u2013 along with a Democratic Party still divided on what message, let alone candidate, can defeat Trump in 2020 \u2013 Brown will have work to do in the months ahead to carve out his place in the field should he decide to run. \u201cNational Democrats and some pundits say that Democrats, they kind of make this a choice: either Democrats talk to progressives, to the progressive base, or they talk to workers, working class families regardless of race. To me you\u2019ve gotta do both, that\u2019s how we won Ohio,\u201d Brown said. Brown\u2019s message \u2013 coined during his Senate re-election campaign as \u201cDignity of Work\u201d (and matched with a new website of the same name launched Tuesday night shortly before his MSNBC appearance) \u2013 is one defined by strong ties to labor, economic mobility in the form of higher wages and opposition to trade policies that he views as having hollowed out the manufacturing base in the industrial Midwest. \u201cWe celebrate the worker,\u201d Brown said in his victory remarks the night he was re-elected in 2018. \u201cAnd that is the blueprint for America in 2020.\u201d He supports a $15 minimum wage and has pitched incentivizing companies to keep their operations in the US and provide higher wages and benefit plans to their workers. As the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, he\u2019s been a consistently sharp critic of the size and interconnectedness of Wall Street banks and a financial system he says is skewed away from workers. It\u2019s a message that faces an initial test in Iowa and may serve as a marker for whether a future campaign would have legs. While Iowa is not analogous to Ohio in terms of industry, it represented another largely white, working class state that moved firmly away from Democrats in 2016, where Clinton lost by nearly 10 points after consecutive comfortable victories by President Barack Obama.",

            "article_content": "Watch Rep. Rashida Tlaib speak on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d at 7 p.m. ET on CNN. Rashida Tlaib likes to tell a story about how when she found out she had been elected to Congress, her 13-year-old son whispered in her ear, \u201cSee mama, bullies don\u2019t win.\u201d No other Congress has ever looked like this \u201cHe was talking about Donald Trump,\u201d Tlaib said in a recent interview before she sworn in to Congress, describing in a matter-of-fact way what her oldest son Adam told her when she won her race to represent Michigan\u2019s 13th congressional district. Tlaib made history with her swearing in as the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress. She and incoming Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota are the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress. Tlaib also immediately caused controversy. Hours after her swearing in, Tlaib defiantly told the audience at a progressive event, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna go in there and we\u2019re going to impeach the motherf****r,\u201d a reference to the President. The comments provoked an uproar and generated criticism from some fellow Democrats, but Tlaib didn\u2019t back down. \u201cI will always speak truth to power. #unapologeticallyMe,\u201d she tweeted Friday. Tlaib has made headlines before. More than a year before she ran for Congress, she was also in the news when she was thrown out of an event in Michigan where Trump was speaking after interrupting the then-Republican presidential nominee to ask if he had ever read the Constitution. She later described it as \u201cthe most American thing I could ever do.\u201d During her campaign, Tlaib \u2013 a member of the Democratic Socialists of America \u2013 embraced progressive ideas like Medicare-for-all, a $15 dollar minimum wage and debt-free college as well as calls to abolish ICE. And her stance on impeaching the President is nothing new. Just last month, she tweeted, \u201cCan we please start the impeachment process now?\u201d With the new Congress underway, Tlaib has a high-profile platform on Capitol Hill to confront the President and try to shape the agenda of the new House Democratic majority. The question now is what will she do next? The 42-year old has had \u201cfirst\u201d status before. She is the first of 14 children born to Palestinian immigrant parents and the first in her family to graduate from high school as well as college. She was also the first Muslim woman to serve in the Michigan state legislature. \u201cWhen I won it was just a moment of light in this time that was pretty dark for a lot of us,\u201d Tlaib said, reflecting on her election to Congress. The 2018 midterm elections led to an \u201cincredible array of \u2018firsts,\u2019\u201d she added, pointing to the election of other women who made history like incoming Democratic Reps. Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland, who will be the first Native American women elected to Congress. Those victories created a sense of \u201chope,\u201d Tlaib said, \u201creminiscent of the America we want to live in.\u201d Although she sounds optimistic about the possibility her political future holds, Tlaib also sounds anxious about the backlash that will come along with it. \u201cMy mere existence, I realize, no matter my positions, even if I didn\u2019t say anything about any issue after I won, just complete silence from me, I would still be a target,\u201d she said, \u201cjust because I exist.\u201d Tlaib has said she will wear a Palestinian gown called a thobe for her swearing-in ceremony and wants to be  sworn in on a Quran. The incoming congresswoman said that she has considered the possibility of using Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Quran or her own, calling the former President\u2019s Quran a \u201csymbol,\u201d that \u201cIslam has been part of American history for a long time.\u201d Tlaib said that people are \u201ctaken aback\u201d when she tells them Jefferson had a Quran. \u201cBut I like that,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI like that it\u2019s kind of pushing against the stereotype that somehow we\u2019re new to this country.\u201d In the end, Tlaib did not use Jefferson\u2019s Quran, choosing instead to be sworn in on a Quran given to her by a long-time friend. \u201cI wanted it to be more personal and my own,\u201d she said of the decision in a tweet. The decision to wear the thobe, Tlaib said, \u201cmeans the world\u201d to her mother, who she said came to the United States when she was 20 years old. \u201cEvery child of immigrant parents knows what it means when \u2026 their biggest hope is that they want us to succeed, but they also don\u2019t want us to lose a part of who we are,\u201d she said. In late December, Tlaib said she had not yet made any decisions about where she would live in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m actually staying at a friends\u2019 house temporarily until I can get a sense of what neighborhood might work best for me,\u201d she said last month. But Tlaib sounded frustrated by how expensive some of the available options seemed to be. Describing some of the questions she has had to ask herself, she said, \u201cDo I get a car? No, can\u2019t afford that. Do I live the closest to the Capitol? Well, sure I would like that, but then every time I look on Craigslist or on different kinds of websites, it\u2019s close to 2,800 dollars the closer you are to the Capitol.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge for me,\u201d she said, discussing housing costs in the nation\u2019s capital. On the eve of her swearing-in to Congress, Tlaib posted a photo of herself and her two sons to Instagram with the caption \u201cLook who came with Mama to DC. They help me stay focused on what matters most.\u201d A post shared by Rashida Tlaib (@rashidatlaib) But although she will now be spending a lot more time in DC, Tlaib is quick to emphasize that she still considers Detroit her home. \u201cI\u2019ve never worked in DC. I\u2019ve visited and have been part of marches there, part of congressional meetings with various groups I\u2019ve worked for, but I still see it as very foreign,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody keeps saying, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re moving\u2019, and I say, \u2018No, to me, this is where I go to work,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMy home will always be in Detroit.\u201d Tlaib doesn\u2019t seem to be afraid of controversy \u2013 and it\u2019s an open question how much she will end up working with or at odds with veteran Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Not long after she won her own election, Tlaib put out a statement of support when the progressive group Justice Democrats launched a campaign to recruit progressive primary challengers to take on sitting Democratic members of Congress. She aligned herself with a political cause far outside the Democratic mainstream when she said that she supports the controversial Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel. Tlaib also recently told The Intercept that she wants to lead a congressional delegation to the West Bank, where her grandmother still lives. When asked about the possibility of making the trip, Tlaib said, \u201cWhen we start addressing the humanitarian needs of both Israelis and Palestinians \u2026 when we\u2019re not thinking the other person is less than or less deserving, I really think we\u2019ll get closer to peace.\u201d \u201cPeople respect that,\u201d she said, before adding, \u201cof course, there\u2019s haters out there.\u201d There are also signs, however, that Tlaib is willing to work with the Democratic establishment in Congress. During her campaign, Tlaib said at one point that she would \u201cprobably not\u201d vote for Nancy Pelosi, the long-time House Democratic leader, who is now poised to become House Speaker in the new Congress. But Tlaib ultimately voted for Pelosi during a House Democratic election to pick a nominee for Speaker and now plans to vote for her in the final floor vote. \u201cI voted for her in caucus, I\u2019m going to vote for her on the House floor,\u201d she said. Tlaib emphasized that no alternative candidate to Pelosi ever emerged and said she had a chance to meet with the veteran Democratic leader and speak with her about her own priorities. \u201cI had a meeting, and I talked to her about poverty and I talked to her about the fact that it\u2019s important to uplift the middle class,\u201d Tlaib, whose congressional district has been ranked the third poorest in the nation, said. \u201cI wanted to be able to be heard,\u201d she said, \u201csometimes that means holding to your chest that vote \u2026 I wasn\u2019t going to walk in a room and just give that up without at least making sure that she knew poverty was an important issue to us.\u201d When asked if she believes what she had to say resonated with Pelosi, however, Talib replied bluntly, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cI hope so,\u201d she said. \u201cI will see in the new Congress.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments since Tlaib\u2019s swearing in.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Democrats should be paying close attention to the Labour Party\u2019s brutal beating in the UK elections last night. It is a cautionary tale about the perils of polarization and the predictable dangers of embracing a far-left leader. On the one side, the UK had an unpopular conservative incumbent; a charismatic nationalist with a persistent truth-telling problem who demonized dissent within his own party. After Conservatives lost seats under Theresa May amid a tortured season of Brexit deals that couldn\u2019t get through Parliament, Labour should have been primed to take back 10 Downing Street. But they decided to stick with a far-left populist and unreconstructed socialist, Jeremy Corbyn, someone with a muddled message on Brexit, who is dogged by accusations of failing to root out anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, calls Karl Marx a \u201cgreat economist\u201d and has a record of admiration for leftist autocrats from Cuba  to Venezuela. He promised to nationalize rail and energy industries and spend hundreds of billions remaking society. (Corbyn has stood by his efforts to address anti-Semitism in his party.) How Boris Johnson won -- and Jeremy Corbyn lost To put it in an American context, Jeremy Corbyn makes Bernie Sanders look like Bill Clinton. But he was beloved by the party\u2019s base and young voters who boosted him on social media. And so despite polls showing that Corbyn was the least popular opposition leader in almost a half century \u2013 with a stunning 76% of all Britons saying that they were unhappy with him, they decided to take the leap, convinced that the unpopularity of Boris Johnson, chaos over Brexit and support for the Labour platform meant that maybe they could sneak Corbyn into 10 Downing Street. Not so much. Actually, not at all. UK election is a 'Love Actually'-esque holiday horror show Under Corbyn, the Labour Party had its worst showing since 1935. It lost seats in former Labour strongholds throughout the middle of the country. They lost working class voters to the Tories. It was a fierce repudiation of Corbyn\u2019s radical plan to remake Britain. Even in a parliamentary system, elections are a compared-to-what proposition, and Boris Johnson \u2013 a former Mayor of London and Brexit cheerleader who campaigned as a self-described \u201cmodern progressive conservative\u201d\u2013 cleaned up despite a slight decline in turnout. This should be a time for reassessment in Labour. Its defeat was both predictable and avoidable. While many on the left now dislike Tony Blair with a passion only second to Margaret Thatcher, the stark fact remains that Blair\u2019s centrist New Labour won three consecutive elections \u2013 something no other Labour leader has done \u2013 while more left-wing candidates before and after him have lost badly. There are no perfect political parallels between different countries, but in the UK as in the USA, we see how polarization distorts democracies and elevates the most extreme voices - depriving voters of representative policies and often a functioning government.  The record of the past half-century makes a compelling case that the center holds when it\u2019s given a strong voice\u2026but in its absence, right-wing populism beats left-wing populism.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. As the Democratic caucuses and primaries heat up, the candidates are starting to go after each other with greater ferocity. Sensing a potential victory in Iowa, Mayor Pete Buttigieg launched an ad that goes after proposals from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to make tuition free at public colleges and universities. \u201cI believe we should move to make college affordable for everybody,\u201d Buttigieg says in the ad. \u201cThere are some voices saying, \u2018Well that doesn\u2019t count unless you go even further, unless it\u2019s free even for the kids of millionaires. But I only want to make promises that we can keep.\u201d The mayor\u2019s critics have pounced on this line of attack. After all, some of the nation\u2019s most successful federal programs \u2014 such as Social Security, Medicare and K-12 public education \u2014 have been available to all Americans regardless of their income. Surely, he doesn\u2019t think that these programs are also misconceived? New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez weighed in with a warning on Twitter: \u201cThis is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems & it\u2019s sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it. Just like rich kids can attend public school, they should be able to attend tuition free public college.\u201d Tapper presses Buttigieg on 'self-inflicted wounds' To be sure, it is more than legitimate for Democrats to attack proposals from their competitors as too bold or poorly conceived. It is healthy for Democrats to encounter tough criticism from every quarter to see who is best prepared to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. But Democrats need to be cautious. There is a long history of Republican candidates using smears that unfairly characterize candidates or their policies against the Democratic party nominee. Very often the candidates who think of themselves as the most moderate in the bunch find themselves the target of rhetoric that they or one of their colleagues originally produced. Democratic candidates who seek to paint themselves as the most moderate in the pack should not forget just how far the GOP is willing go to paint any of the nominees as wild-eyed socialist radicals. Democrats should not underestimate the importance of working as a party to frame the debate around key issues so that they don\u2019t end up giving bipartisan legitimacy to spurious conservative talking points. During the height of the Cold War in the 1940s and 1950s, Democrats often went after each other by accusing others of being soft on communism. Prominent officials in the party castigated the left wing by charging that they were too radical. In doing so, they played into the strategy of equating domestic progressivism and international diplomacy with socialism. Former Vice President Henry Wallace was one of the prime victims of this kind of campaign. This is what black voters want to see from Pete Buttigieg Yet Democrats \u2014 from Presidents Harry Truman to Lyndon Johnson \u2014 learned that they could not contain the fallout from this style of partisan warfare. Eventually, no matter how hawkish the Democrats were, Republicans went after them as being part of the party that was too weak on defense. When former Democratic Vice President Hubert Humphrey made a bid for the presidential nomination in 1972, he condemned South Dakota Sen. George McGovern for being weak on defense. Humphrey warned: \u201cNor am I going to let Senator McGovern\u2019s defense proposals make America into second\u2010class power.\u201d McGovern won the nomination. President Richard Nixon put together a fierce campaign that tagged McGovern as a leftist who would endanger national security. Although McGovern had been a staunch internationalist who supported most of the Cold War strategy, Nixon was successful. In 1984, Democrats were desperate to figure out who was the most electable Democrat to defeat President Ronald Reagan, who in their mind had brought the country into a dangerous era of conservatism, threatening global peace and the social safety net. Ohio Sen. John Glenn, who believed that he had the best chance to beat the Gipper, warned voters that Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale had supported dangerous cuts in defense spending that jeopardized key programs like the Navy\u2019s F-14 Tomcat fighter plane program. Poll: Pete Buttigieg surges to first place in Iowa After Mondale won the nomination, Reagan frequently turned to quotes from Democrats that depicted Mondale as coming from the dovish wing of the party, which he was not. In 1988, during the Massachusetts primary, Al Gore brought up the state\u2019s weekend furlough program for prisoners. He did so to tag the state\u2019s technocratic Gov. Michael Dukakis as being far too liberal on crime, a big topic in the 1980s (though the furlough program was started by Dukakis\u2019 predecessor). Republicans remembered what Gore had said when then-Vice President George H.W. Bush faced off against Dukakis in the general election. The GOP injected race into the story by highlighting the case of an African-American man named Willie Horton, who had escaped from the furlough program, raped a white woman and stabbed her partner. The Republican campaign effectively devastated Dukakis\u2019s image by summoning the case. Similarly, in 2004 Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry went after Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who had been doing well in the race, speaking about his opposition to the disastrous war in Iraq. Kerry warned that Dean would be weak on defense after 9/11 and that his candidacy would ensure President George W. Bush\u2019s re-election. Referring to Dean\u2019s statement that the US was not safer after Saddam Hussein had been captured, Kerry said: \u201cSomeone who talks like this is going to have a hard time convincing the American people that he can keep them safe. This election is too vital for us to lose \u2026 because voters refuse to take a gamble on national security and the steadiness of our leadership.\u201d Although Kerry won the nomination, that became the centerpiece of GOP attacks against him. Democrats who attack from the center don\u2019t always think through the potential impact of their words. They operate from a mythical position that they will be able to insulate themselves from the same such attacks if their turn comes in the crossfire. But we have seen from history it doesn\u2019t work that way. Joe Biden leads nationally as Pete Buttigieg rises The better strategy would be to shore up support for Democratic ideas and policies during the caucuses and primaries, insisting on a debate that centers on those terms rather than Republican points, and not offering the GOP more material going into the fall campaign. For if they are not careful, the moderates might end up doing exactly what Republicans are hoping for, thereby helping to set up the conditions for President Trump\u2019s reelection.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s silence on how she plans to pay for Medicare for All has turned into a problem at an important moment in her campaign. Right as she has become one of the clear frontrunners in the Democratic race \u2014 if not the frontrunner \u2014 she walked out of the fourth Democratic debate a bit bruised from her unwillingness to answer the question about whether she would raise taxes to pay for the benefits. Warren has promised to release her plan about paying for the benefits. \u201cRight now the cost estimates for Medicare for All vary by trillions and trillions of dollars and the different revenue stream for how to fund it, there are a lot of it,\u201d she said in Iowa. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been working on for months and months, and it\u2019s got just a little more work until it\u2019s finished.\u201d The plan will likely involve a package that mixes higher taxes and other revenue streams in exchange for eliminating the deductibles and premiums as well as other out-of-pocket expenses. Warren might make some adjustments to proposed benefits to lower the high estimates that are currently being projected. But to take control of this debate, Warren needs to offer more than a policy brief about finance. She has the chance to turn this challenge into an opportunity to make this part of her signature issue \u2014 restoring security to middle class Americans. It\u2019s an issue that has gotten drowned out with all the emphasis on health care. Why Democrats face an uphill battle against Trump During the televised debates, the conversation about paying for Medicare for All has overwhelmed almost every other domestic issue. The good news for her and other proponents of this idea is that although polls show that 55% of Democrats would prefer to build on the existing Affordable Care Act, 51% of all Americans support a Medicare for All approach \u2014 a good sign of the potential to win votes across the aisle. While Barack Obama was in office, Warren made a name for herself by fighting for middle-class families and offering real solutions to the economic struggles that they faced on matters such as debt. At the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, she fought to protect the rights of average Americans in the world in the financial sector. Her own life story is so powerful on the campaign trail because it comes out of this experience. Families have been struggling to keep up with higher costs, vanishing benefits, and fleeting jobs for decades. Health care concerns fit right in. With this Medicare for All plan, she needs to explain why it is important to the family budgets of Americans who are struggling to get by in the modern economy. Equally important will be her ability to make a strong case about what the alternative to Medicare for All would be. In other words, what happens if the current health care system, dominated by the commercial insurance industry, remains intact without any major reform? To win this debate among Democrats and in the national electorate, she needs to show that her plan will provide the most efficient, cost-effective and equitable health care system possible. Given the increased costs that patients are continuing to experience, even with the Affordable Care Act, Warren needs to explain why costs would rise even more dramatically if Congress doesn\u2019t go big. It will be crucial to demonstrate that by providing the public with immense leverage over providers, through government insurance, the country would finally be able to contain and drive down costs in the long-term and make the obligations from patients more predictable.  Even if taxes go up, she needs to show that this reform would improve the yearly income of working families and offer them more stability notwithstanding the vicissitudes of health. Solving the tax question is not enough. The only way to turn Medicare for All into a campaign theme that can win broad political support in the fall election will be to reframe the issue toward something greater than costs. Warren has an opportunity to make the case that this is not a left-of-center idea but in fact a way to bring greater security to all middle-class families.",

The stakes are high as 20 Democratic presidential candidates get ready to meet in Detroit for their second round of televised debates. Given that the first debates produced some sizable short-term shifts in the polling after Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 direct challenge to frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden on school busing, everyone is aware that the things that are said on the debate stage can make a big difference. Democrats scramble for momentum in Motown While the dynamics of any debate are impossible to predict, each candidate has a specific set of objectives to best position themselves as the campaign moves ahead. The former Vice President needs to show in front of the cameras that he is in fact the most \u201celectable\u201d candidate. The basic premise of his campaign is that he is best positioned to defeat President Donald Trump. With Democrats desperate for a new person in the White House, each poll showing Biden\u2019s strength against Trump offers more fodder for the campaign. Yet the first debate raised some serious questions. Some of the well-known baggage that Biden brings to the table, some of the compromises he has made along the way in his Senate career and his tendency to stumble in high-profile moments, all came to light within a few seconds. The debate in Detroit offers him another chance to prove to voters that he can perform in this arena. Democrats need to imagine what he will look like when facing off against Trump during the crucial months of next year\u2019s general election. At this point, Biden\u2019s biggest vulnerability is his tendency for self-inflicted wounds during  the campaign. By many accounts, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has run the best campaign of any of the candidates. She has risen in the polls by offering a sophisticated mix of stump speeches, policy proclamations and social media blasts. She has also taken a series of bold stands, such as calling for impeachment early on and favoring ending the Senate filibuster, that distinguish her from the rest. Juli\u00e1n Castro: Why my mother yanked me from my sixth-grade classroom But given Biden\u2019s standing she will need to consolidate the non-Biden Democrats, along with the marginal Biden supporters, around her candidacy. This means that in the debate her objective will be to keep making the case that she is the most credible coalition builder rather than the frontrunner. She has to show that she has the capacity, including on foreign policy issues, to hold and excite progressive voters while still appealing to the mainstream of the party. In other words, she has to show that she is the candidate most likely to rebuild the Barack Obama coalition that guided the party to victory in 2008 and 2012. Going head-to-head with Bernie Sanders offers her an opportunity to make this case. Sen. Bernie Sanders has remained steady, but he needs to show that he can broaden his support. He still commands a passionate following. For those Democrats, he remains the most authentic progressive voice and a politician who has been brave enough to be bold on important issues. But his support has not greatly expanded and in some places it has diminished. Sanders needs to use this debate to ignite the crowd. He needs to convince Democrats outside his orbit that his policy positions are winning issues and that he can best appeal to the working-class voters in states like Wisconsin that Democrats desperately want to win back. He needs to go beyond repeating his accomplishments from 2016 and make a case for 2020. Most important, Sanders needs to show that his being at the top of the ticket would not open up the party to defeat as President Trump unleashes his \u201cDemocrats are socialists\u201d campaign. If he was the candidate, some wonder, would Democrats lose voters to Trump in an even broader range of states than the last time around? Sen. Kamala Harris has shown repeatedly that she is incredibly powerful on the public stage. During congressional hearings and in the first debate, Harris demonstrated numerous times that she can handle tough questions and knows how to eviscerate an opponent with remarkable rhetorical precision. Without going low, she can hit hard. But what is her campaign about? Harris still remains something of a mystery. While Biden is all about the promise of  being electable, much of Harris\u2019 buzz remains the fact she is a smart and skillful politician. But she needs to fill in some of the gaps by talking about the issues that matter most to her and outlining a bolder agenda that she seeks to pursue. As someone who has spent much of her career as a pragmatist, offering such a vision may not be easy. Bill de Blasio: Public pre-K programs changed my children's lives. Other American families deserve the same Even though she is not on the stage with Warren, she needs to offer an argument about why her candidacy is more powerful than the other major non-Biden frontrunner. This is her chance to introduce the heart of her run. Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s poll numbers remain low but his promise remains strong. His fundraising haul has been impressive and he has stepped up his campaign with policy agendas on issues such as criminal justice and the economy. The 37-year-old mayor is smart and politically savvy but still needs to overcome concerns about his young age and relative lack of experience, as well as whether he is too moderate to win over progressives. Marianne Williamson: What I learned raising my daughter in an affluent suburb While the mayor brings many strengths to the table and remains in strong position to win over Biden voters should that campaign falter, he has yet to really sell the most powerful part of his candidacy: generational change. This was a theme that he raised when he announced but one that has somewhat faded ever since. He has to use his age to his advantage and argue that expunging the politics that produced Trumpism requires a candidate from a new generation, one willing to think about problems in fundamentally different ways than older politicians. He needs to deal head-on with the structures of politics, such as the Electoral College, that keep reproducing dysfunction and made a President like Trump possible. As a well-educated, married gay man who voluntarily served in the military and focused on local politics, his life story is a symbol of the frustration many Americans feel, as well as the Kennedy-like promise of a new era.  At this point many candidates are really hanging on by a thread. Some once-promising candidates like Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Cory Booker are failing to gain much traction. By the fall there will be pressure for some of them \u2013 let alone others such as Seth Moulton, who have barely made a blip \u2013 to step aside and make room for the main candidates. If they\u2019re not able to make some kind of splash, the pressure for them to exit will intensify. They have to offer a strong taste of what distinguishes them and what makes them viable should there be openings if any of the top candidates falter.",

He may have believed it when he pledged to working people that the gains from the North American Free Trade Agreement \u201cwill be your gains, too.\u201d But that\u2019s not what happened. He would have been better off paraphrasing another president, Lyndon Johnson, who said, \u201cWe are giving away the working class for a generation.\u201d The Democratic Party is supposed to be the party that defends and protects working people. But as our country\u2019s manufacturing jobs disappeared, unemployed auto workers in Michigan didn\u2019t feel protected. Working families in Ohio didn\u2019t see any progress. Small family farmers in Iowa didn\u2019t achieve prosperity or stability. In 2016 Democrats lost the election in the very places and with the very people who suffered from NAFTA. We lost the hearts and minds of those who saw their jobs leave and their communities hollowed out. When we talk about trade in this country, we too often debate only the pros and cons of specific trade deals. And the only trade deals we have ever seen were written by and for multinational corporations. Mexico moves to implement agreement with Trump It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. The current debate is about NAFTA and \u201cNAFTA 2.0\u201d \u2013 or the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA \u2013 the deal President Trump has proposed to replace NAFTA. Instead of debating whether Trump\u2019s trade deal is better or worse than the original, we should ask why NAFTA should be the starting point for anything. Why are we making minor tweaks to a policy that was never designed to help working people in the first place? The Trump administration wants to build a better mouse trap.  Working families are the mice. Here\u2019s a radical idea: Start over. From scratch. Rewrite the rules of international trade, and give workers the pen. If trade deals were written by and for working people, they would include enforceable wage standards, a guaranteed right to organize, and the ability to form multinational bargaining units to negotiate with multinational corporations. When a company wants to move a plant or a call center from the US to Mexico to reduce labor costs, it should be required to bargain with workers from both countries. If trade deals were written by and for working people, they would raise standards on pollution, require trade partners to honor the terms of the Paris Accord, and increase our shared commitment to fight climate change. Cooper: All of Trump's threats were about nothing If trade deals were written by and for working people, they would encourage competition in pharmaceuticals and speed up the process of getting new and cheaper medications to the global market. If trade deals were written by and for working people, they would raise the bar on corporate taxes and prohibit participating countries from setting up off-shore tax havens that help billionaires and multinational corporations avoid paying their fair share. The United States is the largest consumer market on the planet and the \u201cconsumer of last resort\u201d for every other country. The terms we set to allow access to that market should advance the interests of workers and consumers \u2013 not the bottom lines of multinational corporations.  Those who still think \u201cWhat\u2019s good for General Motors is good for America\u201d should spend some time in Lordstown, Ohio. Trust me: those days are over. When it comes to trade, it\u2019s time we put working families first.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Is Donald Trump another Jimmy Carter \u2013 or George H.W. Bush? Democrats are hoping that Trump will join the short list of modern-era presidents who lost their bids for reelection. But the new Washington Post/ABC News poll should make them think twice. Though a majority of Americans see President Trump as \u201cunpresidential,\u201d his approval ratings have risen to 47% among registered voters and 44% among Americans of voting age. He is receiving credit from 51% of those polled for the strong economy. Regardless of who holds office, these are not the kinds of numbers that an opposition party likes to see. Given that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has pretty much ruled out impeachment, almost every Democrat is hoping that the era of Trump comes to an end via the voting booth in November 2020. Where's the beef? Biden lacks a compelling vision for America's future Only then can the nation test Joe Biden\u2019s proposition that politics will resume to normal once someone else is in the Oval Office. Just as important, a Democratic president would have the opportunity to protect the policies and institutions which have come under threat in the past three years. Democrats are thinking of Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the two presidents since Herbert Hoover who ran for reelection and failed. Ronald Reagan defeated President Carter in 1980 and Bill Clinton beat President Bush in 1992. Other than those two candidacies (Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson both decided they would not run for reelection, Gerald Ford was never elected, and John Kennedy was assassinated), incumbent presidents have done well at the ballot box. Unfortunately for Democrats, President Trump seems to be in a stronger position than either Carter or Bush. Despite his relatively low approval ratings, and early polls showing that many of the Democratic candidates come out ahead of him in head-to-head competition, Trump enjoys a number of important advantages over Carter and Bush. The strong economy is the most important. Economic growth and low unemployment, as well as a sense among the public that conditions are good, differentiate President Trump from his unsuccessful predecessors. In 1980, Carter struggled with the impact of 1970s stagflation, the combination of high unemployment and inflation, as well as an oil crisis that left Americans waiting at long gas lines. This was the reason that one of Reagan\u2019s famous campaign lines stuck: \u201cA recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his.\u201d Bush did not fare much better. In 1992, the economy remained in a severe recession. Bill Clinton took advantage of these conditions to overcome the president\u2019s success with Operation Desert Storm and ran a campaign based on the idea: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid. \u201c Both Carter and Bush ran with their parties divided. In 1980, Carter struggled right through the Democratic convention as Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy challenged him in the primaries, claiming he had abandoned traditional Democratic ideals. Kennedy won in a number of key primaries, such as New York, and he generated much more enthusiasm than Carter was able to do. During his speech at the convention, Kennedy brought the crowd to its feet with soaring oratory while Carter could barely muster any applause with his lackluster performance. The bitter tensions that surfaced during the primaries lingered through the election, and, along with the votes lost to third party candidate John Anderson, undercut the kind of enthusiasm Carter needed to defeat the Reagan juggernaut. Bush\u2019s support among Republicans was stronger, although he too faced internal divisions. His decision in 1990 to accept a tax hike as part of a deficit reduction package enraged conservatives like Newt Gingrich who believed he had abandoned a key tenet of Republican orthodoxy. Patrick Buchanan captured even more unease among the base when he took Bush on during the primaries, accusing \u201cKing George\u201d of having ignored working class conservatives and the culture wars. Today, President Trump does not yet face a serious primary challenger. He continues to poll very well among Republican voters and very few leaders in the GOP have challenged his campaign. Neither Carter nor Bush could count on a dedicated partisan media to support their campaign. Fox News didn\u2019t go on the air until 1996 and the internet did not bloom, along with sites like the Drudge Report, until later in the decade. In 2019, President Trump goes into battle with the full weight of the conservative media universe behind him. He can communicate directly to voters and shape the media conversation through Twitter, while his campaign will depend on Fox News and Breitbart.Com to disseminate stories that are sympathetic to him. Social media platforms such as Facebook will once again offer a vehicle to spread their message. Trump has already been outspending Democratic candidates on Facebook ads. And finally, notwithstanding all the instability and diplomatic chaos, President Trump continues to enjoy relative peace abroad. Carter went into the fall campaign with two major international crises \u2013 the Iran Hostage Crisis that started in November 1979 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan which began one month later. Bush had relative calm by the fall of 1992, though the military operation against Iraq with Operation Desert Storm had proven that the end of the Cold War did not mean the end of military conflict. Saddam Hussein\u2019s ongoing provocations against the Kurds and the UN reminded voters that overseas tensions continued to loom large. While political commentators point to all the risks and threats that the nation faces as a result of President Trump\u2019s haphazard approach to foreign policy, most Americans aren\u2019t worried about international conflicts now. In other words, Democrats won\u2019t have an easy run of things. While many Democrats find it inconceivable that Trump could ever win re-election, it is possible to see how many of them might end up reliving the morning after the 2004 election when President George W. Bush emerged as a second-term victor.  Democrats need to consider Trump\u2019s strengths as they select their nominee. Picking someone who stands up well to Trump in early polls will not be enough. They need a candidate, whether Biden or Elizabeth Warren or someone else, who can put together a powerful campaign that mobilizes the grassroots, commands ongoing media attention, and brings the party together with an inspiring agenda. Democrats should  think of 2020 as a monumental effort to unseat an incumbent who will bring great strength to the table rather than an easy defeat of a weakened leader barely holding on to power.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: In this weekly column \u201cCross-exam,\u201d Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. Sen. Kamala Harris owned the stage last week during the first Democratic presidential debate, displaying keen intellect, poise under fire, quick reactions and dynamic presence. In the pressurized, high-stakes environment of the debate, Harris gained an edge over the other candidates by deploying her secret weapon: her experience as a prosecutor. And we are already seeing how potent that weapon is, as public support for Harris surged in a CNN post-debate poll. Harris worked in law enforcement for over 25 years, starting as an in-the-trenches prosecutor before winning election as district attorney of San Francisco in 2003 and California attorney general in 2010 (the first woman and first African American to hold the latter office). As she demonstrated last week, Harris\u2019 prosecutorial background has uniquely prepared her to excel in the debates and to thrive in the grueling campaign ahead. Debates are hard. Candidates are on an overcrowded stage. They get to speak only in short bursts. The questions are somewhat unpredictable. And pundits analyze every word, gesture and facial expression. But criminal trials are harder. The prosecutor must convince 12 ordinary people from all walks of life of a defendant\u2019s guilt \u2013 unanimously. Try getting any 12 people to agree on anything unanimously \u2013 what kind of pizza to order for lunch, for example \u2013 and you\u2019ll understand how hard that is. And the prosecutor must convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest burden of proof in our legal system. One significant slip-up, and the case is lost. Prosecutors must question unpredictable witnesses and respond to unexpected twists, on the spot. Along the way, judges enforce strict rules of evidence and procedure, while razor-sharp defense attorneys slash away at every word out of the prosecutor\u2019s mouth. Kamala Harris: It pays to attack As such, good prosecutors learn to read an audience and to think and speak on the fly. Harris displayed the savvy of an experienced prosecutor during the first debate.  She knew exactly when to hold steady and when to attack.  She sensed when to ratchet up the drama \u2013 most memorably when she told her own story of being bused to school, culminating with the indelible line \u201cthat little girl was me\u201d \u2013 and when to pull back (for example, Harris made clear that she thinks former Vice President Joe Biden is not racist or ill-intentioned, but simply out of touch).  Beyond the moments of high drama, Harris stuck determinedly to her central campaign message about working for middle class families, just as a skilled prosecutor lays out and then reinforces the core theory of a case for the jury. This is not the first we\u2019ve seen of Harris\u2019 considerable courtroom skill.  When Attorney General William Barr testified in the Senate, Harris was effective, asking pointed questions that left Barr first pretending he couldn\u2019t hear and then stammering about not understanding the word \u201csuggest.\u201d  It was a prosecutor\u2019s dream: Harris shredded Barr, and she did it calmly and politely. Harris has come under fire for her record as an aggressive (arguably nonprogressive) prosecutor. Critics note that in the past she fought to uphold questionable convictions, advocated against abolition of the death penalty and expressed doubt about decriminalizing marijuana. Harris\u2019 record from two-plus decades as a prosecutor is absolutely fair game for criticism, and she will need to answer tough questions about her prior work. Why Kamala Harris' Biden attack worked But Harris can also point to innovative policies she enacted \u2013 including prisoner re-entry programs, modernized police training and the use of police body-worn cameras \u2013 and she has made clear she intends to run on a progressive criminal justice platform. Any candidate is a product of his or her experience. Harris\u2019 long history as a prosecutor gives her a skill set, presence and perspective \u2013 in short, an edge \u2013 that few other Democratic primary candidates can match (even the ones that also served as prosecutors). And the prospect of facing off against an unflappable courtroom tactician like Harris should be keeping President Donald Trump awake at night, too. Nadia, California: When Mueller testifies, does he have to stay within the four corners of his written report, or can he say things that are not covered in his report? Mueller does not want to testify beyond the substance of his report \u2013 \u201cthe report is my testimony,\u201d he stated in May \u2013 and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Jay Sekulow claimed it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d for Mueller to testify to anything beyond the report.  Both are wrong. This is not how subpoenas work. Subpoenas are mandatory, not optional. Witnesses testifying under subpoena do not get to pick and choose what they do and do not feel like answering. Mueller of all people knows this: he served over 2,800 subpoenas during his investigation, and the utility of those subpoenas depends largely on their compulsory nature. Nor can outside attorneys for potentially aggrieved parties (like Sekulow) impose self-serving, arbitrary limits on the testimony. This is what Trump and Barr dread There are some questions that Mueller can appropriately and lawfully decline to answer, including those relating to ongoing criminal investigations and sensitive national security issues \u2013 largely due to the need for ongoing confidentiality. As a practical matter, however, if Mueller declines to answer anything beyond the report, there is little that House committee members can do. The committee can go to court to compel Mueller to answer, but that process would be time consuming and burdensome. It would hardly seem worth the trouble and controversy, particularly if Mueller only declines to answer a few questions. Mueller has serious questions left to answer, within and beyond his report, in which he decided to take a cautious, ambiguous and at times indecipherable approach to describing his findings. Most pointedly, he left unclear whether he found sufficient evidence that Trump committed obstruction of justice. If Mueller refuses to answer fully as the law requires, he will do a disservice to his investigation, his legacy and the American public. Chris, Pennsylvania: According to federal law, nepotism is illegal, so why isn\u2019t anyone pressing this issue against Trump\u2019s appointment of his children to high-ranking positions? Federal law does prohibit nepotism, defined as the hiring by the President or other senior officials of a family member to an agency over which he or she has jurisdiction. But the Department of Justice in 2017 opined that the law does not apply to White House staff \u2013 giving Trump the green light to hire family members as White House advisers. Trump used the Justice Department\u2019s end-around to name his daughter Ivanka Trump \u201cadviser to the President.\u201d Similarly, Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner is \u201csenior adviser to the President.\u201d Controversy arose when Trump brought Ivanka Trump to the G20 summit and had her provide a \u201creadout\u201d of Trump\u2019s meetings with other world leaders. The absurdity of Ivanka Trump \u2013 who never worked in foreign affairs before her father became President \u2013 attempting to conduct high-stakes foreign relations with other world leaders underscores the need for anti-nepotism laws. But until Congress closes the loophole for White House staffers, or the Justice Department amends its opinion permitting the hiring of such personnel, we run the risk of giving undue power to underqualified relatives of top federal officials. Sam, Hawaii: Doesn\u2019t Congress have some inherent contempt authority to arrest people who disobey its subpoenas? With Trump administration officials repeatedly defying congressional subpoenas, House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler has vowed that he will file lawsuits seeking to compel testimony from Barr, former White House counsel Don McGahn, former White House aide Hope Hicks and others. If Nadler succeeds, courts will order the witnesses to comply with the subpoenas and testify. Ivanka Trump and Don Jr. put on a ludicrous show But the law also gives Congress its own inherent enforcement powers, separate and apart from the courts, to arrest and imprison witnesses held in contempt for defying a subpoena. Despite the antiquated title, there actually is a House Sergeant-at-Arms \u2013 Paul Irving, a former Secret Service agent \u2013 who is \u201cthe chief law enforcement and protocol officer \u2026 and is responsible for maintaining order\u201d within the House. While there currently is no functioning jail on the Capitol grounds, there are several rooms inside the Capitol building that historically were used to imprison people held in contempt. Like the Capitol jail, however, Congress\u2019 inherent contempt authority is now a curious relic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently referenced the House\u2019s contempt powers, jokingly threatening to arrest and imprison administration members who defy congressional subpoenas. Indeed, Congress has not exercised its inherent contempt authority since 1935. There is no particular legal reason why Congress\u2019 inherent contempt authority has effectively disappeared; it simply has gone dormant over many years of non-use. Chris, New York: How is it that the Supreme Court ruled this term that a person can be prosecuted twice, once by a state and once federally, for the same offense?  Doesn\u2019t this violate double jeopardy? The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution does prohibit double jeopardy: no person shall be \u201csubject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d  But the Supreme Court ruled last month in Gamble v. United States that it does not violate double jeopardy for the same person to be tried for the same conduct in two different jurisdictions. The court ruled that, as long as the two prosecutions are brought by \u201cseparate sovereigns\u201d \u2013 in Gamble\u2019s case, the state of Alabama and then the federal government \u2013 there is no double jeopardy problem.  If, however, a person is charged twice by the same sovereign for the same crime, then double jeopardy bars the second prosecution.  The decision crossed traditional ideological lines between conservative and liberal justices.  Seven of the nine justices \u2013 John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 comprised the majority.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch, who usually stand far apart on the ideological spectrum, dissented. The Gamble decision is bad news for former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, who was convicted in federal court and then charged in New York court with crimes relating to some of the same conduct as his federal conviction. There is now no question that the New York prosecution can continue and does not violate double jeopardy. 1) What caused Trump to lash out at the New York attorney general in tweets on two consecutive days?  Was he informed that bad news might be coming? 2) When will Nadler make good on his continued declarations that the House Judiciary Committee will go to court to enforce its subpoenas? 3) How will the D.C. District Court respond to the House Ways and Means Committee lawsuit seeking to compel Trump to release his tax returns?",

He is coauthor of \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Thinking About the Music\u201d and, most recently, coeditor of \u201cYou Shook Me All Campaign Long,\u201d focusing on the music of the 2016 presidential election. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN. When Democratic candidates converged on the state of Iowa, each candidate took the opportunity not only to speak, but to present a musical soundscape when they walked onto the main stage at the annual Democratic dinner a week ago. So, what does this music say about the individual candidates, their politics and the message they would like to convey to the masses? Let\u2019s take a look at the musical choices of four candidates \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Rep. John Delaney. Sanders walked out to John Lennon\u2019s \u201cPower to the People,\u201d a choice that perfectly matches his political message from beginning to end. It makes sense that Sanders, a democratic socialist who supports tuition-free public colleges, universal healthcare and a $15 minimum wage, would choose a song with the lyrics, \u201cYou got a million people working for nothing, You better give \u2018em what they really own.\u201d The song, which repeats the title phrase several times, reinforces the image of Sanders as someone who will restore the power of the country to the people and address the plight of working-class Americans struggling to survive. Most importantly, it is a song about activism and getting involved to make change. One verse goes, \u201cSay we want a revolution \u2026 You better get on your feet, And head to the street\u201d \u2013 prominent themes of the Sanders\u2019 grassroots campaign. As one of the most progressive 2020 candidates, Sanders\u2019 choice of Lennon is apt, especially since the famed singer-songwriter was known for his activism and often seen as a political radical. In a similar vein, Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s use of The Clash\u2019s \u201cClampdown\u201d pits the candidate squarely against the perceived ideals of President Donald Trump. The song\u2019s opening lyrics, which include the lines, \u201cTaking off his turban, they said is this man a Jew?\u201d and \u201cThey put up a poster saying we earn more than you\u201d make specific reference to the marginalization of certain groups and inequities in society instilled by the establishment. The song is ultimately a call to reject these ideals and resist those who work as part of the \u201cclampdown.\u201d How music fits Trump's campaign message O\u2019Rourke, who was once part of a punk rock band himself, said The Clash changed his life by being openly political and \u201d trying to be a voice for those who otherwise would not have a voice \u2013 but then making it popular.\u201d O\u2019Rourke\u2019s choice ultimately paints him as an anti-establishment candidate who is resistant to the attitudes perpetuated by the current administration as well as the mores of Washington in general. It presents him as someone who is aware of the flaws in the current political system and ready to take a stand against inequality. While Sanders and O\u2019Rourke have cast themselves as rebels intent on political change, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s choice, \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough,\u201d by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, projects hope, unity and dependability, with lyrics like: \u201cIf you need me call me no matter where you are \u2026 just call my name I\u2019ll be there in a hurry.\u201d Through this song, Gabbard presents herself as a candidate who can always be called upon, no matter the circumstance, to help a country face whatever obstacle may stand in the way. This is the biggest 2020 mistake the Democrats could make This message could be effective in both the primary and general election, as it speaks to unifying the various factions of the Democratic Party as well as reaching across the aisle to create a better country for all Americans. Finally, John Delaney\u2019s choice of \u201cI\u2019ve Been Everywhere\u201d by Johnny Cash can be seen in a couple different ways. First, it works to present Delaney as an experienced candidate who is ready to take on the challenges of the party and the nation. The song, which lists places like Chicago, Buffalo, Wichita and Oklahoma, links the candidate to multiple constituencies, whether they be rural or metropolitan. In short, this song is about presenting a candidate who can appeal to a broad scope of people within the electorate Delaney has already pit himself against Sanders on healthcare and economic policies ahead of the first Democratic debates, And by choosing Johnny Cash, who epitomizes authenticity and grit with broad musical appeal among both conservative and liberal audiences, Delaney may be taking a moderate, \u201cbig tent\u201d approach to his campaign.  The musical soundscape of a campaign is an important one \u2013 it can present a concise message and establish an emotional connection between the candidate and the electorate. And as the candidate\u2019s needs change along the campaign trail, these shifts are reflected in the music selections, which can help forge new connections. With more than a year until the 2020 elections, this is likely far from the final musical word from any of these candidates.",

Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 trial balloon just hit some turbulence. The man\u2019s been in public life for more than 40 years, starting back when micro-aggressions didn\u2019t register on the Richter scale compared to more obvious aggressions.  Culturally, he\u2019s a product of the Kennedy era \u2013 even with the aura of contemporary cool that comes from having been President Barack Obama\u2019s Veep. He is on what would typically be the wrong side of the unprecedented generational divide in this crowded Democratic field between the first millennial to run for president, Pete Buttigieg, and elders like himself and Bernie Sanders. Why Joe Biden shouldn't run for president And yet, a new Harvard Institute of Politics poll finds that younger voters like the oldest candidates in the race (Sanders and Biden) best at this point. Biden, whose candidacy at this point is anticipated but undeclared, has been leading most 2020 polls, with his highest approval ratings among African-Americans (despite candidates like Cory Booker and Kamala Harris being in the race). And perhaps most crucially in a contest where the ability to beat Donald Trump is the number one criterion for Democrats, Biden does best in a matchup. For a party that usually backs the hot hand rather than the political veteran \u2013 and got burned by backing Hillary Clinton \u2013 what explains this persistent love for a loose-lipped 76-year-old? I\u2019ll answer with a story about former California Gov. Jerry Brown that his longtime political aide, Joe Trippi (a CNN contributor) , told me. Back in 2010, Golden State voters were looking to replace the two-term roller coaster Arnold Schwarzenegger, the ultimate celebrity outsider at that time.  The state had been in an ornery outsider mood for a while, unceremoniously kicking the technocrat Gov. Gray Davis out of office via recall in 2003. And now Jerry Brown was looking to make a comeback. The man known as \u201cGovernor Moonbeam\u201d had already served two terms beginning in the 1970s. He\u2019d rebounded as mayor of Oakland and the state attorney general. But he seemed to be not just a blast from the past but downright old compared to comparatively fresh-faced candidates like eBay CEO Meg Whitman  and the telegenic and progressive then-mayor of San Francisco Gavin Newsom. Being the anti-Trump isn't enough for Democratic candidates So Trippi was fearing the worst when he did a focus group. Here\u2019s what he told me: \u201cAs we simply told voters of Whitman\u2019s stellar biography \u2013 voters said \u2018no way.\u2019  \u2018We tried someone from outside \u2013 look at Arnold.\u2019  \u2018I just want someone who has been there and knows how government is supposed to work.\u2019   When we told them about Newsom the young rising star \u2013 the reaction was just as stark \u2013 \u2018we need experience.\u2019 \u2018I want someone who knows how to turn on the lights.\u2019 It turned out Jerry Brown, who had been around forever, was exactly what the voters wanted.\u201d In our short attention span, celebrity driven culture it seemed absurd that California voters would go for a comparatively ancient ex-governor. But they did. And Brown delivered \u2013 taming a fractious state legislature in Sacramento, turning a $27 billion deficit into a $15 billion budget surplus in addition to a $14.5 billion rainy day fund to help deal with future budget crises. That\u2019s a fiscal record any Republican governor in the country would envy. On the liberal side of the ledger, he made California a leader in the fight against climate change, dealt with droughts and championed criminal justice reform ahead of the national trend. So what does this have to do with Joe Biden? After the reign of Captain Chaos in the White House, voters just might be in the mood for tried and true. Biden is respected on both sides of the aisle in the Senate  (which of course doesn\u2019t mean that Senate Republicans won\u2019t attack him mercilessly in the context of a campaign). His political brand is set as a fighter for middle America with an ability to connect with working class white voters, many of whom turned out for Donald Trump in 2016. He\u2019s got a comparatively liberal voting record, but he\u2019s not seen as a left-wing culture warrior, let alone a socialist. All this matters, especially when it\u2019s obvious that President Trump\u2019s entire re-election strategy \u2013 as amplified by opinion anchors at Fox News \u2013 is based on appeals to negative partisanship. That means demonizing the Democrats as the party of socialist radicals who believe that the white working class is irredeemably racist. This helps account for the parade of Fox banners framing the election as \u201cTrump vs Socialism\u201d and the attempt to make freshman congresswoman \u2013 and Democratic Socialist \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez into the face of the Democratic Party. And the leftward lurch of the party on policy substance like Medicare-for-all (which actually is the government takeover of health care that Obamacare never was) as well as style is playing right into the Trump re-elect playbook. But Joe Biden is largely inoculated from these attacks. He can\u2019t be defined by Donald Trump. And he\u2019s got deep credibility with the voters Democrats need to win back after 2016. Not coincidentally, he\u2019s popular in the must-win battlegrounds of 2020 \u2013 Michigan, Pennsylvania and retiree-rich Florida. If Trump will again play the \u201cus against them\u201d game, Biden will look to a lot of swing voters in those states as \u201cone of us.\u201d That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t risks with a Biden candidacy. With a four-decade voting record, there will be plenty to hit him on, public positions that haven\u2019t aged well, from busing to his handling of Anita Hill\u2019s accusations against Clarence Thomas. Biden would be considered an undisciplined communicator compared to anyone but Donald Trump.  And while another woman, Amy Lappos, has come forward like Lucy Flores did with an account of Biden\u2019s public touching,  and there may well be more, my guess is that many more will be in the Stephanie Carter camp \u2013 and none of it so far is in the same ballpark as Donald Trump\u2019s record of alleged (and denied) sexual assaults and sexual harassment.  The most obvious deficit is Biden\u2019s age. Trump is old, but Biden is older. If he seems to have lost a few miles off his fastball, the old nickname \u201cSlow Joe\u201d could take on a whole new meaning. But barring a lackluster campaign with literal faceplants, there\u2019s a way to blunt this concern: campaign for one term out of the gate. Campaign as Biden the Bridge-Builder between generations as well as the hardhats\u2019 advocate, determined to heal our divides and make America again seen as a leader on the world stage. Balance the ticket with age, race and gender.  A Biden-Harris ticket, for example, would be hard to beat and give the fresh-faced Veep time to train up to take the top job rather than running into the \u201cinexperienced\u201d buzzsaw against an incumbent. Sometimes President Trump is beyond parody.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is sitting on a political powder keg. With a President trying to goad her into launching impeachment, fulfilling the textbook definition of abusing power, she faces growing pressure from her caucus to let the House vote on starting the process. On Wednesday Democrats met behind closed doors once again to discuss the situation. Like most Democrats, Pelosi understands that someone has to stop President Donald Trump from continuing to wield his authority this way. The problem is that few in Washington feel bold enough to do anything about him. His critics are hoping that the 2020 election takes care of the problem for them. This moment is part of a long story. Partisan interests keep triumphing over what is best for our democracy. We have seen this play out for several decades now. Political polarization continues to erode the strength of our government institutions. Massive policy problems such as climate change have been left largely unaddressed. Political careers have been decimated in partisan warfare. Trust in government continues to plummet. Those cumulative partisan forces have now rendered Congress paralyzed when facing a President who rejects any sense of restraint to how he can use his authority. In addition to the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report and the multiple other investigations that are underway, Trump has done much of his dirty business right in front of our eyes. Unlike President Richard Nixon, Trump is so brazen he doesn\u2019t feel the need to hide in the shadows. Justin Amash's impeachment call puts the Constitution ahead of Trump Over the past few weeks, he and his Cabinet have put on a first-class demonstration in how to subvert the congressional right to oversight. The administration has offered justifications for ignoring subpoenas and preventing testimony that wouldn\u2019t pass muster in an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d When Republicans controlled the House, their response to this kind of abuse was to ignore it and attack the investigators. Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s apparent calculation was that it was more important to protect the interests of the party by keeping Trump in place and insulating him from oversight than it was to hold him accountable. With conservative judicial picks flowing through the Senate and big corporate tax cuts coming their way, Republicans were in no mood to rock the boat. Even with the President\u2019s low approval rating, this course seemed like the best bet. In the end, it is unclear whether their calculation worked. The party did retain control of the Senate but suffered a devastating defeat in the House. Many voters, even in purple districts, voted to check Trump. Still, most Republican leaders continue to stand by the President. The #nevertrump movement is officially dead (with the lonely exception of Rep. Justin Amash). Clinton's impeachment offers no lesson on Trump. But there's a case that does Now Democrats are the ones with power in the House, and they watch as the President\u2019s behavior only gets worse. As more Democrats call on Pelosi to start the impeachment process, she is still pushing back, fearing that the fallout will cost Democrats the House majority and help Trump win re-election while dividing the country even more. Their memory of the late 1990s, when the public turned against the House Republicans for impeaching President Bill Clinton, looms large even if the comparison is faulty. House Democratic leaders are also leery about moving forward with the impeachment process because they believe Senate Republicans who control the upper chamber will never vote to indict the President. The Democrats would take all the political risks that come from the impeachment process and likely watch the Senate Republicans exonerate the President. Why suffer the political costs, they say, if the outcome is already cooked against them? Following Wednesday\u2019s meeting, the speaker gave no indication that the party would be taking any sort of bold action. In other words, in their own way, Democratic leaders are now putting partisan interests ahead of what is obviously a crisis for the democracy. Even the speaker and other party leaders have been very direct about the situation. \u201cEvery day gives grounds for impeachment,\u201d Pelosi said last week. And on Wednesday, she said, \u201cWe believe that the President is involved in a cover-up.\u201d A look back at Clinton's impeachment reveals the GOP's searing hypocrisy The notion that support for an impeachment process is being driven by left-wing Democrats is ridiculous. In fact that\u2019s just a talking point from the President\u2019s supporters that has made its way into the mainstream media. Amash, who is a libertarian Republican, and George Conway, a conservative constitutional lawyer, have offered some of the most powerful and reasoned arguments as to why an impeachment process must begin. Trump, Conway wrote in The Washington Post, is a \u201ccancer on the presidency.\u201d House Democrats should not give Senate Republicans an effective check on holding the President accountable. If the Democrats voted for articles of impeachment, that in itself would be a huge blow to the historical legacy of this President and permanent part of the record with both parties being forced to say where they stand on his use of power. Even if Senate Republicans decided to keep the President in power, that vote would be an extremely important statement for the country. It would be a public statement about what is right and what is wrong.  Although it is impossible to predict how things will play out politically, it is far from clear that having the House vote on articles of impeachment would help the President. Even if Democrats want to play the partisan game, one can imagine that taking such action would energize the Democratic base, sway moderates to the idea that continuing with this presidency for two terms is unacceptable and do more than anything else to define how voters see this President. Trump\u2019s base is energized all the time anyway, so it is unclear an impeachment process would affect their turnout in the 2020 election. The President\u2019s national approval ratings are still miserable, and the charges that he faces are far more serious than anything Clinton confronted. In any case, it is clear that Democrats are more concerned about their partisan prospects in 2020 rather than about making sure that our constitutional checks and balances are working to restrain Trump right now.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst and anchor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo penned an op-ed, published Monday in the Washington Post, in which he asked a series of 35 questions about our current political environment. It was designed to inspire a bit of reflection in a political culture that encourages anything but. And it was compelling enough that I decided to bite. So in response to Cuomo\u2019s \u201c35 questions,\u201d I offer my own 35 answers. Cuomo\u2019s questions (the toughest of which, for what it\u2019s worth, seemed directed at Cuomo\u2019s own Democratic Party) are included below in italics, followed by my responses. Enjoy. Debate. Disagree. Let\u2019s just try to do so civilly. 1: Which came first, President Trump or the degradation of our political system: Which was the cause, and which was the effect? President Donald Trump is a symptom, not the cause, but he exploited and exacerbated our political divides for personal gain. 2. When did political debate become reduced to 280 characters on Twitter? When Trump used Twitter to set the terms of political debate, perfectly tailored to short attention spans and the media\u2019s conflict bias. 3. When did the number of Twitter followers become the measure of political viability? See above. 4. How did an Instagram post come to command more respect and attention than a substantive policy presentation? People have always liked pictures. Remember Ross Perot\u2019s oversized charts? 5. How did \u201csuccessful journalism\u201d come to be defined by the number of clicks? When those who produce online journalism realized it needed to become profitable or it would die. Alternatively, advertisers could choose at any time to support quality journalism based on quality and engagement rather than clicks. Klobuchar breaks from the populist pack 6. When did we stop believing what we read in the press? When the fairness doctrine was eliminated and partisan news started parading under the slogan \u201cfair and balanced\u201d while attacking legacy news organizations as \u201cliberal media.\u201d It\u2019s no accident that trust in media has declined while partisan media has been on the rise. 7. When did cable news turn into the World Wrestling Federation, with each contender playing to its own cheering section? See above. And thank Roger Ailes. 8. Why are the least informed, most unrealistic and most unreasonable political voices the loudest? Because demagogues don\u2019t need to worry about actually uniting a nation and solving problems. 9. When did the labor movement become viewed by some as the enemy of the middle class? Probably in the 1970s and 1980s when periodic strikes and union featherbedding \u2013 combined with corporate greed masquerading as maximizing shareholder value \u2013 helped lead to plant closures in mid-sized American cities. 10. When did this country, which once built the tallest buildings and longest bridges, forget how to build and allow itself to lose its global competitive advantage? When the cost of new construction increased exponentially thanks to lawyers and overregulation \u2013 and hyperpartisan divides made accomplishing great national goals feel politically impossible. 2020 is not a fair playing field. Here's how to even it out 11. When did we lose our confidence? America has always alternated between naive optimism and deep anxiety about the future, going back to the founding fathers. At the midpoint in the so-called \u201cAmerican Century\u201d \u2013 the 1970s \u2013 we were dealing with Watergate, economic malaise and urban decay. But today we\u2019re no longer the rising power on the geo-political stage. In response, we need to defend our diverse liberal democracy without apology and advance policies that unite our nation rather than dividing into warring tribes. 12. Why is it that teachers, doctors, lawyers, hair stylists and plumbers need a license to do their jobs \u2013 but the job of president requires no qualifications or experience? Because we\u2019ve overregulated small businesses while turning politics into a reality show \u2013 rather than an exercise in solving problems across partisan divides. 13. Is campaign finance reform an oxymoron as long as rich corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals can still make unlimited \u201cdark money\u201d contributions? Justice Kennedy may have intended his Citizens United decision to advance transparency, but it hasn\u2019t done that. It\u2019s a long road, but it may be time to pursue a constitutional amendment on election reform that will address big money in politics and level the playing field. 14. What happened to ideas that are good and sound rather than ideas that sound good but are unrealistic and infeasible? Populism is usually the opposite of pragmatism. And demagogues don\u2019t care about solving problems. Surprising results in new 2020 poll of NH Democrats 15. Does anyone remember the old saying about political candidates: \u201cBefore they tell you what they are going to do, ask them what they\u2019ve actually done.\u201d We\u2019re reaping what we\u2019ve sown with a culture where celebrities get famous for being famous rather than doing something well. 16. When did the greatest threat to America become other Americans, and when did diversity become our weakness rather than our strength? When we started advancing a more tribal version of identity politics that elevates our interesting differences over our common humanity. America always works best when we recognize that what unites us is far more important than what divides us. 17. When did some people begin thinking anti-Semitism is tolerable? Social media has helped amplify this ancient form of hate on the far right and the far left. 18. When did white supremacists become so emboldened that when they rally in our streets they no longer feel the need to cover their faces with hoods? When white identity politics went mainstream, with political leaders and partisan media echoing white nationalist talking points, unwittingly or not. 19. When did Puerto Rico become a foreign country? It\u2019s not, of course. But first ignoring and then politicizing the massive death toll from Hurricane Maria is a scandal that would not have been tolerated in the mainland United States. Could Bill Weld cost Trump the election? 20. When did the Democratic Party stop being a big-tent party? The Democratic Party is more evenly balanced between liberals and moderates than the Republican Party, but social media has made the far left louder. President Barack Obama is right about the dangers of a \u201ccircular firing squad\u201d that comes from ideological purity tests. 21. When did the political left become an enemy of the political left and the Democratic Party become a circular firing squad? See above. 22. When did we decide compromise was a bad word? When negative partisanship turned political opponents into personal enemies. It\u2019s hard to compromise with someone you hate \u2013 especially when members of Congress have lifetime employment unless they lose closed partisan primaries. 23. When did our people stop believing our government can function as a force for good? When bureaucratic overreach led people to applaud President Ronald Reagan\u2019s signature line, \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.\u201d Obama's 'circular firing squad' remarks may not persuade 2020 Democrats 24. When did people start running for office just so they could sell a book or to boost their business? See previous discussion of politics as celebrity rather than problem solving. 25. When did we lose respect for our history and choose not to learn from it? When we started seeing America\u2019s historic sins as irredeemable and simultaneously gutted civic education in our public schools. 26. When did we decide progressive posturing is more important than progress? See previous discussion of politics as celebrity rather than problem solving. 27. When did Democrats get so caught up in hating the rich that they forgot about helping the poor? Class warfare is a powerful political narcotic \u2013 and the rise of the super-rich after the great recession has created a fertile field for this resentment because our economy doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s working for all. 28. When did the struggling middle class begin believing that the Democratic Party had abandoned them and put its trust in the Republican Party? When pumping up culture war concerns gave the middle class an outlet for their frustration after feeling squeezed over decades. Dems' town hall was socialism on parade 29. When did it become acceptable that high-ranking government officials lie all the time? When hyperpartisanship and polarization led people to the embrace the insane idea of \u201cmy party, right or wrong.\u201d 30. If so many people are so frustrated, then why don\u2019t more people vote? A feedback loop from anger to alienation to apathy that threatens our democracy by allowing our politics to get hijacked by the extremes. 31. What happened to political courage? We started punishing political independence under the weight of the groupthink that comes from ideological polarization. 32. When did we lose our sense of humor? When taking offense and playing the victim card became celebrated as positions of moral authority. 33. When did we get so angry? I\u2019m going to go back all the way to the Civil War on this one. It\u2019s flowed downstream to our culture from there: North versus South, black versus white, left versus right. Diversity is America\u2019s greatest source of strength. But we need to transcend our tribalism to survive. 34. Where is the emergency exit for this theater of the absurd? Just maybe \u2013 the 2020 election.  35. Is it time that all Americans look ourselves in the mirror and ask if each of us is doing all we can to make a positive difference in our future? Hell, yes. Past time. Be the change you want to see.",

There was a time Rudy Giuliani was viewed as a crime-fighting US attorney and later as the valiant mayor of New York in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. But that Rudy is long gone. And all that remains is a man who will be best known for his work as a pathetic shill for Donald Trump. We saw another example of this on Sunday when Giuliani, appearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d in his capacity as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, gave a master class in deceit as he discussed Robert Mueller\u2019s report. First, Giuliani tried to make Americans think there\u2019s nothing wrong with a campaign for president of the United States accepting help from Russians. This came up in the discussion of the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting attended by Donald Trump Jr., then Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner in the hopes of obtaining \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton from Russian nationals. Mueller report is quite the page-turner In fact, the email to Trump Jr. that prompted that meeting promised not just helpful info from foreign nationals but from the Russian government itself, as it offered the Trump campaign, \u201csome official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father\u201d that was all \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d Giuliani defended the Trump campaign accepting help from Russians by stating, \u201cAny candidate in the whole world in America would take information,\u201d causing Tapper to ask, \u201cFrom a foreign source? From a hostile foreign source?\u201d Giuliani shot back, \u201cWho said it\u2019s even illegal?\u201d A few moments later when pressed again by Tapper on a presidential candidate getting help from Russians in the 2016 campaign, Giuliani responded adamantly, \u201cNo, no, there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking information from Russians! It depends on where it came from.\u201d Congress should initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump Giuliani then suggested the \u201cdirt\u201d the Russians offered to the Trump campaign would not be considered a \u201ccampaign contribution\u201d as defined by federal law.  In support, he argued that the Mueller report \u201csays we can\u2019t conclude that [it\u2019s a contribution] because the law is pretty much against that.\u201d Giuliani is incredibly wrong. First, it\u2019s election law 101 that a federal campaign cannot accept \u201ca contribution or donation of money or other thing of value\u201d from a foreign national. In fact, the Mueller report explains the rationale for this law, noting that \u201cthe United States has a compelling interest in limiting the participation of foreign citizens in activities of democratic self-government, and in thereby preventing foreign influence over the U.S. political process.\u201d Bharara: Giuliani defending Trump 'at all costs' And despite what Giuliani wants you to believe, Mueller did not conclude that the information offered by the Russians at the Trump Tower meeting wasn\u2019t a \u201ccampaign contribution.\u201d Rather, the report informed us that Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort were in fact provided \u201cdirt\u201d from the Russian nationals at the meeting in the way of info about the \u201cZiff brothers\u201d (Americans with business in Russia) who \u201cdonated their profits to the DNC or the Clinton campaign\u201d and had allegedly been involved in money laundering. Mueller wrote in reaction, \u201cThere are reasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a thing of value within the meaning\u201d of the federal law, meaning it could be considered a campaign contribution. However, Mueller did not charge Trump Jr. and the others in large part because there was insufficient evidence that they acted \u201cwillfully\u201d to violate federal laws. But apart from the legality, Giuliani\u2019s claim that there\u2019s \u201cnothing wrong with taking information from Russians\u201d is stunning, especially given that it was described in writing to Trump Jr. as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d  The response of the Trump campaign to such an offer should have been a resounding \u201cno\u201d followed by a call to the FBI. Instead, Trump Jr. responded by email less than 20 minutes later, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d It's not 1998 anymore. Democrats shouldn't be afraid of impeachment GOP Sen. Mitt Romney may have put it best in his statement Friday in response to the Trump campaign\u2019s apparent welcoming of help from Russia \u2013 both directly at the Trump Tower meeting and by the Trump campaign\u2019s documented use of the WikiLeaks emails that US intelligence agencies determined in October 2016 had been supplied to WikiLeaks by Russian government hackers. Romney wrote, that he was \u201cappalled\u201d that \u201cfellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia \u2014 including information that had been illegally obtained.\u201d He then added perhaps the most important comment, \u201cnone of them acted to inform American law enforcement.\u201d  But to Giuliani none of this wrong. And Trump apparently agrees since he has defended the Trump Tower meeting as the type of thing \u201cdone all the time in politics\u201d and he cited WikiLeaks over 100 times in the closing weeks of the campaign. While no one in the Trump campaign was charged with crimes for these actions, clearly the American people will have to decide if they agree with Giuliani that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong\u201d with Trump or any presidential campaign accepting assistance from Russians or other foreign nationals.  The hope is that Americans will overwhelmingly agree that the election for President of our nation should be free from foreign interference and instead be decided solely by Americans.",

Pramila Jayapal introduced a sweeping Medicare for All (MFA) bill on Wednesday (H.R. 1384), and the national debate on healthcare is bound to intensify through the 2020 election. Voters rank healthcare costs as their second most important priority, just after the economy. The political fate of MFA will likely depend on one key question: Will it reduce healthcare costs while preserving the freedom to choose health providers? If properly structured, MFA can do that: cut costs while improving choice. Medicare for All has come a long way since Sen. Bernie Sanders launched his 2016 presidential campaign on that theme, while fellow Democrats ran from the label. Sanders also faced the wrath of mainstream pundits like Paul Krugman, who described Sanders\u2019 healthcare plan as \u201csmoke and mirrors.\u201d Now, every major Democratic Party candidate endorses the label, (though they will certainly differ on the details) and Sanders could well become president in 2021 on the basis of his clear and persistent MFA advocacy. No doubt the debate will become heated, even shrill. We are talking about serious money, and the largest single sector of the American economy. Healthcare outlays in the United States account for nearly 18% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.  Profits are soaring in the private healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, both of which will fight fiercely against MFA. President Donald Trump has weighed in, declaring that Democrats are \u201cradical socialists who want to model America\u2019s economy after Venezuela.\u201d While former President Barack Obama spoke out in favor of a single-payer plan, he avoided the battle back in 2009 with the Affordable Care Act. And by making health insurance available to millions more Americans, the Affordable Care Act allowed private industry to raise prices given the increase in demand. The result is that Obamacare expanded overall coverage, and provided hugely popular guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions, while avoiding any decisive steps on cost containment. Democrats divided on new Medicare for all bill MFA picks up at that point. Real cost containment will be the critical issue that either makes or breaks each MFA proposal. Americans currently pay around $10,000 per person per year in health outlays, compared with roughly half that amount in other high-income countries such as Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, or Sweden. The reasons have been debated and studied in detail. Do Americans use more and better healthcare and therefore also pay more? Alas, no. Americans use roughly the same or less healthcare, but pay far more for health services including drugs, hospital stays, and medical procedures such as an MRI. A comparison of healthcare costs between the US and 10 other high-income countries allows a detailed comparison of the US and Canada, the most relevant peer country. According to the comparative data, the US spends 17.8% of GDP compared with Canada\u2019s 10.3%, amounting to $9,403 per person in the US compared with Canada\u2019s $4,641. All Canadians are covered by the healthcare system, while 10% of Americans lack public or private insurance coverage. Total pharmaceutical spending per person per year averages a whopping $1,443 in the US, compared with $613 in Canada. For example, the cholesterol drug Crestor is $86 per month in the US, and $32 in Canada; the arthritis drug Humira is $2,505 in the US, compared with $1,164 in Canada. Yet despite the much higher health spending per person, life expectancy in the US is 78.8 years, while in Canada it is 81.7 years. The article reaches the following conclusion:  \u201cThe United States spent approximately twice as much as other high-income countries on medical care, yet utilization rates in the United States were largely similar to those in other nations. Prices of labor and goods, including pharmaceuticals, and administrative costs appeared to be the major drivers of the difference in overall cost between the United States and other high-income countries.\u201d US private health insurance costs are out of sight. A typical US family of four covered by employer-based health insurance pays, in total, around $28,000 per year, taking into account the insurance premium paid for by the employer out of the worker\u2019s total compensation, the premium paid directly by the household, and all of the extra costs, including deductibles, co-payments, and out-of-network payments. The cost of healthcare is crippling working-class families, which may explain why it is at the top of the political agenda. What is the reason for these extraordinary costs in the US? Astronomical administrative costs, for one, are the result of countless and conflicting payments systems facing almost any patient who visits the doctor\u2019s office or hospital. One study in 2014 suggested that America\u2019s extraordinarily complicated multi-payer system leads to administrative costs for billing and insurance that are five times the costs of a simplified payment system such as Canada\u2019s. The second is the soaring monopoly profits and sky-high salaries along the entire private supply chain, from drug manufacturers to hospitals. The drug companies use their extraordinary monopoly power, whether due to patents or FDA approvals on out-of-patent drugs, to overcharge Americans with markups that are sometimes hundreds of times the production cost of the medicines. And private providers are a highly concentrated industry in most metropolitan areas. What is Medicare for all? With the mergers and closures of hospitals during the past 20 years, driven by for-profit medicine, this market power has soared, and so too have monopoly profits and healthcare costs facing consumers. Check out the CEO compensation of the big systems providers \u2013 $59 million for Aetna, and $44 million for Cigna in 2017 \u2013 or the salaries of the executives of the \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d hospitals in your area, often running several million dollars per year. For these reasons, healthcare costs in the US could be brought down by cutting three main areas: administrative costs, drug prices, and monopoly profits of private insurers, which in turn could be achieved by much lower reimbursement rates for medical services and more effective contracting. Recent studies (here and here) have shown prospective savings on national health expenditures resulting from Medicare for All would save trillions of dollars over 10 years. The Jayapal bill is smart on cost control. It would have Medicare negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to drive drug prices down, with the threat of removing the monopoly rights of patents if the drug company doesn\u2019t reach a reasonable agreement on prices. (Technically, the government would issue a compulsory license to competitors). It would have Medicare set an annual budget with hospital providers. This annual budget would focus on healthcare provision rather than wasted time and expenses on billing. It would not permit astronomical management salaries and super-profits. By wringing massive administrative costs, monopoly profits, and sky-high salaries out of the healthcare system, costs would be slashed, with the savings passed on to households. Remember, if the US paid the same share of income as our peer countries like Canada, the total saving would be on the order of 6% of GDP (from 18% today to around 10-12% as in the peer  countries).  With a GDP of around $62,000 per person in the US, 6% of GDP saving comes to a cost saving of around $3,700 per person, or around $14,800 for a family of four. House progressives unveil their Medicare for all bill Such savings wouldn\u2019t be achieved in full, or even in the early years. The pushback from industry against cost-cutting will be fierce. Moreover, the sheer inertia of existing costs, prices, budgets, and administrative systems cannot be doubted. But what can be said with confidence is that a well-designed MFA system would put the US on a path toward the reasonably priced healthcare systems of other comparable countries. Moreover, MFA would allow us to rethink healthcare delivery to take into account perhaps the biggest feasible benefit in health outcomes. America\u2019s current disease burdens often reflect unhealthy life circumstances \u2013 great stress, obesity-inducing diets, lack of exercise, drug dependence, and others. These are social ills turning into medical ills. A fairer, more balanced, health system based on good health rather than maximum profits would turn its attention to helping Americans live healthier lives.  Getting MFA through the political process won\u2019t be easy. The drug industry is one of America\u2019s top lobbies and campaign contributors, befitting a massive economic sector rolling in profits. Lobbying outlays in 2018 across the health sector are estimated at around $549 million and campaign funding in the 2018 election cycle at $255 million. The industry will be ready to fight an MFA plan with guns blazing, and trot out the usual arguments: stop socialized medicine, save personal choice, don\u2019t put yourself into the hands of government bureaucrats, don\u2019t let American become Venezuela \u2013 you name it. Yet Sanders and Jayapal and their many colleagues who have come on board now (including 106 co-sponsors) have the best chance to prevail in our modern history. Americans know that the healthcare system is rigged, and they will support a new system that convincingly shows the way to fair and reasonable healthcare costs.",

He\u2019s also the sponsor of a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. The views expressed in this commentary are the author\u2019s own. View more opinion at CNN. As a freshman member of Congress in 1997, one of my first speeches was about campaign finance reform. I warned that unregulated contributions were threatening to undermine our democracy, and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that our current campaign finance system is broken and needs to be fixed.\u201d Fast-forward to 2019, and things have only gotten worse. The Supreme Court\u2019s disastrous Citizens United decision in 2010 led to the rise of dark money groups (nonprofits that don\u2019t have to disclose their donors) and super PACs, political action committees that can accept unlimited contributions from individuals and corporations and spend it on behalf of candidates as long as they don\u2019t hand the money directly to them. It\u2019s notable that big corporate interests that donate generously to campaigns scored a huge tax break while middle class families were an afterthought in the 2017 Republican tax bill. Many Republicans also refused to act on climate change as extreme weather events ravaged communities and hurt our economy \u2013 just what the wealthy CEOs of dirty energy companies would want. While most climate scientists agree that global warming is caused by human activity, many members of Congress seem to listen to the fossil fuel industry that fund their campaigns instead of the facts. This is not the political system our founders envisioned. Of course it takes money to win elections. But the never-ending fundraising required to win an election takes too much of our attention away from the real work of serving our constituents and our country. It also makes individuals who are not well off or well-connected think twice before running for office. What's Mitch McConnell so afraid of? That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud that the new Democratic majority in the House proposed, as one of our first items of business, H.R. 1 \u2013 a sweeping elections and campaign reform bill that will remove the roadblocks many eligible Americans face on their way to the ballot box and help end the dominance of big money in politics. As the new chairman of the House Rules Committee, I look forward to bringing H.R. 1 to the floor for debate. But I\u2019ve also come to believe that I must do more than just support legislation to end the dominance of big money in politics. I need to change the way I run my own campaign fundraising. Over the past year, I\u2019ve been asked by my constituents whether I would stop taking corporate PAC money for my campaign. I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 at first, I was reluctant to consider such a big change. And It\u2019s important to state that I\u2019ve never let a donation from anyone influence my vote. If corporate PACs have tried to buy my vote by cutting me a campaign check, they\u2019ve ended up with a low return on their so-called investment. My voting record speaks for itself. Still, I was hesitant that I would put myself at a disadvantage against a well-funded opponent. Warren, Gillibrand and Sanders enter 2019 with cash edge But our country is in trouble. Our system is rigged to favor those at the top. And I believe the perception of corruption, even where it doesn\u2019t exist, must be addressed if we\u2019re going to restore faith in our government. My constituents want me to lead by example \u2013 and I will. I will no longer take corporate PAC money for my campaign. It\u2019s what the people of Massachusetts\u2019 2nd Congressional District want. And it\u2019s the right thing to do. I\u2019m proud to join dozens of other members of Congress who have made this decision, including my Massachusetts colleagues Elizabeth Warren, Ayanna Pressley and Lori Trahan. I\u2019m also grateful to the PAC End Citizens United, which is funded by grassroots supporters who hope to bring accountability and transparency back to Washington. Fundraisers, lobbyists and even some of my colleagues will surely tell me this is a terrible idea. They\u2019ll say the first rule of running for office is that you don\u2019t leave money on the table. As chairman of the Rules Committee \u2013 a committee that touches every piece of major legislation that comes to the House floor \u2013 I probably stand to lose a lot of campaign dollars. But when voters see economic policies that favor the rich, and inaction on climate change despite all the evidence of its impact, they\u2019re left wondering who politicians are working for. I don\u2019t want there to be any question about whom I\u2019m working for.  I think the public will reward this transparency. In November, citizens banded together to raise millions through small donations for candidates they believed in. Many of these $10 or $20 donations helped elect candidates who are now supporting H.R. 1. A government of the people and for the people should be funded by the people. Try as they may, Republicans will never succeed in convincing Americans that corporations are people. I\u2019m proud to take this step to ensure there is no question as to whom I\u2019m working for when I call the Rules Committee to order.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Joshua A. Douglas is a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law, voting rights, and constitutional law. He is the author of the forthcoming book, \u201cVote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting.\u201d Follow him @JoshuaADouglas. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN. Dear Sen. Mitch McConnell, As a professor of election law and voting rights at the University of Kentucky College of Law \u2013 your state\u2019s flagship institution and your alma mater \u2013 I invite you to come sit in on my election law class. Given your recent commentary on the subject, it might teach you a lot. For instance, you can learn about the true merits of H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a proposed law that Democrats in Congress have introduced to completely revamp our elections. Yes, it would include a provision to make Election Day a federal holiday as part of a suite of reforms to improve voter turnout. You mocked the holiday idea on the Senate floor this week (and in your recent Washington Post op-ed) while ignoring the comprehensive nature of the election reform package. You claim it\u2019s all part of a Democratic \u201cpower grab.\u201d Senator, are you really afraid of more eligible people going to the polls? The law includes many reforms \u2013 like automatic voter registration, felon re-enfranchisement, improved election security, and methods to make voting more convenient \u2013 that all amount to one thing: modernizing our election system for everyone. What\u2019s more, the law would enact numerous ideas that are already working in various states and localities throughout the country.  It is aimed at bringing more eligible voters into our political process. In fact, several Republican-controlled states have enacted some of these reforms. Take automatic voter registration, which is sweeping the nation. The idea is built on a simple premise: When the government already has information about voters, such as through the Department of Motor Vehicles office, it should simply add that information to the voter registration rolls. Voter registration is often an unnecessary barrier to voter participation, and states can eliminate that barrier by automatically registering valid voters in this way. 1.5 million ex-felons register to vote Far from a ruse that registers invalid voters (an assertion from your op-ed that the Washington Post later corrected), it would simply make it easier for more people to participate in our elections. In fact, automatic voter registration actually improves election integrity by helping states clean up their voter rolls. In 2016, Oregon was the first state to adopt automatic voter registration, and the idea has now spread to places like Alaska, Georgia and West Virginia \u2013 hardly Democratic strongholds. More than a dozen states have enacted automatic voter registration. Perhaps most impressively, this reform has led to improved voter turnout. Sen. McConnell, your commentary also attacked H.R. 1\u2019s plans for campaign finance reform and greater disclosure of who is spending money in campaigns. You claim that with the bill, Democrats would be \u201ccoming after free speech.\u201d Not so. Though you may oppose disclosure, the Supreme Court has declared that greater disclosure is the way to solve many of the problems of our campaign finance system and, in almost all circumstances, is perfectly legal under the First Amendment. As for publicly funded Democracy Vouchers that voters can give to candidates to fund their campaigns \u2013 used successfully in Seattle \u2013 the idea is to insert more money into our political system. But instead of having wealthy interests and groups that obscure their identity flood our airwaves, Democracy Vouchers, as a form of public financing, would allow everyday Americans to have a say in who receives campaign funds and democratize who has the financial ability to run for office. Kemp's office claims failed voting hack by Dems Ironically, you assert that \u201cAmericans [don\u2019t] see an urgent need for their tax dollars to be used to bankroll robocalls and attack ads,\u201d yet in heralding Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United and supporting the deregulation of campaign finance, you seem to have no problem with more money being inserted into our political system so long as it comes from wealthy interests who can obscure their identities. You also suggested it is a power grab to change the Federal Election Commission  from its current system of having three members appointed by each political party to having a 3-2 split. Right now the FEC is largely ineffectual, as it often deadlocks on a 3-3 vote (and right now it has only four members, the minimum for a quorum). Having an odd number of commissioners would help the agency actually enforce federal campaign finance laws. And the proposal would simply give an advantage to whichever party is currently in the White House, Republican or Democrat. Now, there may be better ways to reform the agency, and perhaps giving the party in power more control might help them entrench themselves if they set out rules for the next election \u2013 but that\u2019s true for both parties. H.R. 1 also includes numerous other proposals that, once again, already work well in various states and localities. Everyday Americans \u2013 such as the \u201cdemocracy champions\u201d I profile in my forthcoming book who have worked to improve our democracy through sustained advocacy for positive voting rights reforms \u2013 desperately want these enhancements to our election system. For instance, voters are clamoring for independent redistricting commissions, as the results of the five states to vote on the idea in 2018 showed: All five measures passed. That includes both red and blue states, like Utah and Michigan. Americans understand that voters should pick their politicians and not the other way around.  The proposed law would also restore the right to vote to felons who have completed their sentences, reversing a policy that harms minority voters in particular and strips millions of the core aspect of their citizenship. Plenty of states all across the country \u2013 including Florida, this past November through a ballot initiative \u2013 have eased their felon disenfranchisement rules. In addition to declaring Election Day a national holiday, which, to be sure, has its own complexities, such as potentially harming hourly employees, the law would also expand early voting and vote-by-mail/vote-at-home opportunities. The law would require a verified paper trail to enhance the security and integrity of our election system. It would improve access for voters with disabilities. It would impose more rigorous ethics requirements on our public officials. In sum, H.R. 1 would modernize America\u2019s election system for everyone. That should be the goal: let\u2019s make it easy for all eligible Americans to participate and allow the best candidates and best ideas \u2013 and not election rules \u2013 dictate the outcomes. Sen. McConnell, I promise that my election law class presents a fair, unbiased overview of our election system and the numerous laws and regulations involved. We can debate the merits of some of the proposals in H.R. 1, but one thing is clear: States and localities are already seeing success with many of these ideas, modernizing their elections and bringing more people into the political process. Isn\u2019t that something that all sides should want? Shouldn\u2019t everyone champion improved voter participation? I invite you to the classroom anytime you are available.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. The new year brought a new game and new players to Washington: a fresh crop of Democrats who have made Congress younger, more ethnically and religiously diverse (\u201ca huge win for Muslim feminism,\u201d wrote Rafia Zakaria), more female, more gay, more dance-happy and \u2013 they insist \u2013 more inclined to get things done on behalf of women, working people, immigrants and the environment. The Democrats, who now control the House and all of its investigative resources, may be the greatest challenge yet for President Donald Trump, who presides over a government that is partly shut down and an administration full of strife \u2013 and already facing multiple investigations. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether Trump has grasped the full meaning of the new environment in Washington,\u201d Errol Louis pointed out. Impeachment or not, newly elected Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already \u201clet President Trump know that that his days of dominating the national political agenda with bluff, bluster and bullsh** have come to an end.\u201d And though Pelosi didn\u2019t sign on to it, newly sworn-in Rep. Rashida Tlaib captured the mood of many progressives when she proclaimed on Thursday \u201cwe\u2019re going to impeach the motherf****r.\u201d Her F-bomb made some Republican heads explode and upset some Democrats, but when pressed to make nice and apologize, Tlaib declined. \u201cDisgraceful,\u201d Trump complained. (Holly Figueroa O\u2019Reilly countered on Twitter with a highlight reel of the President\u2019s expletives.) Four billion miles away, a NASA robotic probe was taking New Years\u2019 day pictures of the most distant celestial body any man-made object has ever reached. Happy New Year! David Gergen and James Piltch wrote that there\u2019s no denying Pelosi\u2019s central role \u201cin an unfolding drama\u201d that turns on one big question: \u201cWhether the flood of new women into Congress this year can begin the renewal of the badly broken political system that is increasingly holding back the country.\u201d One problem facing Pelosi, warned Russell Berman and Elaine Godfrey in the Atlantic: The shutdown \u201ccould sap much of the spotlight from the Democrats\u2019 policy agenda, muddling their opportunity to drive the national debate, at least on their own terms.\u201d Even after that, Pelosi won\u2019t exactly be able to skate, wrote Scott Jennings. He recalled how the GOP\u2019s just-powerful-enough Freedom Caucus tormented her predecessors John Boehner and Paul Ryan, denying the ruling party the votes to pass a farm bill, raise the debt limit or fund the Homeland Security Department.  Pelosi has it worse with her \u201cthree-way split\u201d among a dwindling conservative wing, New Democrats\u2026and progressives, who smell impeachment. And if that happens, it \u201ccould easily backfire and cost her party dearly in 2020,\u201d Jennings said. New York\u2019s freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez continues to drive her critics on the right crazy. How crazy? Someone tweeted out a dance video she made in college eight years ago, apparently hoping to humiliate her (\u201cHere is America\u2019s favorite commie know-it-all\u2026\u201d). It went viral Wednesday, and tons of people found it \u2026 delightful.  \u201cWell, @AOC is officially done. She\u2019ll never recover from the world seeing her\u2026 (watches video) \u2026dancing adorably and having fun with her friends\u2026?\u201d tweeted Patton Oswalt. Then Ocasio-Cortez clapped back with a cheerful video of her dancing outside her new congressional office. \u201cI hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous,\u201d she tweeted. Virginia Heffernan, in the Los Angeles Times, welcomed the new dynamic that has women like Ocasio-Cortez using social media to run rings around terrified men. \u201cBy turning up the volume on the Republicans\u2019 terrified sexism, as a digital native does best, she\u2019s made quick work of her haters.\u201d Republicans are making a mistake here, argued Julian Zelizer. \u201cBy vilifying Ocasio-Cortez, the GOP is helping to turn her into one of the political superstars of 2019. They are giving her more time in the spotlight and unifying Democrats around someone who does come from a left-of-center perspective,\u201d and is pushing, for example, a Green New Deal. The Democratic senator from Massachusetts announced via video that she was forming an exploratory committee for the presidency. \u201cA brilliant beginning,\u201d Jill Filipovic cheered. \u201cWarren has done us all an immense favor\u201d by setting up the race and \u201cinsisting it focuses on class and race, economic inequality and gender inequality.\u201d In the Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin warned that Warren is a \u201cless formidable candidate than she was a year ago.\u201d She \u201cat times hectors rather than inspires, sounding more like an activist/law professor than a compelling leader,\u201d and flubbed her DNA-test response to Trump\u2019s \u201cPocahantas\u201d jabs, offending Democrats and others, Rubin wrote.  David Axelrod served in the White House when Warren, as a House counsel, \u201cwas pummeling Treasury officials over treatment of Wall Street executives who were culpable in the financial crisis.\u201d Some may find her \u201cedgy and dogmatic vision of capitalism\u201d off-putting, he wrote. But \u201cthe cause of the embattled middle class is a natural one\u201d for her, a janitor\u2019s daughter lifted by her intelligence and tenacity \u201cfrom modest beginnings to this moment. These are indispensable qualities any winning candidate for president of the United States must own.\u201d Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders, faced allegations that there was sexism and harassment in his 2016 campaign. Sally Kohn found his apology on Anderson Cooper\u2019s show, in which he cited his campaign\u2019s \u201cgold standard\u201d for principles, defensive and totally inadequate. \u201cThe gold standard is taking responsibility for the culture you as a leader create and doing everything in your power, rhetorically and otherwise, to root out toxicity within it.\u201d How do you stand it? asked Rob Crilly, who recently tried to get his bum knee fixed in America and found dealing with insurers and doctors\u2019 offices and New York\u2019s Obamacare exchange like entering a maze from Kafka. \u201cWhat no one had briefed me on was the sheer bewildering complexity of it all,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo, what is the solution? Medicare for all, which progressives are pushing, sounds like a possibility. Maybe it could work, like it does in Britain.\u201d Memory is a slippery thing. CNN\u2019s Michael Smerconish thought he recalled vividly seeing a 1987 letter from Richard Nixon to Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo right after Rizzo lost re-election. Nixon wrote: \u201cDear Frank: I have learned that when you win you hear from everybody; when you lose you hear from your friends. Count me in the latter category.\u201d Or did he? Smerconish tried to get the letter as a memento after Rizzo\u2019s widow died. What he learned took him down a rabbit hole of recollection \u2014 and Nixonian etiquette. It\u2019s a good yarn. A TV station in Jacksonville, Florida, drew complaints after it aired video of a returning sailor kissing his husband at dockside \u2014 a re-enactment of Alfred Eisenstaedt\u2019s Times Square photo from V-J Day in 1945. The reaction troubled Danielle Campoamor, who lamented our \u201ccollective ability to overlook the facts.\u201d She noted that the Eisenstaedt photo might well have documented a sexual assault (the nurse in the photo, according to some reports, did not know the sailor who grabbed her). \u201cIf only people were outraged over a picture of a man forcibly kissing a woman and not a husband lovingly kissing his husband.\u201d Just 33 minutes after puny earthlings cheered the dawning of a new year (ET) this week, something actually incredible happened deep in outer space: NASA\u2019s New Horizon probe zoomed at 32,000 mph by Ultima Thule, a big frozen, snowman-shaped object left over from the primordial solar system, snapping pictures the whole time. It is \u201cthe most distant astronomical body ever investigated,\u201d marveled Don Lincoln, a senior physicist at FermiLab. Brian May \u2014 the guitarist for Queen and an astrophysicist \u2013 even wrote a song about it. Call it a triumph of robotics, which have let humans slip \u201cthe shackles of the inner solar system and, as the famed television show said, gone where no one has gone before,\u201d said Lincoln. \u201cThe impulse to explore seems to be hardwired in what it means to be human\u2026With space, we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d He was Super Dave, the deadpan and hilarious fake stuntman who would show up in his jumpsuit on Letterman or Conan every so often, and he was Marty Funkhouser on \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201d And to comedian Gilbert Gottfried, Bob Einstein \u2014 who died Wednesday \u2014 was one of the funniest guys he\u2019d ever hosted on his podcast. Einstein, whose TV-writing roots went back to the Smothers Brothers show, \u201cwas a complete cynic and a total wiseass\u2026totally certain and completely confused at the same time. Even at his most forceful and energetic, he came across looking and sounding like a guy you woke up at three o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d wrote Gottfried. \u201cI\u2019m sad to say farewell.\u201d",

Smerconish is host of \u201cSmerconish,\u201d on CNN Saturdays at 9 a.m. ET and of \u201cThe Michael Smerconish Program\u201d on SiriusXM Channel 124, Sunday columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer and an author. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion pieces at CNN. It happened 31 years ago, but I remember the conversation like it was yesterday. I sat on one side of the oval kitchen table inside the back door of 8919 Crefeld Street, Philadelphia, home of Frank and Carmella Rizzo. We were just days removed from the bruising 1987 mayoral general election, a crushing defeat for Rizzo at the hands of W. Wilson Goode, and emotions were still raw. I was then visiting the house on a daily basis, akin to sitting shiva. Except to walk his dog, which we often did together, the burly former mayor did not leave his home. Instead, he would sit with his back to a bay window next to a sill. On it sat a yellow push button phone with several lines that often illuminated. Friends and supporters were still calling with election condolences. Mrs. Rizzo would dutifully fill our coffee cups and then leave the two of us alone. I was a 25-year-old recent law school graduate who had just served as political director of the ill-fated campaign and was about to learn that I\u2019d passed the bar in the midst of the election. I was unmarried, unemployed and unsure of my future. The only certainty was my continued devotion to Frank Rizzo, and even in defeat there was nowhere I would rather have been. Rizzo was then 47 years my senior, a political legend, albeit controversial, who had famously risen from patrolman to police commissioner, and then been twice elected mayor of what was the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city. Rizzo had governed as a Democrat but after losing to Goode in a 1983 Democratic primary, had switched to the GOP so as to ensure their 1987 rematch would be waged in a general election. To working-class whites, he was a protector of their values. To urban blacks, he was perceived as insensitive, or worse. One day, with just the two of us present, the mayor told me he had something special to share.  A letter. Handwritten.  Personal. From his friend, former President Richard Nixon. Rizzo retrieved the letter from a nearby room and brought it to the kitchen table and handed it to me in a deliberate way that let me know he regarded it as something of great value. I read the words to myself and was touched by them, so much so that I have remembered and quoted them often in the intervening years. \u201cWhen you win you hear from everyone; when you lose you hear from your friends. Count me in the latter category.\u201d Months after Rizzo showed me the letter, we had a very public falling out over which of the two of us would be the chairman of the 1988 George H.W. Bush presidential campaign in Philadelphia. The split came just after Rizzo agreed to accompany me to a private dinner at the Union League of Philadelphia where \u2013 ironically \u2013 President Nixon would be speaking. This would have been Rizzo\u2019s first public appearance since the election loss. But just days in advance of the dinner, after our seating at Nixon\u2019s table had been confirmed, Rizzo told me on the phone that he would not attend, saying \u201cf\u2013k you and your Nixon dinner\u201d before hanging up. Not only didn\u2019t we go to the Nixon dinner, we didn\u2019t speak for three years, and only repaired our relationship just before his passing. Frank Rizzo died on July 16, 1991. The morning that he passed, his office called with word that he wanted to see me.  I\u2019d been recently appointed to a position in the Bush administration (41 had been elected without either of us serving as his campaign chair). Rizzo was himself running again for mayor and had recently won an improbable victory in a three-way Republican primary. He was now about to face Democrat Ed Rendell in the general election. Early in the afternoon, just moments before I arrived for my appointment at his office at 1528 Walnut Street, he collapsed. I learned this news when entering the office suite and together with a friend and campaign aide, Bob Kutler, we greeted the paramedics at street level and then escorted them on the elevator. When we told them who they were about to treat, they were initially disbelieving. Carmella Rizzo would live another 27 years before finally passing at age 101 in July 2018. Soon afterward, the Rizzo children, Frank Jr. and Joanna, decided to sell all the contents of 8919 Crefeld Street to prepare for a sale of the home itself. Advance word of the three-day event was itself a big, local news story. The first day of the sale was Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. I could not attend because I was preparing for my Saturday morning CNN program. One friend, William F. McLaughlin, Jr., was among the first through the door and gave me several colorful accounts of the scene. Warrior for justice: Why fugitives would surrender to Chuck Stone He himself acquired a special sign referencing the home Rizzo controversially built but never moved into on Summit Lane in Roxborough, four American flags and a cigar ashtray that McLaughlin wanted me to have. The sale attracted hundreds of buyers and curiosity-seekers. People paid between $1,250 and $1,500 for Rizzo police billy clubs.  Someone spent $5,000 for one of his single-digit license plates. A Rolodex commanded $2,500. With my middle son, Wilson, I visited on day two, mostly to take one last look at the interior of the house, the kitchen in particular. The d\u00e9cor was just as I remembered, unchanged from three decades prior. The table where we\u2019d sat so many times was itself for sale for $750. (I\u2019d have bought it out of a sense of nostalgia, only I knew the reaction I\u2019d have gotten at my own home.) How did Watergate unfold? I nevertheless enjoyed reminiscing with Frank Rizzo Jr., who was watching with astonishment as hordes of people continued to traipse through his family home. Another friend was present while I was there, veteran criminal defense attorney William J. Brennan, jealously guarding an SUV full of memorabilia he\u2019d purchased, including a Rizzo fedora and walking stick, the former of which he told me he hoped Rizzo was wearing during the famous \u201ccrumb bum\u201d exchange with television reporter Stan Bohrman. And when the sale ended, another 20 boxes of ephemera were reportedly found in the attic, including Rizzo\u2019s passports and more Rolodexes. By the time I got to Crefeld Street that Saturday, the most prized items had already been sold. I learned that the first few people in the door on the first day of the sale acquired some special things, including signed photographs sent to Rizzo by  J. Edgar Hoover and Nixon, and a handwritten letter from Nixon to Rizzo. The text of the letter was exactly as I recalled. \u201cDear Frank: I have learned that when you win you hear from everybody; when you lose you hear from your friends. Count me in the latter category. You fought a great fight against heavy odds. The pollsters - with their landslide predictions \u2013 hurt you badly. You have many good years left.  Keep the faith- Sincerely, RN\u201d The letter I remembered so well and had quoted so often had been sold to one of the first attendees of the estate sale for $2,000. I was disappointed and wanted to own it. Soon after the sale ended, I contacted John Romani from the auction firm, Sales by Helen, to ask if he would put me in contact with the purchaser. He graciously agreed. Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Bentham, a retired Philadelphia homicide detective-turned-private investigator (who also once investigated the famous murder of Carol Neulander on behalf of Camden County, New Jersey, which resulted in the conviction of her husband, Fred) was that lucky person. Bentham had a great personal affinity for Rizzo stemming from his own days as a cop. He\u2019d been present when the mayor famously broke his hip at the 1975 Atlantic-Richfield oil refinery fire and had helped load the mayor onto a stretcher that night. Bentham had acquired a number of items at the sale besides the Nixon letter, including a spectacular coffee table specially made for Rizzo by inmates serving life terms at Graterford Prison. Bentham readily took my call and after a few days of deliberation, said he was willing to sell the Nixon letter to me for what he\u2019d paid, due to my personal connection with the artifact. There was just one problem: The letter was dated May 18, 1983.  That was one day after Rizzo lost a Democratic primary to W. Wilson Goode \u2013 four years before the 1987 race on which I worked.  The corresponding 20- cent stamped envelope bore the date May 19, 1983, which confirmed that Nixon sent this letter to Rizzo immediately after Rizzo lost the primary in 1983, not after the general election loss in 1987. That didn\u2019t jibe with my memory. In 1983, I was an undergraduate at Lehigh University. And although that spring I did drive to Philadelphia to attend Rizzo\u2019s final, election eve rally outside his childhood home at Rosewood and Ritner Streets in South Philadelphia, I had nothing formal to do with that campaign and was certainly not in his house in the days immediately after. Trump could learn a hard lesson from Nixon The date discrepancy hit me hard and made me seriously question my memory. If asked, I\u2019d have given sworn testimony as to the events as I\u2019ve described. I\u2019ve always told the same version of the story and consistently quoted the letter verbatim. As one who himself lost an election, Nixon\u2019s words resonated with me. I did not embellish that in a poignant moment with just the two of us present in his kitchen in 1987, Frank Rizzo showed me a handwritten letter he\u2019d recently received from Richard Nixon. But the date on the letter was at odds with my recollection. If this event didn\u2019t occur as I recalled, what else in my memory and repertoire of well -worn stories was inaccurate? There is no chance that Rizzo misrepresented the date of the letter when showing it to me in 1987. That\u2019s not who he was and besides, the date is plainly evident in the upper right-hand corner of the letter, which I would have seen. So I am left with two possibilities: 1) that I misremembered critical facts \u2013 namely that in 1987, Rizzo showed me an \u201cold\u201d letter from Nixon dated 1983; or 2) there was a second, similar, 1987 version of the 1983 letter. Could it be that Nixon\u2019s standard patter in consoling friends who lost elections was to tell them \u201cwhen you win you hear from everybody; when you lose you hear from your friends.\u201d I decided to investigate that possibility. Two heads of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California (where I have visited) have been guests on my SiriusXM radio program. The most recent was historian Tim Naftali, who is now teaching at NYU. By email, I shared with him the short version of this story and asked whether he knew if Nixon used standard verbiage to friends who lost elections. His reply: \u201cWhat a fun question\u2026 As you know he was a big fan of Rizzo\u2019s, so it is also plausible that he wrote him twice. Moreover Nixon had his favorite cliches\u2013\u201ckeep the faith\u201d\u2013so I would not doubt he wrote Rizzo duplicative handwritten messages.\u201d Now knowing that Nixon was prone to using favorite clich\u00e9s, I next wrote to Michael Ellzey, the current director of the Nixon library and museum. He immediately promised to have his \u201ccrack research team to weigh in.\u201d Soon thereafter, I heard from Jason Schultz, the supervisory archivist: Michael, Through an internet search I was able to find a number of articles which not only mentioned such language from Richard Nixon, but one which also quotes him as saying, \u201cI have often said that when you win, you hear from everyone \u2013 when you lose, you hear from your friends.\u201d The examples below show that contacting the loser in political races was often on his mind. \u201cLet me tell you,\u201d Nixon continues, \u201cI\u2019ve lost a few and you don\u2019t get many calls when you lose.\u201d \u201cIn politics, you find that when you win, you hear from everyone; when you lose, you hear from your friends.\u201d \u201cAnd that brings me to a personal note referring to everybody here. I have had, as you know, some political ups and downs during my 27 years in politics, and I have known times when I wondered if I had very many friends. And every man or woman who has been in politics knows that when you win, they are all your friends, and when you lose, it is pretty had to find them, except when you lose and they are still there, they are the real friends.\u201d So it was Nixon\u2019s custom to say to others what he said to Rizzo in the 1983 handwritten letter. Did he write it again, in 1987? Was there a second letter also handwritten by Nixon, similarly saying, \u201cWhen you win you hear from everyone\u2026.\u201d?  Both John Romani and Frank Rizzo Jr. assured me they had no knowledge of a handwritten, 1987 letter from Nixon to Rizzo.  But nor do they have a typewritten letter after the 1987 election and you\u2019d think it likely that there was some kind of communication from Nixon after Rizzo\u2019s general-election loss.  After all, Nixon was still alive (he didn\u2019t pass until 1994) and when Rizzo died in 1991, Nixon sent Mrs. Rizzo a typed condolence letter. I know. I bought it from Romani. It was among the items discovered after the estate sale. And I also acquired condolence letters sent to Mrs. Rizzo from President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle. As for the 1983 letter, I bought that, too, from Chuck Bentham, who graciously sold it to me for what he paid, asking only that I give him first option to buy it back should I ever decide to sell. (I readily agreed, but asked for a similar pledge concerning his Graterford coffee table.)  No matter how fallible my memory might be, nor the possibility that another letter was sent, I can\u2019t imagine anyone else will have my affinity for the document.",

She is a columnist for Dawn newspaper in Pakistan and The Baffler. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. As a Muslim-American woman living in what feels like, based on growing hate crimes and bigoted political rhetoric, an increasingly Islamophobic America, I get few chances to feel victorious and hopeful. But this Thursday promises just that. On January 3, 2019, not one but two Muslim American women will be sworn into Congress. Taking the oath on a Quran that belonged to Thomas Jefferson, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib will become the first Muslim-American women to serve in the House of Representatives. Their swearing in will be a historic milestone for the country, but it will be so much more than that for me. A black Somali-American woman who wears a headscarf and pokes fun at Islamophobes on Twitter, Omar crushes stereotypes of what a Muslim woman in a headscarf represents. As an unveiled Muslim American woman, Rashida Tlaib \u2013 who will wear a Palestinian gown to her swearing in \u2013 also dismantles the myth that all \u201creal\u201d Muslim women wear the headscarf. In the faces and politics of the two women, I see a welcome challenge to Muslim orthodoxy and American stereotypes, and a huge win for Muslim feminism. She'll be one of the first Muslim women in Congress At different times in my life, I have worn and not worn a headscarf, thus straddling one of the most polemical debates within Islam. Literal and decontextualized translations of the Quran, most of them produced by men, have long held that the \u201chijab,\u201d or headscarf, is a requirement for all Muslim women. Many Muslim feminists, such as Fatima MernissI, have unraveled this premise by contextualizing the verses used to insist on the prescription, and exposing the varied meanings of the word \u201chijab.\u201d In real life, this complicated issue often prompts heated debates among Muslim women who fall on either side of the debate. In high school, when I wore the headscarf, I hotly insisted on its necessity as an article of faith. A decade later, I argued, as Mernissi does, that the women who wore it were inadequately feminist, living out a patriarchal prescription that had been read into the Quran. I won many arguments, but I lost even more friends. Today, after writing a book on the subject, I realize how wrong I was in both cases, in insisting that everyone or no one should choose the veil. This realization is precisely why I feel so triumphant about Omar and Tlaib\u2019s elections. With both a veiled and unveiled woman representing the face of American Islam in the US Congress, the garment can finally emerge as a facet of individual choice available to Muslim women, rather than a divine or even a political mandate. In this way, the emergence of Omar and Tlaib, two outspoken Muslim American women (Tlaib literally disrupted a Trump rally in 2016) who respect each other\u2019s choices and stand together, bridges a schism that has divided Muslim women all over the world. Rashida Tlaib will wear a Palestinian gown as she's sworn into Congress In a riven America, however, the task of bridging rifts will be harder. Even before the Trump era ushered in increased marginalization and targeting of Muslims, many Americans viewed Islam with suspicion. Since 9/11, the equation of \u201cMuslim\u201d with \u201cterrorist\u201d has become routine, rarely even remarked upon. In this milieu, Muslim women who wear the headscarf have become hyper-visible, too often walking targets for ignorance and hate. A teachers\u2019 pulling a student\u2019s headscarf in Virginia, policemen forcing its removal in New York, a man pulling off a woman\u2019s headscarf during a flight, a woman threatened on a public bus and many similarly alarming incidents have occurred and will likely recur. The election of Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib will not magically eliminate the prejudice and fear behind these attacks, but it will provide more Americans with Muslim American public figures who challenge their stereotypes and misplaced hatreds. The twin rookie congresswomen, with their very existence, poke holes at the idea that only unveiled Muslim American women are suitably assimilated (read: safe) or that all veiled ladies are pathetically submissive or latent terrorists. Stereotypes die when those whose stories contradict them become the focus of public attention. This January 3 will be the beginning of this journey for both Americans and for veiled and unveiled Muslim women all around the world. In Ilhan Omar, they will see a black woman who wears a headscarf and who is a committed progressive. In Rashida Tlaib, they will see a brown woman who, like most Muslim-American women, chooses not wear a headscarf but remains committed to her faith and to advancing the cause of the working-class families like her own.  In both Omar and Tlaib lives a vision of a new American heroine, of American exceptionalism realized in the trajectory of two women, brown and black, veiled and unveiled, Muslim and American. Ultimately, it is this very \u201conly in America\u201d quality of these two congresswomen \u2013 one who has risen from her refugee camp origins and the other who has overcome a childhood of hardship and penury \u2013 that will likely endear them to Americans. This Thursday, after what seems too long, Muslim Americans and all Americans can be proud of a country that has made these two women possible.",

He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.com. For those who had somehow escaped this jarring reality, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren offered a little reminder on New Year\u2019s Eve that Campaign 2020 is upon us. Strike up the band! And cue the pundits, who wasted little time assessing her chances and the meaning of her early announcement.  (Yes, it was for an exploratory committee, but come on, folks! Watch the video. She\u2019s in!) Is Warren the new and improved Bernie Sanders, a woman AND a populist, who could combine these robust bases to ride to the nomination? Or is she too strident? Too stilted?  Too old?  Too reactive, as reflected by the ill-conceived video she released shortly before the midterm elections to try to quell doubts about her claim to Native American  ancestry?  All she seemed to accomplish was to give President Donald Trump another opportunity to gleefully trot out his tiresome Pocahontas routine yet again. Anyone who makes confident predictions today about the next presidential election clearly didn\u2019t learn from the last.  Humility is in order, particularly in handicapping a field already as long as the holiday lines at Disney World. Trump slams Warren as she explores 2020 bid With that disclaimer, let me dive headlong into the pundit pool and say that Warren will be a major player among the cavalcade of Democrats now queuing up. We live in times of revolutionary change.  Technology and globalization have created enormous opportunity for some, and disruption and stagnation for many.   Decades of policies in Washington, pushed by an army of special interest lobbyists, have accelerated these trends. This is a case Warren has been making since long before she left Harvard and entered public life. Her pioneering book, \u201cThe Two Income Trap,\u201d about the mounting economic pressure on working families, was required reading among Democrats and progressive politicians in the mid-2000s. If biography is prologue, the cause of the embattled middle class is a natural one for Warren. Her hardscrabble upbringing in rural Oklahoma and struggle as a young single mother to raise her children and pursue an education are powerful validators. I served in the White House when Warren, then a special House counsel, was pummeling treasury officials over treatment of Wall Street executives who were culpable in the financial crisis.  I saw her inaugurate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government watchdog that saved billions for consumers before the Trump administration relegated it to the sidelines. Elizabeth Warren's brilliant beginning She has offered a series of serious ideas about government and Wall Street reform, and is one of the most incisive members of the Senate. Warren also has laid the groundwork for her candidacy more assiduously than most, running an extensive, sophisticated operation in 2018 to help Democratic candidates around the country, even as she ran for re-election to the Senate. She raised tens of millions for these dual operations and still has $12 million in the bank. As Sanders proved on 2016, there is an audience for the hard-edged populism Warren loudly proclaimed in her announcement video.  Many Americans are fed up with the hegemony of Wall Street and the stranglehold of lobbyists, a trend made worse by Trump, despite his iconic campaign pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d The 2018 elections demonstrated the powerful appeal of women on the ballot, both in Democratic primaries and general elections. And the nation\u2019s first primary will take place in New Hampshire, which shares the Boston media market with Massachusetts. Warren to make first Iowa trip this weekend All this makes Warren a contender. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll win.  If Sanders or other populists \u2013 Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jeff Merkley of Oregon \u2013 enter the race, her climb becomes steeper.  There will be other women, all younger than Warren, who is nearing 70.  There will be candidates of color, better positioned to compete in the crucial state of South Carolina and beyond. Democrats may, ultimately, choose a candidate with a more uplifting and unifying message in response to a relentlessly divisive President, or a candidate with a less edgy and dogmatic vision of capitalism than Warren\u2019s. Some fear Warren could drive away the suburban voters who delivered Democrats the House in 2018. And, despite an extraordinary personal story and genuine, long-standing commitment to her principles, Warren\u2019s presentation sometimes can seem wooden and inauthentic. Still, Warren is powerfully intelligent, and indefatigable in pursuit of her goals \u2013 the very traits that helped lift the janitor\u2019s daughter from modest beginnings to this moment. These are indispensable qualities any winning candidate for president of the United States must own. This commentary was updated from an earlier version.",

Here\u2019s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) That Arctic winter weather we told you about is already wreaking havoc in some parts of the US. About 70% of the country will experience record-breaking temperatures.\u00a0Places from Chicago to parts of Tennessee are already being buried under unseasonable amounts of snow, and if you have travel plans in the areas affected, you may want to think twice.\u00a0More than 1200 flights were canceled Monday at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport,\u00a0and an America Eagle flight slid off the runway \u2013 with no injuries \u2013 due to icy conditions.\u00a0Snow and ice will continue to create dangerous travel conditions in the Plains, Midwest and Northeast today. All of that cold air is due to hit the south today as well. If you live in places like Georgia and even Florida, a fairly seasonable start to the day could end with teeth-chattering temperatures. Bolivia\u2019s former president Evo Morales is leaving the country, but he has sworn that he will \u201creturn with more strength and energy.\u201d Morales accepted an offer of political asylum from Mexico after stepping down yesterday amid nationwide protests regarding the outcome of the Bolivian general election in October.\u00a0Morales has described the situation as a \u201ccoup\u201d \u2013 a charge echoed by his allies in South America. Violent clashes continued to pepper the country yesterday after Morales\u2019 resignation, and the Bolivian Armed Forces announced they will carry out joint operations with\u00a0police to\u00a0\u201cavoid blood and grief.\u201d A new proposal by the\u00a0Environment Protection Agency could seriously complicate the creation\u00a0of new clean air and water regulations. According to The New York Times, the EPA\u00a0plans to limit the scientific research that the government can use to form public health regulations\u00a0and would require scientists to disclose their raw data\u00a0for the agency to consider a study\u2019s conclusions. It would also apply\u00a0retroactively, which would mean halting the further use of studies already cited by the EPA that don\u2019t comply with the new proposal. One of the complicating\u00a0issues with this reported\u00a0proposal is that academic studies used in public health policies\u00a0often rely on confidentiality agreements because of personal health disclosures. A chemical attack in China injured 51 children and three teachers\u00a0on Monday afternoon.\u00a0According to a state-run news agency, a 23-year-old suspect climbed into the school in Kaiyuan city, Yunnan province, and sprayed a corrosive chemical known as caustic soda. He was detained about an hour after the attack. Local police said he allegedly sprayed the chemical as an act of revenge on society. The incident continues a worrying series of school attacks in the country. In October of 2018, a woman attacked a kindergarten class with a knife and injured at least 14 students. Earlier that year, a man stabbed and killed nine students at a middle school. In 2017, 11 kindergarten students were injured\u00a0in another knife attack.\u00a0\\ A Trump-appointed federal judge\u00a0decided Monday that President Trump can\u2019t currently sue New York state officials in a Washington, DC, court\u00a0to stop the release of his tax returns to Congress. The ruling, decided by Judge Carl Nichols,\u00a0is the latest call in a near-constant tug-of-war between the President and House Democrats who want to obtain his financial records.\u00a0Courts have sided with the House multiple times in similar cases where its committees have subpoenaed Trump\u2019s financial records, but here\u2019s the rub: Trump is still appealing those rulings, so the subpoenas are still on hold. The ruling says Trump could file a similar lawsuit with another court, such as in New York state, or later\u00a0to prevent the request from Congress.

            "article_content": "Ready to hop into those American flag bikinis or trunks, grab a dog off the grill and enjoy a sunny July 4 at the pool? Don\u2019t you dare! In these days of high sensitivity regarding all matters flag, when folks can boycott a company they\u2019ve already boycotted over a decision not to release a line of shoes, it\u2019s important you know all the rules and etiquette surrounding Old Glory. For example, \u201cThe flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing.\u201d Yup, that\u2019s in the US Code, the collection of federal statutes governing the country. In fact, those Betsy Ross Nikes weren\u2019t exactly in line with flag decorum to begin with, not that anyone cared before Colin Kaepernick got involved. Here\u2019s a look at what the US Code says about the stars and stripes: While it\u2019s true that one man\u2019s disrespect for the flag is another man\u2019s protesting police violence against African-Americans, the US Code lays out specific examples of what it considers discourteous, including displaying a flag upside down (except during times of dire distress or danger), letting it touch the ground or water and carrying it flat or horizontally, Also \u2013 bikini wearers and Nike execs, take note \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be used as apparel, bedding or drapery. Also, it\u2019s gauche to use it as a costume or uniform. Whoops, America. Being respectful also means never flying it in a manner where it could be soiled or damaged, using it to cover a ceiling (looking at you, American frat houses) or employing it as a receptacle to carry things. Lastly, it should never be \u201cfestooned.\u201d You can figure that out on your own. It\u2019s just fun to say festooned. This one car dealerships the nation over have ignored for years, but you can\u2019t use the flag for any advertising purpose. You specifically cannot display a flag bearing a \u201cword, figure, mark, picture, design, drawing, or any advertisement.\u201d You also cannot sell or give away merchandise \u201cupon which shall have been printed, painted, attached, or otherwise placed a representation of any such flag.\u201d If you do it in Washington D.C., you could be fined $100 and thrown in jail for a month. Then, there are few oddly pointed rules about printing or embroidering the flag on cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes or anything you intend to throw away. A little calculus to consider, depending on when, where and how you\u2019re flying the nation\u2019s banner: Aside from Texas v. Johnson, wherein the Supreme Court ruled that burning the flag was protected speech, the US Code says burning is an honorable way to bid the flag a proper farewell: \u201cThe flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.\u201d It\u2019s customary to display the flag from sun up to sundown on a stationary flagpole. If you\u2019re a super patriot and want to show her off 24-7, be sure to cast a light on her at night. \u201cThe flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously,\u201d and if the weather is nasty, go ahead and keep \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d inside. There are a host of holidays when flying an American flag is especially important, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday and, of course, Independence Day. You can see the whole list here. Also, polling places should fly flags on election days, schools should fly them when class is in session and public institutions should fly them daily. No, this isn\u2019t something President Donald Trump said. It\u2019s actually in the Code. Despite the conclusions one might draw from tanks rolling through the nation\u2019s capital on a nonmilitary holiday, there\u2019s no flag Stasi coming to take you away for rocking your Old Glory swim trunks. Aside from the aforementioned provision in Washington D.C., there are no other punishments proscribed in the US Code. But if you love the flag, you might like to obey the rules.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been using new, notable language at her town halls to describe the transition into \u201cMedicare for All\u201d \u2013 saying, under her plan, it would be a voter\u2019s \u201cchoice\u201d to opt in. While the language is already a part of her transition proposal, it\u2019s a notable rhetorical shift on Warren\u2019s part after her moderate Democratic rivals \u2013 namely South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2013 have criticized her plan that would eventually eliminate private health insurance. For the last two weeks, Warren has described the transition into her Medicare For All plan as a \u201cchoice\u201d for Americans to try it. A new Fox News Poll released Sunday showed that support for government-run healthcare has dropped by double-digits among Democrats since October. At her town halls, Warren frequently fields questions from voters who tell her they\u2019ve heard worries from friends or family about giving up their current private insurance. During a stop in Keokuk, Iowa, on Monday morning, 54-year-old Camille Anderson told Warren she was a fan of her Medicare for all plan, \u201cbut I keep hearing from people who are afraid, (a), of the cost and, (b), that they\u2019re not going to be able to get the care they need or see the doctor that they want with your plan. Is there something you can say to alleviate their concerns and their fears?\u201d After a lengthy explanation of how her plan would work, the Massachusetts senator emphasized to Anderson that she believes Americans will embrace the plan once they see it in action. \u201cLet\u2019s let people try it,\u201d Warren said in Keokuk Monday morning. \u201cFind out what it feels like to be making healthcare decisions just between you and your medical professional to get the prescription drugs you need without having to worry about how big the copay is going to be, and whether or not you\u2019re going to be able to get the prescription filled and still have enough money left over to buy groceries this week\u2026. When tens of millions of people have had a chance to try that, I believe, at that point, we\u2019re going to be ready to vote for Medicare for everyone.\u201d In November, Warren released her transition plan that would implement Medicare for All in two phases. The first would use a Senate budget process to pass legislation that would immediately offer Medicare for All\u2019s full suite of benefits \u2013 at no cost \u2013 to children under 18 and people at up to 200% of the poverty level, around $51,000 in income for a family of four. The option would be open to any American who wants to use it, but they would have to pay for it, though costs would decline over time. Additionally, the legislation would lower the current Medicare eligibility age to 50 from 65, while also expanding the program\u2019s benefits and lowering what enrollees have to pay. In a second phase for the plan, Warren said she would push Congress to pass the full Medicare for All legislation. When asked about her recent verbal shift during a press availability with reporters Sunday in Ottumwa, Iowa, Warren argued she \u201cis just talking about the plan.\u201d \u201cThe plan\u2019s been there from the beginning, and I\u2019m just trying to make sure that everyone understands. The part I talk about the most is what I want to see happen \u2013 and that is the most help to the most people as quickly as possible,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s a choice for everyone to make.\u201d Warren\u2019s rhetorical shift may be driven in part by the split within the Democratic Party over how to best handle the health care issue, and the uneasiness among more moderate voters about the difficulties of transitioning to a Medicare for All system. That division has been highlighted in the primary debates; in October, Warren in particular was assailed over Medicare for All and her refusal to directly state how she would pay for it. (Warren went on to release her funding proposal in November.) In interviews with voters in swing states this year \u2013 particularly in union areas where workers have fought hard for their health care benefits \u2013 many moderate voters have said they cannot support either Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders because of their embrace of Medicare for All, which they think would harm the quality of their current benefits and the Medicare system overall. Some more moderate Democratic voters worry that the controversy over the elimination of private health insurance system would harm the Democrats\u2019 chances against President Trump in November. A new Fox poll released Sunday underscored that concern showing that 53% of all voters are opposed to a government-run health care program; while 66% of all voters favor Medicare for All for those who want it. Among Democratic primary voters in the Fox poll, 78% said they favored allowing all Americans to buy into the Medicare system. Only 54% of Democratic primary voters said they favored moving to government-run health care \u2013 a figure that fell from a high of 65% in October. The Fox News poll also found that Warren\u2019s support has dropped since late October \u2013 there was a 13-point drop in her support among those with a college degree; a 12% drop among voters over 45; and an 11-point drop among women. Democrat Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News poll with Daron Shaw, attributed part of Warren\u2019s drop to the fact that some primary voters have soured on Medicare for All \u2013 because of a recognition that defending the program will be difficult in a general election fight against Trump. In debates, Biden and Buttigieg have tried to use the uneasiness about Medicare for All to their advantage by making the contrast between their more gradual approach and that of Warren and Sanders. Biden has criticized the cost of Medicare for All as unrealistic, and argued that it would raise taxes on the middle class. He has proposed expanding coverage by building on the Affordable Care Act, which expanded access to healthcare during the Obama administration. Buttigieg described his plan as \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It,\u201d adding at a recent fundraiser: \u201cI\u2019m going to leave it to you to decide whether you want it instead of telling you what\u2019s good for you. That\u2019s how we get everyone covered.\u201d After Warren\u2019s town hall in Keokuk on Monday, Camille Anderson said she was still committed to voting for Warren, but she worries that the Massachusetts senator\u2019s explanations of her plan in her answer still may not alleviate concerns that \u201cshe wants to give away all this free stuff.\u201d \u201cI feel like she\u2019s not getting her message across succinctly enough so that people can understand the trade-off costs versus private insurance,\u201d Anderson said in an interview after listening to Warren\u2019s answer. \u201cI think breaking it down into bullet points is good. But I still think it\u2019s too much information for the average person to listen to before their eyes start glazing over. So I\u2019m concerned. I feel like that is the one issue that she keeps struggling with that just keeps popping up \u2013 and is not going to go away.\u201d CNN\u2019s MJ Lee, Greg Krieg and Donald Judd contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Kamala Harris\u2019 abrupt departure from the 2020 presidential field means she appears less in the public space. She isn\u2019t out on the campaign trail. Her name appears in fewer stories. But what has yet to dissipate is the legacy Harris leaves behind in her quest to become the first black woman president of the United States. Harris, a woman of black and South Asian descent, rose through the political ranks and made space in her platform to tell black and brown girls across the nation, \u201cI hear you. I see you.\u201d In June, Harris descended the steps of a makeshift stage, set against the backdrop of an oversized American flag, in a gymnasium in Las Vegas. She worked her way clockwise after a town hall to greet throngs of supporters. Eventually, the California senator landed in front of two small black girls named Jasmine and Maya. Harris bent down in one of her signature two-piece suits and the smallest of the two, Maya, immediately dropped her head down, succumbing to shyness. Harris lifted her chin and said, \u201cYou always keep that chin up, you hear me? You always hold that chin up, okay?\u201d Jasmine then boldly told Harris, \u201cif you don\u2019t make it, I\u2019ll take your place!\u201d Harris dutifully agreed: \u201cThat\u2019s our plan B!\u201d America still doesn't know how to talk about Kamala Harris That moment would be viewed more than 2 million times on Twitter and cemented Harris\u2019 role as the woman black girls have always been promised. She embodied the person black mothers told their daughters they could be: if you got good grades in school, went to college, studied hard, did the work, persevered through all obstacles of racism, sexism and otherness, you could one day be president of the United States, pressed-out coils at the nape of your neck and all. But Harris fell short. As black mothers often tell their daughters from childhood, you have to be twice as good at whatever you do to get half of what everybody else has. And in this election, some would say Harris was not. Her exit last week pulled out the rug from underneath thousands of black girls and women who saw themselves in her, because her campaign went to great lengths to show what it could look like for a black woman to belong in the highest office in the land, creating space for Harris to give young black and brown girls and women quick mentorship lessons on how to succeed and bring others who looked like them along, too. Over 11 months, reporters flooded the internet with stories on the inconsistencies with Harris\u2019 message, campaign strategy mishaps and the failures of Harris and her team to define both herself and her past prosecutorial career in a new age of criminal justice reform. Attacks initially took form in the \u201cKamala\u2019s a cop\u201d meme from black and brown folks that careened out of control when she failed to sufficiently defend herself during attacks on her record from Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. But despite that turbulence, she still showed girls like Jasmine and Maya there was space for them to realize their dreams, too. Inside a massive convention center in North Charleston, South Carolina, in March, a pair of black teenagers needled through a firewall of reporters circling Harris to ask for a picture. Harris obliged and then kept them standing there in front of the cameras for almost 5 minutes, leaving them with warnings of financial literacy and career advice because she wanted them to be prepared for the future: they needed to learn how to code. \u201cWhen you come out, you\u2019re going to be in a whole new world than any of us were in,\u201d Harris told the two girls, likening it to needing to know how to drive to get from place to place. \u201cI want you to know how technology works.\u201d \u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d they replied. \u201cIt was intentional,\u201d but not manufactured, said Jalisa Washington-Price, Harris\u2019 deputy national political director and South Carolina state director, in an interview. \u201cShe knew what running for president meant to young black girls and young black women, how it gave them something to believe in, and to see themselves in a presidential candidate.\u201d Miles and months away, Harris would find herself in a small conference room of supporters in November, where one of her Iowan precinct captains, a black woman named Athena Gilbraith, introduced her daughters to the senator. The youngest of the two had won class president the same day Harris was elected to the Senate in 2016 and became the first girl at her school to do so. The senator made direct eye contact with the Paris, a 13-year-old girl, and offered one of her repeated refrains, a lesson from Harris\u2019 mother: \u201cYou may be the first to do something, but don\u2019t be the last.\u201d \u201cCreate a path,\u201d Harris told Paris. \u201cYou\u2019re a role model because of what you\u2019ve done, which means people are watching you to see how.  You\u2019re inspiring people.\u201d But the one who left feeling inspired was Paris. She felt seen. \u201c[Paris] told me right in the car while leaving how it just felt so good to have somebody with that much power, look her in the eye, talk to her, listen to her and treat her as an equal,\u201d Gilbraith said in an interview. That conversation inspired Paris to start a \u201cKamala Club\u201d at her middle school in Davenport, a step in her plan to convert her fellow students and their parents into Harris\u2019 supporters. But it wasn\u2019t just young black and brown children on whom Harris impressed a sense of self. Women of all ages would swarm Harris, including one elderly black woman in Las Vegas who thanked her for being \u201cobedient\u201d to her mother for making something of herself and pledging to do what she could to get her elected. At a \u201cBlack Women\u2019s Weekend of Action,\u201d in South Carolina, Harris made a woman stand up and plug her own small business when she asked the senator a question, introducing the woman\u2019s work to a massive audience of women that looked like her, including members of black sororities like Harris\u2019 own Alpha Kappa Alpha Inc., Delta Sigma Theta and Zeta Phi Beta. Those groups constantly provided the candidate an invaluable network of donations, volunteers and support. \u201cGirl, this is a commercial, c\u2019mon,\u201d Harris joked. L. Joy Williams, a political strategist and resident of Brooklyn\u2019s NAACP chapter, later found out Harris frequently did that on the trail and appreciated her strength as a retail politician to empower her. \u201cJust being able to receive that kind of feedback and engagement from a candidate on presidential stage \u2026 people remember how you made them feel.\u201d Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge said people would be hard pressed to find moments like these at male candidate events. \u201cIf women ran the world, we wouldn\u2019t have wars, because we have a certain kind of a sensitivity that makes people feel comfortable, and we can talk to each other,\u201d Fudge,the former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said. She endorsed Harris\u2019 bid in August and took on a mentor-like role.  \u201cThe thing is, the country didn\u2019t see those sensitive moments, because those are never the things that were portrayed when they put [Harris] on TV.\u201d Harris waged the largest campaign for president a black woman has in modern history. Decades after Shirley Chisholm ran for president in 1972, Harris amassed more than $35 million dollars over 11 months, despite the challenges research shows black women face raising money. (Harris\u2019 totals for each quarter typically fell behind a handful of her opponents, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.) She announced her candidacy in front of 22,000 people, creating expectations of a top-tier candidacy. But she only fleetingly met those expectations, once reaching 17% in a poll released in July by CNN after a debate scuffle on race with former Vice President Joe Biden. Despite the excitement and inspiration generated by her campaign, she was unable to chip away at the strong support of African Americans enjoyed by Biden, who has enjoyed strong ties with the community for decades and has the distinction of serving alongside the nation\u2019s first black president. Harris entered the race looking to build off Obama\u2019s trailblazing legacy, but ultimately couldn\u2019t replicate the Obama coalition. She dropped out in early December, two months out from the first primary contests, citing a lack of funds and an inability to gain traction in a race that had once viewed her favorably. \u201cThere is a tremendous void, and tremendous disappointment,\u201d  Fudge told CNN. Fudge said it felt so disheartening in part because Harris had hit a stride in campaigning, showing confidence and authenticity that primed her for a comeback. \u201cWhen you have finally started to make the impact that you thought you could make,\u201d but then she ran out of resources. In photos: Former presidential candidate Kamala Harris (For her part, Chisholm made it to the primary contests, won the state of New Jersey and entered the Democratic convention with 152 delegates.) The blame for Harris\u2019 decline is shared among a host of issues, but to Devorah Badee, a 64-year-old from Pontiac, Michigan, it just wasn\u2019t Harris\u2019 time. \u201cI love the idea, but she never really had me convinced that she could be president,\u201d Badee said in an interview with CNN. Badee first saw Harris at a speech she gave in Detroit in May for that NAACP chapter\u2019s Freedom Fund Dinner. She contends that America isn\u2019t ready for any woman to be president. Fudge in part blamed the Democratic Party\u2019s infrastructure for making it impossible for somecandidates who to raise money or get media attention. Coming from the rugged world of California politics, Harris was known to raise high dollar amounts in the state to cover her runs for San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and most recently US senator, but she failed to replicate that success on a national scale. \u201cWhat it says to [black women] is that we continue to get the kind of lip service that we\u2019ve always got, not just from the party but from the media who talk about diversity all the time, but they fall in love with candidates and they forget the others,\u201d she said. Fudge recalled watching the news the day Harris\u2019 dropped out and realized her former candidate was on TV more that day than she had been in the last two months. Carol Moseley-Braun, the first black woman elected to the Senate and ambassador to New Zealand, said she was proud of Harris, even though Braun endorsed Biden. Braun says Harris ran into the \u201chard reality\u201d of raising money. \u201cI think she\u2019s still an aspirational figure,\u201d Braun said, saying she\u2019s had a positive impact on how black women in politics see themselves and how others see them too. \u201cWhite males will not look at black women and assume that we can\u2019t be competitive.\u201d",

            "article_content": "With 106 days\u00a0until the Iowa caucuses and a record number of Democratic candidates, the 2020 election is already in full swing.\u00a0Every Sunday, I outline the\u00a05\u00a0BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they\u2019re ranked \u2013 so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week. Tell your friends to subscribe to The Point newsletter! 5. Biden bucks: Don\u2019t lose sight of this amazing fact: Astronaut and first-time Senate candidate Mark Kelly had more money in the bank ($9.5 million) than Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign ($8.98 million) at the end of September. That\u2019s Joe Biden. The three-plus decade senator. The eight-year vice president. The front-runner in the 2020 race since the moment he got into it. (Until now, that is. More on that below.) Biden\u2019s fundraising problems aren\u2019t actually all that surprising. He\u2019s never been much of a fundraiser \u2013 or enjoyed doing it. And he never built the small-dollar national network that more liberal candidates likes Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have accrued. None of those rationalizations change the fact that Biden has considerably less money to spend in the final 100 days before people start voting that any of his top rivals \u2013 including Sanders, Warren and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. How can Biden change that reality? He probably can\u2019t. If he wasn\u2019t able to raise money well (and easily) as the clear front-runner, he\u2019s going to have a much harder time convincing people to give him money given the changing dynamics in the contest. 4. Bernie\u2019s back?: That\u2019s the message coming out of Sanders\u2019 campaign as he seeks to change the subject from his recent heart attack and the is-he-too-old-for-this? conversation that event has spurred. Sanders\u2019 efforts to move on got a big boost over the weekend when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him over Warren.\u00a0\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said at a rally announcing her 2020 pick. What happens next? Well, Sanders has the AOC endorsement as well as $30+ million in the bank \u2013 two very good things with about 100 days left until Iowa. The question now becomes: Does he have another issue on the campaign trail related to his health or age? If not, Sanders\u2019 heart attack might seem like a million years ago by the time Iowa Democrats turn out to vote in the caucuses. But if Sanders has any sort of problem between now and then, it\u2019s likely the end of his campaign. 3. The super-weird Hillary vs. Tulsi dynamic: Hillary Clinton started one of the strangest news cycles in the 2020 race at the end of the last week when she seemed to suggest that the Russians were \u201cgrooming\u201d Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to run as a third-party candidate. Gabbard, thrilled with the unexpected chance to battle with one of the biggest figures in the party, called Clinton the \u201cqueen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d What now? Well, Buttigieg gave the story a bit more fuel Sunday morning.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what the basis is for that,\u201d he said of Gabbard on CNN\u2019s\u00a0\u201cState of the Union\u201d with Jake Tapper. \u201cBut I consider her to be a competitor. I respect her service.\u201d Does this become a story that all of the major contenders on the Democratic side have to respond to? And do any of them take it as an opportunity to distance themselves from the Clinton era that many Democrats would like to put behind them? 2. Trump slump \u2026 dump?: I\u2019m hesitant to predict any sort of major walk-away from President Donald Trump by congressional Republicans over the Ukraine scandal because, well, they haven\u2019t walked away from him over all of the other terrible stories surrounding him over his first three-ish years in office. And yet, there are cracks. Over the weekend, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced that he supported the impeachment and removal of Trump. Florida Rep. Francis Rooney, a Republican, said he would consider impeaching Trump \u2013 and then promptly announced his plan to retire from Congress in 2020. The question is whether any more fissures emerge following Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission that there was a quid pro quo between the US and Ukraine to force an investigation into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s physical server. (Trump \u2013 and Mulvaney, I suppose? \u2013 believe the server might be in Ukraine.\u00a0It\u2019s not.) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! There is somewhat clear evidence that Trump is melting down amid the pressures applied by the House impeachment inquiry. The latest evidence? His Saturday night reversal on plans announced Thursday to hold the 2020 G7 summit at his Doral club in Miami. Is there any scenario in which Republicans say enough is enough and begin to break from Trump publicly in big numbers? If it\u2019s possible, we might be on the verge of it. 1. The new Democratic front-runner \u2026 now what?: There\u2019s a new top dog in the Democratic field: Elizabeth Warren. As Harry Enten and I noted in our brandnew rankings of the 10 Democrats most likely to wind up as the party\u2019s nominee, Warren has overtaken Biden not just in polling but also in money and organization. She also has the clearest path to be the nominee, with a polling and organizational edges in Iowa and a geographic connection in New Hampshire. So now what? Well, last week\u2019s debate is an indicator of what this next phase of the Democratic race will look like \u2013 as the Massachusetts senator was attacked for a variety of her positions by no fewer than seven of her rivals. (Warren did the best she could amid the onslaught, but no one could be expected to prosper under those circumstances.) Warren\u2019s most obvious weakness \u2013 from a policy perspective \u2013 is on her ongoing unwillingness to state, clearly, whether or not middle-class families will see their taxes go up under her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan. The answer to that is almost certainly yes \u2013 as Sanders, another \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proponent, acknowledged in the debate. Expect Buttigieg \u2013 as he did in the debate \u2013 to keep going after Warren on her lack of specifics on how she will pay for such a massive overhaul of the health care system in hopes of making a run at her in Iowa. Warren needs to find a much better answer on how to fund her health care plan between now and the November debate.",

            "article_content": "A dozen (!) Democratic presidential candidates took the stage in Ohio for the fourth debate of the 2020 election, the largest field ever to participate in a single debate. I watched, took notes, tweeted and picked some of the best \u2013 and the worst \u2013 of the night. My winners and losers are below. * Pete Buttigieg: The South Bend mayor had one clear goal in the debate: Hit Elizabeth Warren on her support for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d and make sure Democratic voters knew he had an alternate plan that would not eliminate the private health insurance market. Mission accomplished. And remember: The polling I\u2019ve seen makes clear that voters prefer a plan that preserves the right to choose a private insurance plan than one that gets rid of the private market in favor of a government-run plan. Buttigieg didn\u2019t stop there. His response to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s call to end \u201cendless wars\u201d was powerful, leaning heavily on his own military service. He slammed former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke on gun control, with one of the lines of the night: \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you in courage, political or personal.\u201d From beginning to end, Buttigieg was a dominant and commanding force. Yes, some will say he was \u201cmean.\u201d But debates \u2013 and primaries! \u2013 are about drawing contrasts, and that is what Buttigieg did. And did very well. * Andrew Yang: If I told you even three months ago that there would be a time in mid-October in which there was an extended conversation in a Democratic debate about the dangers of automation, you would have laughed at me. And yet, there we were on Tuesday night \u2013 a full debate within the debate, about Yang\u2019s pet issue. It\u2019s a testament to Yang\u2019s remarkable rise in this race \u2013 second only to Buttigieg\u2019s \u2013 and to the fact that he is already having a significant impact on the conversation within the Democratic Party. Plus, that \u201cMATH\u201d pin was straight fire. * Amy Klobuchar: At the moment, the Minnesota senator hasn\u2019t qualified for the next debate in November. Knowing that, Tuesday night was her last best chance to make a real move. And to her immense credit, she went for it. Knowing that Warren is now the front-runner (more on that below), Klobuchar went right after her. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren at one point. At another, she tried to make clear that Warren had no monopoly on \u201cbold\u201d ideas. At yet another, she accused Warren of \u201cmaking Republican talking points right now.\u201d I\u2019m not sure it changes anything in her polling. But she deserves credit for taking her best shot(s). * Bernie Sanders: If you were watching the debate to see how Sanders fared in the wake of his recent heart attack, well, he was the same old Bernie: Irascible, impatient, sneaky funny and entirely unapologetic about his liberal solutions to the problems facing the country. In a moment indicative of Sanders\u2019 night, he was asked a question about his health, muttered something like \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d and then pivoted to talk policy. Also, it doesn\u2019t hurt that the news that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would be endorsing him broke during the debate. * Elizabeth Warren: Welcome to being the front-runner! Although polling suggests that Warren and Joe Biden are co-front-runners, it was crystal clear Tuesday night that the other 11 candidates on stage viewed the Massachusetts senator as the top dog. Which, in theory, is a good thing for her! But in practice, it didn\u2019t work out well. Buttigieg started things off by attacking her on Medicare for All \u2013 and Warren was unable to provide a clear answer on a) whether she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans and b) if not, how would she find the money to pay for the plan. The hits kept coming. By my count, at least seven candidates attacked Warren at some point in the night \u2013 and while she remains a very able debater, she was unable to parry all of those attacks effectively. Also, Warren saying that she\u2019d like to see the US military presence gone entirely from the Middle East is going to come back to haunt her. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! * Joe Biden: I wrote today that Biden needed a performance that wasn\u2019t just \u201cgood for Biden\u201d but good by any measure. He came close-ish but, to my mind, didn\u2019t do enough. (Worth noting: I thought this was Biden\u2019s best debate performance; his answer on his age and health was probably his best answer of the debate season.) His answer on his son, Hunter, and Ukraine was meh: \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself\u201d was the best he could do, knowing that question had to be coming? And maybe it will play differently on replay, but Biden\u2019s shout-y \u201cI got you votes\u201d move on Warren felt not so good in the moment. I get the argument that Biden didn\u2019t take any big punches in this debate and stayed off the canvas. But ask yourself: is that the right bar for a former vice president and front-runner in this race from the jump? * Kamala Harris: Nothing Harris did on Tuesday night will change her trajectory \u2013 downward in this race. Her \u201cDude gotta go\u201d line about Trump fell flat, as if the audience had sort of been there and done that. Harris\u2019 attempt to force Warren to agree with her that Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account should be suspended felt small and not terribly effective. Harris has simply not been able to recapture the magic she had in that first debate of this election; Tuesday night was another swing and miss. * Tom Steyer: When the most interesting thing about you in the debate is that you wore a plaid Christmas tie, you didn\u2019t have a good debate. * Bing: Man, it\u2019s been a rough decade for Microsoft\u2019s search engine. And Yang reminded us all of that failure on Tuesday night. Well, we\u2019ll always have these original Bing ads!",

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren will launch television ads for the first time in all four early primary and caucus states, marking a new phase of her presidential campaign as she emerges as a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination. In a rare strategy memo sent as part of a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday morning, Warren\u2019s campaign manager, Roger Lau, announced an eight-figure TV and digital campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The memo shared three examples of ads, all featuring the theme of rooting out corruption, that the campaign plans to launch, though it did not clarify which of the three would run online, on television or both, and exactly when the ads would begin to air. Warren: 'Congress is complicit' by failing to start impeachment proceedings against Trump Lau noted that the campaign\u2019s biggest expense at the moment is staff but said he expects that to soon become media spending, with a bigger bulk of the expenditure going towards digital ads than TV. \u201cAt the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election \u2013 by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,\u201d Lau wrote. \u201cAs we head into the fall, here\u2019s how we\u2019ll build on our progress, build out our team, and keep growing the movement that will elect Elizabeth and elect Democrats up and down the ballot next November.\u201d All three ads feature images of President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth Warren. I know what\u2019s wrong. I know how to fix it. And I\u2019ll fight to get it done,\u201d Warren says in the closing of the 15-second and 30-second ads. In the 30-second video, Warren touts her past accomplishments in Washington, including her role in the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and defeating former Republican Sen. Scott Brown in her first political campaign. It flashes a photo of Warren at the White House with former President Barack Obama. \u201cI\u2019ll never let anyone tell me that anything is too hard,\u201d Warren says. \u201cToo hard to stand up to Wall Street? Too hard to protect consumers from cheating banks? Too hard to beat a popular Republican incumbent senator as a first-time candidate? Not too hard.\u201d The full-minute ad begins with a biographical introduction of Warren\u2019s Oklahoma upbringing before transitioning to a familiar line from her stump speech: \u201cMy second chance was a commuter college that cost $50 a semester.\u201d \u201cToday there are fewer paths to America\u2019s middle class and even fewer second chances. Service members are targeted by predatory lenders; students are crushed by debt; families can\u2019t afford childcare,\u201d Warren says in that ad, which also features scenes from Warren\u2019s recent rally at Washington Square Park in New York City. \u201cAnd after generations of discrimination, people of color face an even narrower path to opportunity,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhen we have a government that works for the rich and the powerful, and leaves everyone else behind, it\u2019s corruption, pure and simple.\u201d Lau said in Thursday\u2019s memo that there would also be significant investment on the ground, including the hiring of new state directors and organizers in states that will hold primaries and caucuses well after the first several early states. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate, and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020,\u201d Lau wrote. \u201cThat includes states like Illinois and California, where Democrats won a whole bunch of House seats in 2018 in close elections that we\u2019ll need to defend. It also includes states like Maine, which has a competitive Senate race and Georgia, where there will be two Senate seats up for election.\u201d Lau made clear that the overarching aim is to put more resources into areas where Democrats are trying to either hold or flip congressional seats, as well as make inroads in state legislatures. Michigan, Minnesota, Florida and Texas are all on the list, he said. The goal: secure the House Democratic majority \u2013 without which some of Warren\u2019s plans would be tough to enact in Washington \u2013 and build Democratic power down the ballot to bolster support for her agenda. According to a Warren aide, all of the non-early states mentioned in the strategy memo \u2013 Illinois, California, Maine, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and Florida \u2013 will have paid staff, including, eventually, state directors. \u201cIf we want to make big, structural change,\u201d Lau writes, \u201cwe need to make sure Democrats control the U.S. House and Senate and win important gubernatorial and state legislative races across the country.\u201d Thursday\u2019s announcement comes less than a week out from the end of the third quarter fundraising deadline. Warren has vowed not to hold big-dollar fundraisers or solicit money from wealthy donors during the primaries, a decision that in part led to the departure of her finance director earlier in the year. But the campaign raised an impressive $19.1 million in the second quarter \u2013 more than three times the $6 million she raised in the first quarter. Warren has also benefited greatly from the transfer of more than $10 million from her Senate account. Unlike her current primary campaign, Warren\u2019s Senate reelection bid solicited money from big-dollar donors.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg slammed Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s adopted \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan on Thursday, calling her \u201cextremely evasive\u201d when it came to whether or not the proposal calls for raising taxes on the middle class. \u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward, and was extremely evasive when asked that question. And we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d Buttigieg told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead,\u201d when asked if his competitors have been upfront about the implementation of Medicare for All. \u201cI think it\u2019s puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question of whether her plan or Sen. (Bernie) Sanders\u2019 plan will raise middle class taxes is \u2018yes\u2019, why you wouldn\u2019t just say so and explain why you think that\u2019s the better way forward?\u201d Buttigieg was responding to Warren\u2019s interview on Tuesday night with late night host Stephen Colbert. When she was asked directly if she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for health care, the Massachusetts senator failed to answer the question. Colbert asked Warren, \u201cHow are you going to pay for it? Are you going to raise the middle class taxes?\u201d \u201cSo here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do this. Costs are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations \u2026 and hardworking, middle class families are going to see their costs go down,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut will their taxes go down?\u201d Colbert interrupted. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Warren said before getting cut off by Colbert. And in last week\u2019s debate, Warren was asked \u2013 again \u2013 whether Medicare for All would result in tax hikes for the middle class. \u201cLook, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost,\u201d Warren answered, without directly answering the question about taxes. \u201cAnd the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down, and that\u2019s how it should work under Medicare for All in our health care system.\u201d Buttigieg unveiled his health care plan earlier on Thursday, outlining a middle-of-the-road approach that allows people to opt into a government-backed health insurance option but lets them keep their private insurance plans if they like them. Buttigieg\u2019s proposal \u2013 unlike Sanders\u2019 plan \u2013 would not force people onto government health coverage but instead would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll. Buttigieg has argued this would force private insurers to compete with the government-backed plan on price. Warren, on the other hand, is running on a bill that she first signed on to in 2017: Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer legislation. \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie,\u201d Warren has said more than once in recent months when asked about her vision for the American health care system. Warren\u2019s decision to wholly embrace another candidate\u2019s idea \u2013 particularly on an issue of such outsized significance in the 2020 election \u2013 has put her in an unfamiliar position of defending and advocating a proposal that is not uniquely hers. And she\u2019s made clear that she has no intention of authoring a comprehensive health care plan of her own during the Democratic primary contest. Buttigieg used the third Democratic debate earlier this month to question Sanders directly about his plan, turning to the senator and asking, \u201cI trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don\u2019t you?\u201d And Buttigieg has taken this attack line directly to voters with ads on Facebook and other digital platforms. The mayor has begun sponsoring a post on Facebook that says, \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It will create a public alternative, but unlike the Sanders-Elizabeth Warren vision it doesn\u2019t dictate it to the American people and risk further polarizing them.\u201d Another ad simply states, \u201cI trust the American people to make their health care decisions for themselves.\u201d \u201cPeople are used to Washington politicians not giving straight answers to simple questions,\u201d Buttigieg said in his interview with Tapper on Thursday. \u201cBut at a time like this on an issue this important, that\u2019s exactly what we need.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, MJ Lee, Gregory Krieg and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

And she\u2019s made clear that she has no intention of authoring a comprehensive health care plan of her own during the Democratic primary contest. Warren has gone to considerable lengths in recent months to demonstrate unwavering support for Medicare for All, in one of the clearest signs of the political alliance forged between Warren and Sanders, even as they jockey for second place behind former Vice President Joe Biden. But there are early signs of the potential risks involved in Warren\u2019s full embrace of Sanders\u2019 signature proposal \u2013 she\u2019s opened herself up to the familiar criticism that Medicare for All is too expensive, disruptive and unrealistic. Those dynamics were on full display at Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate, when she was asked \u2013 again \u2013 whether Medicare for All would result in tax hikes for the middle class. Not for the first time, Warren pivoted. \u201cLook, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost,\u201d Warren said on the debate stage, without directly answering the question about taxes. \u201cAnd the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down, and that\u2019s how it should work under Medicare for All in our health care system.\u201d Her argument is that in the aggregate, Americans will spend less on health care in a single-payer system, which would eliminate premiums paid to health insurance companies, along with deductibles and copayments. But questions about additional taxes for the middle class are not going away anytime soon, and would ramp up in intensity if Warren were to win the Democratic nomination. A Warren aide declined to comment on questions about whether there are plans for Warren to release a health care proposal of her own \u2013 either during the primary or in the general election campaign \u2013 as well as about middle-class tax hikes under Medicare for All, instead referring CNN to Warren\u2019s remarks after Thursday\u2019s debate. If Warren is confronting criticism from colleagues to the ideological right of her, the decision to take an unequivocal stance on Medicare for All has also had the effect of reassuring some progressive admirers. In interviews with CNN, activists who vocally back Medicare for All said Warren\u2019s recent \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie\u201d positioning helped assuage concerns about her earlier, more circumspect, tone on Medicare for All. She has previously mused about \u201cdifferent pathways\u201d to Medicare for All and spoken about other, less ambitious bills she had co-sponsored in the Senate. And asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper at a town hall in March whether she supported eliminating private health insurance, as Medicare for All would effectively do, Warren responded that Sanders has \u201cgot a runway for that.\u201d \u201cI think we get everybody together. And that\u2019s what it is, we\u2019ll decide,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve also co-sponsored other bills, including expanding Medicaid as another approach that we use.\u201d Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats, the group best known for helping to launch Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s successful 2018 campaign for a congressional seat from New York, said Warren\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie\u201d comments marked \u201can incredibly important moment for her campaign.\u201d \u201cI think many progressives were kind of confused and getting mixed signals from her on Medicare for All,\u201d Shahid said. \u201cThat was a big moment for her to come out, pretty full-throated, for what\u2019s in the Bernie and (Washington state Rep. Pramila) Jayapal bills, which is a single-payer system.\u201d Asked if Warren should roll out her own version of Medicare for All, Shahid argued that such a move might be counterproductive \u2013 both for Warren and the single-payer movement. \u201cI don\u2019t think she needs to put out her own plan or anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, putting out her own plan would be seen as competing with the existing bills that people have been rallying around and worked really hard on.\u201d One of Warren\u2019s most ardent outside backers, Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, acknowledged \u2013 on the June night she said it \u2013 that Warren\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie\u201d declaration on the debate stage \u201cgave anyone who prioritizes that issue a permission structure for clearly voting for her.\u201d Michael Lighty, a Medicare for All advocate and former director of public policy for National Nurses United, the first major union to endorse Sanders in 2016, was part of the push to build support in the Senate for the 2017 Medicare for All bill. That included a sales pitch to Warren\u2019s office, which he said initially viewed it with some skepticism. \u201cHer staff gave the same consideration to that policy that she does to everything, which is pretty severe scrutiny, really,\u201d said Lighty, who is supporting Sanders again in 2020. Ultimately, though, Warren came around to the legislation, and was in the room next to her colleague from Vermont when it was ultimately unveiled on Capitol Hill. Still, Lighty said, there\u2019s a nagging question in the back of his mind. \u201cYou have to ask, if Bernie\u2019s not there, what will she do? Because she says, \u2018I\u2019m with Bernie,\u2019 and if Bernie is not there, what will she do?\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think you have to ask those questions. I don\u2019t think I would consider her commitment and policy approach settled on Medicare for All.\u201d The simmering skepticism among some dedicated Medicare for All activists is also rooted in a less-talked-about health care battle. Warren, along with fellow Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, pushed as recently as early 2018 for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax on medical devices, an industry with a hub in the Bay State. The tax, which Republicans often targeted during Obama-era legislative standoffs over the health care law, was meant to help offset some of its new costs. A Warren aide noted to CNN that her support for repealing the tax has been contingent on lawmakers finding an appropriate source of alternative revenue. She has since become more vocal in her criticism of big pharmaceutical and insurance companies, railing against their multibillion-dollar profits at a time when millions of Americans can\u2019t foot the bill for life-saving drugs or coverage. And in a video released last week of her recent conversation on health care with Ady Barkan, a 35-year-old activist with ALS, Warren went a step further in assuring even the most hardline single-payer advocates. Barkan noted that Warren appeared to have become increasingly \u201cfull-throated\u201d in her support of Medicare for All. \u201cMy observation is that your political philosophical approach to a system failure is generally not to expand the size of the public sector, but to instead heavily regulate private sector actors and beat down their greed,\u201d Barkan said. \u201cWas that the source of your initial hesitation on the question of getting rid of private insurance, or was it something else?\u201d Warren gently pushed back, saying her concerns had more to do with the \u201ctransition than on (the) end point.\u201d But she then made a point that, for a candidate who so often argues that well-regulated markets can conquer corporate excess, amounted to a notable admission that health care was different. \u201cThere are areas where markets just don\u2019t work, and a big part of health care is one of those,\u201d Warren said. \u201cSo the idea that we\u2019d get a couple regulations in place, and it\u2019ll all \u2013 it\u2019ll all sort itself out, it\u2019s just not true with health care.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg called it \u201cunwatchable.\u201d Amy Klobuchar warned that \u201ca house divided cannot stand.\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro said what was unfolding on stage was \u201ccalled an election.\u201d Democrats met for their third debate of the 2020 presidential primary Thursday night in Houston. With the field narrowed to just 10 candidates who qualified for the stage, it was messy, and at times nasty. The night featured Castro launching a series of risky attacks on the front-runner in national polls, former Vice President Joe Biden. It saw fellow Texan Beto O\u2019Rourke have his best moments yet on home-state turf. And it offered another gauge of how the party\u2019s raging debate over health care is evolving, with Biden leading the centrist candidates in fighting back more forcefully against \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor, tried at one point to pull Democrats out of the mud. \u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable. Because this reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington. Scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that, \u2018My plan, your plan,\u2019\u201d he said. That\u2019s when Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary and the chief instigator Thursday night, interjected. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s called the Democratic Primary Election, Pete. That\u2019s called an election. That\u2019s an election. You know?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re here for. It\u2019s an election.\u201d Here are seven takeaways from the third Democratic debate: Juli\u00e1n Castro takes jab at Joe Biden's memory Much of the pre-debate hype focused on the potential for an ideological clash between Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who were sharing the stage for the first time. But it was Castro, a member of former President Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet, who came ready to brawl with party\u2019s front-runner. Criticizing Obama over deportations, Castro said of Biden: \u201cHe wants to get credit for Obama\u2019s work, but not have to answer any questions.\u201d \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent. That\u2019s where I stand,\u201d Biden responded. The back-and-forth raised questions about what Obama\u2019s legacy really is \u2013 and how Democratic voters want to see it furthered. Do they want to elevate his loyal vice president? Or are they looking for what Obama once was: A young, inspirational candidate to lead them into the future? It\u2019s not clear that Castro qualifies as the latter. His attacks on Biden perhaps weakened Biden but also risked alienating Democratic voters, who largely like all their leading candidates, including the former vice president. The most stunning of their exchanges was the first one, when Castro launched a very-thinly-veiled assault over a topic other Democrats have only gingerly broached: Biden\u2019s age. He accused the former vice president of \u201cforgetting what you said two minutes ago\u201d during an exchange over whether Biden\u2019s health care plan would require Americans who want to sign up for his Medicare-style public option would have to buy into it. Then, he tried to twist the knife, saying: \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you are not.\u201d Castro told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo after the debate that the comment was \u201cnot intended as a personal attack or affront.\u201d \u201cThis is a debate. And when we\u2019re talking about health care policy, we\u2019re talking about a policy that impacts every single person in this country,\u201d Castro said. On CNN after the debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker implied Castro had taken a \u201ccheap shot\u201d and said that \u201ctone and tenor are important,\u201d even as he also insisted Castro\u2019s attacks reflected broader concerns about Biden. \u201cI think that we are at a tough point right now, because there\u2019s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball across the end line without fumbling. And I think that Castro had some really legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long, grueling campaign who can get the ball over the line? And he has every right to call that out,\u201d Booker said. There\u2019s another possibility to consider. Castro has been a contender for the Democratic vice presidential nomination before. If another candidate on stage Thursday night (other than Biden) wins the nomination and is looking for an attack dog for a running mate, Castro gave them something to think about. Democrats\u2019 differences on how to achieve universal health coverage has dominated the opening portions of all three debates. The only difference Thursday night was that all the leading candidates were on stage. Biden was quick to criticize Warren, who supports Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan in which private insurance would effectively be ended and all Americans would be enrolled in a government program. Instead, Biden said, he is offering a more modest proposal that builds on Obamacare by giving Americans the option to buy into a Medicare-style program \u2013 but doesn\u2019t require it. \u201cI know the senator says she is for Bernie,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, I am for Barack.\u201d Warren attempted to defuse Biden\u2019s approach by praising the former president. \u201cWe all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America and committed this country to health care for every human being,\u201d she said. Debates confirm there is really only one issue in the Democratic primary The former vice president went on offense, pressing Sanders and Warren on how they would foot the 10-year, $32 trillion bill for their proposal. Sanders reminded viewers that he \u201cwrote the damn bill\u201d \u2013 which is notable because health care is the rare issue on which Warren does not have her own plan; she backs Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All proposal. And he argued it\u2019s \u201cthe most cost-effective approach to providing health care\u201d to everyone in the country. Warren ducked a question on whether she would raise middle-class taxes to pay for Medicare for All. And the way she framed her non-answer \u2013 focusing on the overall cost of health care, rather than whether it\u2019s paid via income taxes or deductibles and co-pays \u2013 showed how she could make her case in a general election. \u201cThe richest individuals and the biggest corporations are going to pay more, and middle-class families are going to pay less. That\u2019s how this is going to work,\u201d she said. Biden got some back-up on health care Thursday night from his fellow moderates in the race \u2013 most pointedly, Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd on page 8 \u2013 on page 8 of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. And that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance.\u201d \u201cThe problem, Sen. Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote and that Sen. Warren backs is that it doesn\u2019t trust the American people,\u201d Buttigieg said. Turning to the audience, he said, \u201cI trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you, not my way or the highway.\u201d It was a notable shift in the tenor of a health care debate that had, to this point in the race, largely been dominated by the progressive candidates. In the first debate, liberal agitators like New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio were there to pounce against candidates who were not eager to eliminate private insurance. And in the second debate, Warren and Sanders stood side-by-side and batted away criticism from candidates who didn\u2019t qualify for the third debate. Beto O'Rourke: 'Hell yes' we'll take your AR-15 In front of a home-state crowd, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke finally had the kind of night that showed why he\u2019d once been seen as a phenom. His biggest moment came when he forcefully argued for the mandatory buyback of assault-style firearms. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore,\u201d he said. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment positioned him as a leader in the party\u2019s push for gun control (to the chagrin of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who had advanced a similar proposal earlier). That\u2019s right where O\u2019Rourke wants to be, in the wake of the early August mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso that he has said changed him as a candidate. And it was teed up by other Democrats, including Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Castro, who praised him for how he\u2019d returned home to try to help El Paso heal. Another big moment for O\u2019Rourke came at the end of a riff on racism, when he said of Trump: \u201cWe have a white supremacist in the White House and he poses a mortal threat to people of color across this country.\u201d O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign was ready for a spike in Google searches and social media traffic that followed. His website was overhauled to feature a menacing red image of Trump with the words \u201cThe President of the United States of America is a white supremacist\u201d \u2013 as well as lots of links to Trump\u2019s racist comments. In the first debate, it was Harris who had been Biden\u2019s chief tormenter \u2013 earning her a surge up the polls that wound up fizzling in July and August. So she tried a new approach Thursday night, instead taking aim at Trump. She dedicated her entire opening statement to Trump, addressing him directly as if he was watchin \u2013 which was unlikely, given his speaking engagement in Baltimore \u2013 before closing by saying, \u201cAnd now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.\u201d Explaining her shift in strategy to CNN after the debate, Harris said, \u201cMy whole campaign is about that and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running to unseat him.\u201d \u201cListen, I believe that there is one common goal that we all have that we need to focus on. And frankly, when we think about this discussion among Democrats, everyone I think should be really clear about pointing out of course, where we disagree, but the ultimate goal has to be to understand that we need a president United States who understands that we need to bring people together,\u201d she said. She tried to be a unifying voice during the health care debate. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. She also praised the architects of Obamacare, which laid the groundwork for the moderate candidates\u2019 plans, and Medicare for All. \u201cI want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far,\u201d she said, then added: \u201cI want to give credit to Bernie. Take credit, Bernie.\u201d Near the end of the debate, ABC moderators asked the candidates an unusual question: What had been their most significant professional setback? It opened the door for Buttigieg, who is gay, to remind viewers of the historic nature of his candidacy \u2013 and what he has overcome to get into the upper tiers of Democratic presidential candidates. \u201cAs a military officer serving under \u2018Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell\u2019 and as an elected official in the state of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor,\u201d he said, \u201cat a certain point, when it came to professional setbacks, I had to wondering whether just acknowledging who I was going to be the ultimate career-ending professional setback.\u201d Democrats tried to be funny. Sometimes they failed \u2013 like when Klobuchar, referring to Trump, went for the too-obvious \u201cHouston, we have a problem,\u201d or when Harris needled Biden over his resistance to executive orders on guns by saying, \u201cInstead of saying \u2018no we can\u2019t,\u2019 let\u2019s say \u2018yes we can.\u2019\u201d Entrepreneur Andrew Yang went with a stereotype. \u201cI am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors,\u201d he said. Others deserved a little bit of a chuckle. The bald Booker, for example, said of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, \u201cI\u2019m the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau\u2019s hair menacing.\u201d Harris, meanwhile, said of Trump that \u201con trade policy, he reminds me of that guy in \u2018The Wizard of Oz.\u2019 When you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude.\u201d The vegan Booker, who doesn\u2019t have children but is the campaign\u2019s most frequent teller of dad jokes, was asked whether Iowans and Texans should follow his example. \u201cFirst of all I want to say: no. I want to translate that into Spanish: No,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "It was expected to be a showdown between the three front-runners that would bare the ideological divide in the Democratic Party. Instead it was a disjointed affair that didn\u2019t appear to change the trajectory of the 2020 fight for the Democratic nomination. Thursday\u2019s debate was a night when lower-polling candidates like former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Sen. Cory Booker and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg unexpectedly seized the spotlight from former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, turning in improved performances that were, at times, overshadowed by awkward moments \u2013 from Biden\u2019s invocation of a record player to former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s heavy-handed attempt to seize Barack Obama\u2019s legacy by questioning Biden\u2019s age. The lack of a clear winner among the 10 candidates on the stage underscored a key point about the 2020 Democratic primary: It may be a while before a winner emerges, as the Democratic Party wrestles with both an ideological divide and the crucial question of whether it\u2019s time for the next generation to take up the mantle. Without question the sharpest and most unforgettable exchange of the night was when Castro sought a breakout moment by using a minor point in the health care debate to suggest that Biden was losing his memory. 7 takeaways from the third Democratic presidential debate Coming off a spirited ideological debate with Sanders and Warren about his view that their \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal is too expensive and will burden American taxpayers, Biden off-handedly made a point about his own plan: \u201cAnyone who can\u2019t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\u201d Castro aggressively cut Biden off with a jab about his age. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d Castro said, as the other candidates looked on, slightly aghast. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that.\u201d Castro went on to say \u2013 in a point that was only partly correct \u2013 that his health care plan unlike Biden\u2019s, would automatically enroll Americans who lost their jobs. \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you are not,\u201d Castro said in a final joust to Biden. \u201cThat will be a surprise to him,\u201d Biden replied. 2020 Democrats push back at 'personal' attack after Castro questions Biden's memory It was a stunning moment in a race where the younger contenders have often argued \u2013 more gently perhaps \u2013 that it is time for a new generation of leadership. In making that argument, Castro was attempting to relfect the concern voiced by many Democratic voters that Biden does not seem as sharp as he did during his eight years as Obama\u2019s vice president. But the former San Antonio\u2019s mayor attack was so cringe-worthy that several other candidates felt the need to step in. \u201cThis reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other, poking at each other,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s called the Democratic primary election, Pete,\u201d Castro snapped back. \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d \u201cYes, but a house divided cannot stand,\u201d Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar interjected, drawing applause from the audience. \u201cThat is not how we\u2019re going to win this.\u201d New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker closed out the exchange with a plea for unity and an attempt to steer the debate back to a more substantive discussion. \u201cLook, there are a lot of people watching at home right now, listening to us, that are afraid because they are in crisis,\u201d Booker said. He added, \u201cThis must be a moment where we, as Democrats, can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground, but find common ground. Because we\u2019ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president.\u201d While the spat between Castro and Biden was the most memorable exchange of the night, other candidates also managed to leave some shaking their heads. Democratic debate: Speaking times California Sen. Kamala Harris had a more uneven night than in prior debates. Several of her lines that had clearly been rehearsed didn\u2019t land \u2013 though at one point when talking about Trump\u2019s trade policy, she said to laughter that the President \u201creminds me of that guy in \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019 you know, when you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude?\u201d Meanwhile, Biden had some strong moments, defending his health care plan early in the debate with Warren and Sanders, for example. But his answers were sometimes unclear, lacking a linear through line as he jumped from point to point. That was true when he went on a long tangent about his efforts to bring home troops from Afghanistan, and in another exchange when he veered from a question about his position on reparations into an argument that children should listen to the radio or a record player. His sometimes shaky performance may underscore concerns many Democratic voters have about his ability to take on Trump. But he solidified his performance at the end of the night with a strong answer about how he\u2019s recovered from setbacks. He noted that he was raised to believe that family is at the center of everything. Fact-check: Democratic debate from Houston \u201cRight after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, and my two sons were badly injured.  And I just had been elected, not sworn in. And I lost my faith for a while. I came back,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd then later, when my son Beau came home from Iraq and \u2013 with a terminal disease, and a year later, year-and-a-half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul. But the fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it \u2013 is you deal with it by finding purpose, purpose in what you do.  And that\u2019s why I hope \u2013 I hope he\u2019s proud of me today.\u201d Businessman Andrew Yang argued that \u201ceverything in America revolves around the almighty dollar.\u201d And in what his campaign had touted as his big reveal, and a possibly illegal gambit, Yang said he would do something \u201cunprecedented\u201d by using some of his campaign contributions to \u201cgive a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now.\u201d After a long pause, Buttigieg \u2013 who happened to be up next in the line of opening statements \u2013 dryly quipped: \u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d Booker skillfully turned specific policy questions into eloquent arguments about the need to unify America. When the debate turned to the series of mass shootings, for example, Booker argued that America needed to show more \u201ccourageous empathy.\u201d \u201cWe are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action,\u201d Booker said, noting his own experience with gun violence as mayor of Newark. \u201cI have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine, because we forget \u2013 national shootings, these mass shootings are tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine,\u201d Booker said. Beto O'Rourke: 'Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47' The night was a strong one not only for Booker, who has repeatedly showed his command of the finer points of debating, but also for O\u2019Rourke, who has often seemed out of his depth when sharing the stage with his more experienced rivals. After the massacre in his hometown of El Paso, O\u2019Rourke suspended his campaign for nearly two weeks to meet with victims\u2019 families and tend to his community. He spoke with passion about that experience Thursday night and did not shy away from a moderator\u2019s question about whether he would confiscate assault-style weapons. \u201cAre you proposing taking away their guns?\u201d ABC moderator David Muir asked. \u201cI am, if it\u2019s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, adding, \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d The first hour of the debate laid bare the broad ideological divide in the Democratic Party as the initial stages once again focused on the future of health care in America. Biden, whose camp had made clear before the debate that he planned to go after Warren, quickly made good on that promise by attempting to distance her from Obama, who remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party. Debates confirm there is really only one issue in the Democratic primary \u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie, I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI think the Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it, replace everything that\u2019s been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance number one.\u201d Sidestepping the opportunity to attack Biden, Warren chose to be gracious \u2013 complimenting the work of the Obama administration on health care. She would not \u2013 at the moderator\u2019s prompting \u2013 say that middle class Americans\u2019 taxes would go up, but she defended her plan. \u201cI actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company. I\u2019ve met people who like their doctors,\u201d she said, along with their nurses, their pharmacists and their physical therapists. She added that Americans don\u2019t want to spend all their time fighting with insurance companies. Sanders, who has been praised by Biden as being honest with the American people that their taxes would go up if the country moves to \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d weighed in by citing the costs the country would bear if the nation does not move to Medicare for All. \u201cAmericans don\u2019t want to pay twice as much as other countries, and they guarantee health care for all people,\u201d Sanders said.

            "article_content": "Comedian Hasan Minhaj called on Congress to address the student loan debt crisis Tuesday, calling it a \u201cpaywall to the middle class.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a huge problem that the youth of America have to bombard their favorite rapper or pop musician and ask them to pay back their student loans,\u201d Minhaj said at a House Financial Services Committee hearing. The comedian and political commentator is the host of the Netflix show Patriot Act, which earlier this year ran an episode highlighting the problems with student loan servicers. During that show, a survey of the audience found that those 200 people in attendance owed a combined $6 million in student loan debt. \u201cNow granted, our audience is mainly unemployed poli-sci majors, but that\u2019s still a lot of money,\u201d Minhaj joked. At one point, he invoked musician Taylor Swift, who recently helped a fan pay off a loan. \u201cThey\u2019re not even asking for selfies anymore. Are you a fan of Taylor Swift? Are you a Swiftie? Even her fans have gone up to her and asked if she would pay off her student loans. That\u2019s how desperate student borrowers are,\u201d he added. The hearing was one of the first the House Financial Services Committee has held on with a focus on student lending in its history, said Chairwoman Maxine Waters, a California Democrat. \u201cGiven the scale of the crisis at hand, it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d Waters said. There are currently about 45 million Americans with student loan debt, which has climbed to nearly $1.6 trillion, surpassing the total amount of outstanding credit card debt and the total amount of auto debt. The issue is sure to be a hot button issue in the next presidential election. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, has introduced legislation that would immediately wipe away all outstanding student debt, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has proposed a similar plan that would forgive student loans for nearly all borrowers, excluding high-earners. Democratic members and some consumer advocates who testified Tuesday blamed the student loan servicing companies, which are hired by the Department of Education, for poorly communicating with borrowers about their repayment options. But a number of Republican members blamed Congress for creating a complicated repayment system that\u2019s hard to navigate. \u201cThis is a crisis, but this is a crisis that Congress created,\u201d said ranking Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry. Minhaj argued that student loan servicers often rush borrowers off the phone before recommending the best repayment option. \u201cThey will advise you to go into loan forbearance instead of income-based repayment plan, which would probably be better for you. That simple misinformation is a problem,\u201d he said. But Jason Delisle, a resident fellow and student loan expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, argued that borrowers wouldn\u2019t have the patience to stay on the phone long enough to hear about the complicated terms of their loans that Congress established. \u201cI guess the people would be very upset about that, too,\u201d Delisle said, holding up a document explaining the terms, which nearly reached the floor. Seth Frotman, the former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Student Loan Ombudsman, also testified Tuesday \u2013 calling on Congress to create a stronger protection system for student loan borrowers. He pointed out that student loan borrowers have fewer rights than those Congress has afforded to credit card holders and mortgage borrowers. \u201cThe student debt crisis is a consumer protection crisis, and that is where this committee comes in,\u201d Frotman said.",

            "article_content": "With 183 days until the Iowa caucuses and a record number of Democratic candidates, the 2020 election is already in full swing. Every Sunday, I outline the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they\u2019re ranked \u2013 so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week. 5. The Detroit debates\u2019 aftermath: Sometime this week we should start to see some polling that was conducted entirely after the second set of Democratic debates in Detroit. Given how much California Sen. Kamala Harris (and, to a lesser extent Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren) shot up the polls in the wake of solid performances in the first debates in June, expectations are high that the second debates could have a similar effect on the massive Democratic field. That would be a good thing for Sens. Cory Booker (New Jersey), Warren and Bernie Sanders (Vermont) \u2013 all of whom had very solid debates. It might be less kind to Harris and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who clearly struggled in the debates. I\u2019m intrigued to see how post-debate polling treats former Vice President Joe Biden, whose debate performance was hugely uneven. 4. How long can you hold on?:\u00a0That\u2019s the question a lot of candidates will be fielding this week as the realities of the race set in. The second debate is in the rearview mirror and it\u2019s going to be hard for many of these third-tier (and below) candidates to qualify for the third debate in September (much more on that below). That group includes Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, spiritual guru Marianne Williamson and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. At some point that is likely soon, these candidates\u2019 ability to pay their staffs and travel around the country will be curtailed by their lack of polling progress \u2013 and the fundraising that follows. Go into debt or drop out? That\u2019s the question a lot of candidates have to ask themselves now. Here's who has qualified for the September debates so far 3. The scramble for September: It\u2019s August! (This should not be news to you. If so, please see me after class). That means that this is the last month where the 2020 Democratic candidates will not debate until the calendar turns to 2020! BUT, that doesn\u2019t mean you can just stop thinking about the debates. Far from it! Although the next debate isn\u2019t until the second week of September, candidates have only until August 28 to qualify for it. How do you qualify? You need 2% support in four qualifying polls and 130,000 individual donors. So far, Biden, Harris, Sanders and Warren are in, as are South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Booker, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and O\u2019Rourke. That\u2019s eight. Who\u2019s on the bubble?\u00a0Businessman Andrew Yang, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii all have hit the fundraising goal but are short of the polling one. 2. All Iowa, all the time: My favorite state fair in the country \u2013 Iowa (sorry Texas!) \u2013 starts Thursday, and 2020 candidates will flood the fair (and the state) on its first weekend. Biden and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock will be at the fair on Friday, speaking from the Political Soapbox (it\u2019s just a raised platform in the middle of one of the fair\u2019s thoroughfares; it\u2019s also the site of Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201ccorporations are people too\u201d comment in 2012.) Every candidate will find a way onto that soapbox before the campaign is over. The following day \u2013 aka Saturday \u2013 is the state Democratic Party\u2019s Wing Ding \u2013 amazing name! \u2013 that will have a who\u2019s who on stage in search of Iowans\u2019 votes. The roster of candidates includes the Big Four: Biden, Harris, Sanders and Warren. 1. A(nother) gun control debate? Within the space of 13 hours, 29 people were killed in mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. CNN interviewed 7 presidential candidates on gun violence. Watch what they said about its ties to Trump This \u2013 mass casualties produced by shooters armed to the teeth \u2013 is not new. In fact, in the last two decades it\u2019s become numbingly normal. What\u2019s different about this is that the shootings happened so close to one another in time \u2013 and that nearly 30 people were killed in the two incidents. The question now is whether the time proximity will do anything to affect the stagnant politics around guns. To date, there\u2019s very little indication it will. O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas lawmaker who represented his hometown of El Paso in Congress, reacted to the shootings in the Lone Star State\u00a0by saying that President Donald Trump is a white nationalist \u2013 and suggested Trump had created a culture of intolerance and hate where these sorts of acts become more commonplace. A number of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2020 Democratic rivals echoed that sentiment; Sanders called for a ban on assault weapons. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (New York) said Sunday that Congress should come back to pass the House-approved universal background check law. But with Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of the Senate, any action on guns seems very unlikely. Especially when you consider that Congress is gone from Washington until after Labor Day.",

            "article_content": "The battle over health care exploded at Tuesday\u2019s CNN Democratic debate, with progressive and moderate candidates sparring over how far to go to overhaul the nation\u2019s system. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, along with fellow moderates Rep. Tim Ryan and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, all sought to defend their plans to build on the status quo \u2013 Obamacare \u2013 and portray Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on health care as too far to the left. They argued that \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which would establish a national health insurance system and essentially eliminate private insurance, would also dash Democratic prospects in the 2020 presidential election. That argument, over the policy itself and its political implications, has become the bloodiest battleground of this Democratic primary. Health care emerged as a winning issue in the 2018 midterms, but the Democratic Party remains divided over how to proceed in 2020 \u2013 at the same time as the Trump administration is waging a court battle to undo the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. Sanders and Warren are the only two top-tier candidates to back Medicare forall without apology or qualification. Former Vice President Joe Biden is a vocal opponent, while others, like California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, support plans that would move the American health care system in that direction but preserve some space for the private insurers to operate. But Sanders and Warren came prepared \u2013 and appeared energized by the chance to defend the bedrock progressive policy plan. Warren condemned Delaney\u2019s criticism as \u201cRepublican talking points,\u201d and Sanders suggested the former House member misunderstood the basic goal of the plan, which is to both change the way Americans both receive and perceive health care. The debate was heavy on substance, demonstrating the ideological divide at the heart of the contest. Delaney sought to highlight the potential problems that Medicare for All could create for the nation\u2019s health care system, saying that Medicare pays much less than private insurance. Hospitals, particularly rural ones, couldn\u2019t afford the cut in reimbursements, he said, brushing aside Sanders\u2019 retort that hospitals will save money because they won\u2019t have to do as much billing and administrative tasks. \u201cI\u2019m the only one on the stage who actually has experience in the health care industry,\u201d said Delaney, who owned a health care firm and co-founded a lender to health care companies. \u201cAnd with all due respect, I don\u2019t think my colleagues understand the business.\u201d As he finished his sentence, Sanders shot back: \u201cIt\u2019s not a business.\u201d Sanders also pushed back against Ryan with a line that, before the debate had ended, his campaign had already slapped on a bumper sticker. Asked if he could promise union workers that Medicare for All would provide the same quality benefits they have now, Sanders argued Medicare for All would improve on them. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that, Bernie,\u201d Ryan jumped in. \u201cI do know,\u201d Sanders stormed back. \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u201d Warren, too, made a point of hitting out against the arguments against Medicare for All, lamenting moderates\u2019 use of what she described as \u201cRepublican talking points\u201d of warning that its implementation would throw people off their health care \u2013 without taking into serious account the system they would land in. Delaney set off Warren when he said Democrats risked becoming \u201cthe part of subtraction\u201d by enforcing an end to private plans. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear about this,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe are the Democrats. We are not about trying to take away health care from anyone. That\u2019s what the Republicans are trying to do.\u201d It was left to the author Marianne Williamson, an ally to Sanders and Warren on most policy issues, to offer one of the more convincing lines of skepticism. \u201cI do have concern about what the Republicans would say,\u201d she said. \u201cI do have concern that it will be difficult. I have concern that it will make it harder to win, and I have a concern that it\u2019ll make it harder to govern.\u201d Advocating for his bill, Sanders called the health care system \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and argued that a single-payer regime would provide stability for the health care industry. He praised the system in nearby Canada as a model, noting that it spends half of what America does on health care and that \u201cwhen you end up in a hospital in Canada, you come out with no bill at all.\u201d CNN moderator Jake Tapper might have caused the most uncomfortable moment for Warren when he asked whether her version of Medicare for All would include a middle class tax hike, as Sanders has said his bill would require. \u201cSo giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more. Middle-class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their health care,\u201d Warren said. That\u2019s the nut of Sanders\u2019 answer when he gets the question. But Warren was less direct. Given another chance to address if taxes would go up, Warren would only reiterated that \u201ctotal costs\u201d for middle-class families would go down. Though they were pinned back by Sanders and Warren much of the night, the moderates did not come unprepared \u2013 or without alternative plans of their own. Some opponents of Medicare for All coalesced around the idea of strengthening the existing federal health-care law \u2013 the Affordable Care Act as signed into law by former President Barack Obama \u2013 through a government-backed insurance plan, otherwise known as the public option. Among the supporters of that idea were Hickenlooper, Bullock and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who called it a \u201cbetter way\u201d to reach universal coverage. Biden, who debates on Wednesday night, has also hinged his plan on that promise. Klobuchar noted that not only did Obama advocate for a public option when he was president, but Sanders, as well, supported a recent bill that would implement the idea. Bullock noted that it \u201ctook us decades and false starts\u201d to pass the Affordable Care Act. \u201cSo let\u2019s actually build on it,\u201d he said. Others, like former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, argued for a hybrid plan that would place uninsured and underinsured Americans on Medicare. Delaney said his plan would provide universal health care with \u201cchoices.\u201d But at the heart of those proposals was an argument \u2013 at times explicit, other times implied \u2013 that Medicare for All would be a loser for Democrats in a general election. Leading that charge was Delaney, who said the Democrats threatening to take Americans off their private health plans \u2013 no matter what waited on the other side \u2013 were courting electoral disaster. \u201cMy dad, the union electrician, loved the health care he got from the IBEW. He would never want someone to take that away,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cHalf of Medicare beneficiaries now have Medicare Advantage, which is private insurance, or supplemental plans.\u201d Bullock echoed Delaney, suggesting Medicare for All would \u201c[rip] away quality health care from individuals.\u201d Hickenlooper argued for the preferable health-care solution \u201cwould be an evolution, not a revolution.\u201d And Buttigieg brought up his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d proposal to give Americans the option to change without kicking people off their existing plans. The South Bend mayor, who has staked out a middle ground between the progressives and moderates like Delaney and Hickenlooper, scored some points later on as the debate-within-the-debate dragged when he advised the field to pay less attention \u2013 and worry \u2013 to how Republicans might try to weaponize the Democratic debate against them. \u201cIf it\u2019s true that if we embrace a far-left agenda, they\u2019re going to say we\u2019re a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they\u2019re going to do? They\u2019re going to say we\u2019re a bunch of crazy socialists,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cSo let\u2019s just stand up for the right policy, go out there and defend it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony Wednesday has drawn a near-unanimous response from the Democratic primary field: The case against President Donald Trump is clear \u2013 but it\u2019s nothing new. By early evening, most of the candidates \u2013 either in tweets or emails to supporters \u2013 had shifted their attention back to the topics dominating the primary: health care, race relations and the economy. In social media posts and comments to reporters during Mueller\u2019s roughly seven-hour appearance, the Democrats roundly affirmed their belief that Trump had obstructed the special counsel\u2019s probe, a determination, they said, that became apparent months ago, when Mueller\u2019s report was made public. \u201cWe all read the hardcover. The audiobook version was no different,\u201d one aide to a leading campaign told CNN. A top aide to another candidate echoed that, saying Mueller\u2019s testimony would not alter the campaign\u2019s strategy. \u201cThis didn\u2019t change anything we have planned going forward,\u201d the aide said. On the trail, the candidates were anything but united. Former Vice President Joe Biden attacked Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who had called him an \u201carchitect of mass incarceration,\u201d over Booker\u2019s record as mayor of Newark. Biden also targeted Sen. Kamala Harris of California, over her insistence that \u201cMedicare for All\u201d could be paid for without raising taxes on the middle class. And Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 team pushed back against Biden\u2019s latest comments about the plan. Meanwhile, Mueller\u2019s careful testimony quickly turned into an afterthought. By repeatedly referring to his report and refusing to answer questions, Mueller denied Democrats the kind of slam-bang moment likely to alter the dynamics of the presidential race or the status quo in Congress, where House Democrats remain divided on whether to pursue impeachment proceedings. Even among the 2020 candidates who have been more outspoken in their support for impeachment, the message on Wednesday was familiar: The report on its own should be evidence enough to jolt the Congress into action. Asked about Mueller\u2019s remark that Trump had not, as the President falsely claimed, been exonerated, Sen. Elizabeth Warren told reporters the contradiction had been plain to see for a long time. \u201cThat was clear in reading his report,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat said. \u201cThe day the report came out, I sat down and read it, I read into the night and early into the next morning, and when I got to the end, it was clear to me.\u201d In a tweet, Warren made her point again: \u201cI read the Mueller report the day it came out. Three things were clear: A hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election, Trump welcomed their help, and Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack. I agree with (the NAACP, which voted unanimously this week to call for impeachment) \u2014 it\u2019s time to begin impeachment proceedings.\u201d A number of other candidates in Detroit for the NAACP convention sounded a similar line. \u201cI am very clear,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI am very clear that there are outlined incidents of obstruction of justice, and no matter what this current attorney general and President try to say, the American people are smart enough to know what is and what it is not true.\u201d Booker also pointed to the Mueller report, saying it \u201cseems quite clear that he spelled out\u201d evidence showing Trump\u2019s efforts to interfere with the investigation. Booker\u2019s campaign had predicted where the testimony would go just as it started, and Mueller began to takes questions about the legal guidelines some Democrats believe unduly circumscribed his findings. \u201cAs we all tune in to Robert Mueller testifying today, a reminder that @CoryBooker believes that no one is above the law - including the president - and supports reversing the (Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel) guidance,\u201d Booker press secretary Sabrina Singh tweeted early on Wednesday morning. Warren has said the same, pledging in May to \u201cappoint Justice Department officials who will reverse flawed policies so no President is shielded from criminal accountability.\u201d During his testimony, Mueller frequently pointed to that Office of Legal Counsel policy, which says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime. He said that prevented his team from even considering whether to make a determination as to whether Trump had committed one. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, reiterated his support for an impeachment inquiry ahead of Mueller\u2019s testimony but was also quick to note the roadblocks ahead. Mueller and the Office of Legal Counsel rule on prosecuting a president \u201cThere was more than enough in (the Mueller) report to interpret it as an impeachment referral,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI believe that an impeachment inquiry would bring more facts to light, I also believe the Republican Senate will not act, and so I\u2019m focusing on the best thing I can do about the Trump presidency, which is to defeat in November 2020.\u201d Onstage at the NAACP forum, Sanders, who has also called for the start of an impeachment inquiry, pointed to what had already been presented in Mueller\u2019s report. \u201cLook, we know for a fact the President did everything that he could to obstruct the investigation,\u201d the Vermont independent said. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, a pair of Texans who clashed mightily on the debate stage last month in Miami, were in lockstep when responding to the hearing. \u201cThis hearing only confirms the facts: Trump invited an attack on our democracy, obstructed the investigation into it, & made clear there won\u2019t be consequences for launching another,\u201d O\u2019Rourke tweeted a little before noon. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said since I was running in TX, he\u2019s unfit for office. Begin impeachment proceedings now.\u201d A little more than an hour later, Castro said about the same: \u201cMueller\u2019s testimony today underlined what was already clear: the President of the United States broke the law and would be under criminal indictment if not for the fact that he holds that office. He is not above the law. Congress should begin impeachment proceedings.\u201d Biden, who has been more cautious on the question, told reporters later in the day during a stop in Michigan that his position hadn\u2019t changed. \u201cI stand where I did on impeachment,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there are impeachable offenses that the President should be tried for but I think it\u2019s something that the House has to come about in an orderly way so that the American people understand that this is not done for political reasons.\u201d Daniella Diaz and Jasmine Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday defended his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill against escalating attacks from critics like former Vice President Joe Biden, while also challenging the Democratic primary field to reject donations from private health insurance and pharmaceutical interests. \u201cIf we are going to break the stranglehold of corporate interests over the health care needs of the American people, we have got to confront a Washington culture that is corrupt, that puts profits ahead of the needs of the people,\u201d Sanders said in a speech. \u201cThat is why today I am calling on every Democratic candidate in this election to join me in rejecting money from the insurance and drug companies. Reject that money.\u201d Sanders\u2019 call capped off a contentious week that saw Biden unveil his own health care proposal, which would greatly enhance Obamacare\u2019s subsidies to help people by coverage and create a public insurance option. During the rollout, Biden leveled attacks \u2013 some of them misleading \u2013 against Medicare for All and what a transition to a single-payer program would mean for people covered under the existing system. Biden\u2019s comments added fuel to a long-running debate in the Democratic Party, and among its presidential candidates, over how to expand government-backed coverage while most Republicans continue to seek its demolition. Speaking at George Washington University, Sanders \u2013 without naming Biden \u2013 also lashed out at the \u201chalf-truths, misinformation and in some cases outright lies that are being spread about Medicare for All.\u201d Bernie Sanders accuses Biden of 'misinformation' in pitched battle over 'Medicare for All' \u201cMedicare for All critics tell us that Americans just love their private health insurance companies,\u201d Sanders said as the friendly audience laughed along. \u201cYou know what? I have never met one person who loves their insurance company. I have met many people who do love their doctors and their nurses who have very good experiences in their hospitals. And what we do is to say you can go to those doctors, you can go to those hospitals, but you\u2019re not going to have to anymore deal with ripoff insurance companies.\u201d Aides to Sanders and Biden scrapped on Twitter ahead of the Wednesday speech, after the Sanders campaign accused Biden of lying in his recent remarks about Medicare for All and how it would affect people currently on programs like Medicare. \u201cBiden absolutely did lie when he echoed Donald Trump\u2019s lies by telling seniors\u2019 @BernieSanders will throw them off Medicare \u2013 and Biden should now have to explain himself,\u201d Sanders speechwriter David Sirota tweeted. That prompted a response from Biden spokesman Bill Russo, who posted a screencap from a piece of the bill and added, \u201cSection 901 of the Medicare for All Act lays it out: Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP as they exist today go away. Defend your replacement all you want, but the bill pretty clear that existing federal health programs go away. Biden told the truth.\u201d The Biden camp was correct in the most narrow terms \u2013 those programs, \u201cas they exist today,\u201d would indeed \u201cgo away.\u201d But people covered through them would be insured through Medicare for All. Seniors would actually get better benefits than they have now from Medicare since Sanders\u2019 plan would also provide vision, dental and hearing aids and would eliminate all premiums and out-of-pocket costs. The \u201cpledge\u201d Sanders introduced during the speech asks that Democratic presidential candidates \u201crefuse to knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, lobbyists, or top executives of health insurance or pharmaceutical companies.\u201d Donations from \u201crank-and-file\u201d industry employees would not come under scrutiny. Sanders gave a preview of his Wednesday comments \u2013 and a widening effort to hit back against Biden \u2013 a day earlier, when his campaign posted an interactive quiz on its website asking supporters if they could identify \u201cwho said it\u201d about Medicare for All. The options \u2013 underneath a series of six quotes \u2013 included Biden, Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and former President Barack Obama, whose praise for single-payer during a 2003 speech was featured in the final question. The shots continued later in the day during a live-streamed video chat, when Sanders responded to Biden\u2019s suggestion last week that Americans risk \u201ca hiatus\u201d of months or years as officials push for Medicare for All, by saying he wanted \u201ca health care debate on the facts and not on fear-mongering.\u201d The two most recent editions of Sanders\u2019 legislation include a four-year transition period, which would go into effect only after the bill was signed and a process set in place. The current system would remain in place until that time, and Americans would join the government program in stages over the four years. On Tuesday, Sanders argued that the duration of the phasing-in process was, in fact, cautious to the extreme. \u201cPeople are telling me that in the year 2019, after Medicare has already been around for over 50 years, when we have all kinds of technology, that somehow we really can\u2019t do it over a four-year period,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to answer the question, we\u2019re being pretty conservative here. I think it can be done quicker.\u201d Sanders on Wednesday also asked whether the Democratic candidates in the field who say they support Medicare for All, including his four Senate colleagues who signed on as cosponsors, are prepared to unequivocally reject any significant future role for private insurers. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised her hand during a debate last month when the candidates were asked if they\u2019d be willing to abolish the industry as part of establishing single-payer. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who wrote the bill\u2019s transition plan, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker have said private insurers should not be shut out entirely. California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 stance is less clear. She has insisted that Medicare for All would not completely wipe out the industry. But that is true only up to a point \u2013 with the bill only leaving room for, as Sanders himself has said, private insurers to cover certain elective procedures, like cosmetic surgery. Kamala Harris: My plan is not an elimination of Obamacare Asked on Tuesday what Medicare for All would translate to during a Harris administration, Harris told CNN her definition stated \u201cthat everyone will have access to health care and cost will not be a barrier.\u201d \u201cAs it relates to private insurance, there will still be supplemental insurance, but transitioning into Medicare for All will at some point reduce the requirement for insurance, because everyone will have access to health care,\u201d the California Democrat said, though she warned it might take more than four years to complete the transition. The role of those insurers, she added, would only be to \u201ccover what is not otherwise covered.\u201d Harris also said that she would not raise taxes on the middle class \u2013 only on wealthier Americans and Wall Street \u2013 to help pay for the program. The Sanders campaign has stated that tax hikes across the board would be required to make Medicare for All work, arguing that any added tax burden would effectively be canceled out by the elimination of health insurance premiums, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses. On Wednesday, Sanders senior adviser Jeff Weaver rejected Harris\u2019 suggestion that single-payer could function without those broader tax increases. \u201cI mean, without unicorns, magic wands \u2013 health care is not free,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThere\u2019s doctors, nurses that have to be paid. There\u2019s hospitals. You have to have to pay for it. People will paying less under Medicare for All than they are now, and that\u2019s the point.\u201d Annie Grayer and Tami Luhby contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Bipartisan Senate leaders are expressing optimism over budget talks, but a meeting between top lawmakers and administration officials concluded on Tuesday without a deal, despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying earlier that he hoped an agreement could be reached before the end of the day. As he left the meeting, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters talks had not resolved spending levels or domestic programs. Washington is flirting with a debt crisis. No one has a plan to stop it \u201cWe are trying to come up with an agreement, and one of the biggest questions is how to fund all the needs of the middle class on the domestic side,\u201d Schumer said. Earlier in the day, McConnell called the meeting with the top four congressional leaders from both parties and several top administration officials \u201cvery encouraging\u201d and said, \u201cOur hope is to make a deal before the day is over.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be too forward leaning in predicting an agreement, but it seems to me without exception everyone would like to,\u201d McConnell told reporters, saying that \u201cthe agreement would be a two-year caps deal\u201d and that \u201cit would also in all likelihood include the debt ceiling.\u201d If such a deal is reached by congressional leaders and the White House it would represent a significant and rare instance of bipartisan cooperation at a time when hostility between congressional Democrats and the administration continues to escalate amid the administration\u2019s resistance in the face of congressional investigation. The expectation is that any deal would raise spending caps and stave off $120 billion in automatic spending cuts to domestic and military programs required by sequestration. A two-year deal could also take a potentially contentious fiscal fight off the table in the run up to the 2020 presidential election. Schumer said earlier on Tuesday that the meeting was \u201cproductive,\u201d though he also pointed to potential roadblocks ahead. \u201cThere are still some significant issues outstanding, particularly the domestic side spending issues, things like health care and infrastructure and things that average middle-class folks need,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re having good discussions.\u201d The spending and debt ceiling negotiations come with a hard deadline \u2013 and hard consequences for failing to meet it. For Republicans, it would mean dramatic cuts to defense programs, a central GOP priority. Democrats would have to accept equally painful cuts to domestic programs, which have long been their top priority in talks. News of progress on a long-sought deal came after a meeting that also included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought. Both Schumer and McConnell were asked if they were confident that the White House officials they were negotiating with could speak for the President, who has turned his back on previous agreements. \u201cI had a really good session with the President just the two of us about a week ago about the options available to us when it comes to government spending over the next two years. A negotiated agreement with the House Democrats is the best of three alternatives,\u201d McConnell said, speaking of the reality of divided government and the need of the two parties to talk negotiate solutions. \u201cTrust but verify,\u201d Schumer said.  \u201cObviously, we need the President to publicly sign off on whatever we agree to.\u201d CNN\u2019s Haley Byrd and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump, still seething over a major firefighters union\u2019s endorsement of former Vice President Joe Biden, retweeted nearly five dozen tweets on Wednesday rebuffing Biden\u2019s claim to support from firefighters. The 58 retweets before 6:30 a.m. ET sought to make the case that while the International Association of Fire Fighters\u2019 leadership supports Biden, many firefighters themselves support Trump. While the retweets \u2013 which included a parody account \u2013 did not conclusively make that case, the spree belied Trump\u2019s public claims that he is not concerned about the prospect of facing Biden in the 2020 general election. Biden responded during a campaign stop Wednesday in Iowa, joking that he expects to \u201cbe the object of his (Trump\u2019s) attention for a while.\u201d \u201cI understand the President\u2019s been tweeting about me this morning for a while. I wonder why he\u2019s doing that?\u201d Biden said. Earlier in the day, Biden\u2019s communications director tweeted of Trump: \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t seem concerned at all.\u201d The Point: Donald Trump is doing a terrible job disguising his worries about facing Joe Biden in 2020 Trump addressed his early-morning Twitter tear on Wednesday night, telling Fox Business\u2019 Trish Regan in a phone interview that while Biden got the union\u2019s endorsement, its members would still vote for him. \u201cI don\u2019t care, no. It just seemed to me what happened is, you know the firemen love Trump, the policemen love Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThe international comes out \u2013 and they always do, they have for many, many years \u2013 but they go with the Democrat, with Joe,\u201d Trump added. \u201cAnd the firemen and women, they went crazy when they saw it. They went absolutely crazy because they\u2019re going to be voting for me. They\u2019re all going to be voting for me. I had it the last time.\u201d Trump also argued that Biden would be an easier 2020 opponent, predicting that the former vice president would fail to incorporate the far left in uniting the Democratic Party and drawing a parallel to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s struggles garnering progressive support in 2016. \u201cI think Biden would be easier from the standpoint that you will have so much dissension in the party, because it\u2019ll make four years ago look like baby stuff,\u201d he told Regan. \u201cThey want the radical left \u2013 they want the left movement \u2013 and he probably isn\u2019t there,\u201d Trump added. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re going to have tremendous dissension just like Hillary did.\u201d Privately, Trump has worried for weeks about Biden\u2019s appeal to voters in the Rust Belt states that helped deliver the President\u2019s 2016 victory. In the first week of Biden\u2019s candidacy, Trump has failed to keep those concerns private. Trump\u2019s tweets also marked the latest instance of the President rejecting the advice he has gotten in recent weeks: to avoid taking any top Democratic candidate on one-on-one at the risk of boosting their chances of securing the Democratic nomination. The President\u2019s retweets highlighted support from people who claimed to know or be firefighters who support Trump, not Biden, despite the International Association of Fire Fighters\u2019 endorsement of Biden. \u201cI\u2019ve done more for Firefighters than this dues sucking union will ever do, and I get paid ZERO!\u201d Trump claimed early Wednesday morning, before diving into the five dozen retweets. One account, whose author claimed their husband was a longtime New York firefighter and would be voting for Trump in 2020, changed its name to \u201cF*** Donald Trump\u201d after the President retweeted it. The author \u2013 who replaced the account\u2019s avatar of a woman with a \u201cBernie 2020\u201d logo \u2013 then wrote, \u201cWhat a great morning. In all seriousness, our president is an awful, hateful human being who wants nothing more than to keep the status quo and hatred prevalent in our country.\u201d A CNN poll conducted by SSRS after Biden\u2019s announcement last week cemented his status as the Democratic front-runner, with 39% of voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents saying he is their top choice for the nomination. Biden has highlighted his longstanding support for trade unions and his appeal to blue-collar workers across the country. \u201cI am a union man,\u201d Biden said during his first campaign rally, flanked by members of the firefighters\u2019 union. Trump goes after Biden \u2014 and against advisers' advice After Trump slammed union leaders last Friday, Biden hit back. \u201cI\u2019m sick of this President badmouthing unions,\u201d Biden tweeted. \u201cLabor built the middle class in this country. Minimum wage, overtime pay, the 40-hour week: they exist for all of us because unions fought for those rights. We need a President who honors them and their work.\u201d Trump has appeared unnerved at Biden\u2019s candidacy and support from unions, and has launched attacks on the former vice president despite advice from some of his political advisers not to get sucked into a tit-for-tat with any of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination. Several of the President\u2019s political advisers have warned him against targeting Biden and responding to Democratic candidates\u2019 attacks, wary that Trump might elevate a potential rival, sources have told CNN. During meetings at the White House, Trump often asked about Biden\u2019s strength as a candidate as Biden itched closer to officially jumping into the race. In his presidential campaign announcement and Tuesday\u2019s trip to Iowa, Biden lambasted Trump over his response to the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

            "article_content": "Free college is emerging as the new hot topic on the 2020 campaign trail. The term, which Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders helped make mainstream during his previous presidential bid, has become a catchall for a variety of plans aimed at making college more affordable. \u201cSome version of free or debt-free college \u2013 or a bold proposal on college affordability \u2013 is now the barrier to entry into this conversation,\u201d said Mark Huelsman, associate policy director at the liberal think tank Demos. Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a new plan Monday that would make tuition and fees free for all students at public colleges \u2013 while also expanding financial aid so that it can be used to cover additional costs like housing, food, books and child care for students who need it. She wants to invest an additional $100 billion in Pell grants over the next 10 years, making them available to more students and increasing the size of the award. Currently, the lowest-income students are eligible to receive about $6,200 a year from the federal Pell program. Warren\u2019s plan goes even further than making college more affordable to help those who already have student debt \u2013 differentiating herself from the rest of the field. It would cancel up to $50,000 in student loans for households that make less than $100,000 a year, with the amount of relief getting gradually smaller as income level goes up. Households that make more than $250,000 would not be eligible for any debt relief. She explained her reasoning for the proposal at her CNN town hall on Monday night. \u201cThis is the America we live in now,\u201d she said. \u201cBasically to get a shot at a middle class life you\u2019ve got to have some post high school technical training, two-year college, four-year college, maybe graduate school depending on who you are and what you\u2019re ending up doing. The position of the federal government has been, good luck to you, you\u2019re on your own. The one thing they\u2019ve done, they have \u2026 lent tens of thousands of dollars to students.\u201d \u201cIt is crushing them.\u201d Several candidates have already expressed support for making sure students can graduate without debt. Last month, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Warren \u2013 all presidential contenders \u2013 signed on to co-sponsor Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz\u2019s Debt-Free College Act. It would establish a matching grant to states that commit to helping students pay for the full cost of attendance \u2013 including tuition, books and other expenses \u2013 without taking out loans. Tackling those other expenses differs slightly from Sanders\u2019 proposals, which focus more on making tuition and fees free at public colleges. His 2015 proposal offered to make those free for everyone, but a 2017 bill scaled back eligibility based on income \u2013 its language built on a compromise proposal agreed on between Sanders and Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. Here are the 18 Democrats who have said they're running for president His legislation would make community college free and four-year public colleges free for students whose families earn less than $125,000. It would also ensure that low-income students could still use federal Pell grants for books, housing, transportation and other expenses. But not every candidate is embracing free college. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, worried about the national debt, said at a CNN town hall in February that she supports free community college and expanding financial aid for low-income students, but rejected the idea of making all public colleges free. \u201cI am not for free four-year college for all, no,\u201d Klobuchar said, adding: \u201cIf I was a magic genie and could afford to give that to everyone I would.\u201d Klobuchar reiterated that on Monday at her CNN town hall in New Hampshire: \u201cI wish I could staple a free college diploma under every one of your chairs. I do. Don\u2019t look. It\u2019s not there. I wish I could do that, but I have to be straight with you and tell you the truth.\u201d Candidate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has also stopped short of endorsing a free college plan. \u201cAs a progressive, I have a hard time getting my head around the idea,\u201d Buttigieg said during an appearance at Northeastern University last month. On Monday, Buttigieg said he thought Warren\u2019s plan was \u201cpretty appealing,\u201d but suggested that any major movement on the issue should follow similarly large scale changes to how Americans are taxed. \u201cI\u2019m not as certain I\u2019m comfortable with people of that high an income participating\u201d in Warren\u2019s debt forgiveness plan, he told his CNN town hall audience, \u201cuntil we have completed the transition to a more progressive tax code.\u201d He argued that making college free would be asking lower-income Americans to subsidize others who will earn college degrees and are likely to end up in higher-paying careers. But he also called for expanding Pell grants, allowing borrowers to refinance their federal student loans and making sure loan forgiveness is available to teachers and other public sector workers. The conversation about free college has come far since President Barack Obama made a splash with his announcement in 2015 that he wanted to make two years of community college free for students who maintained a minimum GPA and performed some community service while in school. It never happened on a national level, but several red and blue states, as well as cities, have enacted some version of a tuition-free law \u2013 including New York, Oregon, Tennessee and Rhode Island. \u201cObama sparked the issue a bit, and Sanders got a lot of attention in 2016, but the progress we have seen has really been at the state level,\u201d said Ryan Morgan, senior adviser for the Campaign for Free College Tuition. \u201cFree college is so popular and has such strong bipartisan support that it\u2019s something elected officials up and down the ballot want to run on,\u201d he added. While four red states have enacted free college polices in the past year, federal legislation has failed to gain traction from Republicans.

Kamala Harris of California released 15 years of her tax returns, the most of any 2020 Presidential candidate. Harris released her taxes from 2004 to 2018, \u201cmaking her the most transparent candidate in the field when it comes to information about personal finances,\u201d said a campaign aide. \u201cThis is a stark contrast with President Trump, who refuses to release his tax returns.\u201d House committee sends new letter to IRS demanding Trump's tax returns The aide added Harris supports congressional legislation requiring a president\u2019s tax returns be made public. Sanders, who has repeatedly promised to release his tax returns and recently revealed his book deals made him a millionaire, is expected to release his returns on Monday, the tax filing deadline for 2018. According to Harris\u2019 tax returns reviewed by CNN and Tim Steffen, director of Advance Planning at Baird, the California Democrat and her attorney husband, Douglas Emhoff, reported an adjusted gross income for 2018 of $1,889,156. Emhoff, an entertainment and intellectual property lawyer and law partner at DLA Piper Law Firm, brings in the overwhelming bulk of the couple\u2019s wealth and investments. Harris\u2019 returns show she earned $157,352 as a US senator. Harris reported a net income of $320,125 from her writing \u2014 she published \u201cThe Truths We Hold\u201d earlier this year. In 2018, the couple donated $27,259 to charity \u2013 among the recipients were Harris\u2019 alma mater, Howard University at $5,000, and South Central Scholars, a scholarship program for high-achieving, low-income students. Over the last five years, Harris and her husband paid more than $2.2 million in federal taxes, at an approximate 33% tax rate. In the 10 years before Harris married, she paid just under $350,000 in federal taxes. Steffen says prior to her married tax filing in 2014, Harris\u2019 filings over the previous decade had a fairly basic tax return. Her income while in public office also shows a decline as she climbed from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general. Her election to the state office sliced about $43,000 off her salary. The state AG salary also dropped year after year, due to state mandated pay cuts for state salaries in the wake of the financial crisis. Steffen says according to his analysis, Trump\u2019s tax cut act had little impact on Harris\u2019 personal taxes. In her campaign for president, Harris has repeatedly called for a repeal of Trump\u2019s tax plan. As a US senator, Harris has introduced a middle class tax plan, that she calls her LIFT Act. She also pledges should she win the Presidency, she would increase teacher pay through federal funding.",

            "article_content": "The House Democrats\u2019 divide over health care will be on full display Tuesday, when leaders plan to fulfill their midterm election promise by rolling out comprehensive legislation to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. The bill aims to protect people with pre-existing conditions, as well as lower health care costs and reverse the Trump administration\u2019s moves to weaken Obamacare. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, along with several committee chairs and freshman lawmakers, are set to unveil the legislation at a public event designed to mark the ninth anniversary of the signing of the landmark health care law. Your cheat sheet to all the 2020 Democrats' 'Medicare for All' plans What\u2019s not in the bill? Anything resembling a universal \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, a version of which was introduced by Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Debbie Dingell of Michigan last month and has more than 100 co-sponsors. Pelosi acknowledged the goal of universal health care in a statement over the weekend, saying: \u201cAs we mark the 9th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, we reaffirm our commitment to this fundamental truth: that health care must be a right, not a privilege, for all Americans.\u201d But party leaders continue to slow walk the Medicare for All bill through the House. No hearings are scheduled, though the Rules and Budget committees have said they would hold hearings on the concept of so-called \u201csingle payer\u201d programs, in which the federal government would have an expanded role in health care. Jayapal\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment. Trump administration now says entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down House leaders are taking several steps to lower costs and shore up Obamacare, even as the landmark law comes under new legal threat from a lawsuit by Republican-led states. On Monday, the Trump administration dropped its previous support for elements of the law, instead siding with a lower court judge who ruled in December that the entire law should be invalidated in a case that may make its way to the Supreme Court. Tuesday\u2019s House bill calls for increasing subsidies and allowing more middle class Americans to qualify. It would also provide additional funding for states to implement publicly-backed reinsurance programs, which reduce premiums by shielding insurance companies from high-cost enrollees. House progressives unveil their Medicare for all bill The bill would also reverse the Trump administration\u2019s rules that make it easier for Americans to buy short-term policies that don\u2019t provide all of the protections required under the Affordable Care Act. Consumer advocates are concerned that these plans will draw healthy people out of the exchanges leaving sicker folks in the system \u2013 which in turn would drive up premiums. It would also curtail the administration\u2019s efforts to allow states to waive certain protections for those with pre-existing conditions, including weakening the standards for the benefits that insurers must provide, such as prescription drugs and maternity. And the legislation would restore funding for enrollment assistance and outreach for the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration slashed the budgets for advertising and sign-up aid, which many advocates say prompted fewer people to participate. \u201cThe American people spoke loudly in November for exactly what this bill does,\u201d said Leslie Dach, a former Obama administration official and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group seeking to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s a giant step forward to providing lower-cost, better care and ending sabotage.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren said she does not support term limits in Congress while speaking at a town hall in New Hampshire on Sunday. \u201cHere\u2019s the problem on term limits on folks in Congress \u2013 it makes them more dependent than ever on the lobbyist. Believe me, if the senators only stay for two terms, the lobbyist will be there a lot longer and they\u2019ll know how the game is played,\u201d the senator, who\u2019s running for president, told an audience member at the town hall in Conway, New Hampshire. \u201cIt worries me that it will make them even more dependent on big money.\u201d Warren said that without term limits, she\u2019s been able to use the money she raises during election years for a grassroots campaign in her home state of Massachusetts. \u201cWhen I ran in 2018, I wasn\u2019t nearly as dependent because I knew people, people knew me in Massachusetts,\u201d she said. \u201cSo instead, I took the money and started building grassroots. We had more paid organizers, so young people, people who\u2019ve never done this before got a chance to become organizers.\u201d She continued: \u201cAnd here\u2019s the deal, they not only worked on my campaign and helped me win, and they did, but they\u2019re also out there now to work on my campaign again or to work on other campaigns. To be part of rebuilding democracy.\u201d Warren, who campaigns on the promise of getting rid of money in politics and improving the economy for the middle class, told the audience of 200 in Conway, New Hampshire, she believes the better option is to \u201cgo with the money straight on.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t need a constitutional amendment for any part of this,\u201d she added.

            "article_content": "When Katie Hill opened the heavy wooden door to her new congressional office in the Longworth House Office Building, one feeling smacked her in the gut. No other Congress has ever looked like this \u201cWell, this doesn\u2019t feel like me,\u201d recalled the freshman congresswoman from California\u2019s 25th District. \u201cSo yeah, this very formal place being my home base does feel strange,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t want to become more formal. That\u2019s not on the table.\u201d Hill argues her life doesn\u2019t allow her to embrace any of the formal trappings of Washington. Raised in suburban Los Angeles, she prefers sneakers to heels. She\u2019s a Democrat and the daughter of a Republican police officer and survived a sexual assault. Socially conscious, she married a man but identifies as bisexual. The thrust of her career has been in non-profits, as an advocate for the homeless. She also embraces the sexist criticism, known as \u201cresting bitch face,\u201d about a serious woman (like her) not smiling while thinking. This isn\u2019t the sort of resume or life story that typically precedes a seat in Congress, but that\u2019s just fine with Hill and the voters who elected her. An unconventional woman, the 31-year-old joins the 116th Congress, the most diverse legislature in history by many measures \u2014 gender, race and sexual orientation. Refusing to change is part of the internal feedback loop in Hill\u2019s first days in Washington. Sometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom. We\u2019re about to be sworn in. Let\u2019s do this. pic.twitter.com/8zmyMbgvb9 Hill won with an insurgent campaign spurred by the 2016 election. She channeled her anger at the victory of President Donald Trump by taking aim at her congressman, Rep. Steve Knight, who voted with fellow House Republicans in May 2017 to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWho is going to run against him?\u201d Hill typed out on her social media accounts. A friend said, \u201cWhy not you?\u201d Why not, thought Hill. A year and a half later, Hill flipped the suburban Los Angeles district for Democrats. The first-time candidate had started her grassroots campaign out of a rented apartment backed by a hoodie-wearing millennial staff, chain-sipping La Croix sparkling water. The team raised more than $8 million without taking a cent in corporate or special interest money. Women candidates challenged by history, party and sexism Hill won over voters as a progressive advocate for affordable housing while offering a pragmatic willingness to work across party lines for her purple district. Trying to fit into Washington is not why Hill was elected nor does it sit anywhere on her agenda. \u201cPlaying nice isn\u2019t really something that\u2019s in my vocabulary,\u201d she said. \u201cI just do what I think is right.\u201d That philosophy may sound quaint, even naive, for Washington, but Hill believes that\u2019s the shared sentiment among the incoming freshmen congressional class. A record-setting 127 women were elected to the 116th Congress, the majority of whom are Democrats. More African Americans, Latinos and LGBTQ members now serve in Congress. The legislature also saw its median age drop by approximately a decade with its newly elected members. Hill is notable for her youth as well as being California\u2019s first openly bisexual woman elected to Congress. But it\u2019s the sheer size of the freshman class, at 92 new members with 46 flipped seats in the 2018 midterm election, that\u2019s politically powerful to her. On the eve of her swearing-in to Congress, Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar remembers arriving as a refugee to the US Traditionally, new legislators have been expected to wait their turn while more seasoned members drove the agenda. But this time, and in this age, the newbies are demanding their voices be heard. \u201cI think we have enough power and enough strength in numbers and enough of a strong mandate from voters that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to stay true to the things that we ran on,\u201d said Hill, who was elected to the Democratic House leadership team as one of two new members representing freshmen. The result, she hopes, will be in them governing differently. Top of Hill\u2019s agenda is focusing on a more equitable system, from health care to taxes to housing. Hill believes the biggest problem with Washington has been the \u201cbillionaire class\u201d being controlled by special interest donors and ignoring the needs of the politically powerless. \u201cWe are regular, middle class people,\u201d said Hill, the now third-youngest member of Congress (behind Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Iowa\u2019s Abby Finkenauer.) \u201cWe\u2019re young. We look like and speak like the people that we\u2019re there to represent. We\u2019re not people who came up through the political process. The majority of us are first-time candidates. We\u2019re not stuck in the old way of doing things,\u201d she said. This Freshman class is larger, younger, and more diverse than ever before and that\u2019s not a coincidence \u2013 it\u2019s a call to action. Yesterday @JoeNeguse and I were elected to be the Co-Representatives to Leadership for this historic class and we are so ready to get to work. pic.twitter.com/GZv3FUElNe Hill spoke to CNN as she made the flight to Washington from Burbank, California, inviting us to chronicle her journey from candidate to congresswoman-elect to swearing in. A millennial, Hill embraces the sharing philosophy of her generation via social media and speaks easily with reporters as cameras roll. She\u2019s shared on Twitter and Facebook her personal stories about surviving sexual assault and an unplanned pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. In her unconventional political ads, she went rock climbing. As Hill checked in for the 6:45 a.m. flight, she remarked, \u201cI\u2019ve never lived outside of California or traveled with so many bags.\u201d For the record, there were three suitcases. She wore athletic clothing for the flight, noticing then, under the bright fluorescent lights of the ticket counter, that her black pants were covered in her dog\u2019s white hair. \u201cOh well,\u201d she said, as she walked towards airport security. Her goal, she said, is to demystify Congress by bringing her voters with her on this journey and through her entire term, dog hair and all. \u201cI think what I, and many of the other freshmen have, what\u2019s kind of unique, is this sort of ability to relate to people in a different way.\u201d I left my house in SoCal and it was 37 degrees, landed in DC and it's more than 50 degrees here! What a warm welcome! \u2600\ufe0fCan\u2019t believe inauguration is this week \u2014 I\u2019m so ready to get to work. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc pic.twitter.com/UV28nRQPFO It\u2019s why on Hill\u2019s Twitter feed she\u2019s posted frequent updates on her first impressions of Washington during new member orientation, known as \u201cCongress Camp.\u201d She talked about what committees she hoped to join to best represent her district, a sprawling community with suburban middle-class families and lower-income desert communities, and doesn\u2019t plan on slowing down the tweets. Hill signed the lease at her new home \u2013 a small, no frills, two-bedroom apartment that gives off a corporate, temporary housing sensibility. It\u2019s there she caught up with her roommate and fellow freshman, Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. Nearly the same age, the congresswomen initially give off a bubbly vibe of moving into a college dorm. You can only have tough dinner table conversations if you first get the dinner table! \ud83d\ude02 @LUnderwood630 is the best Ikea partner I could imagine \u2014 the true test of roommate compatibility! (And maybe our negotiation skills too...) pic.twitter.com/knACssVjXF But as Underwood talked, it became apparent that both carried the weight of their new elected jobs. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d said Underwood, who also flipped her district, defeating a Republican male incumbent. She is now the youngest black woman to ever serve in Congress. \u201cWe don\u2019t walk in and everything automatically changes.\u201d \u201cI would imagine there will be confrontations,\u201d said Hill. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be fights between the old guard and the new one. But I feel very optimistic that the existing leadership all want us to be part of this process. They recognize the change that\u2019s happening, and they\u2019re trying to include us.\u201d On inauguration morning, a crush of cameras greeted Hill, swarming around her as she tried to enter the Capitol to be sworn in. \u201cIt feels good. It feels like we can finally get to work,\u201d she said. She stepped into the US Capitol through the south door entrance and disappeared into the tunnel. Her cross-country journey had ended but her new role as Congresswoman Katie Hill had just begun.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. When the global elite are aligned against him and laughing like the immature cool kids you hated in middle school, President Donald Trump is winning. When the liberal law professors are neglecting their Thanksgiving turkeys to read congressional transcripts and snarking about Trump\u2019s 13-year old son, Trump is winning. When the politicians are mad \u2014 so mad that they have shut down all policymaking to impeach the President of the United States on what constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley called \u201cwafer thin\u201d evidence \u2014Trump is winning. You have to remember: Donald Trump wasn\u2019t elected to fit in with these people \u2014 the political, intellectual class \u2013 to make them happy, or to become one of them. He was elected to break them. And that\u2019s apparently what he\u2019s done. After Wednesday\u2019s House Judiciary Committee hearing featuring three liberal law professors and Thursday\u2019s announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that her conference is moving forward with impeachment, the die is cast \u2013 Donald Trump will be the third president in American history to be impeached by the House of Representatives. Is the impeachment process moving too quickly? And honestly, that\u2019s just fine with Trump\u2019s supporters. What better evidence is there that you\u2019ve shaken Washington to its core when the minders of a system you\u2019ve come to despise are leveling the gravest punishment the system permits against the very President who is doing the shaking up? We can lawyer this to death, but for many Americans this comes down to a simple observation \u2013 Trump said he was going to rattle their cages, and by golly they seem rattled. Trump\u2019s supporters have known since election night that this day would eventually come. After all, his sworn enemies have been openly promising it since before he was sworn into office! They\u2019ve used words like \u201cresistance,\u201d \u201ccoup,\u201d \u201cinsurance policy,\u201d and \u201cimpeachment\u201d so often that, now that they are actually doing it, the American people \u2014 and Republicans especially \u2014 are offering a collective yawn. Rueful analysts stare into television cameras, lamenting and wondering why Republicans aren\u2019t fleeing from the President over the impeachment hearings (he stands at 90% approval among his party in the latest Gallup poll). But there won\u2019t be massive convulsions in public opinion because everyone has known for three years what was going to happen. The only reasonable response to Trump Sure, some Democrats gamely argue that Pelosi didn\u2019t really want to go through with it, but she had to out of a sense of duty to the Constitution. But it\u2019s a half-hearted argument at best. It\u2019s true that Pelosi had no choice, although it\u2019s not because of the Constitution. Rather, her party\u2019s left flank and their inflamed grassroots activists overwhelmed her. This is a one-sided, partisan impeachment. It\u2019s the exact kind of thing Congressman Jerry Nadler, now chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, warned Republicans about in 1998, during Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. But political party leaders almost always do what the bulk of their party\u2019s supporters want them to. Republicans \u2014 no matter how moderate \u2014 got in line to cut taxes and confirm an avalanche of conservative judges because that\u2019s what their activists expected. And what have Democrats wanted more than anything since Trump\u2019s election? Since the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh? Since Trump made Twitter his private channel to the electorate? Since the Mueller probe? Since the Trump Hotel story? Since questions over Jared Kushner\u2019s security clearance? Since\u2026you name it? The answer is obvious: to undo the 2016 election by any means necessary. It\u2019s a political itch that had to be scratched, and Pelosi could hold off her tormented partisans no longer. Pelosi did what no one else could So here we are, headed for a rushed, hyper-partisan (and futile) exercise put on by the very elites Trump railed against to get himself elected in the first place. But for all the relief they might feel in finally striking this blow against Donald Trump, I wonder: have these Trump opponents even considered what this impeachment signals to the American people? That partisanship is more important than policymaking? That House Democrats have no confidence in their party\u2019s ability to beat Donald Trump in an election? And, perhaps most alarmingly, that impeachment \u2014 once reserved for the gravest of situations \u2014 is now just another tool to inflict damage on their political opponents.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. The American political debate over health care is absurd. Americans pay twice as much as any other nation for health care, and then are told daily that they \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d to switch to a lower-cost system very similar to those of Canada and Europe. If President Donald Trump and the plutocratic Republican party were the only ones carrying this ridiculous message, it would be understandable. Yet this message is also coming from media pundits aligned with the Democratic Party and the most conservative wing of the party. Let\u2019s be clear on the central point. Medicare for All, as first proposed by Bernie Sanders and endorsed by Elizabeth Warren, is affordable precisely because it is cheaper, much cheaper, than the current system. America\u2019s health care system relies on local monopolies (such as a health care provider centered at the sole major hospital in a city) and national monopolies, notably pharmaceutical companies holding exclusive patents. In other countries, the government sets delivery prices and typically pays the health bills through the budget. In the US, the monopolists set the prices. The sky-high revenues end up as huge corporate profits, wasteful administrative costs, useless and even harmful advertising and lavish salaries. Health care CEOs are making gargantuan salaries, many exceeding $10 million per year. Who loses? Almost all Americans, whose insurance costs and out-of-pocket outlays inevitably lead to lower income because of unaffordable health care costs, untreated chronic illnesses, premature mortality and personal bankruptcies. Single-payer systems such as in Canada and Europe are cheaper, fairer and have better outcomes. A recent international comparison of the performance of 11 national health systems on five main dimensions (care process, access, efficiency, equity and health care outcomes) ranked the US health system dead last. Despite all of this, the US pundits profess to be alarmed about the prospect of Medicare for All.  There has been a wave of op-eds and columns published (for example, here and here and here) declaring that Medicare for All would lead to massive tax increases, and that Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All threatens to reelect Trump. It\u2019s ridiculous. Economist: Warren is right. Her Medicare for All plan won't raise taxes on the middle class Both Sanders and Warren poll well against Trump, ahead in the overall popular vote (though like all Democrats, facing headwinds of the Electoral College). And at this stage of a national campaign, the goal should be to explain to voters the vast benefits of a single-payer system rather than to prejudge the politics based on self-fulfilling fearmongering. Yes, one way or another, taxes would rise with Medicare for All, but private health outlays would go down by much more. Total health costs would fall. That idea is not so hard to understand. One influential pundit, economist Paul Krugman, has come around. In the 2016 election cycle, Krugman railed against Medicare for All. Yet after Warren laid out her proposal, Krugman supported Medicare for All. In truth, he was simply returning to the economically sound observations that he had long made before 2016. The pundits seem to believe that Americans will rebel at \u201chigher taxes.\u201d Actually, Americans are much smarter than that. They know that their current private health care payments, whether insurance premiums or out-of-pocket, are nothing other than \u201ctaxes\u201d they pay to stay alive.  They\u2019ll agree to pay higher taxes to the government if those new taxes eliminate larger private health care bills \u2013 again, there are \u201ctaxes\u201d by any other name \u2013 that they now pay. Some mainstream pundits are simply repeating what they hear from Democratic Party conservatives and centrists, the wing that has been dominant since Clinton\u2019s election in 1992. They are following the lead of Nancy Pelosi, Pete Buttigieg and others who are trashing Medicare for All. 'Medicare for All' looks like a political loser for Democrats What in the world are these leading Democratic Party politicians doing in opposing the transition to a fairer, more efficient and lower cost health care system? I would suggest it\u2019s not a lack of understanding. It\u2019s the power of campaign financing. These Democrats are funded by the status quo. The health sector contributed $265 million to federal campaigns in 2018, of which 56% went to Democrats. The sector spends nearly $500 million per year on lobbying. Money talks.  Meanwhile, Americans go bankrupt or die early. There remains the issue of the best way to raise budget revenues for Medicare for All. The basic answer is to use progressive taxation to fund the program. In this way, the nation as a whole will pay much less for health care and the vast majority of households will as well. The highest income households will end up paying a bit more because their funds will not only finance their own health care but will help to pay the health care costs of the poorest households as well. Sanders rightly proposed a menu of options to pay for Medicare for All, including payroll and income taxation. Warren has proposed one specific approach: progressive taxes on the super-rich and the corporate sector but also a surprisingly regressive \u201chead tax\u201d on companies. She took great pride in not charging a penny of new income or payroll taxes on middle class households. But the proposed head tax on companies would hit wages indirectly and regressively. Still, both Sanders\u2019 and Warrens\u2019 approaches would result in a more equitable and less expensive system. For most households, overall health care costs will decline.  The most worrisome thing about Warren\u2019s statement as she introduced her Medicare for All plan, is her emphasis on \u201cnot one penny\u201d of new middle-class taxes. Here we go again. The Democrats have, for far too long, copied the Republican mantra about \u201cno new taxes,\u201d even as our public debt soars, our infrastructure and public services collapse and inequality reaches stratospheric dimensions. To honor the silly stricture of \u201cno new taxes\u201d directly paid by middle-class households, Warren ended up endorsing a regressive head tax paid by the employer, which would end up hitting lower-wage workers even though its paid by their employers. Let\u2019s hope this blunder is a one-time stumble for Warren. Most importantly, both Sanders and Warren are pointing the correct way to reform America\u2019s costly, unfair and inefficient health care system. And this is a goal that most Americans support.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of \u201cSE Cupp Unfiltered.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion on CNN. It\u2019s become the political buzzword over the past few years, increasingly used to describe the root cause of our divisions and our resentments: tribalism. The idea that Americans are more divided than ever, entrenched in ideological camps and unwilling to meet in the middle, is so pervasive that one hardly goes a single hour without hearing about it on a cable news show. Since 2016, numerous books by very smart people, including Jonah Goldberg, Amy Chua, Steve Kornacki, Stevan E. Hobfoll, Sarah Rose Cavanagh and others have been devoted to tracing, explaining or solving America\u2019s tribalism. But is tribalism really to blame? It\u2019s more complicated than that. Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA. The need to identify with a group, to belong and commune with like-minded people is not only biological, it\u2019s what has helped motivate our desire for and devotion to all kinds of important cultural institutions, from organized religion to sports fandom. What isn\u2019t natural, however, is the oversized importance we\u2019re increasingly putting on politics. Tribalism, of course, is a compelling argument, considering that we\u2019ve reduced our political beliefs to untenable absolutisms, have sacrificed compromise and comity for purity and are subjecting each other to increasingly unproductive tests of loyalty. We are more and more defined not by our friends but our political enemies \u2014 collecting them like badges of honor. It was actually a question at a 2015 Democratic debate: \u201cWhich enemy are you most proud of?\u201d None of the five candidates batted an eyelash, eagerly rattling off their political hit lists. Hillary Clinton was practically giddy: \u201cWell, in addition to the NRA,\u201d she said, \u201cthe health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians. Probably the Republicans.\u201d Biden defends working with Republicans ahead of possible 2020 bid This election feels somehow even worse. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden has been harassed by people in his own party for complimenting Republican lawmakers, for seeming to be congenial, for vowing to work across the aisle if elected. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders insist if you\u2019re not as far to the left as they are, you\u2019re lacking intestinal fortitude. And on the right, we all know how that goes. President Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that anyone not fully behind them is an enemy, and maybe isn\u2019t even an American \u2014 the latter of which Trump alluded to in a series of racist tweets targeting four women lawmakers of color. That is tribalism by definition. But we can\u2019t throw it completely under the bus or out with the bathwater. After all, we literally can\u2019t live without it. Forming communities \u2014 even and especially ones based on strong loyalties and allegiances \u2014 is in our DNA. It\u2019s what\u2019s kept us alive for millions of years. As UCLA professor Matthew Lieberman wrote in his 2013 book, \u201cSocial: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect,\u201d \u201cMammals are more socially connected than reptiles, primates more than other mammals, and humans more than other primates. What this suggests is that becoming more socially connected is essential to our survival. In a sense, evolution has made bets at each step that the best way to make us more successful is to make us more social.\u201d The need for community, to belong to something, is one important reason two very powerful communities have thrived: organized religion and professional sports. Both communities are organized around intense allegiances, often with the explicit requirement that adherents reject and disavow competing entities. Few worshipers believe equally in the major tenets of Christianity and Judaism \u2014 that Jesus is both the Messiah and that he\u2019s not. Almost no baseball fans root equally for the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. That would be, well, sacrilegious. The \u201cus vs. them\u201d structure demanded of many religious and sports faithful is not only accepted within those contexts, but it\u2019s used to justify some patently bad behavior, from taunting rivals and hooliganism at sports events, to bigotry, hate crimes and even wars in the name of religion. The tribalism in both, however, has inarguably helped their success in creating vast global communities across generations and geography; becoming important agents of change in breaking down civil rights, race and gender boundaries; and providing purpose and a sense of family for billions of people. Polarization is poisoning America. Here's an antidote The tribalism in today\u2019s politics is similarly double-edged. On the plus side, one could argue political engagement has benefited from an intensified political environment. 2018 was the first year that more than 100 million Americans voted in a midterm election, for example. On the minus, it feels impossible to civilly discuss politics \u2014 or avoid it altogether \u2014 when tensions are so high. It infects every aspect of our culture, from award shows to football games, our favorite coffee and fast food. Political \u201cteams\u201d may build enthusiasm and loyalty, but they inherently pit American against American, citizen against immigrant, young against old, and so on. That, as we\u2019ve seen, can lead some to vengeance and violence in defense of their political tribe. It seems like politics has surpassed sports and organized religion as the most defining part of our identity. Our politics has become synonymous with our values and our organizing life principle. Instead, politics really should merely be a mechanism to govern. It\u2019s not just tribalism in politics that\u2019s the problem \u2014 it\u2019s our outsized belief in its significance in our lives. We\u2019re spending more on political campaigns, moving to places where our political views are popular and, according to a new study in the American Journal of Political Science, our politics may even be overriding our morals. As Peter Hatemi, one of the study\u2019s authors, explains: \u201cWe will switch our moral compass depending on how it fits with what we believe politically.\u201d Partly to blame is our increasing obsession with the American presidency as an embodiment of hope and change, to borrow a phrase. Long before former President Barack Obama was supposed to save the country from its many suffering ills, so too were Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush. These were merely men \u2014 politicians, at that \u2014 but onto each of them was foisted a heavy mantle of expectation that was never going to be fully realized. The power of incumbency: Four two-term presidents in a row? The paternalism of the presidency was baked in from the get-go. George Washington recoiled at the notion of being called \u201cthe father of his country\u201d in newspapers, and, as Thomas Fleming writes in \u201cThe Intimate Lives of the Founding Fathers,\u201d Washington did \u201chis utmost to avoid acknowledging this tendency to view him as a demigod.\u201d But our view of the chief executive as a fatherly figure who is there to guide us and care for us only grew. In conservative columnist George Will\u2019s weighty new book, \u201cThe Conservative Sensibility,\u201d he describes this as the \u201cinfantilization of the public.\u201d He recalls a 1992 town hall-style debate featuring Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot, where an audience member asked, \u201cHow can we, as symbolically the children of the future president, expect \u2026 you to meet our needs, the needs in housing and in crime and you name it?\u201d The American president, it is believed, must solve all our problems, both complex and mundane. He or she must reflect to us our idealized best selves and represent all we hope to become as a nation over the next four years. Whether we seek a Republican or a Democrat, a strong man or a caretaker, a traditionalist or a progressive, we truly believe we can find and deserve the Aaron Sorkin version of a president \u2014 a leader who is omnipresent in our lives and reflective of our values. In reality, the president has very little to do with our day-to-day challenges. The most influential people in our daily lives likely run our schools, our municipalities, our health, safety and sanitation boards. Most of us couldn\u2019t name any one of those people. What progressives should know about Trump voters The election of President Donald Trump amped up our presidential cult of personality to 11. With no political record and a campaign of personal attacks and fear-mongering, Trump wasn\u2019t elected to \u201cdo politics\u201d or solve problems, but to mirror to his supporters the image of a forgotten man and all his grievances. How we unwind our long obsession with the presidency is complicated, and in some ways, like putting toothpaste back in the tube. But an essential part of deemphasizing the role of politics in our private lives is demystifying the persona of the president. Now, I know it might feel like we\u2019re at a crisis point in America \u2014 we are, among other things, contemplating impeaching our president. But while you might not know it from watching the news or reading the headlines, 2019 is a pretty good time to be alive. By nearly every metric of human well-being, the world around us is a much better place than it was a century or two ago. As Max Roser, an Oxford University economist, writes in \u201cThe Short History of Global Living Conditions and Why It Matters That We Know It,\u201d we\u2019re freer, more democratic, healthier, richer, better educated and more literate than we ever have been. And yet, especially in high-income Western countries like the United States, we\u2019ve never been more stressed or felt more anxious. According to a recent survey,  a scant 6% of people in the United States said things were getting better when asked, \u201cAll things considered, do you think the world is getting better or worse?\u201d It\u2019s no wonder, under those conditions, that we\u2019ve become more divided, angry at our neighbors and resentful of others. But there\u2019s reason to believe change is possible. And it\u2019s important that we start looking inward, to our own communities. Over the past half-century, we dreamed big, looking outward to the horizons to expand our global opportunities and connectivity. That was a good thing, but in doing so we often ignored our own backyards. Instead of marching on Washington, imagine marching on your town square for smaller class rooms, cleaner water, less crime. Instead of tweeting about Trump or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, what about doing some community service or volunteer work. Instead of teaching our kids to parrot our political views, let\u2019s teach them civic engagement and how to make small differences in their own communities.  If our political identities are how we build our own individual community, how we weed out friends from foes, how we judge each other above all other things, the logical conclusion is an America that sees politics as religion, that justifies intolerance and exclusion as virtue and righteousness, that rationalizes patently bad behavior in the name of a cause. We can continue to blame tribalism for our anger and division, but it\u2019s an important part of our evolutionary makeup and a survival skill we\u2019re not likely to ditch any time soon. The problem isn\u2019t that we\u2019re too tribal \u2014 it\u2019s that we\u2019ve let politics replace community.",

Mark Parker is Professor of English at James Madison University. They are the authors of \u201cSucking Up: A Brief Consideration of Sycophancy.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own; view more opinion at CNN. If presidencies were branding exercises, sycophancy would be the trademark of the Trump era. Sycophancy in politics is often hard to see, something done behind closed doors, away from public scrutiny. But the release of a rough transcript of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s conversation with President Trump offered a window into it. His flattery of Trump began small, as routine ingratiation \u2013 a phone call, a private kowtow, with a limited audience of diplomats and officials inured to this dynamic. But now we have an expanded theater, a media spectacle that plays to an audience whose complicity is eagerly solicited. The release of the notes of the call could easily be seen as a function of Trump\u2019s branding exercise: to show the world the spectacle of a foreign leader sucking up to him.  While the White House is suppressing other documents and as many witnesses as it can, there was no hesitation in publicizing Zelensky\u2019s textbook suck-up: calling Mr. Trump a \u201cgreat teacher\u201d from whom he has learned \u201cskills and knowledge,\u201d affirming \u201cwe are great friends,\u201d eagerly agreeing with Trump\u2019s disparagement of Angela Merkel, not just \u201c100%, but actually 1000%,\u201d and touting his stay at the Trump Tower in New York. Politics and sycophancy have a long association, ranging from the ingratiating punctilio of diplomacy to the pomp and fatuity of state visits. But the Trump brand prefers a different version of this old practice, one that exploits new media to intensify and redirect its force. Flatterers perform through the media for a target who often monitors the tribute at a distance. As toadying becomes spectacle, the observers \u2013 or in the patois of new media, followers \u2013 become more important. Where observers traditionally have been bystanders \u2013 sometimes amused, sometimes appalled \u2013 their participation and approbation are now cultivated. We can trace a rough history of this rewiring of flattery. Trump himself tried something like this earlier in his career as a developer, when he reportedly called journalists using an assumed name to praise himself. Whatever pleasure Trump got out of flattering himself, this deceptive promotion of a brand was essentially flattery for the observer. It\u2019s worth considering just how Trump\u2019s impersonation of a Trump flatterer changes the effects of this act of sycophancy. Just as Trump\u2019s television show blended roles usually kept separate, fusing the self-congratulatory patter of the talk show host with the performed character of the boss, Trump collapses the roles of sycophant and target. The purpose is not to suck up to the boss; it\u2019s to draw the audience into sycophantic agreement. We all became apprentices. The White House's impregnable stone wall is starting to crumble This transformation intensified after Trump\u2019s election, when then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer feverishly exaggerated the size of the inaugural crowd. This isn\u2019t the kind of opinion conformity so evident on the Watergate tapes \u2013 the private, behind-closed-door flatteries of a yes-man vying for favor with the boss \u2013 this sycophancy is done on demand, at a distance, and for the largest audience possible. The media is not simply the means; it is a crucial part of the flattery loop. As kowtowing has become spectacle, flatterers are no longer embarrassed by their abasement. Who can forget the June 2017 cabinet meeting, which opened with a round of competitive sycophancy?  Or Kellyanne Conway urging everyone \u201cGo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff?\u201d Or when Anthony Scaramucci, during his brief tenure as White House communications director, addressed the camera directly to repeatedly proclaim \u201cI love the President?\u201d Such formidable sycophants have schooled foreign leaders well. This year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named a Golan Heights settlement after Trump . In 2017, during the President\u2019s trip to the Middle East, Saudi King Salman, in presenting Trump with the country\u2019s highest civilian medal, affirmed that the Saudis respected him far more than his predecessor. Trump\u2019s picture was everywhere during the visit, culminating in the inspired five-floor projection of the President on the exterior of the Ritz-Carlton hotel. All this obsequiousness paid off handsomely, as Trump backed the Saudis\u2019 vision of the Middle East. Marie Yovanovitch launches an insurrection It remains to be seen if Zelensky\u2019s quid pro unctuous quo will pay off. Perhaps he will continue to secure the money he needs to defend his country from Russian aggression. But he might pause to consider the sad fate of other sycophants in Trump\u2019s world, such as Lindsey Graham and Mike Pompeo, whose reputations have been shredded by their transformation into court flatterers. Despite the distance between sycophant and target provided by new media, the essentials of the exchange are the same. Flattery begins with an attempt to enhance the target\u2019s perception of himself, and though the new dynamics of media-fired flattery might turn some of these energies toward transforming observers, it always reshapes the flatterer. Sucking up may, as the adage has it, get you anywhere, but it also takes you places that you do not want to go. While sycophants might begin their campaign with condescension for the target they plan to exploit, they rationalize their behavior over time, constructing in their own minds a target more worthy of the abasements they perform. The more successful flattery is, the less likely the flatterer is to see it as fraud. It becomes habitual, second nature. Even in a time of swift technological change we can count on humans to, as Shakespeare memorably puts it, \u201ccommit the oldest sins the newest kind of ways.\u201d  But the damage is not simply personal \u2013 sucking up has wider consequences. Dante, in his Divine Comedy, placed flatterers in the eighth circle of hell \u2013 below murderers and tyrants. While this seems strange, even inexplicable at first reading, his reasoning is particularly cogent, as we endure the new publicity of sycophancy. For Dante, this kind of fraud not only injures the person deceived by a flatterer; it also affects the larger community. Flattery diminishes the trust on which the social order is based, and it ultimately threatens this order. Dante associates flattery with an entire class of transgressions against social order \u2013 such as hypocrisy, lying, graft, sowing of discord, false counsel \u2013 by placing them on one level in hell. Fraud connects all them all. We have lost Dante\u2019s sense of outrage, just as we have lost sight of his deep sense of community. Often, we condone flattery as useful or laud it as clever. But while new media has changed the dynamic of flattery, it cannot contain the corruption that sycophancy engenders. The excremental vision of Dante and other traditional moralists \u2013 the essential stain of brown-nosing \u2013 abides.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael Bociurkiw is a global affairs analyst and a former spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. For someone who was already fighting for his political future, the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse. On Wednesday, Time magazine published a photo from 2001, showing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wearing brownface at an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d theme party. In the yearbook photo, Trudeau, then a 29-year-old teacher, poses with four women. He is the only person in brown-face and appears to have both arms around the woman closest to him. At a press conference on his campaign plane shortly after the news broke, an ashen-faced Trudeau said he was \u201csorry\u201d and \u201cpissed off at myself\u201d and identified the woman as \u201ca close friend.\u201d Justin Trudeau apologizes for wearing brownface during 2001 event at school The damage may not end there. Pressed by reporters, Trudeau suggested there were other times where he might have dressed up in an inappropriate way. He said there was a time in high school when he dressed up with makeup and sang \u201cDay O\u201d \u2013 an admission that will almost certainly send the war rooms of opposition parties into a frenzy and journalists digging further into Trudeau\u2019s past. The brownface photo is devastating for the Trudeau campaign as October\u2019s national elections approach, especially since one of its tactics has been to dig up social media dirt on opponents \u2013 many of whom are young and have had a digital footprint from almost the time they were born. The strategy has already derailed rival parties, forced some opponents to resign over race issues. Now, using that opposition research could expose the prime minister\u2019s Liberal Party to accusations of a double standard. But if the entire approach is suspended, it could also place Liberals at a potential disadvantage. The incident will surely play into the rival Conservative Party\u2019s narrative that Trudeau is not the paragon of progressive virtue he seems to be. The son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, he modeled himself as a chief promoter of minority rights and multiculturalism. But opponents say the man who pledged \u201csunny ways\u201d in his 2015 campaign and promised to do politics differently, cannot be trusted, especially after he violated conflict of interest guidelines. Justin Trudeau Fast Facts Late on Wednesday night after the photo came out, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, in a brief statement, said Trudeau lacked judgment and integrity and was not fit to govern Canada. Scheer, who has been playing defense since hitting the hustings, will certainly welcome the winds of scandal blowing the other way. Throughout the campaign, he has been responding to allegations of impropriety found in dated social media posts of some of his candidates. Canada\u2019s elections take place on October 21, and it\u2019s looking like a tough race. Any perception of being insensitive or hypocritical\u2013 as an \u201cimposter,\u201d in the words of one major Canadian newsmagazine earlier this year \u2013 is certainly not the way Trudeau wants to be seen. In the run-up to the federal election campaign, Trudeau has been criticized by opponents as coming across as insincere, especially after his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair. Jagmeet Singh, standard bearer for the New Democratic Party, has called Trudeau\u2019s behavior \u201ctroubling\u201d and \u201cinsulting.\u201d And Rachel Curran, director of policy to former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, told me, \u201cThe statement did not sound sincere in the least. He choked out the absolute briefest of apologies that sounded entirely scripted, and made no mention of the impact of his actions on minority communities.\u201d That aspect is probably what Trudeau will be addressing tomorrow and the days to follow: the potential hurt for minorities, who make up a large percentage of voters in key constituencies in vote-rich Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. There are still more than 30 days to go until Canadians head to the polls. Until now, the Liberals have been focusing on bettering the livelihoods of the Canadian middle class, with Trudeau traveling in a media bubble with picture-perfect moments. Before today, his party was probably within reach of a minority government \u2013 knocked off their current majority by scandals ranging from the finding that Trudeau violated conflict of interest rules in the corporate criminal case of SNC-Lavalin to his controversy-mired state visit to India in 2018. He is also being attacked for bloating the federal deficit and for not delivering on campaign promises like reforming electoral laws. What baffles many analysts is why the Liberals waited until it came out this way. Trudeau could have tried to limit the damage by coming out with the news himself \u2013 he must have known about the damage it did to the US\u2019 Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, after revelations of a blackface image on his yearbook school page. (Northam initially apologized for being in the image, then he insisted it wasn\u2019t him.) Of course, what seems an unimaginable scandal today could also appear to be a tempest-in-a-teapot some days later. But for now, the Liberal campaign will be forced to shift into a strategy which no campaign team relishes: crisis mode. And Trudeau has plenty of explaining and apologizing to do to save his embattled government from being banished to the opposition benches of Parliament.",

With the stock market in a state of uncertainty and the possibility of a global recession becoming very real, Republicans are worried. A recession is what could keep Trump off the list of two-term presidents and relegate him to the one inhabited by Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter and George H.W Bush. Trump realizes the danger: on Thursday, he tweeted that the media is \u201cdoing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election. The problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on Trade, and everyone knows that, including China!\u201d A good economy is not enough to guarantee the President reelection, given that voters are registering concern about other issues, such as his conduct in office and gun control \u2013 but a very bad  economy is more than he could withstand. Trump is impeaching himself The President\u2019s 2020 strategy depends on holding together a very narrow coalition that can get him through the Electoral College. He is not really anticipating another 1964 or 1984 landslide. Not only are those kinds of elections rare in the modern age but Trump has never even tried to broaden his base. His goal is to maintain Republican support and make sure the turnout is high. The problem is that the Republican Party, as opposed to the base, wants more than his fiery, reactionary language. Many Republicans are willing to tolerate his white nationalist rhetoric in exchange for deregulation, tax cuts, booming stocks and a good economy. They support the President for the same reason that they would support any other Republican, he appears to help their bottom line. Thus far they have even remained largely quiet about the turbulence from the trade wars. But if a global recession takes place, Trump will have a difficult time keeping his office as long as the Democratic nominee runs a strong campaign that unifies the party. Trump needs his famous base, but what he also needs are big business conservatives, Wall Street investors, small business owners and prosperous suburban middle class families who are pleased with the state of their pocketbooks. The President is counting on many Republicans who didn\u2019t vote in 2016 to support him in 2020 because they believe he has delivered on their paychecks and investments. If the good economic times go south, then all they will be seeing is the rest of Trump. And they will be open to options \u2013 either from a Democrat who promises to achieve what President Barack Obama did in bringing back growth or a Republican primary challenge. The Trump base also cares about the economy. To be sure many of them will vote for the President regardless of what the economy does. They love him and what he stands for. But if they are really struggling to stay above water, he won\u2019t seem quite so appealing.  Americans living on a razor\u2019s edge can\u2019t afford to risk a second term with an unstable President if they see four years of economic gloom ahead. Some will stay with him, but the job losses would cut into his narrow constituency and make it hard for him to gain votes elsewhere. Despite recent warning signs of a coming recession, the economy has remained strong so far, but there is more than a year still to go before the general election campaign season reaches its height. Democrats certainly don\u2019t want to base a campaign on the possibility of looming economic disaster. They need to offer ideas, vision and hope. But if the events of this week portend a recession during the election, few things would put them in as strong a position to take back the White House.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: S. Mitra Kalita is the senior vice president for news, opinion and programming for CNN Digital. She is the author of two books, including one about Indian immigrants in New Jersey. There\u2019s a scene in the new movie \u201cBlinded by the Light\u201d where British protesters harass and assault a Pakistani family on their way to a wedding. Their teenage son is nowhere to be found; he\u2019s off buying Springsteen tickets. I watched it unfold and began to sob. Not at the racism, as awful as it was, but seeing myself in a teen who turned a blind eye to all his parents endured in pursuit of happiness. As the film\u2019s eponymous song goes: \u201cMama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun. Oh, but mama, that\u2019s where the fun is.\u201d It\u2019s not surprising that Gurinder Chadha\u2019s film evokes such recognition among my generation, born to post-World War II immigrants, now reaching middle age and raising children of our own. It joins a growing genre of Asian-American movies with old world-new world tensions at their heart: \u201cThe Farewell,\u201d \u201cMeet the Patels,\u201d \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d \u201cAlways Be My Maybe\u201d and Chadha\u2019s own sleeper, \u201cBend it Like Beckham.\u201d Timing is everything, though, and my hope is that a broader audience sees this movie \u2013 shot almost entirely in Britain \u2013 for what it actually is: an ode to America. I saw the movie the week President Trump made his \u201cgo back\u201d comments, and it contextualizes both his point of view and the hurt with which it lands. \u201cBlinded by the Light\u201d tells the story of Javed, the son of Pakistani immigrants \u2013 his mother works as a seamstress and his father loses his job in an auto factory. Javed turns to poetry to both capture and escape his 1987 suburban British existence; his hometown of Luton, he writes, \u201cis a four-letter word.\u201d All around him, tensions flare. Skinheads taunt him on the way home from school and there\u2019s the broader political backdrop of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s re-election bid. The Iron Lady was not known for rolling out a welcome mat to the Commonwealth\u2019s former subjects. She once explained, \u201cPeople are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture.\u201d It is a Sikh classmate who hands Javed a cassette tape of Bruce Springsteen. Javed gets hooked, as if the Boss \u2013 a continent and several cultures away \u2013 uniquely understands his pain. He becomes obsessed with lyrics about class struggle and identity, so far from the expectations of Pakistani and British society. And through this a portrait of the hardscrabble American dream emerges, along with Javed\u2019s yearning to be a part of it. In 1988, a year after the setting of this movie, I moved to Springsteen\u2019s native New Jersey. The state is a frequent muse and backdrop to his songs, and rightfully so. My parents emigrated from India to the US in the early 1970s and I have lived all over \u2013 Puerto Rico, New Delhi, New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. I can attest to the fact that New Jersey is the most American place on earth. New Jersey is the ether of a laid-off worker trying to find his place, of an immigrant who escaped family dysfunction and political violence, and of a teen who thinks Jersey is a four-letter word, too. Its density breeds diversity, for New Jersey can make room for anybody. Like 53% of America, the state is largely suburban, at once labeled a commuter\u2019s paradise and the armpit of America for its neither-New York-nor Philadelphia identity. We know this feeling of being in the middle, trapped as translators. After January 2018, when President Trump referred to some immigrant homelands as \u201cshithole countries,\u201d I desperately tried to shield my parents from the news. My kids, too. The cursing was secondary to my deeper fears that they would no longer feel they had transcended one home, or fully belonged in another. We\u2019ve been here before. In 2017 I wrote about witnessing a man telling my neighbors to go back where they came from. Then too, I did not want to tell my father, nervous it would taint his view of his home of 50 years, a place that has given us so much. I forgot how Papa knows better, has seen more. \u201cThere will always be those people. But they are the minority in America,\u201d he told my daughters. \u201cYou have to believe that.\u201d He\u2019s not naive. He was never beaten up like Javed\u2019s dad, but his name\u2019s been shortened, his accent mocked and his otherness scorned by co-workers. Our parents arrived at a time where these comments and beliefs were common. They combated these prejudices through hard work and by keeping their heads down. In the film, Javed\u2019s father advises his son do the same. Study economics, not writing, he says. To which Javed screams, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be your son! I want to be more than that!\u201d Indeed, our generation had high hopes. While my own schooling in the 1990s was filled with schoolyard taunts, it also forced and inspired change. English classes introduced us to Toni Morrison and Zora Neale Hurston, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Amy Tan. School textbooks were revised to use terms such as Native American, to mention that George Washington owned slaves. In social studies, I had to memorize the five pillars of Islam. The 1980s were tense and uncertain, for sure, but we kept hope alive, in echoes and applications of the civil rights movement. Our parents kept their heads down \u2013 so we didn\u2019t have to. Since the 2016 election, decades of all that progress slipped into reverse. Hate crimes rose 17% in 2017, compared to the year before. And so our behaviors are changing. I find myself hesitating to speak our native Assamese in stores or on airplanes. I see videos of racist acts on the subway going viral and I wonder if I should hide them from my daughters or expose them and proffer tips on how to stay safe. I wonder if I want them to intervene if they see others being victimized or just keep their heads down. Today, we ready ourselves in the morning for work and school, and we wonder which America will greet us. In the ultimate irony, fear and uncertainty also propel some Trump voters. Pew Research reported in 2016 that roughly a third of white voters \u2013 rural and suburban alike \u2013 feel pessimism about their children\u2019s financial future. This feeling both divides and unites people from shithole countries and this one, too: a fear our kids might have it worse than we do. And that\u2019s the least American thing ever. There\u2019s irony in a Pakistani teen longing to escape racism in Britain for an idealized America that may not exist anymore. But Springsteen reminds us that there\u2019s always been a gap between the inclusive American ideal and the harsher, complicated reality. \u201cTell your stories. But don\u2019t forget ours,\u201d Javed\u2019s father tells him. He\u2019s right. This movie does that. It offers what feels so unattainable right now \u2013 a representation where a laid-off Trump supporter and a left-leaning union guy and a teenage child of immigrants all might see themselves. They might find common ground in that most Springsteen of ideas \u2013 being \u201cborn to run\u201d \u2013 and settle on the idea of a country that has room for all of them. This ragtag medley of people who feel they don\u2019t belong, who escaped and demand greatness from this land, is actually what makes America great. I must believe this. Because my parents, they ran. Me, I have nowhere to go.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Earlier this year, I shattered my elbow in a freak fall, requiring surgery, plates and screws. While I am a US citizen, several years ago I married an Englishman and became a UK resident, entitled to coverage on the British National Health Service. My NHS surgeon was able to schedule me in for the three-hour surgery less than two weeks after my fall, and my physical therapist saw me weekly after the bone was healed to work on my flexion and extension. Both surgery and rehab were free at the point of use, and the only paperwork I completed was my pre-operative release forms. Compare that to another freak accident I had while living in Boston in my 20s. I spilled a large cup of hot tea on myself, suffered second degree scald burns, and had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. In the pain and chaos of the ER admission, I accidentally put my primary insurance down as my secondary and vice versa. It took me the better part of six months to sort out the ensuing paperwork and billing confusion, and even with two policies, I still paid several hundred dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. With debate raging in the US among Democrats about whether to push for a government health care system such as Medicare for All, there is no doubt in my mind that the NHS single-payer health care system is superior to the American system of private insurance. As someone who suffers from chronic illness, is incredibly clumsy and accident-prone, and has two young children, I spend an inordinate amount of time in doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals.  When my family is in our home in York, England, our health care is paid for principally through direct taxation, and we have zero out of pocket costs. In contrast, when we are in the US, we are on my employer-based insurance plan. After years with one provider, rising costs pushed the premiums alone to above 10% of my gross salary for the family plan, and I recently opted to switch to a new provider, whose premiums are a more modest but still eye-watering 7% of my salary. I have had to switch our family doctor and specialists, with the attendant hassle of applying to have our medical records released and transferred to our new providers.  In addition to my premiums, both plans include significant co-pays, although my new provider does not have a deductible. In Britain, I am not entitled to the annual well patient and women\u2019s health check-ups that Americans can now receive without a co-pay or deductible thanks to the Affordable Care Act.  As an asthma sufferer, I do, however, have regular annual reviews of my condition. When one of my children becomes ill, I am usually able to receive same-day treatment in both countries, although in both cases this involves showing up early for the urgent care clinic. Sanders slams Harris' health care plan: 'It's not Medicare for All' The comparative ease and security of the NHS is why the system retains such high levels of support from the British public, despite frustrations with wait times and other aspects of service provision. A recent poll found that 77% of respondents felt that \u201cthe NHS is crucial to British society and we must do everything we can to maintain it,\u201d and nearly 90% agreed that that the NHS should be free at the point of delivery, provide a comprehensive service available to everyone, and be primarily funded through taxation.  Britons\u2019 affection for their NHS was dramatically enacted in Danny Boyle\u2019s 2012 Olympic opening ceremony extravaganza. Yet, while I share my adopted countrymen\u2019s support for the NHS, I can see almost no chance of America adopting a single-payer health care system of the kind described by Sens. Sanders and Warren any time soon. Sanders, Warren and other single-payer advocates not only face a strong and entrenched adversary in the American insurance industry, they also lack the broad public support for reform which characterized post-WWII Britain. That broad public support for reform was crucial. Britain\u2019s NHS system was very nearly defeated by opposing interests when it was introduced in the 1940s. It was initially opposed by the municipal and voluntary authorities, who controlled the 3,000 hospitals which Health Secretary Aneurin Bevan sought to bring under national administration, by the various Royal Colleges of surgeons and specialists, and by British Medical Association (BMA), the professional body representing the vast majority of the nation\u2019s general practitioners, who stood to lose control of their private practices and become state employees. Medicare for All is a political loser At a meeting of doctors following the publication of Bevan\u2019s proposals in January 1946, one physician claimed that \u201cThis Bill is strongly suggestive of the Hitlerite regime now being destroyed in Germany,\u201d and another described the proposed nationalization of the hospitals as \u201cthe greatest seizure of property since Henry VIII confiscated the monasteries.\u201d The BMA hostility persisted through rounds of negotiations lasting two years. Less than six months before the bill was set to come into effect on July 5, 1948, the BMA\u2019s membership voted by a margin of 8 to 1 against the NHS, sparking serious fears within the government that GPs would refuse to come on board, effectively scuppering the NHS. Bevan insisted that he would not cave but he did have to make several costly concessions to bring the doctors on board.  First, he cleaved off the specialists (who were closely tied to the hospitals), by promising them that, if they signed on, they could continue to treat private patients in NHS-run hospitals in addition to their NHS patients, whom they would be paid to treat on a fee-for-service basis. Then, he offered the general practitioners a generous buyout to give up their stake in their private practices (effectively purchasing their patient lists), if they came on board. And finally, he promised them that the government would not be able to compel them to become fully salaried employees of the state without the passage of new legislation. The Medicare for All bill is a winner At the same time that Bevan offered the carrot of economic concessions, he also wielded the stick of public opinion against the doctors. Speaking in the House of Commons in February 1948, Bevan positioned single-payer healthcare as an issue of middle class survival, in language whose substance, if not its style, would not sound out of place in a 2020 Democratic primary debate: \u201cConsider that social class which is called the \u201cmiddle class.\u201d Their entrance into the scheme, and their having a free doctor and a free hospital service, is emancipation for many of them. There is nothing that destroys the family budget of the professional worker more than heavy hospital bills and doctors\u2019 bills.\u201d Bevan spoke for a public exceptionally united in support of an expanded state welfare policy as a result of the socially unifying experience of World War II. Fear of public backlash combined with economic incentives ultimately brought the medical establishment to heel. Many were shocked when Bevan succeeded, but the BMA was arguably a less formidable threat to reform then than the American insurance industry is now. Insurance companies stand to be the biggest losers from a switch to single-payer health care, which seeks to achieve economies in large part through cutting out the profit-making middle man. As Elizabeth Warren noted in last Tuesday\u2019s debate, US insurance companies reported $23 billion in profits last year. And the insurance lobby is determined to protect its position. That is why insurance companies are major donors in both state and federal election campaigns. The insurance industry has put massive resources into ensuring continued public and political opposition to the introduction of a single-payer system.  It\u2019s possible that, if Americans were presented with an arguably cheaper and less bureaucratic health care system, they might decide that they liked it and were committed to doing everything they could to maintain it. But given the constellation of political forces in 21st century America, that just isn\u2019t going to happen any time soon.",

With this debate promising to be one of the major issues of the 2020 campaign, the former Vice President took a shot at the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d being pushed by fellow candidates. \u201cBernie\u2019s been very honest about it,\u201d he said to reporters last Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s said you\u2019re going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. He says it\u2019s going to end all private insurance.\u201d Biden has proposed expanding the Affordable Care Act as his alternative, including the creation of a public option, like progressives had pushed for when the program was created. Sanders blasted the Democratic frontrunner, accusing him of making false allegations about what his program would do. The 2020 election is now fully on the horizon, and the health care issue doesn\u2019t look like it will be going away any time soon. As the Supreme Court considers a case that could deem the ACA unconstitutional, Democrats are dividing over what needs to be done to the national system if a Democrat wins office (and the party manages to somehow take enough control away from Senate Republicans). While some Democrats are terrified of divisions, health care has proven to be a good issue for Democrats in recent years, and the efforts of the GOP to radically dismantle the current system have been very unpopular with the public. This was a key sticking point for voters in the 2018 midterm elections. Medicare for All is a political loser Currently, there are three major health care alternatives on the table. The Republican position remains repeal and replace. This is the most dangerous political position of all, which is why so many Republicans are practically begging the President to stay silent on the issue. The GOP has not put forth any substantive health care proposal other than promising something better than what exists. The radical option put forth by the GOP would destabilize the entire health care system by removing this massive regulatory infrastructure and then waiting for Congress to put forward an alternative. Some Democrats, including Sens. Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, endorse going bold as soon as possible. In their minds, the reforms put into place under Barack Obama through the ACA did not go far enough, leaving a system still broken with all the political costs that come from any expansion of domestic policy. Too many people remain without coverage and costs are still too high. Obama was pilloried as a left-wing radical, even though his policy centered on reforming and improving the existing private health care system. The progressives in the party argue that something bigger needs to be done to make sure that all Americans receive coverage at a fair cost. They want to expand Medicare into a national insurance program. If Congress changed the program, they would fulfill the vision of the original founders, who always thought that Medicare for seniors was just a first step. Affordable Care Act gears up for momentous test in court Biden is seeking a different path. While sharing many of the objectives of his fellow Democrats, Biden argues that building on what already exists (though Medicare supporters would argue they are doing the same) is the best way to go. The health care initiative that the Obama administration passed \u2013 which Biden famously called a \u201cbig f***ing deal\u201d \u2013 offers the bones, so he says, for something even bigger. \u201cACA for all\u201d might be his catch phrase. In practice, as the Washington Post\u2019s Paul Waldman noted, the Biden expansion is quite bold, embracing many of the ideas that had been considered \u201cradical\u201d in 2009-2010. Still, Biden is trying to package his plan as a middle way, an incremental approach to reform, which is part of his overall effort to claim the centrist lane in party politics. As long as all three proposals are in the mix, Democrats are in good shape. Which plan wins is anyone\u2019s guess.  But the fact that the debate is taking place is a good thing. Democrats fighting over health care will keep the issue in the public mind. While there are risks that Medicare for All can become a tool for President Donald Trump to paint his opponents as far left, there\u2019s the potential for Democrats to demonstrate that the GOP is in fact the most radical party of all \u2013 constantly pushing to eliminate federal protections and subsidies that millions of Americans have come to rely on. This is one debate Democrats should be delighted to have.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. Every presidential investigation gives us new phrases that stick. \u201cWhat did the President know, and when did he know it,\u201d Sen. Howard Baker asked during the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon. \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman,\u201d President Bill Clinton told America, before surviving impeachment \u2013 and completing his second term. Future historians may not yet have a defining quote from the investigation of President Donald Trump (one contender from Trump after he learned about Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s appointment: \u201cThis is the end of my Presidency. I\u2019m f****d.\u201d) But his attorney general, William Barr, threw a memorable line into the mix this week when he referred to a previously undisclosed letter he received from Mueller in dismissive terms: \u201cYou know, the letter\u2019s a bit snitty, and I think it was probably written by one of his staff people.\u201d \u201cSnitty\u201d turned out to be an apt word for much of the reaction to this week\u2019s events. Our legal analysts couldn\u2019t have differed more strongly on what it all meant. Paul Callan wrote, \u201cBarr did not deserve Mueller\u2019s snit nor any of the snitty abuse heaped on him for doing his job. His interpretations were a defensible analysis of a report that was poorly written.\u201d Elie Honig painted a much different picture. He called Barr\u2019s testimony before a Senate committee \u201ca master class in obfuscation, backtracking and blame-shifting. This performance would\u2019ve been pathetic coming from an ordinary witness \u2013 never mind from the chief law enforcement officer of the United States.\u201d In Vanity Fair, Abigail Tracy wrote that Democrats, wary of the \u201coptics\u201d of impeaching Trump, might just choose to try impeaching his attorney general instead. It \u201ccould be a creative way for Democratic leadership to placate the progressive and activist wings of the party,\u201d she wrote. And in The Washington Post, Catherine Rampell argued that Barr\u2019s biggest misdeed this week actually wasn\u2019t what he told the Senate committee: It was his department\u2019s effort to get Obamacare thrown out by the courts. Snitty or not, Mueller\u2019s letter impressed a third legal analyst, Shanlon Wu, who compared it favorably to former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s resignation letter: \u201cRosenstein\u2019s letter reads like that of a middle-schooler whose favorite book is \u201cBartlett\u2019s Familiar Quotations.\u201d In only six short paragraphs, Rosenstein manages to quote Thomas Paine, Robert Jackson, Edward Levi, John Ashcroft and close with President Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018America first\u2019 exhortation.\u201d Other writers continued to pore over Mueller\u2019s 448-page report. John Avlon found a trove of buried leads and questions still worth investigating. Alexander Urbelis said the report sheds light on the prosecution of Julian Assange. Taking a longer view, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and former NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen called on candidates to pledge to refuse help from foreign powers that try to interfere in their elections. The Nixon and Clinton scandals were on the mind of Joe Lockhart, who urged divided Democrats to keep pursuing investigations of Trump despite fears of a voter backlash: \u201cIt was Congress\u2019 determination to get to the bottom of Watergate that exposed the pervasive corruption of the Nixon administration.\u201d No, it\u2019s not another phrase for a politician\u2019s outlandish lie. The Impossible Whopper is a plant-based patty that Burger King is promising to roll out nationally this year. Researchers Tim Searchinger and Richard Waite called the news potentially historic: Meat substitutes could help save huge amounts of forest land that might otherwise be cleared for raising beef cattle to feed a fast-growing world population. \u201cBeef uses roughly 20 times more land and releases 20 times more greenhouse gases for the same amount of protein as common plant proteins such as beans.\u201d In Venezuela, opposition leader Juan Guaido made his move to oust President Nicolas Maduro, and the results were inconclusive. What to make of the situation? \u201cAbove all, we should view Venezuela as a human tragedy,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know who to root for as you see reports of competing forces and hear accounts of rival narratives, root for the Venezuelan people. Rooting for the Venezuelan people means hoping that Maduro will step down peacefully, bringing to a close the most disastrous regime Venezuela has ever seen.\u201d \u201cToday should have been my funeral,\u201d wrote Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein of Chabad of Poway, California, in a New York Times opinion piece. Two days earlier, a 19-year-old shooter attacked his congregation, killing one member and wounding three, including the rabbi. \u201cI pray that my missing finger serves as a constant reminder to me. A reminder that every single human being is created in the image of God; a reminder that I am part of a people that has survived the worst destruction and will always endure.\u201d Eighteen-year-old writer Daniel Blokh responded to the Poway shooting, which came six months after an attack that killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, by describing how poetry has helped him process his thoughts and emotions on hate killings. \u201cIf this attack seems sickeningly familiar to many Americans, that\u2019s because it is,\u201d wrote Peter Bergen. The Poway shooter appeared to have been inspired by the Pittsburgh shooter as well as the attacks against mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. \u201cLike school shooters, terrorists learn from and emulate other terrorists,\u201d he noted, and outlined three ways to seek to prevent domestic terrorism. One of them is for President Donald Trump to stop defending his controversial \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d remark he made about the August 2017 protests in Charlottesville, Virginia. Nicole Hemmer, who has studied those events, wrote that it\u2019s vital to be clear-eyed about the context. The Charlottesville confrontation wasn\u2019t about preserving historic monuments to Robert E. Lee, as Trump recently told a reporter, she wrote. \u201cThe President and his allies continue to provide cover for the racist violence in Charlottesville, and the violent ideology propagated there.\u201d Seconds after the gargantuan Battle of Winterfell came to its abrupt end, the tweets, recaps and op-eds on the third episode of the final season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d started flooding in. In Wired, \u201cAngry Staff Officer\u201d provided an unusual take: a \u201ctactical analysis\u201d of the mistakes made by the castle\u2019s defenders and the forces of the Night King (for example: sending the Dothraki cavalry into an attack without knowing more about the enemy\u2019s forces wasn\u2019t the smartest idea). UK-based cultural critic Kate Maltby noticed that while formerly despised male characters such as Theon Greyjoy and Jaime Lannister were having their reputations redeemed on the HBO show, there seemed to be no such absolution for women. \u201cWithout a culture that forgives past sins, we\u2019d all be lost. But we need to be clear about who is permitted a redemptive journey and who isn\u2019t. In the world of \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 that means men.\u201d (HBO is a subsidiary of WarnerMedia, which owns CNN.) Meanwhile, The Washington Post\u2019s Elahe Izadi suggested that the ultimate winner in the final three episodes would turn out to be a woman who has overcome all kinds of adversity: Sansa Stark. The Labor Department reported Friday that the jobless rate had fallen to the lowest level since 1969, with hiring and wages up strongly. Positive news about the economy raises a key political question, wrote Julian Zelizer, earlier in the week. \u201cWith an economy as strong as the one that the nation currently enjoys \u2013 3.2% growth in this year\u2019s first quarter \u2013 President Donald Trump should be feeling pretty good about his prospects for re-election. In post-WWII history, the only presidents who have failed to win re-election struggled with a tough economy (Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush), or decided not to run (Harry Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson). So, why are 20 Democratic candidates running to unseat President Trump?\u201d Given Trump\u2019s historically low approval rating and concerns about health care and the President\u2019s values, \u201cDemocrats are betting that even if the economic numbers hold, the President is extremely vulnerable.\u201d SIGN UP TO GET OUR NEW WEEKLY COLUMN AS A NEWSLETTER. The wheels threatened to fall off at the once-invincible National Rifle Association as the organization tried to cope with internal disputes, deficits, lawsuits and an investigation, wrote John Avlon: \u201cNow that the New York attorney general has sent out subpoenas, this is a scandal the NRA probably won\u2019t be able to spin its way out of.\u201d The organization faces a deeper problem than money woes, wrote Jill Filipovic: \u201cPeople may be the ones who kill people, but when they use guns, that killing becomes remarkably efficient, and the numbers of dead and injured are exponentially higher. \u2026 It\u2019s not ill-gotten green changing hands that the NRA truly needs to worry about.

I vowed to be more reflective, inclusive and accurate in my portrayal of the world. Just as John Singleton was.\u201d Singleton died this week, after suffering a stroke at the age of 51. Historian Peniel Joseph was 18 when he saw \u201cBoyz\u201d and was mesmerized by it. \u201cMore than any filmmaker of his generation, Singleton humanized the black experience by plumbing the pain behind the statistics of what commentators dubbed \u2018black on black crime\u2019 to reveal the emotional depth and breadth of African-American life that contained as much joy, laughter and genius as it did pain, sorrow and death.\u201d Where exactly is Sesame Street? It\u2019s not in the middle of Manhattan, despite the sign placed there this week, wrote Allison Hope. \u201cIt always has and always will belong to the people in the outer boroughs. \u2026 Sesame Street is a tight-knit neighborhood with people (and puppets) of all colors and creeds. They sit on stoops on warm summer evenings and get yelled at by grouchy residents who live in beaten-up garbage bins barely large enough to fit them. None of that sounds like Manhattan.\u201d Michael Hayden, a CNN national security analyst who once headed the CIA and National Security Agency, suffered a stroke last fall. In his first article since then, the retired four-star general bravely explored the challenges of relearning everyday tasks. \u201cIt is humbling to face these challenges that were once so routine.

She didn\u2019t like what she saw: \u201cCleverly hiding xenophobia under legalese and statutory mumbo jumbo are tools that the Trump administration have deployed to detract from the fact that the possibility of asylum, as it has existed in the United States, is being virtually eliminated for most of the world\u2019s persecuted people.\u201d Former Sen. Rick Santorum welcomed Trump\u2019s focus on the border, crediting him with facing a problem others have ducked. But in addition to expecting stronger action by the Northern Triangle countries to fix problems that are driving their citizens north, the United States has to provide more aid. Santorum wrote: \u201cAddressing the root causes of trouble is a better investment than inheriting the aftermath, as we see now on our southern border. Foreign assistance is critical, and it\u2019s a bargain compared to the security costs of having failed states on our doorstep.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Steve Rabinowitz is president of Bluelight Strategies, a Washington, D.C., public affairs firm, and a veteran of the national staffs of nine US presidential campaigns. The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. View more opinion articles at CNN. Two years ago, at the height of yet another national debate on the Affordable Care Act, some Republican members of Congress all but stopped engaging their constituents \u2013 and the traditional public town hall meeting took a big hit. President Donald Trump has also eschewed the format, preferring instead to deliver large campaign-style rallies in which he seems to revel. But now, with the 2020 presidential campaign in full swing and more than 20 Democrats jockeying for their party\u2019s nomination, the town hall meeting is back with a vengeance. CNN has a webpage dedicated to town hall meetings it has hosted. At last count, it featured more than a dozen candidates \u2013 some of whom have already appeared twice. MSNBC has also hosted meetings. And kudos to Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar for trying to reach across the aisle by participating in town halls on FOX News. Candidates are even staging their own town hall meetings instead of counting solely on TV networks to host them. Undoubtedly many of these candidates recognize that they are taking a page out of history. Few emblems of American democracy are as storied and historic as the New England town hall meeting of colonial times, where citizens came together to solve problems and hold their elected representatives accountable. While congressional candidates and elected officials continued to hold these meetings throughout the decades, they weren\u2019t always the standard for presidential candidates. Sure, President Jimmy Carter held several of these meetings, which often took place in high school gymnasiums across the country, but they lacked the intimacy and exchange that truly characterizes a modern town hall. Tim Ryan: I'm going to fight for the Americans Trump abandoned It was Bill Clinton who made them a part of modern-day presidential campaigns back in 1992, when he stood in the middle of a tiered \u201cbowl\u201d of voters seated on risers and bleachers and took their questions. (Immodest disclosure: When I worked as a staffer for Clinton\u2019s campaign, I came up with the tiered bowl format and my campaign colleague, Jeff Eller, worked with TV stations to host these town halls or broadcast them live from sister stations.) With a wireless lapel mic that allowed him to walk around the stage, Clinton engaged directly with members of the audience \u2013 both those seated around him, and viewers watching from home \u2013 making them feel as if he were addressing each of them individually. I subsequently had the White House purchase choral risers when I served as the director of design and production in the early days of Clinton\u2019s presidency, so as to replicate the same audience intimacy we enjoyed during the campaign. We placed the risers behind the President, which visually reinforced the support of the uniformed nurses, police, construction workers, servicemen and others standing in the crowd. For the next 27 years, presidents, members of Congress and candidates of all kinds would try to recreate these designs and images. Eric Swalwell: It's time to restore the American dream While this current crop of Democratic presidential hopefuls \u2013 and one lone Republican challenger \u2013 are jumping at the chance to interact with real-life voters, Trump, unsurprisingly, studiously avoids these events. He has stuck to large rallies filled with boisterous supporters who don\u2019t ask challenging questions. And we know very well the brutality that awaits anyone who attempts to heckle or confront the President. Much has been made of the President\u2019s contempt for democratic norms, attacks on the press, attempts to stoke partisanship and willingness to support foreign autocrats. While he connects to his base on Twitter, where he frequently rolls out policy proposals and unleashes attacks on his critics, he seems to avoid interacting with regular citizens in the town hall debate or forum. In this way, he does resemble a demagogue, eschewing conversations with voters for the adulation of an invited crowd.  Democratic candidates, on the other hand, are embracing voters\u2019 questions, recognizing that the largely unscripted format of the town hall allows the public to gain insights into their values, personal experiences and policy proposals. As the 2020 presidential campaign heats up, the Democratic Party is at a crossroads \u2013 there are generational rifts, splits between its center and left factions, and a raging debate about the importance of race, class and other identity markers. But what unites this disparate and soon-to-be-quarreling field is a commitment to American democracy, with the town hall meeting being a historical centerpiece where ideas are challenged and debated. Democrats should take heart in that and bear in mind all that unites us as we head into this presidential election cycle.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Two things were unavoidable as I visited Sargent Farm outside of Pacific Junction in southwest Iowa earlier this month. The first was the smell and sight of rotting soybeans, which were spilling out of busted bins and scattered across the land as far as the eye could see. The second was that the fields had all but turned into lakes. It turns out the two were directly connected. \u201cLast year\u2019s harvest is on the ground,\u201d third-generation farmers and brothers Matt and Dan Sargent explained to me. \u201cThis year\u2019s is under water.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have led America\u2019s trading partners to turn elsewhere \u2013 leaving many farmers like the Sargents holding the bag. So, last year, the Sargents made a tough call: surrendering much of their potential profit, they loaded some of their harvest into storage containers, praying the market would eventually stabilize so they could sell it in the future. Then, a few weeks ago, the Missouri River surged over its banks and through its levees, drowning their farm. It was one of the greatest floods in the river\u2019s history, fueled, in part, by a changing climate. The soybeans that the Sargents had stored took on so much moisture that they burst out of their bins. Two years worth of crops, spoiled and worthless \u2013 a casualty not only of climate change but of this President\u2019s unnecessary trade wars. Farmer who voted for Trump: I'm not going to be quiet The Sargents thought they might find some relief through their government-issued crop insurance, only to discover that it didn\u2019t cover stored grains. When Trump\u2019s Department of Agriculture finally reached out to the Sargents, it wasn\u2019t with assistance, but with a threat. According to the Sargents, the USDA said that if they didn\u2019t immediately dispose of their ruined crops in the specified way, they would be punished with a citation on the grounds that spoiled crops posed an environmental risk to the soil. This tragedy is not unique to the Sargents, or even to Iowa. In Texas, the price of Trump\u2019s trade war is also being paid by pecan farmers in Seminole, which is the county seat of Gaines County. The 2016 election results showed that 84.8% of the county voted for Donald Trump \u2013 but now, with tariffs on pecans driving down profits, one farmer at a town hall told me, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to pass this farm down to my kids.\u201d Trump knows full well how destructive his trade wars have been. They amount to one of the biggest middle-class tax hikes in history. But even with so many farmers crippled by tariffs, drowning in debt, and some farms still underwater, our President has refused to throw them a meaningful lifeline. Farmer warns US: America could suffer The President said he would compensate the farmers whose lives were upended by the very crisis he created \u2013 but to this day, many farmers I spoke to say they have received little if any compensation. Needing to find work elsewhere in order to make a living, some farmers tell me they are having to walk away from their profession altogether. And the more time I spend listening in rural communities, the clearer it becomes: China isn\u2019t paying the price for this reckless trade war. We are. This is only the most recent example of an administration that has ignored the interests of rural America. Longstanding inaction and indifference have left their communities with shuttered hospitals, underfunded schools and decaying highways, bridges, and railways. And as the President\u2019s more than $2 trillion tax cut helped corporations and the wealthiest Americans race forward, far too many more have been left behind. They have limited access to economic necessities like broadband, which they need to finish their education, look for a job, start a business or sell what they grow to the world.  Those living in rural America aren\u2019t looking for handouts. They don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s pity. They want a partner who will empower them, invest in them and allow them to make a profit as they grow the food and fiber that feeds and clothes us all. Meeting with farmers like the Sargents inspired me to revise my climate plan to make sure that federal crop insurance covers stored grain. Our plan will also protect communities against flooding and create new market incentives for carbon farming \u2013 farming in more environmentally sustainable ways. And as president, I would work with rural America to end these awful trade wars. We won\u2019t address climate change or a broken economy with half measures or with only half the country. We need to go to forgotten places like Pacific Junction and Seminole \u2013 and not only pay lip service to their problems, but listen to their ideas and welcome them to be a part of the solution. That\u2019s the only way we can transform this moment of peril into a moment of potential for all of us.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his own. Read more opinion articles at CNN. Delta Air Lines has taken a beating on social media in recent days for trying to persuade thousands of its employees not to unionize. It put up posters telling flight attendants and ramp workers that the $700 they would pay in annual union dues would be better spent on video games, rounds of beer or baseball tickets. While union leaders say these posters insult workers\u2019 intelligence, there is no denying that Delta has had considerable success beating back unionization. (In a statement, Delta said, \u201cDelta has shared many communications, which on the whole make clear that deciding whether or not to unionize should not be taken lightly.\u201d) Delta is the least unionized major US carrier, and thanks to its aggressive anti-union campaigns, organizing drives by the flight attendants\u2019 union were defeated in 2002, 2008 and 2010. Delta\u2019s flight attendants narrowly rejected unionizing in 2010, with 9,216 voting for and 9,544 against. Corporate executives, of course, applaud such defeats for labor, asserting that unions impede management\u2019s flexibility and hurt profits. But while any given union defeat may be good for a corporation\u2019s shareholders and managers, the many union defeats, taken together, have taken a substantial toll on workers and society. The percentage of private-sector workers who are in unions has dropped from 35% in the 1950s to just 6.4% today \u2014 from more than one in three to just one in 16. Numerous factors have fueled this decline, including factory closings, outsourcing and automation, but corporate America\u2019s decades-long effort to hobble unions is arguably the biggest factor. Oklahoma teachers will strike despite raise The decline of unions has fueled income inequality and wage stagnation, reduced economic mobility and helped enable corporations and wealthy donors to dominate our nation\u2019s politics and policymaking. When unions were mighty and union jobs plentiful, unions pulled up wages for everyone, nonunion workers too. Unions catapulted countless number of workers with just a high school degree into the middle class. In their book \u201cWinner-Take-All Politics,\u201d Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson bemoan the decline of unions, writing, \u201cWhile there are many \u2018progressive\u2019 groups in the American universe of organized interests, labor is the only major one focused on the broad economic concerns of those with modest incomes.\u201d Unions have also played an important role in reducing inequality. The decades when organized labor was strongest \u2014 the 1940s through 1970s \u2014 were the decades when America had the least income inequality. It\u2019s no coincidence that the United States has one of the weakest labor movements among major industrialized nations and ranks near the top for income inequality. One study found that the decline in union power and density since 1973 explains a third of the increase in wage inequality among American men, and a fifth of the increased inequality among women.  Economists at the International Monetary Fund found that the decline in unionization explains about half of the rise in incomes for the richest 10% percent in advanced industrial nations since the 1980s and about half the increase in those nations\u2019 main measure of income inequality. Kamala Harris introduces plan to raise teacher salaries Unions help to reduce inequality by pushing for higher pay for typical workers, greater restraints on executive pay and increased taxes on the rich. Another study found that a 10% increase in the percentage of unionized workers in a US community is associated with a 3% to 4.5% increase in the income of all the area\u2019s children \u2014 partly because unions push for better schools and a higher minimum wage. As union ranks have declined, so has labor\u2019s power in politics. In the 2015-16 election cycle, business outspent labor 16 to one \u2014 $3.4 billion to $213 million \u2014 according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. That center also found that all the nation\u2019s labor unions taken together spend about $45 million a year for lobbying in Washington, while corporate America spends $3 billion \u2014 66 times as much. Corporate America\u2019s huge advantage in campaign contributions and lobbying explains why many worker-friendly measures that have overwhelming public support stand little chance of being enacted. Americans support raising the $7.25 federal minimum wage; 75% want to see it at $12.50 by 2020. They also want laws guaranteeing paid sick days by 85% to 14%, and employer-paid parental and family leave by 80% to 17%. Corporate lobbyists have long given these a thumbs down, and these proposals have been stalled in Congress for years.  Many business executives voice alarm that more young Americans have a positive view of socialism than capitalism, according to a recent Gallup poll. Many young people feel this way because income inequality in the US is so extreme, economic mobility has slowed, and the American dream has become more elusive. Strengthening unions would be an important way to help reverse these unfortunate trends. Corporate executives and Wall Street will no doubt cheer if Delta\u2019s ramp workers and flight attendants again vote down unionization, but many economists warn that any further weakening of labor unions will skew our nation toward even greater income inequality and even greater domination of our politics and policy-making by corporations and wealthy campaign donors.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: In this weekly column, \u201cCross-exam,\u201d Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. This piece has been update with a question and answer portion. Attorney General William Barr\u2019s Senate testimony on Wednesday was a master class in obfuscation, backtracking and blame-shifting. This performance would\u2019ve been pathetic coming from an ordinary witness \u2013 never mind from the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. Throughout the day, Barr\u2019s explanations for his most consequential decisions ranged from flatly unpersuasive to downright bizarre. When asked about his determination that not one of the \u201cpotentially obstructive actions\u201d detailed by special counsel Robert Mueller constituted obstruction of justice, Barr offered the weak rejoinder that there was no proven underlying crime (debunked below). Indeed, Barr offered next to nothing to justify his dramatic conclusion that Trump never obstructed justice. When pressed on one of the most flagrant examples of obstruction \u2013 Trump\u2019s instruction to then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to have Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein fire Mueller \u2013 Barr resorted to a perplexing claim that Trump merely wanted McGahn to discuss Mueller\u2019s conflict of interests. Yet Mueller himself finds in the report that Trump, through McGahn, made \u201cefforts to remove\u201d Mueller, and told McGahn that Mueller \u201cmust be removed.\u201d Again: this is the top prosecutor in the United States, not a sneaky defense lawyer out of \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d Barr spent much of the day on the run from Mueller\u2019s remarkable March 27 letter, which flatly rebuked Barr for publicly characterizing his report in a way that \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions.\u201d Barr meekly claimed that Mueller\u2019s objection was with the media, which had misshaped public opinion \u2013 but that\u2019s simply not what Mueller\u2019s letter says. Yes, Mueller takes issue with media coverage. However, he was also concerned with Barr\u2019s four-page summary \u2013 to such an extent that Mueller felt it necessary to put it all on paper the day after the attorney general released it. And then there was the tragicomedy: Barr openly fawning over Trump yet playing dumb when asked the most elementary questions by Democrats. Barr lamented that Trump was falsely accused \u2013 as if Trump was like the Harrison Ford character in \u201cThe Fugitive\u201d \u2013 and excused Trump\u2019s obstruction efforts because, Barr surmised, he must have felt aggrieved by the investigation. When asked how a political campaign should react if approached by a foreign national offering dirt, Barr didn\u2019t give the only correct and sensible answer \u2013 \u201crun and call the FBI\u201d \u2013 but instead twisted himself in a pretzel, saying the person should first try to ascertain if the foreigner is an intel agent. And Barr pretended not to understand what basic words such as \u201creceptive\u201d and \u201csuggest\u201d mean, when Democrats had the nerve to use such \u201ctechnical\u201d terms. Barr is following the Trump playbook: Deny, deny, deny Barr\u2019s performance answered few questions and raised plenty of new ones. He offered nothing of substance to even begin to explain his dramatic \u201cno obstruction\u201d conclusion. He showed little appreciation for the national security threat posed by Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2013 and the fact that Mueller concluded that the Trump campaign \u201cexpected it would benefit electorally\u201d from Russian hacking \u2013 nor much inclination to prevent similar attacks in 2020. And he offered no coherent rejoinder to Mueller\u2019s concern regarding Barr\u2019s apparent efforts to spin the Mueller report before releasing it to the public. Barr now has bailed out on his scheduled House testimony, which is a genuine embarrassment: the attorney general of the United States is running away from a few minutes of follow-up questioning by congressional staffers. But this is far from over. In the coming weeks, we will likely hear from Mueller himself. That testimony should shed light on the most relevant issues \u2013 Russian election interference and Trump\u2019s potential obstruction \u2013 and, in the process, further expose Barr\u2019s politically-driven dissembling. Andrew, Virginia: One of Barr\u2019s arguments against Trump being guilty of obstruction of justice is his view that obstruction cannot occur without an underlying crime. Could Trump have obstructed justice even without an underlying crime? When asked during Senate testimony about his determination that Trump had not obstructed justice, Barr\u2019s first response was that there was no proven underlying crime \u2013 in this case, no proven crime of conspiring with the Russians. Previously, in his four-page letter summarizing Mueller\u2019s findings, Barr noted that \u201cwhile not determinative, the absence of such (conspiracy) evidence bears upon the President\u2019s intent with respect to obstruction.\u201d Barr\u2019s testimony was misleading on this count. A prosecutor might choose to give some weight to the absence of an underlying offense, but the law is clear that a person can obstruct justice even in the absence of a separately charged crime. Mueller correctly states in his report that \u201cthe obstruction statutes do not require proof of such a(n underlying) crime,\u201d though such absence could be relevant in assessing a subject\u2019s overall motives. Famous examples of defendants who have been charged with obstruction or similar offenses without an underlying crime include Martha Stewart (who was convicted of obstruction and lying to investigators but no underlying crime), the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, Scooter Libby (who was charged and convicted for obstruction, perjury and false statements but later pardoned by Trump), and Roger Stone (whom Mueller has charged with perjury but no separate crime underlying his allegedly false testimony). Even outside the criminal realm, President Bill Clinton was impeached on obstruction and perjury charges without any separate underlying crime. Mueller lays out several compelling reasons why a person would obstruct justice even in the absence of a definitely provable underlying crime: \u201cObstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment.\u201d If the law was otherwise, then criminals would have every incentive \u2013 and reward \u2013 to obstruct justice: a person who commits a crime (let\u2019s say murder) and then successfully destroys all evidence of that crime (let\u2019s say by burning the body and destroying the weapon, leaving no evidence to support a murder charge) can be prosecuted neither for the crime itself (murder) nor for obstruction. That is an unjust and dangerous outcome, and it is not how our law works. Anne, Oregon: What can the House do now that Barr has refused to show up? Will he be arrested? Assuming that negotiations with the House Judiciary Committee do not result in some sort of agreement, the House has three primary options, all carrying practical drawbacks (described in depth in this New York Times explainer). First, Congress can hold Barr in contempt of Congress, which is primarily symbolic. Second, Congress can refer the matter for a criminal contempt prosecution. Of course, that referral would go to the Justice Department \u2013 headed by none other than Barr himself. Don\u2019t count on the Justice Department taking action there. Third, Congress can go to court seeking an order compelling Barr to testify, punishable by imprisonment if defied. That litigation likely would take months, or years, to wind through the federal courts \u2013 though there is a rarely-invoked mechanism to seek direct review in the Supreme Court in cases of paramount public interest and time sensitivity. Barr ensures Congress can't stop Trump now There\u2019s a bigger picture here, of course. The White House has stonewalled various congressional requests and subpoenas, defying the inherent oversight authority of the legislative branch. Eventually, one of these cases will go to the courts, where we will see a civics course in action: Constitutional showdown between two branches (executive and legislative) decided by the third (judicial). I\u2019d expect Congress to prevail in court, depending on the specific facts of the dispute. Congress has broad fundamental authority to conduct oversight, and a court likely would intervene and limit only excessive or abusive exercises of that authority. The administration would be wise to pick its battles. A blanket policy of \u201cwe will defy every request across the board\u201d won\u2019t play well in courts. Paula, Massachusetts: Can Barr be removed through impeachment? Legally, yes \u2013 but realistically, it\u2019s exceedingly unlikely. While impeachment is most commonly associated with Presidents, the House has impeached other federal officials including Senators, Representatives, judges and a Secretary of War. No attorney general has been impeached, but it is clear from the text of the Constitution and history that an attorney general is subject to impeachment. While the law permits it, don\u2019t hold your breath. I believe Barr has damaged his own credibility and independence, but it is a stretch to argue that he has committed \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d  And the politics \u2013 including the fact that Republicans control the Senate, which can convict on impeachment only with a two-thirds vote \u2013 make it exceedingly unlikely that House Democrats will seek to impeach Barr. Lynn, Georgia: Why would Mueller spend nearly two years investigating without providing clear and conclusive statements of his findings? Two hugely revealing letters from Rosenstein and Mueller In his testimony, Barr pointedly criticized Mueller for failing to make a prosecute-or-don\u2019t-prosecute decision on obstruction. But as Mueller states in the report, Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president put him in an awkward position. On one hand, Mueller failed to make a \u201cprosecution or declination decision\u201d on obstruction, as required by the Special Counsel regulations (and Mueller did make such a declination decision with respect to conspiracy). Yet Mueller explains that even if he found sufficient evidence to justify criminal charges against Trump, \u201cFairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought\u201d because an accused individual cannot seek to clear his name through a criminal trial. (Mueller leaves us with a sentence that sounds like it was written by Yoda: \u201cif we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment.\u201d Meaning, it seems: I\u2019m not saying Trump did not obstruct justice. Former federal prosecutor and CNN Legal Analyst Shanlon Wu offers a smart take here, arguing that Mueller did not want to place himself in the middle of a political firestorm by announcing the President had committed a crime but would not be indicted. Ultimately, there is only one way to know for sure why Mueller declined to decide: Mueller\u2019s own testimony, which may happen soon.  1) Will the House Judiciary Committee hold Barr in contempt, and will they then go to court to try to force him to testify? 2) Will the White House seek to block Mueller and McGahn from testifying in the House? 3) Will the House request testimony from other players relevant to Mueller\u2019s findings, including Rod Rosenstein, Corey Lewandowski and others?",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. Joe Biden kicked off his 2020 presidential bid this week with a video. He looked into the camera and talked about the torch-wielding white supremacists of Charlottesville, Virginia, with an opening argument that aimed to leap over his primary opponents, across the generation gap, straight at President Trump. \u201cWe are in the battle for the soul of this nation,\u201d he said. He\u2019s older, he\u2019s white, he\u2019s straight, he\u2019s a guy \u2013 but in a Democratic field that \u201clooks like a Benetton ad,\u201d don\u2019t hold that against him, said Republican Ana Navarro. \u201cJoe Biden brings a lot to the table. He is everything Trump is not. He knows policy. He is a uniter. He calls for our better angels. He is empathetic and draws on his own grief to console and encourage others through theirs. He laughs easily. He is decent.\u201d And the main thing? \u201cHe is normal.\u201d Right now, Navarro said, \u201c\u2018normal\u2019 sounds really good to me.\u201d David Gergen, James Piltch and Blythe Riggan weren\u2019t so sure of Biden\u2019s chances, after watching five of his opponents appear in Monday\u2019s marathon of town halls on CNN. \u201cHis chief opponents are more formidable than they may have appeared in the early going, and the generational gap within the field may well work in favor of the younger candidates.\u201d One of those opponents, Elizabeth Warren, is the star who may eclipse another high-flying Biden rival, Bernie Sanders, wrote Jess McIntosh. Scott Jennings saw in the five-candidate evening \u201csocialism on parade.\u201d As he watched, \u201cI imagined my taxes going up. I imagined my guns and pickup truck being confiscated by the Green New Deal police. I imagined Donald Trump being impeached. I imagined Bernie Sanders ordering his bros to pick me up by the ankles and shake the change from my pockets.\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s move to invoke Charlottesville was smart, wrote Dean Obeidallah. \u201cI can assure the 2020 candidates that Trump\u2019s demonization of communities, from blacks to Latinos to the disabled to transgender Americans to my own \u2013 Muslim Americans,\u201d is very much on the minds of the progressive base. Susan Crabtree, in RealClearPolitics, took a look at bad things people say about Biden \u2013 he\u2019s handsy, he bullied Anita Hill, he opposed desegregation, he\u2019s a gaffe machine \u2013 and wondered whether Trump may have actually softened the ground for him. \u201cIn the era of Donald J. Trump, with his freewheeling rallies and over-the-top combative Twitter jabs, authenticity reigns supreme over more scripted, polished pols,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat amounted to weaknesses in Biden\u2019s previous presidential campaigns could emerge as strengths.\u201d But Matthew Yglesias, in Vox, foresaw a Hillary Clinton problem. Biden may be likable enough, but he will still face \u201cextended public scrutiny of every detail of a decades-long career in public life. \u2026 Americans like outsiders and fresh faces, not veteran insiders who bear the scars of every political controversy of the past two generations.\u201d Tonight on HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Gene Seymour warned, \u201cwe\u2019re prepared to have our guts wrenched and hearts broken.\u201d Someone is going to die, naturally. Who will it be? Seymour hates to spoil it, but \u201cif you insist on some idle, haphazard speculation, you\u2019ve come to the right place.\u201d We won\u2019t give his educated guesses away \u2013 but Brienne of Tarth? Grey Worm? Gendry? Watch your back. (HBO is a subsidiary of WarnerMedia, which owns CNN). Last week, of course, brought an altogether different shocker for Thrones fans: Arya, a young assassin, a character they\u2019ve known since she was 11, lost her virginity. Some viewers balked. Double standard, wrote Holly Thomas: She is 18 now \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t she get on top? \u201cA young woman claiming her sexuality apparently still challenged some viewers,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cFor young female audiences who are too often fed a diet of nerves and submission around first-time sex however, Arya\u2019s approach marks a welcome shift toward sexual autonomy.\u201d As Democrats tangled over what to do in the wake of Attorney General William Barr\u2019s release of the (redacted) Mueller report, Hillary Clinton weighed in with an op-ed for The Washington Post. Robert Mueller\u2019s report is \u201ca road map\u201d for both parties, she wrote. \u201cCongress should hold substantive hearings that build on the Mueller report and fill in its gaps, not jump straight to an up-or-down vote on impeachment,\u201d and look to Watergate for precedents. \u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d she wrote. Former federal prosecutor Elie Honig dug in on reader questions about the report, among them, \u201cHow could the White House be given access to the report before Congress?\u201d Honig\u2019s answer: It was legal and a \u201cbaldly political act\u201d reflecting \u201cBarr\u2019s political solicitude of Trump.\u201d Shanlon Wu, also a former federal prosecutor, lamented Mueller\u2019s obstruction of justice punt. A misplaced sense of modesty was the culprit, Wu surmised: \u201cA decision to announce that the President of the United States had committed a crime but would not be charged would have placed him front and center at one of the most controversial decisions of the modern political era. I think Mueller did not want that to be his legacy.\u201d A week after suicide bombings in Sri Lankan churches and hotels killed and wounded hundreds, authorities there urged people to worship at home. As police searched for conspirators, Peter Bergen asked: \u201cWhy would well-educated, upper-middle-class folks with seemingly everything to live for blow themselves up and kill so many innocents?\u201d Terrorism is often an endeavor of the privileged, he wrote. Osama Bin Laden, the \u201cunderwear bomber,\u201d the 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta, to name just a few, came from money. Frida Ghitis, recounting her travels in Sri Lanka, warned that the attacks could revive deadly ethnic and religious tensions in a place that has grown welcoming to tourists. Decisive action to root out terrorists is needed, \u201cbut let\u2019s hope cool thinking prevails. Sri Lanka\u2019s peace is fragile,\u201d she cautioned. \u201cFanatics intent on sparking unrest, on boosting recruitment and weakening the state like nothing more than to see the state make life worse for their potential supporters.\u201d Gene Seymour responded to the news that Kate Smith was suddenly persona non grata in sports arenas for singing racist songs in the \u201930s. \u201cHistory, however mortifying, demeaning or sickening,\u201d cannot be changed, he wrote, after the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Flyers decided to stop playing Smith\u2019s recording of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d at games because of ugliness in her old catalog. The Flyers also removed a statue of her outside their arena. Fine, said Seymour, but \u201cinstead of sweeping such anachronistic, paternalistic claptrap under the proverbial rug,\u201d shouldn\u2019t we be waging a  more meaningful struggle against racism, like \u201celiminating disparities in housing, opportunities and everyday treatment under the law?\u201d As he heads into a tough re-election bid, with Democrats nipping at his heels over his tax returns, allegations from the Mueller report and more, Donald Trump may not be able to take a second term for granted.  Here\u2019s an idea, wrote Arick Wierson: Trade in Vice President Mike Pence for former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. Advantages abound, he argued: \u201cTrump would make history by selecting a woman of color with a deep political resum\u00e9 and foreign policy gravitas \u2013 making it the most diverse ticket in the history of the GOP.\u201d It would deliver the \u201cultimate coup de grace\u201d to Democrats\u2019 2020 hopes. Alice Stewart, the former communications director for Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign, had some advice of her own \u2013 for the 20 Democrats candidates. It\u2019s great to play to the base on core progressive issues such as Medicare for All and clean energy, but remember: Dems \u201cneed a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in the general election, which may involve appealing more overtly to centrists.\u201d Be civil (polls say voters overwhelmingly want that) and \u201cnever, I mean never, eat a corn dog in front of the media at the Iowa State Fair. Just Google that last one \u2013 you\u2019ll understand.\u201d Other smart takes on politics today: Julian Zelizer: Trump\u2019s stonewalling of Congress is a constitutional crisis. John Avlon: Andrew Cuomo asked 35 questions. I have some answers. The royal baby watch is heating up, but there\u2019s another reason Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were all over the British tabloids. The couple is reportedly considering moving to Africa after Baby Sussex is born. Don\u2019t do it, pleaded a British professor, Kehinde Andrews, citing the ugly echoes of colonialism. The couple would \u201cnot be representing modern multiracial couples everywhere, but the colonial institution that is the British monarchy.\u201d The couple made the British press even shirtier by announcing that they were having their baby at home and skipping the traditional post-birth public viewing. But Kara Alaimo fumed in their defense.  \u201cAs a new mom, I\u2019m outraged by all the outrage,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s deplorable to expect Meghan to get all dressed up after delivering a baby so she can be viewed by others, instead of focusing on her own needs and those of her family.\u201d Daily Mail columnist Jan Moir differed \u2013 with darts. \u201cIs it too awful to suggest that perhaps they also need time to art-direct the first tasteful monochrome photoshoot of Baby Sussex swaddled in Soho House cashmere and then upload it to their Instagram account?\u201d The Supreme Court heard arguments on the Trump administration\u2019s request to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. \u201cThe result could be devastating for political representation,\u201d wrote Joshua A. Douglas, costing states with large minority populations congressional seats and reducing their Electoral College clout starting in 2024. \u201cA citizenship question that undercounts states with heavy concentrations of noncitizens in urban areas would dilute the influence of more populous states even more.\u201d Back in the 2000s, Stephen Moore lamented in the National Review: \u201cIs there no area in life where men can take vacation from women?\u201d Moore, the former Wall Street Journal editorial board member and former CNN contributor, is President Trump\u2019s choice for the Federal Reserve Board (another candidate, Herman Cain, backed out amid concern over earlier allegations of sexual harassment). Moore\u2019s comments about women, surfaced by CNN\u2019s KFile, were made in jest, he insists. Roxanne Jones wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cPlease,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAmerica needs a vacation from men like Moore. It\u2019s time to stop branding these type of men successful leaders. Stop electing them. Stop promoting them. Time for media to stop hiring them, excusing their misogyny while professing to respect women. The hate speech of the Trump mini-mes isn\u2019t funny. It never was.\u201d The UN Security Council this week passed a resolution to help survivors of wartime sexual violence \u2013 but only after weakening it under pressure from the Trump administration, which objected to its sections about providing sexual and reproductive health resources to victims. Jill Filipovic was outraged. \u201cHow shameful that the American government is in league with some of the world\u2019s worst human rights abusers in asserting that, in the name of \u2018life,\u2019 we won\u2019t help the world\u2019s most vulnerable rape victims recover.\u201d \u201cFat. F-a-t. FAT. Roll the word around in your mouth until you can comfortably accept that fat is a truthful adjective devoid of intention,\u201d wrote Sarah Conley. She was speaking of the effort by fat-acceptance activists to reclaim the word. A Hulu show, \u201cShrill,\u201d and its star, Aidy Bryant, do just that. \u201cWe fall in love with her because for many of us, we finally see ourselves fully represented on screen,\u201d Conley wrote. \u201c\u2018Shrill\u2019 is a much-needed love letter to loving your body, standing up for yourself, and the power of community. For once, it feels like we\u2019re actually winning.\u201d Depending on your politics, Archie Bunker was either a retrograde racist or he was a righteous white man who, in 1970s America, \u201cspoke to the anxieties of countless working- and middle-class families across the country,\u201d wrote L. Benjamin Rolsky. Whoever Archie was, he\u2019s back. The impresario Norman Lear is reviving the \u201cAll in the Family\u201d character for a TV special. It\u2019s a tricky needle to thread, said Rolsky: The old show was satirical comedy, but \u201csatire only works if its audiences understand it as such. Otherwise, satire can often cultivate the very thing it seeks to examine critically, such as bigotry and racism.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, and author, with Kevin Kruse, of the new book \u201cFault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. As Beto O\u2019Rourke enters the crowded field of Democrats running for president, the party\u2019s voters face a key question: Should they opt for the \u201csafe choice\u201d \u2013 the candidate with the most experience, the most moderate positions and the one least likely to ruffle feathers by advocating controversial stances \u2013 or opt for someone such as the former congressman from Texas who might be perceived as riskier. After all, the 46-year-old O\u2019Rourke lost his race to defeat Ted Cruz for Senate, only served three terms in Congress and has an unconventional campaign style. Is it safer to go for centrists such as Amy Klobuchar or long-tenured politicians such as Joe Biden? The stakes feel enormous to most Democrats so they want to make sure they make the right decision. Defeating President Donald Trump is the top priority for every Democrat, above any internal tensions over policy that might exist. Beto-mania doesn't do justice to women This creates nerves about many of the other nominees, including O\u2019Rourke, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and even to some extent Sen. Kamala Harris. It might be that the \u201csafe\u201d candidate is not the smartest political choice. Any American voter over 40 has lived through a series of consequential presidential elections where the Democrats\u2019 safe choice went down to defeat. Vice President Al Gore seemed like he had a pretty good chance at the White House in the 2000 election. The 1990s ended with a booming economy, the federal deficit literally vanishing and peace overseas. The good times were rolling for many middle-class voters.  While the Republican House had voted to impeach President Bill Clinton, a fierce political backlash took shape against the GOP. Voters registered soaring approval ratings for Clinton despite the scandal, while Republicans ended the decade in the doghouse. Gore brought a great deal to the table. He had extensive experience in office and had a remarkable command of the intricacies of public policy. He had been involved in a number of key issues, such as the internet, long before they were on the national radar. He also had been senator and vice president, which gave him a fair amount of savvy about the dynamics of party politics. Yet George W. Bush won the election. To be sure, his victory came only after a divisive and controversial recount battle that ended in a Supreme Court decision effectively giving Bush Florida\u2019s electoral votes. Ralph Nader\u2019s third-party candidacy also took key votes away from the Democratic ticket. Nonetheless, thanks to the Supreme Court ruling that essentially awarded Bush a majority in the Electoral College, Gore was defeated. For all his experience, he was unable to deliver margins that were large enough in Florida to avoid the need for a recount. Many Democrats felt the election shouldn\u2019t have even been close to begin with given the wind that was behind Gore\u2019s campaign. Nor was the team that Gore assembled in the recount battle as skilled as Bush\u2019s in the final stage. Bush served two terms because the next \u201csafe\u201d candidate, Sen. John Kerry, lost in 2004. Many Democrats felt that Bush was extremely vulnerable. By 2004, the President was struggling to maintain his popularity as the war in Iraq was turning out to be an operational disaster, on top of the fact it had been based on spurious claims of Saddam Hussein possessing weapons of mass destruction. Democrats were energized to defeat a President who had slashed taxes, deregulated the economy and opposed gay rights, in addition to launching an unjustified war and botching the victory over Iraq. Like Gore, Kerry was an impressive politician. He defeated a number of primary opponents including the unorthodox Howard Dean, had served in the military, had a long record on Capitol Hill and had exceptional knowledge of foreign policy. The senator played it safe at the Democratic National Convention by boasting of his military service through a famous salute rather than talking about his work protesting the Vietnam War. Kerry also had been in the trenches of politics for enough time to understand how to avoid the traditional pitfalls of campaigns. Is Beto O'Rourke the next Barack Obama? Not quite. Yet in another close election, Kerry lost. The safe candidate didn\u2019t have what was needed to win. The Republican campaign machine twisted and turned his record so badly that many voters had trouble seeing Kerry as anything other than a war-resisting Democrat who would say whatever it took to win. The Republicans took his virtues, such as his willingness to engage in the complexities of issues, and turned them into weaknesses. Bush used wedge issues such as same-sex marriage to make certain turnout was robust. He wrapped himself in the American flag, touting the way his administration helped to restore normalcy after 9/11. The result was four more years of Republican policies. And most recently, Hillary Clinton went down to defeat against Trump in 2016. Once again, Democrats picked the candidate who seemed as if she was cast by Hollywood to be the safe choice. After a close call with Sanders\u2019 electrifying underdog challenge, Clinton took to the campaign trail in 2016 with immense confidence. After all, she had worked on the Watergate committee staff, served as a senator from New York and been secretary of state in addition to her eight years as first lady. Nor was she inexperienced with hardball partisan politics. She had seen the wrath of congressional Republicans when they continually attacked her and her husband in the 1990s. She had come under political fire while secretary of state from the congressional Republicans and the conservative media, particularly over Benghazi. And then there was her experience in the 2008 primary when a little-known Democratic newcomer from the Senate, Barack Obama, turned her world upside down by defeating her. In 2016, Clinton did win the popular vote, and some believe Trump\u2019s victory was aided by Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign. But as in 2000, there are many Democrats who feel the election shouldn\u2019t have even been close given the state of the economy, Obama\u2019s popularity and the kind of opponent she faced. Which brings us to the other reason that Democrats might want to think twice about the \u201csafe choice\u201d argument. The political candidate who had the most success in the 21st century was the one least likely to succeed. Can 2020 Democrats learn Trump's 2016 strategy? In 2008, Obama had barely any experience in elected office when he ran for president. He was unknown to much of the public except for those who remembered his powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. His biggest virtue was that he had spoken out against the war in Iraq, unlike so many of the \u201csafer\u201d establishment Democrats. He had taken a risky political position when it was not popular, and voters rewarded him for it. (Since Obama wasn\u2019t in the Senate until after the war started, he didn\u2019t have to cast a vote on the Iraq War.) He would be the first African-American in the country\u2019s history to win the presidency, something that still seemed impossible to many voters. He was depending on a coalition of younger, women and immigrant voters who were not traditionally the party\u2019s muscle in elections. While the economic collapse of 2008 and Bush\u2019s unpopularity provided him with tremendous advantages over Sen. John McCain, just as important was Obama\u2019s ability to organize, motivate and inspire voters. They believed he would offer a new era in politics and not simply a better option than the status quo. Obama also had a mastery of the election process, from his ability to navigate the frenzied 24-hour cable and internet media environment to his understanding that local organizing and social networking still mattered. Unlike Gore, Kerry and Clinton, he got to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office \u2013 and went on to win re-election.  To be sure, just because the safe choice didn\u2019t work in 2000, 2004 and 2016 doesn\u2019t mean that it couldn\u2019t be the ticket to success today. It is true that a candidate such as Biden or Klobuchar might have the best shot at winning back voters in states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that were crucial to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. But the best bet is anything but clear-cut. Democrats should not assume one candidate has a better chance than the other because he or she is the most conventional or risk-averse. Even the Democrats who are driving through the safe lane would do well to remember the recent past. Biden and others should beware of the Kerry trap of always looking for the safest, poll-tested positions on every issue. Recent election history should be part of the conversation that Democrats have in the coming months. It might be that the candidate best suited to bringing an end to Trumpism is the person who is drawing the large crowds causing voters to dream of a country that is better than this, and the person who will know how to fight hard in the crazy and unpredictable political-media landscape we now inhabit.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders are sparring through food metaphors on the campaign trail as the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential candidates inch closer to their first caucus showdown in Iowa. Biden, asked about Sanders\u2019 claim that President Donald Trump \u201cwill eat (Biden\u2019s) lunch,\u201d had a quick response: \u201cTell him come and I\u2019ll give him some dessert at the White House.\u201d Biden\u2019s latest quip comes in response to what the Vermont senator told the Los Angeles Times editorial board in an interview last week when Sanders was asked if he is too far left to unite moderates in a general election. Sanders talked about why he can unify the electorate and then, unprompted, pivoted to Biden and why his \u201csame old, same old type of campaign\u201d will not work. \u201cIf you are, if you\u2019re a Donald Trump and you got Biden having voted for the war in Iraq, Biden having voted for these terrible, in my view, trade agreements, Biden having voted for the bankruptcy bill. Trump will eat his lunch,\u201d Sanders said. Why we don't really know who is ahead in Iowa right now This is not the first time the two Democratic hopefuls have clashed. During the December debate in Los Angeles, Biden and Sanders disagreed loudly over a familiar battle: who has the most effective healthcare plan, leading to a comical moment when Sanders waved his hand to interject Biden\u2019s pitch. \u201cPut your hand down for a second, Bernie, OK?\u201d Biden said. \u201cJust waving to you, Joe!\u201d Sanders responded. Biden has frequently checked Sanders on the campaign trail \u2013 in one instance, saying that the senator is honest about the fact that his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan will raise taxes \u2013 but he recently told CNN that Sanders might have staying power, as opposed to someone like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, because Sanders is \u201cauthentic.\u201d Biden added that whether or not that will help Sanders win the nomination is \u201ca different question.\u201d Since Sanders has entered the 2020 race, the senator has called Biden a \u201cfriend,\u201d but has consistently gone after Biden\u2019s record. Sanders argued he is the better candidate when asked at a recent campaign event in West Lebanon, New Hampshire, about how he will defeat Trump. He tacitly referred to Biden and what appeared to be others by saying: \u201cYou know who they are.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A federal appeals court has found the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate unconstitutional but did not invalidate the entire law, which remains in effect. The 2-1 decision by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals likely pushes any Supreme Court action on Obamacare until after the 2020 election but again thrusts the issue of health care into the forefront of the campaign \u2013 and extends the uncertainty surrounding the future of the landmark law, long a political target for President Donald Trump and other Republicans. The challenge was brought by Texas and a coalition of Republican states after a failed 2017 congressional repeal effort, then later joined by the Trump administration \u2013 which, in a dramatic reversal from its earlier position, argued the entire law should be thrown out. \u201cLet the courts do their job,\u201d Attorney General William Barr told Congress earlier this year. READ: Appeals court ruling on Affordable Care Act The ruling should not affect the millions of Americans who signed up for 2020 coverage on the exchanges in recent weeks. Nearly 3.9 million people had selected policies through December 7, but millions more signed up or were automatically re-enrolled in policies through the end of open enrollment, which finished early Wednesday morning in most states. Protections for those with preexisting conditions \u2013 one of the law\u2019s most popular provisions \u2013 remain in effect. The court case is part of what once was considered a long-shot attempt to gut the Affordable Care Act. But two courts have now sided with the argument that a key part of Obamacare \u2013 the individual mandate requiring Americans to purchase health insurance \u2013 is no longer constitutional. \u201cThe most straightforward reading applies: the mandate is a command. Using that meaning, the individual mandate is unconstitutional,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s ruling states. Judges Jennifer Walker Elrod \u2013 appointed by President George W. Bush \u2013 and Kurt Engelhardt \u2013 appointed by President Donald Trump \u2013 were in the majority. Judge Carolyn Dineen King, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, dissented. Legal challenges to Obamacare have continually defied predictions and its fate may be even more difficult to predict in the 2020 presidential election year \u2013 other than the fact it will continue. Wednesday, the panel told a lower court that it must consider whether the individual mandate can be separated from the rest of the law. When Chief Justice John Roberts and the Supreme Court upheld the ACA\u2019s linchpin individual insurance requirement in 2012, the majority had relied on Congress\u2019 taxing power. Texas and other Republican-led states sued after the Republican-led Congress in 2017 cut the tax penalty for those who lacked insurance to zero as part of the year-end tax overhaul. That move came after a Republican-led repeal effort failed at the last minute due to the vote of the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But because the individual mandate is no longer tied to a specific tax penalty, the states argue, it is unconstitutional. They also say that because the individual mandate is intertwined with a multitude of ACA provisions, invalidating it should bring down the entire law, including protections for people with preexisting conditions. Getting rid of Obamacare would be a headache for Trump Last winter, US District Court Judge Reed O\u2019Connor agreed and struck down the full law. The appeals court majority agreed. In 2012, \u201cthe individual mandate \u2013 most naturally read as a command to purchase insurance \u2013 was saved from unconstitutionality because it could be read together with the shared responsibility payment as an option to purchase insurance or pay a tax,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s opinion states. \u201cIt could be read this way because the shared responsibility payment produced revenue. It no longer does so,\u201d the judges added. \u201cTherefore the most straightforward reading applies: the mandate is a command. Using that meaning, the individual mandate is unconstitutional.\u201d Defenders of the ACA, which include California and other Democratic-run states, as well as the Democratic-led US House of Representatives, have argued that Congress\u2019 2017 action affected only the amount of the tax penalty, not the individual mandate or the law as a whole. They say that if lawmakers wanted to actually repeal additional Obamacare regulations, they would have done so. Trump celebrated the ruling, which was issued in the middle of the House debate on impeachment. The ruling \u201cconfirms what I have said all along: that the individual mandate, by far the worst element of Obamacare, is unconstitutional,\u201d the President said in a statement. \u201cThis decision will not alter the current healthcare system,\u201d he added. \u201cMy Administration continues to work to provide access to high-quality healthcare at a price you can afford, while strongly protecting those with pre-existing conditions. The radical healthcare changes being proposed by the far left would strip Americans of their current coverage. I will not let this happen. Providing affordable, high-quality healthcare will always be my priority. They are trying to take away your healthcare, and I am trying to give the American people the best healthcare in the world.\u201d The Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administer the Affordable Care Act, did not immediately return requests for comment. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton praised the ruling. \u201cThe Fifth Circuit correctly held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional,\u201d Paxton said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to the opportunity to further demonstrate that Congress made the individual mandate the centerpiece of Obamacare and the rest of the law cannot stand without it.\u201d In its ruling, the court directed the lower court to look at two issues: How much of the law can stand and whether it should apply nationwide. The appeals court said that O\u2019Connor went too far when he invalidated the full law and needs to explain \u201cwith precision\u201d what he believes should happen next. They advised O\u2019Connor to use a \u201cfiner toothed comb\u201d and conduct a more \u201csearching inquiry\u201d into which provisions Congress intended to be inseverable from the individual mandate. \u201cThe rule of law demands a careful, precise explanation,\u201d the court said. Getting rid of Obamacare would be a headache for Trump For instance, the judges questioned whether the Affordable Care Act provision requiring certain chain restaurants to disclose the calories of their menu items is tied to the individual mandate. The judges also said O\u2019Connor must take a second look at the law after the Trump administration made new arguments late in the game that had said the law should only be struck as it applies to the states that brought the challenge. Invalidating the law in only the 18 states in the lawsuit would throw the nation\u2019s health care system into chaos and deepen the inequality of access to health care that already exists. Also, several provisions \u2013 such as making it easier to obtain lower-cost versions of certain complex drugs, changing Medicare payment rates or increasing certain taxes on wealthier Americans \u2013 would be difficult to divide up by state. The court acknowledged that when the lower court reviews its opinion it might once again hold that the entire law must fall. But the judges urged limits, writing: \u201cIt is no small thing for unelected, life-tenured judges to declare duly enacted legislation passed by the elected representatives of the American people unconstitutional.\u201d By sending the issue back to O\u2019Connor, Wednesday\u2019s action actually lessens the likelihood that the Supreme Court will be faced with yet another monumental challenge to Obamacare just ahead of the next presidential election. It is exceedingly rare for the high court to accept a case that has not yet been aired and resolved by lower court judges. \u201cBecause the Court of Appeals did not reach the larger question of whether the entire Affordable Care Act must now fall, and instead remanded that to the district court, the Supreme Court will face far less pressure to take this case now \u2013 versus waiting until the case comes back after that remand,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cThus, among other things, today\u2019s ruling may allow the justices to dodge \u2013 if they want to, anyway.\u201d But California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who is leading the coalition of states defending the law, said his department is prepared to file a petition with the Supreme Court to challenge Wednesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cLet\u2019s get finality,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans don\u2019t need to be jerked around when it comes to their health care.\u201d \u201cFor California, and I think millions of Americans, it is indispensable to get clarity and certainty,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd the best way to get certainty is to go to the Supreme Court.\u201d In her dissent, King said it \u201cboggles the mind\u201d that Congress wanted to strike Obamacare when it changed the tax language in 2017. \u201cIt is unlikely that Congress would want a statute on which millions of people rely for their healthcare and livelihood to disappear overnight with the wave of a judicial wand,\u201d King wrote. King added that she believed Texas and the other states behind the challenge did not have the legal right to bring the challenge in the first place because they could not demonstrate how they were harmed by the law. If Congress had wanted to repeal the law \u201cit could have done so,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut with the stakes so high, it is difficult to imagine that this is a matter Congress intended to turn over to the judiciary.\u201d She called the district court opinion that invalidated the entire law \u201ctextbook judicial overreach.\u201d The majority, she wrote, has ensured \u201cthat no end for this litigation is in sight.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story was originally published November 10. It has been updated to reflect the formal launch of Collins\u2019 reelection bid. There\u2019s a reason, besides the pie, that cars were lined up to get into the parking lot of the American Legion hall in Kennebunkport, Maine, on a chilly night in November, and her name is Sara Gideon. The Democratic state House speaker wants to unseat Republican Susan Collins, who has served the people of Maine as senator since 1997 and formally announced her reelection campaign in December. The event in Kennebunkport, exactly 365 days before the 2020 election, drew nearly 100 people to hear Gideon make her case. A Democratic win in Maine is potentially key to flipping the Senate in 2020. Gideon has already attracted backing from national Democrats. She raised more than $1 million in a week after launching her campaign and has outraised most other Democratic Senate challengers with the exception of Arizona\u2019s Mark Kelly, the astronaut husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, and Amy McGrath, who aims to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. Riding on growing distrust of Collins, Gideon is framing her opponent as someone who no longer represents the interests of Mainers. Over the course of her 22-year career in the Senate, Collins has built a reputation for being a moderate. She said she didn\u2019t vote for President Donald Trump in 2016, but she\u2019s disappointed those on the left since he took office when she voted for the Republican tax bill and \u2013 most infamously in her critics\u2019 eyes \u2013 by voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. But Gideon has an uphill battle. Despite her 10 years in public service and her campaign\u2019s growing momentum, very few of her potential voters have heard her speak before, besides in her TV ads. The American Legion talk was her biggest campaign event to date, and Gideon, 47, used the opportunity to introduce herself. The mom of three, a Rhode Island native, lives in Freeport, about an hour north of Kennebunkport. Her father is an Indian immigrant and her maternal grandparents came to the United States as toddlers, escaping the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. It was her husband, Ben, who was first recruited to run for the Freeport Town Council in 2009, she tells her audiences. But Gideon decided she was better suited for the job. Now, she\u2019s served nearly four terms in the state House, the last two as speaker. \u201cFor the past four months now, in addition to those beloved and important roles in my life, every day when I wake up, I remind myself that my new job and my most important job is to challenge Susan Collins to be our next US senator,\u201d she said at the American Legion hall. The crowd cheered. There was an energy in the room that\u2019s been building over the past three years. Trump\u2019s unexpected 2016 win and handling of the presidency since has unleashed a new determination among previously casual voters to get politically involved, to show up at town halls, to donate to campaigns out of state. \u201cI liked Susan Collins. I\u2019ve always admired her, often times when she voted or spoke on an issue I actually agreed with her,\u201d said Donna Gaylor, a lifelong Democrat from the nearby coastal town of Wells. \u201cBut I truly felt that she started to fence-sit on some things and waited to see where the wind was blowing, so to speak, where her party was going,\u201d she said, adding that she lost respect for the senator when she voted for the Republican tax bill and then for Kavanaugh. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that she didn\u2019t understand the ramifications of that,\u201d Gaylor said. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to take back the Senate in 2020, or three if they win the White House. The national party has targeted Maine as a battleground state, as well as Arizona and Colorado. Money has poured in from out of state to both Collins and Gideon. \u201cMaine is a legitimate pickup opportunity for the Democrats. I think it\u2019s going to be Collins\u2019 toughest race to date,\u201d said Mark Brewer, a professor of political science at the University of Maine. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the Democrats\u2019 seat to lose, beating an incumbent is very hard to do,\u201d he added. The Maine election has all the signs of growing into an expensive and vicious race. A Burlington woman has already been found guilty of sending a threatening letter to Collins \u2013 which she said she sent after hearing about the controversy surrounding the Kavanaugh vote. Collins was a target of protesters at the time, who participated in sit-ins in her office. Gideon is refusing to take corporate PAC money and calls for getting corporate donations out of politics. She often points out that Collins has taken more than $1 million from drug and insurance corporate PACs during this election cycle. \u201cA lot of what is preventing us from getting things done on the federal level is that there is too much influence form special interests over members of Congress,\u201d she told CNN earlier in the day. But Republicans scoff at Gideon\u2019s criticism of Collins for taking corporate money, arguing it\u2019s hypocritical because she took money from companies while serving in the state senate, and isn\u2019t shunning money from party leadership PACs now \u2013 which could be funded with corporate PAC money. \u201cSara Gideon\u2019s claims about corporate PAC money are a joke. She built her entire political career accepting corporate money through her leadership PAC,\u201d said Jason Savage, executive director of Maine Republican Party. Gideon is also taking heat for an ethics violation. Last month, she was fined $500 by the Maine Ethics Commission over donations made in her name in 2015 and 2016 to her now dissolved leadership PAC. The contributions are also subject to complaints filed with the Federal Elections Commission. The complaint was filed by a former Republican member of the state senate. \u201cIt should come as no surprise that Speaker Sara Gideon was unanimously found guilty by the Maine Ethics Commission today for being a straw-donor for her corporate-funded PAC. Her clear and blatant violation of the law was clear and we are glad to see she is being held accountable,\u201d said Maine GOP Chairwoman Demi Kouzounas in a statement. But Gideon has said that it was a mistake and she was \u201cgiven incorrect guidance\u201d on how she could make the contributions. Her campaign points out that that the commissioners \u201csaw no intention by Speaker Gideon to mislead or deceive\u201d and declined to investigate the matter. \u201cThere are people that are trying to make that into something that it\u2019s not,\u201d she said when asked about the fine by a constituent at the American Legion Hall event. Maine has a long history of electing moderates. The late Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and former Sen. Olympia Snowe both earned reputations as moderate Republicans. Maine\u2019s other sitting senator, Angus King, is an independent who caucuses with Democrats. Collins has been consistently ranked the \u201cmost bipartisan\u201d senator, based on the degree she works across party lines. \u201cTo suggest Senator Collins has changed is laughable.  She is constantly being criticized by extremists on the far left and the far right, yet she has never wavered,\u201d said Kevin Kelley, a spokesman for Collins. \u201cRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents are yearning for pragmatic, common sense leadership, and that\u2019s what Senator Collins has always, and will continue to, bring to the table,\u201d he added. Maine voted for Barack Obama twice and split its electoral votes between Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016. But Collins supporters point out that Collins won big even during those years. Voters also replaced Republican Governor Paul LePage, an ardent Trump supporter, with Democrat Janet Mills last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s changed a bit,\u201d said Ben Gilman, who has worked Maine campaigns for the Republican party for 25 years and currently serves as general counsel to the Maine Chamber of Commerce. Collins also carries some weight with voters because she was born and raised in Maine herself. \u201cIt\u2019s a big rural state and Sen. Collins has probably been to every town. She\u2019s been the bean suppers and the opening days to hunting season. They know her,\u201d Gilman added. Gideon is also positioning herself as someone who can reach across the aisle and often talks about her record for getting things done in a divided government. \u201cThere is one thing I want you to know about me and that is that I know how to stand up to a bully.  But maybe more importantly than standing up to a bully, I know how to work around somebody like that,\u201d she said at the American Legion Hall. During her first term as speaker of the state House, LePage was governor and the Senate was also under GOP control. But Gideon was able to build bipartisan support for a bill that expanded access to the overdose-reversing drug naloxone \u2013 enough to even override LePage\u2019s veto. \u201cSara marshaled the votes,\u201d said Chris Babbidge, a Democratic state Representative who introduced Gideon at the Monday night event. She\u2019s also had to build support from her colleagues in the House to be chosen as Assistant Majority Leader and then as Speaker for two terms. Gideon was selected by her colleagues as House Speaker after just two terms as a representative. \u201cIt demonstrates, I think, some remarkable skills,\u201d said Jon Hinck, a former Democratic state House representative who also challenged Snowe for her Senate seat in 2012 but lost in the primary. Gideon smiled warmly when she walked into the Portland Public Library for a roundtable discussion her campaign organized on prescription drug prices last week. She circled around, greeting each of the seven constituents with a handshake, asking where they live and what brought them out on a Monday morning. For Maine, one of the oldest states in the country, affordable drugs and health care are top of mind for many residents, and Gideon has made it her primary campaign issue. She\u2019s held similar listening sessions across the state. It\u2019s mostly senior citizens that showed up in Portland. One of them was wearing socks with Michelle Obama\u2019s face on them. She and another woman said they participated in a sit-in at Collins\u2019 office, protesting her vote on Kavanaugh. \u201cThank you for doing that,\u201d Gideon said. Gideon is a natural in this environment. She asked each person to share their experience and easily guides a thoughtful discussion on what at times becomes a rather wonky topics \u2013 ranging from importing pharmaceutical drugs from Canada (something Maine has asked the federal government for permission to do) to capping out of pocket costs for Medicare recipients to \u201cMedicare for All\u201d (she has some concerns and wants people to be able to keep their private insurance). All the while, she was weaving in what the state legislature has accomplished under her term and arguing that Collins has jeopardized the Affordable Care Act by voting in favor of doing away with the penalty for not having insurance, otherwise known as the individual mandate, as part of the Republican tax bill. Collins is a rare GOP defender of the Affordable Care Act and had previously cast a critical vote against Republican efforts to repeal the health care law. Gideon took notes throughout the hour-long meeting, tells one man that her staff will follow up to help with a billing issue, and wrote down the name of a prescription drug coupon service for another. It was clear she\u2019s spent time knocking on doors and listening to constituents\u2019 stories on a very local level. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s been the most challenging work I\u2019ve done because you\u2019re talking about people\u2019s house, their backyard, their children their schools \u2013 the things that are the most emotional,\u201d she said afterward. There\u2019s money waiting for whoever wins the Democratic primary. Progressive advocacy groups that organized many of the protests around the Kavanaugh vote have raised $4 million for Collins\u2019 challenger. But there are still seven months until the primary and Gideon has to run against at least two other Democrats: Bre Kidman, an attorney and activist, and Betsy Sweet, a longtime advocate for women\u2019s rights in Maine who ran in the Democratic primary for governor in 2018. Kidman has raised about $14,000 and Sweet has raised $183,000. Both have criticized the national party for hand-picking Gideon and telling Mainers who their candidate should be. \u201cThe playbook out of Washington on the way to win this race, is to raise a ton of money from wherever you can get it and run negative ads. To me, that\u2019s a stale playbook and it\u2019s not going to beat Susan Collins,\u201d said Sweet, who\u2019s held 19 town halls to date and is focusing on building grassroots support. Still, it will be hard to contend with the war chest Gideon has amassed. \u201cWhen you have a lot of money, you\u2019re reported on like the only candidate that matters,\u201d said Kidman, who was the first to jump in the race. \u201cWhen we say the person with the most money in the race is the best person in the race, I think we\u2019re undermining the legitimacy of our democracy,\u201d she added.

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg was getting a signal to wrap up his Iowa town hall, but he first gestured to the gathering of young people crouched near the stage as they clutched handmade signs. \u201cDo you want to go ahead and do the thing?\u201d he asked them. A few voices in the audience chuckled as Buttigieg invited the young activists, most of them college students at Grinnell College, to spread out so he could see their signs. \u201cWall Street Pete,\u201d one sign read. Another: \u201cYouth to Pete: You will Kill Us.\u201d \u201cNo, I won\u2019t! \u2018You will kill us?\u2019 That\u2019s really mean!\u201d Buttigieg exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you!\u201d The moment served as a window into the anxieties this young generation has about the inaction of older political leaders on major issues like the climate crisis \u2013 and how much of that anger is now being trained squarely on Buttigieg, who, while their peer in age, has offered moderate views that often align him with older voters. Increasingly, their opposition to Buttigieg is turning to fury, fueled by a boisterous online ecosystem of progressives who are driving anti-Buttigieg commentary and memes. They view him as beholden to corporate interests, unable to win over the diverse Democratic base that these activists take pride in, and disinterested in the systemic change they believe the country desperately needs on issues like the influence of big money on politics and climate change and systemic racism. These narratives have persisted in spite of what his campaign points to as evidence to the contrary, including that Buttigieg has proposed plans to address those very issues such as a climate change plan to cut emissions to zero by 2050 and a proposal to address systemic racism that he calls the Douglass Plan. Buttigieg supporters say the criticism has become unhinged, with some progressives eager to latch on to virtually any negative narrative about Buttigieg whether it is true or not. There is no question: The youngest candidate in the 2020 presidential race, at age 37, isn\u2019t doing well with young Democratic voters. In the latest Quinnipiac poll, Buttigieg gets the support among just 2% of voters under 35. And in an average of CNN polling in October and November, Buttigieg gets slightly better with 8% of voters under 35 \u2013 still a single-digit number. While some in the Iowa crowd might have found Buttigieg\u2019s invitation to his protesters to be disarming, several of the students were not charmed. \u201cI thought it was condescending,\u201d said Dylan Bremner, 22, one of the students who protested Buttigieg over his plan to address climate change. \u201cWhen he said \u2018That\u2019s mean,\u2019 I think it\u2019s pretty f***ing mean that you\u2019re not going to save us.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like he was very clear and candid,\u201d said another student, 20-year-old Oscar Buchanan. Since he jumped into the race, Buttigieg has gone from a little-known, small-town mayor, to representative of the Democratic Party vision has of itself as an inclusive party to, now, the arch-nemesis of certain progressive advocates. The intense heat on Buttigieg from some corners of his party comes as he rises in both early state and national polls and vies with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for a slice of the college-educated electorate. Both candidates have upped their contrasts with each other in recent weeks as the Iowa caucuses near. \u201cThe nature of presidential politics is the better you do, the more you are tested,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist of his campaigns. \u201cButtigieg has made a pretty remarkable progress in 2019. Now he is being tested as a legitimate top tier candidate and we\u2019ll see how he handles it.\u201d \u201cIt is an inevitable part of this process,\u201d he added. Buttigieg\u2019s critics cite a dramatic turn in his approach to his candidacy and are particularly incensed by his criticism of Warren on \u201cMedicare For All.\u201d (Buttigieg, for his part, has pushed for a proposal called \u201cMedicare for all who want it,\u201d an option that would keep private health care plans.) They consider his low standing with black and Hispanic voters to be disqualifying, and pejoratively refer to him as \u201cMayo Pete\u201d for his overwhelmingly white supporters. As a result, his candidacy, in their view, is akin to the vanity project of an overly ambitious, privileged white man. Some even readily share a \u201cNeverPete\u201d hashtag at the mention of his name online, reminiscent of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans who commiserated in opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy during the 2016 election. \u201cHe\u2019s phony,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, when asked why he opposes Buttigieg\u2019s candidacy so strongly. For Washington insiders, Jentleson is a well-known figure, a former senior aide to former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, a far cry from the kind of left-wing progressive candidate Jentleson now would prefer. But now, Jentleson is known online as a progressive flame thrower, leading the anti-Buttigieg charge and slamming him for his attacks on more progressive candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Warren. \u201cI was supportive of him on Twitter and stuff, but then he took a hard turn,\u201d explained Jentleson, who has also become a vocal Warren defender. \u201cHe\u2019s been validating Republican lines of attack consistently in ways that, if Warren and Bernie were the nominee, will give Trump a lot of footage to use in ads against them.\u201d Online, criticism of Buttigieg seems to be snowballing from questioning his moderation to suggesting that he is a Trojan Horse. His harshest critics pin him with the worst of descriptors, including one recently who called him \u201cracist, arrogant, dangerous, a warmonger and not qualified to be president.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s campaign largely dismisses the intense criticism they have experienced from people like Jentleson. \u201cWe\u2019re not focused on the small echo chamber of Washington insiders talking to each other on Twitter,\u201d said Chris Meagher, a Buttigieg spokesman, \u201cwe\u2019re focused on talking to voters about the issues that matter most to voters.\u201d He continued: \u201cThis election is about defeating Donald Trump and uniting the country the day after this president leaves office. Pete is the best candidate to do just that.\u201d But the contempt that has played out online has also started to playout offline, as evidenced by protestors at the Grinnell rally. The controversy over his time at McKinsey as a management consultant has fueled accusations that he is bought and paid for by corporate interests. And opposition research has flourished online, including one that accused him of playing a role in a bread price fixing scheme at a Canadian grocery store chain that began and ended long after his months-long consulting stint for the company. The chain, Loblaws, released a statement saying Buttigieg had nothing to do with the scheme. The kind of attacks that have been directed at Buttigieg have puzzled the candidate as well as his aides. And as they have gone from the internet to real life, including a wave of new protests outside of his high dollar fundraisers. \u201cIt is a little strange, because I think that I broadly share a lot of the same values and goals,\u201d Buttigieg told The Washington Post\u2019s Bob Costa in an interview when asked if the protests bother him. \u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to have a conversation with them, so I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d Buttigieg senior adviser and communications director Lis Smith is often on the front lines of batting down what she calls \u201cbad faith\u201d attacks against Buttigieg on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre given that Pete is the literal polar opposite of Trump- in words, deeds, values, experience, demeanor- but he melts people\u2019s brains in the same way and completely blocks out the sun for competitors similarly,\u201d she tweeted this month. It has been perplexing to Buttigieg supporters that a particularly vitriolic brand of anger has been reserved for Buttigieg rather than other moderate candidates like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden, both of whom share Buttigieg\u2019s positions broadly on issues like Medicare for All and college affordability. Many of the progressive voices fanning the anti-Buttigieg flames explain the disproportionate attention by pointing to Buttigieg\u2019s standing in the polls and a feeling of inevitability that Biden\u2019s candidacy is not as strong as it currently seems. The \u201cbrain-melting\u201d power of Buttigieg might also be attributable to the very thing that he touts as an asset: his age. Buttigieg has pitched himself as the candidate of a younger generation. But among some people in that generation, his current political positioning has filled them first with disappointment, then with rage. \u201cHe tried to fashion himself as someone more progressive on the outset and is now caving,\u201d said Jordan Uhl, 32, a progressive organizer who has been a vocal anti-Buttigieg voice. \u201cYou could say similar things about Biden, but Pete is much more brazen about it.\u201d \u201cBiden has a much longer history in public service and that\u2019s what leads people to not latch on to the same attacks as Pete,\u201d he added. Uhl cited former President Barack Obama as an example of a candidate who represented generational change and who he characterized as a crusader for systemic change to the political system. But presented with the argument that some of Obama\u2019s policies would be considered more moderate than Buttigieg\u2019s in today\u2019s Democratic Party, Uhl paused. \u201cThe thing is Obama was willing to speak to systemic issues and a lot of younger people are becoming increasingly disillusioned and cynical because time and time again candidates would pay lip service and not do it,\u201d he said. \u201cPete\u2019s not even trying.\u201d And then there are the the hard-to-define ways in which Buttigieg seems to grate against some Democrats\u2019 nerves, even the ones who might be expected to be drawn to his candidacy the most. The distaste among some gay Democrats to Buttigieg has been the subject of a fair amount of analysis \u2013 even raising the interest of Tim Miller, a moderate gay Republican and former Romney aide who has quizzically observed what he believes is a disproportionate amount of vitriol directed toward Buttigieg. \u201cThey\u2019re the meanest,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWithin the gay community, unfortunately, I think it\u2019s a lot of resentment that Pete does not represent the gay ideal \u2013 the pre-conceived notions about what a gay President would act like.\u201d \u201cThe idea that he\u2019s a closet Republican is absurd, but I think because of his nature as a mild-mannered, traditional-acting religious man, that it\u2019s easier to demean him as being Republican lite,\u201d he added. But for others, the part of Buttigieg\u2019s identity that is the most salient is not that he is gay, but that he is white, which they believe has insulated him from the kind of scrutiny that other candidates have been subjected to. \u201cI think Buttigieg and Biden are two generational ends of the same problem,\u201d said Jodi Jacobson, a progressive advocate who has taken issue with Buttigieg. \u201cThey\u2019re both white guys they both get away with saying stuff that we wouldn\u2019t abide by other people.\u201d Throughout the Trump presidency Democrats have insisted that removing him from office is a top priority, but the #neverPete sentiment is testing that. Asked whether he would vote for Buttigieg if he were the nominee, Uhl wouldn\u2019t say. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cOn a theoretical level, you\u2019re under no obligation to vote. Not voting is as important to consider as a speech mechanisms as voting.\u201d Bremner, the senior at Grinnell College, bristled at the question. \u201cI dislike when people ask me this question,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democratic Party needs to take seriously whether it wants to get the support of young people.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re completely ignoring us and they still expect us to vote for their corporate candidates?\u201d he asked. But even for some of Buttigieg\u2019s critics like Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, not voting for whoever is the nominee goes too far. \u201cEveryone should vote,\u201d said Green. \u201c(People can decide) how many times they want to volunteer or how much they want to donate, but it is moronic not to vote against Trump.\u201d This story has been updated with additional comment from the Buttigieg campaign.",

            "article_content": "House Democrats can now say they\u2019ve taken action to lower drug costs. The chamber on Thursday passed a drug price bill backed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi by a 230 to 192 vote. That\u2019s as far as the legislation is likely to go, since both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Trump administration have said they do not support the effort. But it allows House Democrats to say on the campaign trail next year that they fulfilled one of their main promises from the 2018 election. Pelosi had a tough time locking down support from members of the progressive faction, who complained the bill wasn\u2019t aggressive enough. She reached a last-minute deal earlier this week with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, including two changes that the group had been advocating for. The bill, titled the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act in memory of the Maryland congressman who passed away earlier this year, would empower the Health & Human Services secretary to negotiate annually for the best prices on at least 50 costly brand-name drugs and up to 250 medications, including insulin. Prices would be capped at 1.2 times their cost in certain other developed countries. And it would require drug companies to pay a rebate to the federal government if their prices increase faster than inflation. The plan would impact drug prices for all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. \u201cThe historic Lower Drug Costs Now Act will empower Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time in the history of the program and makes those prices available to all Americans with insurance,\u201d said Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr., Democrat of New Jersey. The legislation also caps seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket costs on prescription medications at $2,000 per year. The negotiation provisions would lower spending by about $456 billion over a decade, but the bill calls for plowing about $358 billion into providing dental, vision and hearing coverage for Medicare enrollees, according to a Congressional Budget Office report released Tuesday. A more controversial finding is that the bill would lead to eight fewer drugs being introduced over the next decade and about 30 fewer medications over the subsequent decade. Republicans, who are pushing their own legislation \u2013 the Lower Costs, More Cures Act \u2013 argued on the House floor that limiting prices for select drugs would make the private sector less likely to invest in research and development for new treatments and cures. The pharmaceutical industry also slammed the bill, noting that a single section would cut revenues by $1 trillion. \u201cThis would lead to the loss of anywhere from 30 to 100 or more new medicines over the next 10 years, leaving patients with some of the serious diseases, like Alzheimer\u2019s, ALS and cancer, without hope for the treatments and cures they need,\u201d said Stephen Ubl, CEO of PhRMA, a lobbying group. Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, is trying to drum up support for a bipartisan bill he crafted with ranking member Sen. Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. White House officials praised the legislation last week, but it still faces a tough path forward. Last week, the senators issued an updated version of their legislation, which would reduce the amount Medicare enrollees have to pay in the initial phase of the drug benefit to 20%, from 25%. And it would limit the amount seniors pay for drugs to $3,100 annually, but also cap the amount they pay out of pocket on drugs in any given month. The legislation would also require drug makers to pay rebates to Medicare if they raise prices on certain drugs by more than inflation, a provision that does not sit well with GOP lawmakers./ CNN\u2019s Haley Byrd and Clare Foran contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Kamala Harris fell as quickly as she rose. The California senator entered the 2020 presidential race in January a top contender for the Democratic nomination, someone whose political chops after ascending from prosecutor to attorney general to senator instantly made her one of the top 2020 candidates. Less than a year later, and exactly two months before the Iowa caucuses, she exits as a candidate who failed to live up to the hype and was unable to raise enough money to keep her campaign going. Harris\u2019 abrupt decision on Tuesday makes the senator the most high-profile candidate to date to drop out of the race to challenge President Donald Trump, and is the culmination of months of disjointed messaging, contentious infighting among top aides and severe money issues that plagued the campaign. A host of issues sunk Harris\u2019 campaign, but the final straw, according to a number of Harris aides and advisers, was the California senator could see no path toward the nomination given her inability to gain any traction in the race or raise money to get her message out, leading her to make what she called \u201cone of the hardest decisions of my life\u201d and end her presidential bid. Kamala Harris ends 2020 presidential campaign Harris was the lone black woman to launch a bid in 2020 and aimed to coalesce a diverse coalition of voters that mirrored that of President Barack Obama. But Harris failed to cut into former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s commanding lead with black voters, particularly in the early voting state of South Carolina, and struggled to break into the top tier of contenders in Iowa, despite polls showing voters viewed her favorably. Harris\u2019 central reason for dropping out now was to preserve her political future, multiple people close to the senator told CNN. At 55 years old, Harris did not want to assume debt \u2013 financial or political \u2013 and she believes she will be better positioned to be considered as a running mate or to run for re-election in 2022 if she accepted reality and ended her candidacy now. Harris started to take a hard look at the campaign\u2019s resources over the Thanksgiving holiday, sources told CNN, and made her final decision to get out on Monday after a full audit of the campaign\u2019s finances made clear success in Iowa and later primary contests was not possible. Harris pivoted most of her campaign to Iowa in September and all but shuttered her New Hampshire operation in November. Harris informed her campaign staff during a conference call on Tuesday morning, with one senior aide who was on the call telling CNN that it was clear the call was a tough one for Harris to make. The decision to end the campaign was a shock to many of Harris\u2019 top aides. Mere minutes before Harris\u2019 Iowa staffers were told the senator had an announcement and there would be an all-staff conference call, the team in Iowa, where the candidate had planned to make her final stand, was busy planning her next visit and for California Gov. Gavin Newsom to travel to Iowa as a surrogate. Harris, in the coming days, will travel to her campaign headquarters in Baltimore and then travel to South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada to thank her team. \u201cIn good faith, I cannot tell you my supporters and volunteers that I have a path forward if I don\u2019t believe I do,\u201d Harris said in a video announcing her withdrawal. \u201cSo, to you my supporters, my dear supporters, it is with deep regret, but also with deep gratitude that I am suspending our campaign today.\u201d By getting out on Tuesday, Harris also avoids an embarrassing finish in her home state\u2019s March primary, as there are still weeks for her to remove her name from the ballot in California. \u201cThe path became too narrow\u201d for Harris to stay in the race, an aide said, despite the fact that the senator had already qualified for the December debate. \u201cShe could\u2019ve waited till the end of the month to drop out then, but she isn\u2019t interested in just being a participant in the race.\u201d What appeared to be the high point of Harris\u2019 campaign came during the first Democratic debate in June, when she confronted Biden on his past opposition to busing as a way to desegregate schools. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day,\u201d Harris told Biden. \u201cThat little girl was me. So, I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly.\u201d The highs and lows of Kamala Harris' roller coaster summer The moment went viral \u2013 to the point that Saturday Night Live parodied it \u2013 and her campaign seized on the exchange, which helped quickly catapult Harris in post-debate polls and exposed a weakness in the vice president. Harris was touted as a possible new front runner in the days after the debate. But \u2013 in a sign of what was to come for Harris\u2019 campaign \u2013 the confrontation damaged Harris nearly as quickly as it lifted her up. Harris was accused of manufacturing the exchange and struggled to respond when she was accused of having the same position as Biden on federally mandated busing. Harris\u2019 campaign also got off to a shaky start when, at a CNN town hall in January, the senator said that her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan would get rid of private insurance, only to walk away from that position hours later. The misstep \u2013 which Harris\u2019 campaign aides chalked up to the senator being open to alternate routes to a single payer system \u2013 dogged the candidate for months and raised questions about her consistency and commitment to certain policies. As Harris\u2019 jump in the polls steadily gave way over the summer, senior aides within the Baltimore-based campaign began to search frantically for a message that would reinvigorate the sputtering campaign. Instead, according to people close to Harris, the search exacerbated a series of central issues within the campaign: A lack of clear messaging from the candidate and combative infighting between some of Harris\u2019 longtime aides from California, her sister-turned-campaign chairwoman Maya Harris, and campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. Harris\u2019 campaign soon became a hotbed of drama and backbiting, with many staffers feeling torn between the rival factions. Some aides and advisers questioned why Maya Harris, who previously worked as a policy adviser for Hillary Clinton in 2016, was playing such a central role in the operation. Some accused her of exerting so much control in the campaign that she slowed the decision-making process and muddied the message. But, according to some close to Harris, her sister\u2019s negative impact on the campaign was overblown and overshadowed the senator\u2019s inability to land on a coherent message. \u201cSure, it was Maya, but it was also the candidate who could have taken steps to fix that and more,\u201d one person close to Harris told CNN, saying it would be incorrect to assign more blame to Maya than Kamala. Others accused Rodriguez of overseeing a campaign rife with mismanagement, an assertion that centered on the fact that Harris had over $35 million to spend but still struggled to fund a successful campaign. That, according to sources, is a lingering question that has infuriated Harris and top officials: How could the campaign spend so much money, without being able to place TV ads when they count? \u201cThat will be the central question to examine: Where did the $35 million go? Why was the campaign structured like this?\u201d said a person close to Harris. The campaign\u2019s financial situation was also more dire than widely known, said one former aide. For example, the campaign has only reserved less than $10,000 for a digital ad that they had touted with much fanfare earlier this week. The ad was ultimately never released online and the buy was canceled Monday. All of the infighting took a toll on Harris\u2019 staff, who grew demoralized by the day as poll after poll showed Harris losing ground both nationally and in key states like Iowa. This problem was made worse when \u2013 even after Harris fired dozens of staffers, closed her New Hampshire operation and moved people from Nevada and California in November \u2013 her polls failed to budge in the key state. But possibly the most damaging aspect of the infighting was the impact it had on top-dollar fundraising. As stories of discord inside Harris\u2019 campaign came to light in the press, multiple donors told CNN that they complained to the campaign about how they didn\u2019t want to keep funding an effort where there was little direction and no one person was in charge. The best encapsulation of this was a fundraiser Harris was slated to headline in New York in Tuesday. The event, which included a number of top Harris donors like Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry, was struggling to raise significant money despite the big-name hosts, said a top Democratic donor, a sign that Harris \u2013 once a darling of monied Democratic donors \u2013 was falling out of favor. \u201cNo one is going to pay for a wake,\u201d the donor said. \u201cThe high dollar fundraising was just tanking.\u201d Harris canceled the event shortly before announcing she was dropping out. Money woes reshape 2020 Democratic presidential field two months before Iowa The lack of money became a particular issue because of billionaires like former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and businessman Tom Steyer spending millions of their own fortune to fund their campaigns. Bakari Sellers, a prominent Harris supporter in South Carolina and CNN contributor, said that the inability to keep up with campaigns like that eventually put too much pressure on Harris\u2019 campaign. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that it would be this stark, but I knew that she would never run a shoestring campaign,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cI think that there was a thought that more money would be coming in more freely, but I think all the candidates across the board are realizing that\u2019s simply not the case.\u201d Sellers also pointed to Harris\u2019 race as a reason she failed to catch on. \u201cThis country is ready for a lot and has made a lot of progress,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we still got a way to go and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for black women to be President of the United States.\u201d Harris has no immediate plans to support one of her Democratic rivals, people close to her said, even though she would be seen as one of the party\u2019s top outstanding endorsements. While Harris is not ruling out an endorsement before the voting begins in Iowa, she is more likely to make a decision by Super Tuesday, when she will be voting in California. Harris remains close with the handful of Democratic senators still running for President and, despite their prominent clash over the summer, her relationship with Biden has improved considerably over the course of the campaign, sources said. After visiting her campaign aides across the country to thank them for their time, Harris plans to turn her focus to one issue: the impeachment of Donald Trump. Harris plans to play a visible role in the Senate trial, sources said, and also in the Department of Justice inspector general\u2019s report that is slated to be released later this month. This work will return Harris to a key role she played before her presidential run as a constant check of the Trump administration. Widely watched moments between Harris and a number of Trump appointees, including now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, helped propel Harris to stardom before her campaign. And more of that work, her aides believe, will accelerate the process of rebuilding her brand, which has undoubtedly been damaged by the campaign that failed to reach its promise.

And they\u2019re ranked \u2013 so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week. 5. The Yang money machine rolls on: Even as better-known candidates \u2013 including a slew of elected officials \u2013 continue to struggle to raise the money they need to run effective campaigns in early states, technologist Andrew Yang just keeps raking it in. Yang announced on Twitter Sunday morning that he had raised $2 million in just the last week alone, a somewhat remarkable number given that most people were more focused on eating and napping than donating money to political campaigns over the past seven days. That $2 million haul represents one-fifth of the total Yang raised from July 1 to September 30 and suggests he could equal or even eclipse that number between October 1 and the end of the year. (Yang started October with more than $6 million in the bank.) While Yang has yet to demonstrate he can compete financially with the likes of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, he has already far surpassed the expectations of what he might be able to raise. And remember: Raising money is an indicator of support and momentum. People don\u2019t donate money to candidates \u2013 especially this late in the primary process \u2013 unless they think there is a real chance at success. 4. What do Bloomberg\u2019s millions buy him?: The former New York City mayor \u2013 and billionaire \u2013 is spending north of $50 million on his first flight of TV ads, with a special focus on big, populated states like California, Texas and North Carolina set to vote on Super Tuesday (March 3). To what end? We don\u2019t really know yet. There\u2019s been limited polling in those Super Tuesday (and beyond) states to date and limited national polling since Bloomberg got into the race. (A CNN national poll\u00a0released just before Thanksgiving showed Bloomberg at 3%.) If Bloomberg\u2019s ads are working, you are likely to see it nationally first, followed by places like California and Texas, where there are large numbers of undecided voters who might be persuaded by his ads. We should expect most of the major national networks to release polls on the state of the 2020 Democratic race over the next two weeks. And we might get lucky and get a credible California or Texas poll thrown in, too. For Bloomberg to stay relevant, he needs to show that he is more than just money \u2013 that he has a compelling message votes respond to. Those polls should show that.

Click to subscribe! 3.\u00a0Kamala\u2019s collapse continues: The final stage of any failed presidential candidacy is the blame game \u2013 when senior advisers seek to protect their own reputations by distancing themselves from a candidate who is clearly going down the tubes. One of the most striking examples of that ship-jumping came in a stunning New York Times story the day after Thanksgiving in which more than 50(!) current and former Harris staffers dished on why the California senator\u2019s campaign had collapsed after beginning with such promise. You should read the whole thing, but here\u2019s the CliffsNotes version: Juan Rodriguez, the campaign manager, and Maya Harris, the candidate\u2019s sister, are handed most of the blame \u2013 for running a message-less (and mean) race that ill served Harris, according to the staffers interviewed. That more than four dozen staffers and former staffers were willing to talk to the Times about their gripes with the campaign speaks to its massive dysfunction. That sort of rebellion is, frankly, shocking. Because we are still 60+ days away from the Iowa caucuses, the possibility remains that Harris can turn it around. But with this sort of staff dissatisfaction and disagreement, it\u2019s hard to see how she hangs on in the race until February. 2. Warren is bleeding support: The incredible summer surge of the Massachusetts senator, which catapulted her into first place in Iowa and New Hampshire, ended about four to six weeks ago. Now something more troubling is happening: Warren is starting to lose support in key places. A Quinnipiac University national poll released just days before Thanksgiving showed Warren at 14% in the national ballot question \u2013 down from 28% in the same poll in October. In a Des Moines Register/CNN survey released in November, Warren dipped to 16% \u2013 down six points from a September poll when she was top of the field in the critical Iowa contest. Those are the most striking results, but they are far from isolated incidents. According to the Real Clear Politics average of all 2020 national polling, Warren passed former Vice President Joe Biden briefly in early October \u2013 averaging 26.6% support. As of today, Warren is at 15.8% on average \u2013 putting her behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and trailing Biden by double digits. What happened? Warren\u2019s slide closely correlates to the October 15 presidential debate in which she was pilloried by, among others, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and\u00a0Biden for her support of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and her lack of specifics about how she would pay for it. Under pressure to answer that latter question, Warren released a detailed funding plan in early November to a very mixed reception. Then she followed all of that up with a mediocre performance in the November 20 debate. Add it all up and she looks like a sailboat in search of wind \u2013 at the exact wrong time. 1. The week impeachment gets real: Sometime Monday afternoon (or, because this is Congress, Monday evening), the House Intelligence Committee will make its full report on what President Donald Trump (and his associates) did regarding Ukraine available to its members. The following day the Intelligence Committee will vote to send the report to the House Judiciary Committee where, presumably, articles of impeachment will begin to be drawn up. There are two critical elements here: The report and the vote. The biggest question in the report is whether there are things in it that we didn\u2019t already know that either further implicate Trump or exonerate him. It seems very unlikely there is a bombshell bigger than US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\u2019s admission that there was a quid pro quo in place between the US and Ukraine but, at this point, who knows? The second issue is the vote. Because Democrats control the majority on the Intelligence Committee \u2013 as they do on all House committees \u2013 the outcome of the vote isn\u2019t in doubt. You should expect all 13 Democrats on the committee to vote in favor and all nine Republicans to oppose. But what\u2019s notable is that this will be the first of \u2013 likely \u2013 a series of impeachment votes that could fundamentally alter not just the shape of the 2020 election but also of the two parties going forward. Once the vote on Tuesday happens, the course will be set: Impeachment in the House followed by a Senate trial. This is history.",

            "article_content": "The activist Ady Barkan announced on Wednesday that he is endorsing Elizabeth Warren for president, a strong sign of progressive support for the Massachusetts senator after her rollout of a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d transition plan last week that received mixed reviews from leading single-payer advocates. Barkan, who is dying of ALS after being diagnosed in 2016, has emerged over the last few years as one of the leading health care activists in the country, incorporating his own story into a broader appeal for a massive overhaul of the American health care system. During this Democratic primary campaign, nearly all of the party\u2019s leading candidates have made the journey to California, where Barkan lives with his wife and two children, to discuss the issue in a series of taped interviews. In the past month, as Warren first unveiled her proposal to finance Medicare for All and, more recently, with the release of her transition plan, Barkan has backed her over the concerns of some fellow activists. A neurodegenerative disease took this man's future, but his legacy might be the 2020 election \u201cWe can and should talk about our strategy and our tactics,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed published early Wednesday by The Nation. \u201cBut what matters most to me is that Elizabeth Warren is all in for Medicare for All. Her plan says clearly that by the end of her first term everyone will have comprehensive guaranteed Medicare \u2013 whether you are rich or poor, young or old; that there will be no co-pays, premiums or deductibles; and that we will bring down the costs of healthcare because private insurance companies will no longer be able to put profit over patients.\u201d Warren in a statement thanked Barkan for his endorsement. \u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful to have Ady Barkan\u2019s support in this fight,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m making a promise to Ady, his family, and every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own. We\u2019re going to do this together.\u201d This past spring, Barkan testified at the first congressional hearings on Medicare for All. \u201cSome people argue that although Medicare for All is a great idea, we need to move slowly to get there,\u201d he said during a now-rare trip to Washington. \u201cBut I needed Medicare for All yesterday. Millions of people need it today. The time to pass this law is now.\u201d But Barkan\u2019s relationship with Warren traces back further than the current election cycle. In 2012, he launched a pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve, calling for it to prioritize employment and wage growth over concerns about inflation. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Elizabeth since before I was sick,\u201d Barkan recalled. \u201cShe was a key partner for the Fed Up campaign, an effort I led to demand that the Federal Reserve use monetary policy as a vehicle for good, instead of as a handout to Goldman Sachs.\u201d Warren sat with Barkan earlier this year to discuss the issue, a conversation that pushed Warren deeper into the ideological weeds of the debate than she had previously gone. Asked by Barkan how she ultimately squared her support for Medicare for All \u2013 which would effectively ban private health insurance \u2013 with her defense of well-regulated private markets, Warren offered what progressives considered a notable concession. \u201cThere are areas where markets just don\u2019t work and a big part of health care is one of those. So the idea that we could get a couple of regulations in place and it will all sort itself out is just not true with health care,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI get financial decisions over whether you\u2019re gonna to be able to get a new car or what it looks like, but not financial decisions at the heart of basic health care. Medicare for All, it\u2019s about a relationship that all of us as Americans have to each other.\u201d Elizabeth Warren releases plan to implement Medicare for All during first term in office Last week, Warren put out her new plan to transition the country to Medicare for All, first by using the Senate budget reconciliation process to pass legislation that would immediately offer Medicare for All\u2019s full suite of benefits \u2013 at no cost \u2013 to children under 18 and people at up to 200% of the poverty level, around $51,000 in income for a family of four. The option would be open to any American who wants to use it, but they would have to pay for it, though costs would decline over time. Additionally, the legislation would lower the current Medicare eligibility age to 50 from 65, while also expanding the program\u2019s benefits and lowering prices for enrollees. But a full push to move to Medicare for All, she said, would only come after the first piece was implemented and had a chance to take hold. Warren has pledged to finish the transition before the end of her first term in office. Amid some criticism suggesting Warren was checking her support for the policy, Barkan defended her. \u201cToday, @ewarren laid out a plan to get 100 million ppl onto Medicare in first 100 days, via exec action & 51-vote reconciliation,\u201d he tweeted last week. \u201cAnd to use that victory to win midterms & show America that M4A is a great+workable. It\u2019s a damn smart plan. And by now, that should surprise no one.\u201d In his piece in The Nation explaining why he would vote for Warren in the California primary, Barkan also makes clear his fond feelings and support for Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent senator who wrote and popularized the Medicare for All legislation. \u201cFor progressives like me \u2013 and maybe you \u2013 the choice in this primary is between Elizabeth and Bernie. It is a difficult and wonderful choice to have,\u201d Barkan wrote. \u201cI believe that either one of them would be the best, most progressive president in modern US history.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "The fault lines in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary are clear when it comes to health care. On one side are Sens. Bernie Sanders (Vermont) and Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) who support \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a proposal that would eliminate the private health care industry totally and replace it with a government-run system. On the other side are former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom have said the best course of action is to improve upon the current law of the land \u2013 the Affordable Care Act \u2013 rather than undergo a(nother) wholesale change in the health care delivery system. According to a new analysis of the 2018 midterm election results by Emory University Political Science professor Alan Abramowitz, Democrats who supported \u201cMedicare for All\u201d in the 60 closest House elections did significantly worse than those who did not. In the districts Abramowitz examined \u2013 places President Donald Trump won in 2016 by less than 10 points that were either open seats or a Republican incumbent \u2013 just 42% of Democratic candidates who publicly supported Medicare for All won in 2018 while 72% of Democrats who did not support the legislation came out on top. Obviously, it is not as simple as that. House races aren\u2019t solely decided by where a candidate stands on a single issue \u2013 even one as high-profile and intensely felt as Medicare for All. But even when Abramowitz ran a regression model to control for other factors in these five dozen most competitive contests, he found similar results. \u201cAfter controlling for all of the other variables affecting the outcomes of these contests, Democratic candidates who endorsed Medicare for All \u2026 the estimated coefficient of -4.6 indicates that support for Medicare for All cost Democratic candidates in these competitive districts almost five points of vote margin \u2013 a substantial effect in a close election,\u201d concluded Abramowitz. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Which is verrrry interesting \u2013 and consistent with polling on the subject. In a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month, 55% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they would prefer to vote for a candidate who will build on the existing law while 40% said they wanted a candidate who supported replacing the ACA with Medicare for All. The bulk of polling on the issue affirms the Kaiser findings; Democrats, when given the choice, would rather make the current law better than rip it up and replace it with something new. This data comes even as Warren has fully embraced Medicare for All \u2013 to the point where, after months of public pressure, she released a detailed plan on how she proposes to pay for it. It also arrives as the surge Warren enjoyed over the summer has clearly come to an end \u2013 both nationally and in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Coincidence? Those don\u2019t happen all that much in politics at this level. The Point: Warren (and Sanders) are all-in on a proposal that the majority of Democrats don\u2019t want, and which exerted a drag on Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms.\u00a0That should worry them (and their supporters).",

THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Writes former Chicago mayor (and former White House chief of staff) Rahm Emanuel in Politico: \u201cThe Democratic candidates who have prevailed in battleground contests since 2016 didn\u2019t embrace pie-in-the-sky policy ideas or propose a smorgasbord of new entitlements. They didn\u2019t talk constantly about providing a guaranteed basic income. Or promising to make college free. Or eliminating private insurance and replacing it with a government-run health care system. Or giving $250 more each month in Social Security benefits. Or enacting the \u2018Green New Deal.\u2019 Or calling for the immediate and abrupt end of fossil fuels. Or vowing to seize guns from people\u2019s homes\u2026. \u201c\u2026Inexplicably, the men and women who want to be our party\u2019s standard-bearer seem to be ignoring the unambiguous message voters are sending\u2014and that should concern anyone who wants to defeat Trump in 2020.\u201d Now, Emanuel, who helped direct House Democrats\u2019 last successful retaking of the House majority in 2006 as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and later went on to serve as President Barack Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, is no favorite of the liberal left. They view his political pragmatism with deep skepticism and believe he is far too close to the party\u2019s corporate side for their comfort. Which means that Emanuel\u2019s advice here \u2013 make the election about Donald Trump and his policies rather than on big \u201cpie-in-the-sky\u201d proposals offered to placate the liberal left \u2013 will likely be ignored or castigated by the likes of Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and Bernie Sanders (Vermont) and their supporters. But should they ignore Emanuel? After all, Emanuel did engineer the Democratic House takeover in 2006 \u2013 after more than a decade of Republican rule. And he did spend years at the sides the last two two-term Democratic presidents: Obama and Bill Clinton. And there\u2019s plenty of polling and real-world results that suggest Emanuel isn\u2019t wrong about the basic makeup of the party regulars. Candidates in Virginia\u2019s state legislative races earlier this month talked very little about proposals like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and the Green New Deal \u2013 instead focusing on more local issues. The Democrats\u2019 suburban gains in places like Florida, Pennsylvania and California in 2018 were fueled by a relentless focus on Republicans\u2019 plans to repeal Obamacare and their tax cut package that strongly favored the wealthy and corporations. Polling in six swing states done by The New York Times and Siena College earlier this month affirms that sense. Almost two-thirds of Democrats (62%) in those states said they prefer a candidate who \u201cpromises to find common ground with Republicans: while just 1 in 3 would rather a candidate who \u201cpromises to fight for a bold and progressive agenda.\u201d A majority (55%) want their presidential nominee to be \u201cmore moderate\u201d than most Democrats, while 39% want their nominee to be \u201cmore liberal\u201d than most in the party. Among Democratic voters in those six states, 49% identify as \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cconservative\u201d while 48% call themselves \u201cliberal.\u201d Again, Emanuel: \u201cThe good news for Democrats is that Trump doesn\u2019t have enough die-hard voters to win without convincing some voters who are on the fence. The bad news for Democrats? Neither do we.\u201d Will Democrats heed his warning? Almost certainly not \u2013 especially given the success of both Warren and Sanders in the primary fight to date. Whether they should listen to Emanuel if they want to win is a much more open question.",

And they\u2019re ranked \u2013 so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week. Subscribe to The Point newsletter\u00a0here! 5. Bloomberg vs. the calendar: The former New York City mayor has two calendar questions surrounding his potential candidacy. First, did he get in too late? Yes, Michael Bloomberg qualified for the presidential ballot in Alabama on Friday. But can he meet the varied ballot requirements \u2013 many states requires slews of signatures that take time and money to get \u2013 with such a truncated timeline? The best argument in Bloomberg\u2019s favor is that he\u2019s a billionaire and can throw loads of money at these ballot problems as they arise. Which, maybe? Second, can any candidate \u2013 even one worth $50+ billion \u2013 skip the first four states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina) as Bloomberg would do if he ran and have a real chance at winning? It hasn\u2019t worked before in the modern nominating era, largely because momentum is built in those first few contests that carries over throughout the rest of the primary. For Bloomberg to avoid that fate, he needs some help. A single candidate \u2013 like, say, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2013 winning several of the first four could give her enough momentum to make Bloomberg\u2019s plan useless. What Bloomberg needs is a muddled result out of the first four states \u2013 ideally with three (or even four) different winners. That would mean a reset of the race in early March, when Bloomberg begins to factor into the race in earnest. 4. Buttigieg vs. everyone else: The New York Times headline on Sunday tells it all: \u201cWhy Pete Buttigieg Annoys his Democratic Rivals.\u201d What\u2019s behind the disdain of Mayor Pete held by his opponents? A decent chunk of it is jealousy; Buttigieg has raised more money and performed far better in polls than most of the field and is seen by lots of people within the party as its future. The other piece of the annoyance is rooted in the confidence (some would say over-confidence) of the South Bend, Indiana, mayor and his team. Buttigieg, much more so than the rest of the field, is willing to publicly play pundit and make pronouncements like he did last week when he said the race was now down to him and Warren. (He later walked that back.) What that rising ire means for Buttigieg is, well, watch out. Buttigieg is likely to be a major target in the November 20 presidential debate \u2013 and in the 10 days between now and then, too. The likeliest attacks? His age (he\u2019s 37), his inexperience (he\u2019s only ever served as the mayor of South Bend) and his lack of detailed policy plans. Buttigieg\u2019s ability has been the story of the race so far. Can he fend off the inevitable attacks that come with his rising poll status? 3. Warren and Sanders vs. Bloomberg: The likely late-entry candidacy of Bloomberg has made Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders very, very mad. \u201cTonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain\u2019t gonna buy this election,\u201d Sanders told a cheering Iowa crowd\u00a0Saturday night. Warren sent a tweet with a link to her billionaires calculator that tells the uber-rich how much more in taxes they would pay under her presidency than they do right now. The willingness of the two most liberal candidates in the race to attack the richest person in the race (assuming Bloomberg runs) is telling \u2013 especially when you consider that both Warren and Sanders have avoided directly attacking their rivals in the race to date. (More on Warren dipping her toe further into the attack waters below.) Warren and Sanders clearly believe that a Bloomberg candidacy is good news for them \u2013 further dividing the moderate/pragmatic/establishment vote between Biden, Buttigieg and now Bloomberg. While Bloomberg is an imperfect example of the ways in which the ultra-wealthy game the system \u2013 he donates huge sums to both charities and political causes \u2013 his defense of the business world is enough for both Warren and Sanders to jump on him. Watch to see how Bloomberg hits back \u2013 and if it works. 2. Trump vs. the public: The President has, to date, cast the impeachment investigation led by House Democrats as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and a \u201choax\u201d among other things. Those attacks have been interspersed by the regular release of transcripts of witnesses who have testified behind closed doors about the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 transcripts that paint a clear picture of a pressure campaign organized by the White House to force the foreign power to open an investigation into Joe Biden. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president.) The landscape of that fight changes on Wednesday, when the House holds its first of a series of open, public hearings\u00a0with US diplomat Bill Taylor on Wednesday. (Taylor is one of three witnesses expected to testify publicly this week.) The open hearings pose an entirely different challenge for Trump since visuals are always more powerful than words on paper. Trump, of all people, understand this; he has spent a lifetime using the power of TV to his advantage. But shaping how people perceive these public hearings is largely out of his hands. He can tweet, sure. He can attack everyone as \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d \u2013 despite no evidence that that\u2019s the case. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! What will mater most, however, is how credible people like Taylor and George Kent, a State Department official, come off to the public. And whether the moments created in these hearings \u2013 and there are always moments \u2013 work in the President\u2019s favor or in the favor of his opponents. 1. Biden vs. Warren: When Warren suggested the former vice president should be running in the Republican presidential primary because of his criticism of her \u201cMedicare For All\u201d plan, Biden fought back. He\u2019s spent the past week bashing Warren as an elitist who is out of touch with working people, who, he maintains, are the core of the Democratic Party. Warren has cast that elitist attack as an attempt to paint her as angry \u2013 a gendered low blow. \u201cOver and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry,\u201d Warren wrote in a fundraising email to supporters. \u201cIt makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.\u201d Both sides clearly believe that this is a fight that benefits their side \u2013 and that they can win. Which means it\u2019s not going to stop anytime soon. To reclaim momentum in the race, Biden has to convince Democratic voters that Warren represents a dangerous gamble because of her liberal policies and alleged elitism. For Warren, she needs to show she can beat back that attack \u2013 which will surely come from Trump if he is the nominee \u2013 while also making the case that Biden\u2019s hits on her are a function of the establishment (and men in particular) panicking because they see a strong woman emerging as the potential nominee.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren has a message for those attacking her as angry: Yes, she is. On Friday afternoon, the Massachusetts Democrat, in a fundraising email for her presidential campaign, addressed the innuendo stoked this week by former Vice President Joe Biden and others who have cast her as a elitist ideologue. \u201cI am angry and I own it,\u201d the subject line read. \u201cOver and over,\u201d Warren wrote below, \u201cwe are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.\u201d It was the most direct response to \u2013 and an embrace of \u2013 an attack launched by Biden in a Medium post on Tuesday in which he assailed the senator, without naming names, over her suggestion that his arguments against \u201cMedicare for All\u201d sounded like they were coming from a candidate \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d In her response, Warren also made explicit what many of her supporters have suggested in recent days: that recent criticisms lodged against her by rivals like Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have a sexist edge to them. Both have singled out Warren for taking a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d approach to her campaign. On Tuesday, Biden wrote that Warren\u2019s remarks accusing him of employing \u201cRepublican talking points\u201d against Medicare for All suggested a more damning analysis. \u201cThese kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics,\u201d the former vice president wrote, before describing Warren\u2019s \u201capproach to politics\u201d as \u201ccondescending\u201d and elitist. Joe Biden sharpens his attacks on Elizabeth Warren The word that jumped off the screen to many Democrats \u2013 and a lot of women: \u201cangry.\u201d Almost immediately, a series of writers and pundits zeroed in on and denounced the phrasing as sexist \u2013 which, to many observers of her campaign, seemed odd, if not plainly misleading. \u201cThis is not an endorsement of Elizabeth Warren the candidate, but an affirmation of who I know her to be. Anyone falsely casting her as angry & antagonistic is telegraphing the limits of their minds, & the magnitude of their insecurities,\u201d wrote journalist Connie Schultz, who is the wife of Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Friday, after Warren\u2019s email landed, Biden denied that he had characterized his rival for the nomination as angry because of her gender. \u201cThe strong women in my life are angry \u2013 they get angry about things. That has nothing to do with it,\u201d he said. Criticizing her in terms used to denigrate women, Biden added, was \u201cnot anything that I did or was intended to do.\u201d \u201cIt had nothing to do with that,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cIt had to do with the fact that it started off and she said, you know, Biden is running in the wrong primary because I disagreed, disagree with her Medicare for All proposal.\u201d The Biden campaign\u2019s view \u2013 and those of his close allies, men and women \u2013 is that Warren threw the first punch, during the health care dust-up, and he is merely answering her remarks. Warren\u2019s initial comment about running in the \u201cwrong presidential primary\u201d was \u201cabsurd, because Joe Biden has served this country honorably \u2013 he\u2019s been a Democrat his entire life,\u201d said senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders, baking in an implicit jab at Warren\u2019s decision, in 1996, to switch her registration from Republican to Democrat. \u201cThis has been and is about health care, and we want to be able to have a high-level policy conversation,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd as Democrats, we should be able to disagree without asserting that someone doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about or should be kicked out of the party or is corrupt.\u201d The Warren campaign, which has made it a practice from the starting line not to swat at every provocation, opted against putting out a direct reply to Biden\u2019s initial criticism. Instead, her team amplified some of the ambient online criticism and appeared poised, at least until Friday afternoon, to leave it at that. Despite the more forward wording, Warren\u2019s email offered a different flavor of the same message she regularly delivers to supporters on the campaign trail. Lines in the email detailing her anger \u201con behalf of everyone who is hurt by Trump\u2019s government, our rigged economy, and business as usual,\u201d were nearly indistinguishable from her stump speech. Her frustration, Warren has said throughout the campaign, does not hold some distorting grip on her politics. \u201cI don\u2019t propose a wealth tax because I\u2019m cranky,\u201d she said during a rally in Seattle this summer, a line she often repeats now on the stump, sometimes smiling broadly for effect. \u201cI don\u2019t propose it because I\u2019m mad at anybody.\u201d This is the narrow line Warren has been made to walk throughout the campaign. Polling over the course of the past 10 months suggests she has successfully charted the path. Warren tops a number of early-state polls and is regularly found to be among the leaders when voters are asked to name their second-choice candidates. Still, the prospect of a Warren presidency has provoked anxiety and attacks from those opposed to her politics, and, quite literally, brought at least one grown man to the brink of tears. \u201cI don\u2019t need Elizabeth Warren, or the government, giving away my money,\u201d billionaire former hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman told CNBC earlier this week, his eyes watering, when the conversation turned to Warren\u2019s signature wealth tax. Cooperman is one in a growing crowd of powerful men \u2013 including some campaign rivals \u2013 to paint Warren, who has campaigned on a populist promise to tax the rich in order to fund an ambitious suite of social programs, as angry or vindictive. Asked this week if he would ever discuss tax policy with Warren, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure how open-minded she is \u2026 or that she\u2019d even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.\u201d Before he bowed out of the race, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas suggested that Warren \u201cis more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other\u201d than \u201clifting people up.\u201d A source close to Biden\u2019s campaign described the new tone of attacks on Warren coming from him and his team as intentional in a different way: to communicate the message that \u201cWarren is a smarty britches who thinks if you don\u2019t agree with her, you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Faced with accusations, amplified on social media by Warren\u2019s campaign during the week, over what some saw as sexist attacks, Biden\u2019s campaign also pointed to examples of him using the same words and phrases to criticize men \u2013 including the time he called John McCain an \u201cangry man\u201d and \u201ca little more angry than he usually is\u201d in 2008, before labeling Mitt Romney an \u201celitist\u201d in 2012. Carol Moseley Braun, a Biden-supporting former senator from Illinois, said she\u2019s known the former vice president since the 1990s and has seen \u201cnothing, zero, zippo, to suggest this man has got a sexist bone in his body. I just haven\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much gendered criticism as it is a stupid argument, and you can quote me on that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a silly argument, as far as I\u2019m concerned. The fact is that Sen. Warren is entitled to her position, VP Biden is entitled to his position and they\u2019re not going to be the same position \u2013 they\u2019re different candidates.\u201d She also alluded to Biden\u2019s implicit digs at Warren for being a registered Republican until the 1990s. \u201cTo have somebody that just came around beating up on (Biden), to me, is just insulting,\u201d she said. Biden\u2019s campaign also needled the Warren campaign for its response to his comments \u2013 which during the week largely came through retweeting women and progressive activists who were critical. \u201cDonald Trump has already tried to extort a foreign country into intervening in this election, and we fought back. In his attempts to get reelected, no dirty trick will be off limits and no stone left unturned,\u201d said spokesman Andrew Bates. \u201cAnyone who thinks they will be able to simply subtweet their way to victory against Donald Trump is flat-out wrong.\u201d CNN\u2019s MJ Lee contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg released a plan Saturday morning aimed at \u201csystematically dismantling institutions that discriminate against people with disabilities,\u201d ahead of a presidential candidate forum on accessibility, inclusion and outreach in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cDignity, Access, and Belonging: A New Era of Inclusion for People with Disabilities\u201d plan, obtained by CNN on Thursday, urges Congress to end the \u201cshameful\u201d subminimum wage for Americans with disabilities \u2013 a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act that authorizes employers to pay employees with disabilities a wage below the federal minimum wage. It also aims to double work force participation for people with disabilities by 2030, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. On education, Buttigieg\u2019s plan would expand opportunities for students with disabilities to join general education classrooms, placing 85% of students with disabilities in general election classrooms for 80% or more of the day. In addition, the presidential hopeful is promising to end corporal punishment, restraint, and seclusion as disciplinary tactics in schools, which the campaign says disproportionately effects students with disabilities. The Buttigieg campaign, which consulted on the plan with the University of New Hampshire Institute on Disability and with the Center for Accessible Technology at Berkeley, also calls for expanding access to mental health care and primary care, tying it to their \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan released earlier this year. The plan would also expand accessibility at voting locations \u2013 ensuring the voting process can accommodate those with disabilities, institute protections to ensure parents with disabilities wouldn\u2019t lose custody or adoption rights based on their disability, and restructure housing and natural disaster protocol to \u201chelp ensure that people with disabilities participate in disaster preparedness efforts and, after a disaster, can return to their homes and communities.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As Ady Barkan has struggled with the deterioration of his body as a result of ALS, the activist has pulled off a feat that would be remarkable even for the most agile of health care advocates. This year, month after month, he has drawn most of the major presidential candidates to his doorstep and championed \u201cMedicare for All\u201d while forcing the presidential contenders to think through the impact of their health care agendas in the most personal terms. He brought California Sen. Kamala Harris to tears recalling the day her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren used Barkan\u2019s case to punctuate the failures of the healthcare system during a July presidential debate: \u201cAdy has health insurance, good health insurance, and it\u2019s not nearly enough,\u201d she said. Barkan and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the author of the Medicare for All legislation, discussed their legacies during their conversation, which was posted online in early September. \u201cIn terms of your legacy, Ady,\u201d Sanders told Barkan, \u201cI think it will be very clear that even with the terrible illness that you\u2019re struggling with right now, that you didn\u2019t give up, that you understood that \u2013 especially given your illness \u2013 that you could play a significant in rallying the American people toward a sane and humane health care system.\u201d In the latest interview released Thursday with Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana Mayor told Barkan that it was the first time he\u2019d been around breathing equipment since the death of his father, who had cancer, in January. \u201cWe sat down with a social worker who basically explained to us at the hospital that in terms of long term care our best option was probably for our family to spend down everything that we had until we were asset-poor enough to qualify for Medicaid,\u201d Buttigieg told Barkan, according to the transcript shared with CNN. \u201cI remember just thinking, is that how this works in America?\u201d The two debated their differing views on Medicare for All, and Barkan told Buttigieg he appreciated that the mayor was \u201cwilling to have the tough conversations even when someone doesn\u2019t agree with you.\u201d In their exchange, Barkan called out former Vice President Joe Biden, who Barkan says is the only top-tier presidential candidate who has not responded to his invitation to meet. On September 18, he issued a searing plea to Biden, noting that Biden has his own heartbreaking struggles involving the healthcare system (most recently with the death of his son Beau in 2015 from a brain tumor). \u201cMr. Vice President you know about illness. You know about doctors and hospitals. You know that health care is personal. \u2026  You won\u2019t come talk to me about it?\u201d Barkan said in video missive to Biden the day before undergoing surgery for a tracheostomy to help him breathe. \u201cLook a dying man in the eyes and tell me how we fix this country.\u201d In an interview with CNN this month, Barkan described ALS as \u201cthe story of things becoming impossible\u201d \u2013 from a simple stroll around the neighborhood to his ability to tickle his 3-year-old son Carl. ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, ultimately depriving the brain of its ability to initiate and control muscle movement, including the loss of speech. (Barkan now speaks through a computer). \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting and overwhelming,\u201d Barkan told CNN. \u201cFor me, ALS has been a lesson in exactly how broken our health care system is and why it\u2019s so important to fix it.\u201d Barkan, a life-long advocate on economic justice issues who was diagnosed with ALS in October 2016, has imparted those lessons not only with high-profile testimony in Washington, but also in these intimate one-on-one conversations with candidates. He and his crew film publish the interviews as part of the work of their PAC, the Be A Hero fund, which attempts to hold politicians accountable on health care and other issues by using the stories of average Americans as their persuasion tool. Barkan realized the power of his exchanges with politicians when he met former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake by chance in December 2017 on an airplane. Overwhelmed by his mounting medical bills, Barkan urged Flake not to support the GOP tax bill, which he believed would disrupt his health care coverage. \u201cYou can save my life,\u201d Barkan told Flake in an exchange captured by a fellow passenger. \u201cPlease remember this conversation.\u201d Flake did end up voting for the tax bill \u2013 in contradiction to Barkan\u2019s request \u2013 but that exchange vaulted Barkan into the national spotlight. As Barkan has explained to the current crop of presidential candidates, his insurance company tried to deny coverage for a breathing assistance machine that he needed to live. He said he, his wife Rachael, an assistant and a lawyer spent \u201cendless time on the phone trying to get our insurance company to behave properly, lawfully. Beyond that, his family is billed $20,000 a month out of pocket for the 24-hour home care that he needs. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have wealthy supporters cover the cost for us, but that\u2019s not an option for a lot of people \u2013 most just go bankrupt,\u201d he told CNN, which provided questions to Barkan ahead of time to give him enough time to write out answers. \u201cNinety percent of Americans with ALS choose not to go on a ventilator because it requires 24-hour care, which most insurance plans don\u2019t cover. In Japan, where long-term care is guaranteed, the numbers are reversed. That just isn\u2019t right, and it doesn\u2019t need to be this way.\u201d That view has fueled Barkan\u2019s advocacy for Medicare for All, the signature health care proposal from Sanders: \u201cI\u2019ve come to believe that fundamentally we need radical, disruptive change to the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only plan I\u2019ve seen that aims for that level of ambition is Medicare for All.\u201d He believes that any plan that stops short of the promise of Medicare for All \u2013 the kinds of plans that have been proposed by Buttigieg, Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for example \u2014 \u201cwon\u2019t deliver the universal coverage or the cost savings that we need.\u201d Barkan, who gets around in a wheelchair, speaks through a vocalizer and takes his meals through a feeding tube in his stomach, has still managed to make his sense of urgency felt through in-depth conversations with Buttigieg, Sanders, Harris, Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama. He says Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and businessman Asndrew Yang have also agreed to meet with him. The Be A Hero PAC has started a petition calling on Biden to meet with Barkan. Biden\u2019s team did not respond to CNN\u2019s query about why the former vice president has not responded to Barkan\u2019s invitation. But Barkan isn\u2019t giving up on his hope for a one-on-one with one of the 2020 race\u2019s front-runners. It\u2019s a persistence that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez notes in the prologue she wrote for his new memoir, \u201cEyes to the Wind.\u201d Even through his vocalizer, Barkan\u2019s testimony to Congress \u201cforced an urgency and moral clarity that members could not look away from or ignore,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote. \u201cI saw their discomfort at issuing the usual excuses, and Ady also would not tolerate them\u2014even with many physical capabilities gone,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote. The New York Democrat first met Barkan when he stopped by a labor town hall that she was holding at a church in the Bronx after winning her primary election last year. He could still speak at that point and she held the microphone for him as he addressed the crowd. They met again this year, at her congressional office after the his testimony to Congress. Barkan acknowledges that part of the power of his advocacy is that he is dying from ALS, a fact he points out in his Twitter profile. He told CNN he is \u201ctrying to use the time I have left here to make things better for as long as I still can.\u201d \u201cIf I could be healthy and completely anonymous, I would do it in a heartbeat,\u201d he said. But because of his illness, his activism with Be a Hero and the Center for Popular Democracy have drawn national notice. His team went on to travel the country making health-care ads that he said were among the top-performing spots of 2018. \u201cWe built a platform that made it hard for candidates to ignore us,\u201d Barkan said. \u201cThere are millions of folks who the candidates should sit down with. I\u2019m just hoping I can be a voice for them and force candidates to answer questions that really matter to people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Months after President Donald Trump declared the GOP would become the \u201cparty of health care,\u201d House conservatives are set to announce a sweeping health care proposal \u2013 one that has virtually no chance of becoming law. The Republican Study Committee on Tuesday unveiled what members described as a \u201cframework,\u201d nine months in the making, even as the White House continues to develop its own set of principles behind closed doors. It includes no legislative text and does not have the formal backing of the White House or broader GOP conference. The conservatives behind it hope the plan could help inoculate Republican congressional candidates against the perception that Republicans have no ideas for fixing a system they\u2019ve vowed to destroy. But the proposal comes as the attention of Washington is focused squarely on the mushrooming impeachment scandal engulfing Trump\u2019s presidency. And it recycles some of the policies that Republicans tried and failed to advance during the 2017 health care debate, when they controlled both chambers of Congress. That raises questions about how they plan to get a different result a second time around. The conservative caucus says its plan, titled \u201cA Framework for Affordable, Personalized Care,\u201d will protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, a top priority for many Americans. The concern that Republicans would weaken the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections helped doom the GOP plan to repeal and replace the law in 2017 and was one reason Democrats, many of whom ran campaigns focused on health care, recaptured the House in the 2018 midterm elections. The plan contains several elements that were in those 2017 replacement proposals, which narrowly fell short of enough Republican support to pass the Senate at the time. It would create federally-funded, state-run insurance pools to cover people with high-cost illness. For instance, states could establish high-risk pools, which existed before the Affordable Care Act with mixed levels of success, or institute reinsurance programs to stabilize the health care market. And it pushes another favorite Republican measure: combining federal funding now used for Obamacare premium subsidies and Medicare expansion into block grants given to states to help low-income Americans pay for their health care. Several GOP proposals in 2017 also contained block grants, but those raised concerns because Congressional Budget Office analyses found that it would lead many people to lose their coverage over time. A senior Democratic aide said the Republican Study Committee\u2019s proposal is unlikely to advance in the legislative process, slamming the proposal as a threat to Americans\u2019 health care. \u201cIt\u2019s even worse than what passed out of the Republican House last Congress,\u201d the aide said. \u201cThe whole notion of that sort of block granting idea just rips out even more of the protections.\u201d The RSC plan also calls for extending legislation that provided protections to Americans with job-based insurance to people in the individual market. That law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA, limits insurers\u2019 ability to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions who are starting a new job, switching jobs or moving from a worked-based plan into the individual market. The proposal would curb insurers\u2019 ability to deny policies to those shifting plans on in the individual market, as long as they were continuously covered. The committee would also boost health savings accounts, which allow Americans to sock away money tax-free for health-related expenses. This is another favored mechanism among Republicans, but critics have said it does little to help those who don\u2019t have funds to set aside for health care bills. House Republicans are rolling out their complex plan as Trump struggles to articulate broad ideas for the nation\u2019s health care, and as Democrats campaign across the country on an easy-to-explain vision for extending coverage to everyone. Rep. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, and Rep. Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, the chairman of the RSC, said Monday that they had spoken to White House policy directors and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney over the weekend as they prepared to publish their lengthy health care report this week, but they noted the White House is continuing work on another parallel plan. That plan \u2013 so far a patchwork quilt of health care proposals that Trump\u2019s team hopes will stack up to a comprehensive vision \u2013 will serve as the White House\u2019s answer to the growing support on the left for the kind of universal health care system that Republicans have spent years warning against. \u201cThe White House welcomes the RSC announcement and their contributions to improving our healthcare system,\u201d Judd Deere, White House spokesman, told CNN. \u201cThe Trump Administration continues to work to improve healthcare more broadly, which includes creating a system that protects the vulnerable and those with pre-existing conditions and delivers the affordability Americans needs, the choice and control they want, and the quality they deserve.\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, both said they haven\u2019t discussed the congressional proposal with the RSC. Both Azar and Verma are deeply involved in helping the White House craft its forthcoming set of health care principles. The House GOP plan comes against the backdrop of a court case that has the potential to upend the nation\u2019s health insurance system and the 2020 election campaign. Federal appellate court judges in Louisiana are now considering a case brought by a coalition of Republican-led states, and backed by the Trump administration, that argue Obamacare as a whole is unconstitutional because Congress essentially eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance, the so-called individual mandate. A US District Court judge in Texas in December sided with the Republican states. The Trump administration has chosen not to defend the law, leaving many Republicans concerned that they will not have a replacement ready if the appellate court upholds the lower court\u2019s ruling. Democrats are already attacking Trump and the GOP for threatening the coverage of millions of Americans, and if the court invalidates the ACA, Republicans could be left with the blame for dismantling the country\u2019s health care system without preparing a realistic replacement. \u201cWe may have the only ideas on the table to fill that void,\u201d Johnson said, explaining the rush among RSC members to move ahead with the outline of a plan now, a year out from the 2020 election. The court case could be decided before the end of the year. Regardless of what happens at the appellate level, though, the law\u2019s ultimate fate likely rests with the Supreme Court, and that process could stretch well into next year \u2013 setting up the possibility that the White House could secure the verdict on Obamacare it has always sought, and yet risk alienating millions of Americans heading into a contentious election by creating uncertainty around access to medical care. Marshall, the chair of the RSC health care task force, said he still believes health care will be the \u201cdefining issue\u201d of the 2020 election. \u201cDo you want a president who wants to have the government take over your health care, or do you want personal choices?\u201d Marshall said Monday. \u201cSo even though there\u2019s impeachment and all those other things going on here, I think this \u2013 healthcare \u2013 is the issue of 2020.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Welcome to CNN\u2019s fact check of the fourth Democratic presidential primary debate. We will be posting our checks of candidates\u2019 claims as we complete them through the night. This debate in Ohio hosted by CNN and The New York Times features a record 12 candidates who met polling and fundraising thresholds set by the Democratic National Committee. It is the first time the Democratic presidential hopefuls are on the debate stage since the House of Representatives launched a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The President, and his attacks against former Vice President Joe Biden, have come up in tonight\u2019s debate. The three previous debates (fact checks here, here and here) have focused on the candidates\u2019 policies and past records. Along with Biden, tonight\u2019s debate features: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, businessman Andrew Yang, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, billionaire Tom Steyer and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Asked about his son\u2019s international business dealings, former Vice President Joe Biden said, \u201cI never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have.\u201d Facts First: Hunter Biden has indicated otherwise. In both an interview on ABC that aired today and a New Yorker article from July, he said that he had spoken briefly with his father about his involvement with Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings. According to the New Yorker, \u201cAs Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: \u201cDad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do.\u2019\u201d However, the New Yorker article did not make clear whether Hunter Biden said there were any more details as part of the father-son exchange. In the ABC interview, Hunter Biden initially minimized the exchange saying \u201cit wasn\u2019t a discussion in any way,\u201d before acknowledging the New Yorker\u2019s characterization was accurate. After publication, in a statement to CNN, Biden\u2019s campaign argued that the exchange did not amount to a conversation about Ukraine. \u201c\u2018I hope you know what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 and \u2018I do,\u2019 is not a conversation. That\u2019s a failed \u2018gotcha\u2019 \u2013 and if that\u2019s the best the most dishonest president in American history can do, it\u2019s even more clear why Joe Biden\u2019s annihilated him in over 70 polls,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesperson. \u2013 Tara Subramaniam Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed that President Donald Trump has \u201con three occasions, three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections.\u201d Facts First: This claim is true. Trump has publicly invited Russia, China and Ukraine to interfere in US elections. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump infamously suggested Russia find emails belonging to his opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, from her time as secretary of state that were wiped from the private server where she kept them. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let\u2019s see if that happens. That\u2019ll be next,\u201d he said during a press conference in Florida. Trump then asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden, a potential political rival in the 2020 election, during a phone call on July 25, 2019. Trump has insisted the call was \u201cperfect\u201d but that conversation is the focus of a whistleblower complaint at the center of Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe. In October 2019, Trump suggested \u2014 without prompting \u2014 that China should also investigate Biden and his son. \u2013 Zachary Cohen South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg argued for expanding the Affordable Care Act rather than moving to Medicare for All, the government-backed health care program supported by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years,\u201d Buttigieg said. A moment later, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar made a similar point, arguing that extending Obamacare was \u201cwhat we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in four years.\u201d Facts First: The figures cited by both Buttigieg and Klobuchar are close to the latest number provided by one study. Some 153 million people are covered by private plans sponsored by their employers, according to the latest Kaiser Family Foundation report. There are also tens of millions more who are covered by private plans through Medicare Advantage, Medicaid managed care plans and on the Obamacare individual market. All these people would have to change their health care under Medicare for All \u2013 but they would be covered by the federal plan instead. \u2013 Tami Luhby Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro claimed that a trio of states \u2013 Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 have lost jobs of late, and businessman Andrew Yang claimed that Ohio in particular has lost a large number of manufacturing jobs over time. Castro claimed that the latest jobs report shows Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania losing jobs, while Yang claimed that President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 \u201cbecause we got rid 300,000 manufacturing jobs manufacturing jobs in your towns.\u201d Facts First: Castro is incorrect, while Yang\u2019s claim, taken on a long enough timeline, is accurate. It\u2019s not true that Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania lost jobs in the most recent available jobs data, as Castro claimed. Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania all added jobs in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. State-by-state data for September is not available yet. As for Yang\u2019s claims that Ohio lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs before the 2016 election, while Ohio has gained manufacturing jobs during the Trump presidency, the state did lose more than 300,000 manufacturing jobs over the 15 years prior to November 2016. There were 987,100 manufacturing employees in Ohio in February 2001. The month of Trump\u2019s election in November 2016, there were 686,300 \u2013 a loss of roughly 300,000 manufacturing jobs. As of August 2019, there were just over 700,000 manufacturing jobs in Ohio. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, total employment in Ohio\u2019s factories has actually risen nearly every year between 2010 and 2018, and reached its most recent peak in June 2019. Castro also falsely claimed that Ohio has been losing jobs under Trump. The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 nonfarm payroll data shows that jobs rose steadily since January 2017, peaking two years later in January 2019. Since then, new jobs added have fallen slightly. \u2013 Anneken Tappe Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has proposed a vast expansion of the social safety net, outlined her plan to pay for her proposals with new taxes on personal assets \u2013 drawing a sharp retort from businessman Andrew Yang, who claimed that many countries that have tried to impose wealth taxes eventually removed them. \u201cA wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThe problem is it\u2019s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue projected.\u201d Facts First: Yang is correct that these four countries tried and eventually repealed wealth taxes. In 1990, 12 developed countries \u2013 including Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden \u2013 in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had net wealth taxes. But by 2017, only four countries levied such a tax, according to a 2018 OECD report. Since then, France repealed its tax, leaving only Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Countries generally justified repealing these taxes because of concerns over their efficiency and over administering them, as well as \u201cby the observation that net wealth taxes have frequently failed to meet their redistributive goals,\u201d according to the OECD. The revenue collected from them have been \u201cvery low,\u201d with only a few exceptions. \u2013 Tami Luhby and Holmes Lybrand Amid a heated exchange between former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, over gun policy, O\u2019Rourke said that 40,000 Americans die annually due to gun violence. O\u2019Rourke cited that statistic as he sought to defend his proposal for a mandatory buyback program for AK-47s and AR-15s. Facts First: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s is accurate but this statistic requires key context in order to understand the full picture. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 39,773 people died from gun-related injuries in 2017 \u2013 the most recent year for which data is available \u2013 most of those deaths are suicides. Roughly six in 10 gun deaths in 2017 were suicides, and less than four in 10 gun deaths involved homicides. The number of gun deaths that year reached the highest level since at least 1979, when record-keeping on firearm mortalities began. The kinds of firearms O\u2019Rourke has zeroed in on, semi-automatic rifles, have been utilized by mass shooters. However they\u2019re not used in the majority of murders. The vast majority of murders are committed with handguns, according to the FBI, and a relatively small number are committed with rifles \u2013 the type of guns O\u2019Rourke would target with his mandatory buyback program. In 2017, handguns were involved in 7,032 murders and rifles were used in 403 murders. \u2013 Sarah Westwood Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders claimed that six US banks \u201chave assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States,\u201d while giving examples of \u201cthe grotesque level of income and wealth inequality\u201d in the country. Fact First: This is correct. America\u2019s GDP totaled $20.5 trillion in 2018. The largest banks by assets in the United States are JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Together, their total assets amount to $10.6 trillion dollars in 2018, according to ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u2013 Anneken Tappe California Sen. Kamala Harris resurfaced a previous claim that the eight biggest pharmaceutical and insurance companies alone made $72 billion in profits last year while Americans continue to suffer under the opioid crisis. \u201cThe eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic,\u201d said Harris. \u201cAnd they knew what they were doing.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time that Harris has made the argument. She lodged the complaint back in July while criticizing former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s health care plan. Facts First: While it was not clear which companies are part of Harris\u2019 tally, she\u2019s likely in the ballpark, at least according to profit data available for US drug companies as well as numbers on health insurance company profits from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. However, some context is needed as these profits aren\u2019t derived solely from opioids or from the US market alone. Ten of the largest US-based drug companies made $69 billion in profits last year. The health insurance industry made a total of $23 billion. The profits of the top US drug companies were as follows: Johnson & Johnson ($15.3 billion), Pfizer ($11.2 billion), Amgen ($8.4 billion), Merck ($6.2 billion), AbbVie ($5.7 billion), Gilead ($5.5 billion), Bristol-Myers Squibb ($5 billion), Biogen ($4.4 billion), Celgene ($4 billion), Eli Lilly ($3.2 billion). Not all of these profits came from the companies\u2019 operations in the United States. A report from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said the health insurance industry generated net earnings of $23.4 billion in 2018. \u2013 Donna Borak and Daniel Dale Several of the Democrats debating Tuesday night made shocking claims about the opioid epidemic in the US. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar cited an employee of a pharmaceutical company comparing addictive pills to Doritos. Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang asserted that at one point there were more prescriptions in the state of Ohio than people. And hedge fund founder Tom Steyer said that 72,000 Americans died from an opioid overdose last year. Facts First: The devastation wrought by the drugs in communities across the country needs no exaggeration, and Klobuchar and Yang gave straight facts. But Steyer\u2019s number is wrong. Steyer appears to have conflated the number of overdoses overall with opioid deaths. According to the latest Centers for Disease Control data, in 2017 (the latest year for which data is available), 70,000 people died after overdosing on drugs, including substances like meth, which is not considered an opioid. 47,600, or just over two-thirds of the total 2017 overdose deaths, were due to opioids, per the CDC. Yang\u2019s claim is backed up by data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In 2010 there were 102.4 opioid prescriptions per 100 persons in Ohio. That figure dropped in the latest count \u2014 to 63.5 opioid prescriptions for every 100 persons in 2017. Klobuchar\u2019s reference comes from an internal email sent by an employee of pharmaceutical giant Mallinckrodt, released this year as part of litigation in Ohio. (Klobuchar called the person a pharmaceutical executive, but CNN reporting is that the person was a sales representative.) \u201cJust like Doritos keep eating. We\u2019ll make more,\u201d the employee wrote, referring to shipments of oxycodone. \u2013 David Shortell Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who called for legislation codifying the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, referred to a recent Alabama law that she said called for jailing doctors who perform abortions. \u201cWhat if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? I said, you said you wanted to do this in your race for president. You actually said that you wanted to put women in jail,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThen you tried to dial it back, and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail. That is exactly what the Alabama law is. It put doctors in jail for 99 years.\u201d Facts First: Alabama\u2019s near-total ban on abortion would jail doctors who perform some abortions for up to 99 years. Alabama\u2019s near-total ban \u2013 the most restrictive abortion law in the country \u2013 would punish doctors who perform the procedure with up to 99 years in prison and does not include exceptions for cases of rape and incest. The law does contain an exception for abortions that prevent a \u201cserious health risk\u201d to the mother of if the \u201cunborn child has a lethal anomaly.\u201d Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bill into law in May, and a challenge to the law is currently pending before a federal judge. The law is slated to take effect in November. \u2013 Caroline Kelly Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg clashed over the issue of US military involvement in Syria, engaging in an electric debate that centered around why the American forces are there. President Donald Trump announced this month he is withdrawing 1,000 US troops from Syria, a move that has prompted bipartisan criticism from lawmakers who say the US is abandoning its Kurdish allies who fought tirelessly against ISIS. Gabbard repeatedly called for an end to the \u201cregime change war\u201d in Syria and claimed US policy was helping terrorist groups in the country, like Al Qaeda. Buttigieg defended America\u2019s role in the conflict, arguing that the small number of US forces there were all that stood between \u201cthe beginning of a genocide and reemergence of ISIS.\u201d Facts First: The story of American involvement in the Syrian civil war is complicated and difficult to assess. The US military intervention in Syria has been debated since it began \u2013 but Gabbard\u2019s claim that American forces were engaged in a \u201cregime-change war\u201d cuts against what US officials have said about American policy in Syria. Some US-backed militias have fought the Syrian government, but US troops were there to help defeat ISIS. While Syrian opposition groups fighting against the regime wanted to end Assad\u2019s government, US policy has never explicitly centered around overthrowing Assad\u2019s regime, even as the Obama and Trump administrations both increased support for various rebel groups and conducted limited strikes against government targets in response to its use of chemical weapons. In fact, then-President Barack Obama was criticized by Republicans for not doing more to topple Assad. Obama called for Assad to leave power, but did little on the battlefield to make that happen. Despite Gabbard\u2019s claim that keeping a small number of US troops in Syria would \u201ccontinue this regime change war,\u201d there is no evidence to suggest that American forces were engaged in an effort to overthrow Assad. Syria\u2019s devastating, years-long war recently moved into a new phase which could be described as one of consolidation. With the help of Russia and Iran, the Syrian military managed to all but defeat the rebel insurgency looking to unseat Bashar al-Assad. At the same time, the US-led coalition with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces \u2013 and to an extent Russian and Iranian forces \u2013 drove ISIS to the brink of destruction, at least territorially. ISIS holds virtually no more territory. However, the US warns there are still tens of thousands of ISIS fighters hiding in both Iraq and Syria. \u2013 Zachary Cohen Weighing in on President Donald Trump\u2019s recent decision to withdraw troops from the Middle East, Biden appeared to misspeak, confusing one country for another. Biden said, \u201cI would not have withdrawn the troops and would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops in Iraq which are in retreat now being fired on by Assad\u2019s people.\u201d Facts First: Trump ordered US troops withdrawn from northern Syria, not Iraq. According to the Pentagon, days later the remaining US forces in Syria came under fire from Turkish positions, not forces aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. While the Pentagon confirmed the attack, the Turkish Defense Ministry claimed its soldiers did not fire on US troops but were aiming for Kurdish fighters whom Turkey considers terrorists. There is no evidence Syrian troops have fired upon US troops or the Kurds. However, a senior Trump administration official told The Washington Post that the actions of Syrian militia allied with Turkey are putting American forces in danger even as they continue to withdraw. \u2013 Tara Subramaniam This story is breaking and will be updated.",

            "article_content": "As a dozen Democratic presidential candidates descend on Ohio for their debate on Tuesday, a larger political question looms: Is Ohio still a winnable swing state worth fighting for in the general election? Donald Trump carried the state by 8 percentage points in 2016, a Republican victory so resounding that some Democrats were left wondering whether Ohio had lost its storied role as a pivotal battleground. Yet the prospect of abandoning Ohio, which Barack Obama won twice, is deeply offensive and wrong-headed to party leaders here. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a mistake to write it off,\u201d Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s always gone with the winner and it will again next year.\u201d The last Democrat to win the presidency without capturing Ohio is John F. Kennedy. But in the intervening 60 years, every Democrat who made it to the White House has carried Ohio, a trend that Brown believes will almost certainly continue. Interviews with more than two dozen party leaders, strategists and Democratic voters here suggest the true answer to whether Ohio remains a competitive battleground revolves largely around who wins the primary battle. It\u2019s less a question of the candidate moving in a progressive or moderate direction, party leaders say, but rather of policies that may be portrayed as unrealistic or extreme. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible mistake if the Democratic nominee would publicly support \u2018Medicare for All,\u2019 \u201d said Brown, an unabashed progressive who believes such a policy could scare voters and unwittingly give Trump a political advantage on health care. He urged candidates to focus on improving the Affordable Care Act, while protecting pre-existing conditions. David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, takes pains to not take sides in the 2020 primary. But he joins Brown in arguing that Medicare for All \u2013 and ultimately abolishing private health insurance plans \u2013 could turn off many voters here. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be told they\u2019re going to lose their health care or their health care plan,\u201d Pepper told CNN. \u201cWhoever the candidate is, there are ways to broaden health care without having people feel like their own health care situation will be thrown upside down.\u201d That tension will be front-and-center Tuesday night at Otterbein University as 12 Democratic candidates take the debate stage. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are among those who have championed Medicare for All, while former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and others have questioned the disruption such a sweeping policy would pose. It\u2019s one of the biggest differences among the Democratic rivals. The outcome of the policy fight could play a large role in determining who becomes the party\u2019s nominee. In 2020, winning Ohio will be no small task for Democrats. While Obama carried the state in 2008 and 2012, Trump\u2019s 8-point victory over Hillary Clinton showed how deeply red Ohio can be. But the suburbs are changing. Here in Westerville, just outside Columbus, Republican support has fallen off. In 2012, Mitt Romney beat Obama 53% to 45%. Four years later, Clinton won 50% to 45%, despite losing the state overall. \u201cThis new block of voters in the suburbs we have to work hard to keep. We shouldn\u2019t take for granted that they\u2019re just going to vote for us,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cBut Ohio can be the state that ends the Trump presidency.\u201d Jane Timken, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, said she believes Trump is in a strong position as he stands for reelection. The President has visited the state multiple times, is building a large campaign operation here and is investing heavily in branding Democratic candidates as too radical for Ohio. \u201cThose messages don\u2019t really resonate in Ohio, and I don\u2019t think suburban voters are going to buy it,\u201d Timken told CNN. Yet that remains an open question, which is impossible to answer with any certainty one year before Election Day. One of the biggest things that has changed from the last campaign: the Trump presidency is now motivating Democrats in a way that it did not four years ago. Nan Whaley, the Democratic mayor of Dayton, said voters should hold Trump accountable for his trade policy, promises to restore manufacturing jobs and for failing to swiftly take action on guns, a key issue after an August mass shooting killed nine people and injured 27 in her city. \u201cWhy would you abdicate Ohio so quickly to Donald Trump?\u201d Whaley told CNN. \u201cWe really need to pay attention to the messaging around suburban voters \u2013 particularly women,\u201d she added. \u201cHillary\u2019s loss awakened a group of people that were not interested or willing to do the work of politics who are now completely fixated because they know what\u2019s at stake in 2020.\u201d Whaley is talking about women like Stephanie Pyser, Tiffanie Roberts and Lisa Ludwig, who were awakened by Trump\u2019s victory and have become increasingly angered by his presidency. A few weeks after the 2016 election, they decided to form a group they call \u2018Positively Blue.\u2019 They\u2019ve been organizing like-minded voters ever since from their kitchens and front porches in Dublin, Ohio, a suburban community just outside Columbus. \u201cThis neighborhood tends to be a little bit more Republican, so I wouldn\u2019t have brought up politics too much at social settings,\u201d Pyser said. \u201cThat was one of the reasons we started Positively Blue because we didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to.\u201d They\u2019re motivated by a sense of obligation \u2013 and perhaps lingering feelings of guilt \u2013 for not being more active in the last presidential race. \u201cI wish I would have been more involved prior to the 2016 election. Truthfully, I didn\u2019t think that that would be the outcome,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cI like to think I\u2019m pretty in tune, but I never saw it coming.\u201d Now, their group has 310 members. They\u2019ve been working to elect local candidates, but soon will turn their attention to the presidential race. \u201cGoing into 2020, we\u2019re full steam ahead,\u201d Pyser said. \u201cThat\u2019s when our members really step up and want to get more involved in canvassing, fundraising and all the many things that we get to do. We\u2019ll be ready.\u201d Katie Paris said she hears similar sentiments across Ohio. From her home in the Cleveland suburbs, she started a group called Red Wine and Blue to bring together women from all corners of the state and help them become politically active. \u201cLittle did I know I would find this everywhere across Ohio,\u201d Paris said. \u201cWomen are taking action and they\u2019re talking to their friends and that\u2019s how change happens.\u201d Paris, a Democratic consultant who spent years in Washington, moved to her husband\u2019s native Ohio in 2012 and is helping organize suburban women in advance of the 2020 election. She dismisses questions of whether Ohio is still a pivotal swing state, pointing to a handful of key suburban legislative races Democrats won in 2018. She said groups like Priorities USA, one of the largest Democratic super PACs that did not include Ohio on its list of top 2020 priorities, are giving up too easily because of the 2016 defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a mistake to overlook Ohio,\u201d Paris said, standing on a front porch on a recent fall afternoon. She said her message to the Democratic nominee was simple. \u201cSpend time here,\u201d Paris said. \u201cTrump sure is. What does that tell you? If he was sure he had Ohio locked up, would he be coming here so often?\u201d Hours before the debate on Tuesday \u2013 and just miles away \u2013 the President\u2019s reelection campaign is holding a \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d event in Columbus. It\u2019s one sign, at least, that Ohio \u2013 and suburban women voters \u2013 are among the highest targets of the 2020 campaign. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify Katie Paris\u2019 move to Ohio.",

            "article_content": "Twelve Democrats will line up in swing state Ohio on Tuesday for a crucial debate in their White House battle, which will unfold as their party gears up to consider impeachment \u2013 the ultimate political sanction \u2013 against President Donald Trump. Candidates will take the most crowded debate stage in the history of US presidential primaries as their race approaches a turning point just three-and-a-half months before voters begin to weigh in. Joe Biden heads into the showdown, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, fighting a two-front battle against his rising foe Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a President who is seeking to knock out the former vice president before he has a chance to win the Democratic nomination. Biden is under pressure to deliver a crisp and aggressive performance after initially struggling to fend off Trump\u2019s claims that his son Hunter\u2019s business activity in Ukraine while he was vice president is a symptom of family corruption. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son in Ukraine. The Delaware Democrat tried to turn the issue against Trump in an aggressive new pre-debate strategy, by unveiling an anti-corruption plan that he said would ensure that \u201cno future president can ever again abuse the office for personal gain.\u201d  This will be the first Democratic debate since the party launched a bid to impeach the President over claims that he abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. The evening will allow Democrats to make their broadest case yet against Trump\u2019s suitability for a second term, given the uproar over his decision to desert America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria and withdraw US troops, triggering a humanitarian crisis. The debate is also crucial for 78-year-old Sen. Bernie Sanders to show that he is fit for the long haul and potentially to be president after a heart attack raised questions about his age. Time is running out for candidates like Sen. Kamala Harris of California, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Cory Booker of  New Jersey to prove they are a threat for the nomination. Lower-polling candidates like Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro need to make a splash to keep voters \u2013 and donors \u2013 interested as they struggle to qualify for November\u2019s debate. Businessman Tom Steyer will make the debate stage for the first time. And the showdown will give new oxygen to entrepreneur Andrew Yang, whose unorthodox campaign has turned in impressive fundraising and is outpacing several full-time politicians. Biden has been the front-runner for months, but the race is tightening as it enters a pivotal new stage, with Warren cresting in polls after an impressive summer leading the party\u2019s policy debate. Latest polling shows the senator from Massachusetts closely matched with the Delaware veteran in the national race and in three of the four early-voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Biden, with his strong edge among African American voters, has a more comfortable lead in South Carolina, although the primary there could be reshaped by what happens in the early contests. Biden heads into the debate with a pressing need to communicate to the American people that there is no evidence that his son did anything wrong, despite Trump\u2019s repeated and unfounded claims of massive corruption and his disinformation campaign. Biden\u2019s rivals have been largely supportive amid Trump\u2019s searing attacks but have not been above questioning a potential conflict of interest posed by Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business ventures at a time when his father was vice president. Hunter Biden announced on Sunday that he would swear off all jobs with foreign-owned businesses if his father wins the presidency next year, an apparent bid to defuse the issue. But Joe Biden\u2019s camp will be worried about the outcome of Hunter Biden\u2019s interview with ABC News due to drop hours before the debate, which could focus on his complicated personal and professional life. The best bet for the former vice president may be to turn the controversy \u2013 the latest holdover from his long political past to torment his campaign \u2013 into a full-frontal attack on Trump. Biden last week issued a full-throated call for Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2013 apparently deciding that his more circumspect earlier position was increasingly out of touch with polls that show more and more Americans in favor of the investigation. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me and not going to destroy my family,\u201d Biden said, addressing Trump in a possible preview of a debate line that could bolster his claim that he is the toughest Democrat who could take on the President. On the eve of the debate, however, a new Quinnipiac University poll showed that Warren is making some progress on that question of who has the best chance to bet Trump. Some 48% of voters say Biden is the best bet, but Warren has increased her support on this measure from 9% in August to 21% currently. But her new status as near co-front-runner comes with fresh pressures. In the earlier debates, other candidates have been more keen to target Biden than her. Considering she bills herself as the candidate with a plan for everything, Warren\u2019s lack of specificity on how to pay for her health care proposal is an obvious target for her rivals. Some analysts see the omission as a device to allow her to track more to the center in a general election after avoiding alienating liberal voters who want a single-payer health care system and to abolish private insurance. Addressing the health care system  \u2013 perhaps the most important issue for progressive voters \u2013 could offer an opening for Sanders, who is keen to reestablish himself as the dominant liberal in the race. He hinted at a more aggressive approach toward Warren in an interview with ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week on Sunday.\u201d \u201cThere are differences between Elizabeth and myself,\u201d he said. \u201cElizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not.\u201d If Sanders is to win the nomination he will need to check Warren\u2019s momentum, amid signs she has eclipsed him after he put issues like economic inequality, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and corporate responsibility at the top of the Democratic agenda in his 2016 presidential bid. The split between the left and centrist elements of the Democratic Party will again reveal itself if Biden seeks to check her rise. The former vice president, who says his decades in the Senate equip him to work with Republicans to get changes into law, took a veiled shot at Warren in New Hampshire last week, warning that \u201cit takes proven ability to get things done. We\u2019re not electing a planner.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s debate is not the last chance for candidates outside the top three to elbow their way into the race. But time is running out. Harris, for example, says she has \u201cvirtually moved to Iowa,\u201d staking everything on a strong showing at the caucuses that would allow her to mount a run deep into the Democratic race. Apart from a memorable debate clash with Biden over the summer, the former prosecutor has failed to live up to the high expectations for her campaign. But she said over the weekend that voters were still a long way from deciding who to support. \u201cOf course, there are a number of people who are on the stage who have been on the stage for, in some cases, decades,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd I think that speaks volumes about the fact that people are still interested in getting to know everyone before they make a decision.\u201d Buttigieg has been running a quietly impressive campaign, and bumper fundraising could set him up for a possible late surge into the caucuses. But he needs to dispel impressions that his youth \u2013 he is only 37 \u2013 means he lacks the necessary experience to be president. For several of the remaining candidates, Tuesday\u2019s debate could be their last, given tightening criteria for entries into future showdowns. Omission from November\u2019s debate could effectively choke off a candidate\u2019s visibility and fundraising and make it impossible for them to mount a realistic challenge. Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Klobuchar and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas are all on the cut line. The Democratic National Committee requires candidates to get at least 5% in at least two DNC-sanctioned early-voting state (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina) primary polls or 3% in at least four DNC-sanctioned national or early-state primary polls. Candidates can use polls released between September 13 and November 13 to make the stage. There\u2019s no better way for those candidates to engineer the big moments they need than to tangle with one of the front-runners. So that could mean several high-risk moments for Biden and Warren \u2013 even if for now, their best interests do not include taking on one another in a fight to the finish.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden has long wanted nothing more than this: a head-to-head matchup with President Donald Trump to show Democrats that he is the party\u2019s best chance of winning the White House. But as his extraordinary battle with Trump enters its third week \u2013 and the impeachment inquiry intensifies \u2013 Biden is struggling to prove that point as he searches for the proper footing to fight the President without being sullied by the fallout. He\u2019s under siege by Trump and the explosive Ukraine investigation even as he tries to regain command of the Democratic primary race. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden told donors this past weekend during a closed-door retreat in Philadelphia, a person in attendance told CNN \u2013 a message he also delivered in a speech late last week and in a Washington Post op-ed aimed squarely at Trump. \u201cYou won\u2019t destroy me and you won\u2019t destroy my family.\u201d At this critical juncture for Biden\u2019s candidacy, the official position inside the campaign is that this noisy feud with Trump elevates the former vice president\u2019s standing in the Democratic race. Yet even his most loyal supporters and longtime advisers concede they can\u2019t be certain whether that\u2019s true, given the uncertainty surrounding the politics of impeachment and his fragile position in the primary fight. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say there is no concern,\u201d a Biden confidant told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign conversations. \u201cAs this drags on, we just don\u2019t know. No one knows.\u201d For all of the planning and deliberations that went into his presidential bid, more than a dozen aides, donors and top supporters to Biden acknowledged in weekend interviews the campaign was entering almost entirely uncharted terrain as it grappled with the confluence of three distinct challenges. First, the threat Elizabeth Warren\u2019s candidacy presents to Biden is more serious than ever. Not only did she announce Friday that she had outraised him by nearly $10 million over the last three months, she also has the ability to return to those grassroots donors again and again as she works to consolidate the party\u2019s progressive wing. Biden has been far more reliant on traditional fundraising, which places him at a distinct disadvantage among his leading primary rivals. Second, the utter unpredictability of Trump and his attempts to draw Biden into the fray presents an unwieldy challenge. Biden does not want to get pulled into \u201ca mud fight,\u201d as he told donors last week in California, yet early attempts to respond to the President\u2019s bombastic claims left many senior Democrats saying Biden looked weak and imploring the campaign to ramp up its response. Third, the injection of Hunter Biden into the fray complicates an already fraught private family dynamic. Despite unfounded allegations that the former vice president intervened to help his son in Ukraine and China, the campaign has struggled to respond to almost daily taunts from Trump and his followers. Fighting a war on these three distinct fronts has awakened anxieties inside the Biden campaign and among his supporters. While Warren\u2019s ascendancy may typically spark the most worry in a typical campaign season, aides say she is almost relegated to the back burner, which could create challenges of its own. In photos: Presidential candidate Joe Biden \u201cNone of this is going away,\u201d said a senior Democrat official who admires Biden, but is troubled by the campaign\u2019s response to Trump. \u201cHe needs to show more emotion and find a way to turn all of this into an advantage.\u201d Over the weekend in Philadelphia, dozens of Biden donors gathered for a tour of campaign headquarters and to receive an update on the state of the race from top Biden advisers, including campaign manager Greg Schultz and longtime adviser Steve Ricchetti. The event was scheduled long before the impeachment inquiry began, aides said, but, in the context of the drama unfolding in Washington, it took on a heightened sense of urgency. After initially taking a far more measured approach to the crisis, Biden and his campaign have stepped up their attacks on Trump on multiple fronts in recent days, from paid advertising to fundraising appeals to more aggressive responses. The shift in strategy comes after the campaign received a fusillade of advice from Democrats watching in frustration. \u201cThis campaign will continue to focus on the issues that impact people\u2019s lives,\u201d deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield wrote in a weekend memo, \u201cwhile simultaneously hammering Donald Trump for his unprecedented abuse of power and correcting the record on the mountain of lies Trump and his allies continue to spread about Joe Biden.\u201d Striking a proper balance between offensive and defensive moves \u2013 juggling primary opponents and a potential general election rival \u2013 has proven remarkably tricky. The challenges from Trump come just as more voters are tuning into the 2020 campaign and as Biden loses his frontrunner\u2019s advantage in on the race. Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania said he had little doubt Trump was trying to weaken Biden\u2019s candidacy because Republicans would prefer to run against Warren or another candidate with positions far more liberal than Biden. He said Democratic voters should not allow Trump to hijack their primary campaign. \u201cThe American people know Joe Biden and his character and values,\u201d Casey said in an interview. \u201cWe should not allow Trump to change the subject and distract from a clear abuse of power.\u201d Warren was already a rising threat, but raising $24.6 million \u2013 compared to Biden\u2019s $15.2 million \u2013 sent alarm bells throughout the campaign and among top donors. Several Biden campaign officials used the fundraising comparisons, along with Bernie Sanders\u2019 $25 million haul, as a plea for donors to step up their efforts. \u201cSanders and Warren have been building an online fundraising mechanism for six years. Joe Biden\u2019s been building one for six months,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina Democratic state senator who has hosted a fundraiser for Biden. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to raise some money. His online efforts are getting better, but he\u2019s going to continue to have to do fundraisers which takes away from his time to campaign.\u201d On the policy front, advisers to Biden say they will gradually sharpen differences, particularly on Warren\u2019s support for the single-payer \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal. But they have no plans to use a scorched-earth campaign against the Massachusetts senator \u2013 largely because they believe it would backfire \u2013 and they hope other Democratic rivals will assume that role. This week, Biden is traveling to New Hampshire, which will be a critical battleground between the two leading candidates. \u201cYou know how difficult it is to be the frontrunner from the start and maintain that over time,\u201d said Lou D\u2019Allesandro, a longtime New Hampshire Democratic legislator and top Biden supporter in the state. \u201cThere are always ups and downs, but we\u2019re holding our own. And give her credit where credit is due, but by the same token, we\u2019ve got to work harder.\u201d Biden\u2019s advisers have acknowledged Iowa and New Hampshire could be tough terrain for his candidacy, but they routinely emphasize his appeal in South Carolina, particularly among black voters in the fourth nominating state; A CNN South Carolina poll released last month found he had a huge lead over his opponents \u2013 37% over Warren\u2019s 16% and Sanders\u2019 11%. His team is also building out its operations in Super Tuesday states, with announcements for key campaign organizers expected this week, in hopes of building a firewall in states with more minority voters to help slow Warren\u2019s momentum if she wins early contests. \u201cWe have a broader base and coalition than anyone else,\u201d said Pete Kavanaugh, deputy campaign manager for Biden who is overseeing early-state contests. \u201cOnce you get past South Carolina, it\u2019s a delegate game.\u201d But in conversations with more than a dozen campaign advisers and Biden loyalists, it is the subject of Hunter Biden that comes up again and again as the most worrisome aspect of the moment. He is seen by many inside Biden\u2019s orbit as something of the former vice president\u2019s kryptonite, who presents unique and uncertain challenges. On the campaign trail, Biden\u2019s discussion of his son and his business dealings have been limited. Biden bristled at a recent question about whether his son\u2019s position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company \u2013 at the very time the former vice president served as the point man on Ukraine in the Obama administration \u2013 presented a potential conflict. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. \u201cThere has been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else. Period,\u201d Biden told reporters, his voice raising. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna respond to that. Let\u2019s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing as President that no president has ever done.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Staring down the near-certainty of running next year against a Democrat whose campaign will feature a sweeping vision for health care, President Donald Trump is rolling out the latest in a series of isolated health care policies that his team hopes will stack up to a plan he can run on. That effort included an event Thursday in Florida, where Trump signed an executive order that underscores the benefits of preserving the status quo for Medicare, in particular Medicare Advantage plans offered by private insurers. In a raucous campaign-style event, Trump claimed Medicare is \u201cunder siege\u201d and that Democrats want to destroy it. \u201cThese people on the other side, these people are crazy. They want to take it away, give you lousy health care,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are making your Medicare even better and we\u2019re not letting anyone, it will never be taken away from you.\u201d Trump\u2019s piecemeal approach risks leaving him \u2013 and, perhaps more crucially, vulnerable down-ballot Republicans \u2013 without a coherent alternative in a race that could center largely on competing ideas for health care. Trump's push to make health care prices more transparent is long overdue Nothing is likely to move on Capitol Hill as the White House and Congress focus on the impeachment inquiry engulfing Trump\u2019s presidency. However, even before the House began those proceedings, the administration had little in the way of an overarching design for health care. The White House had planned to start pumping out health-related initiatives on a near-weekly basis over the summer, aides said, but mass shootings, travel and other events have scrambled those plans. Now, Trump\u2019s team has laid out a blueprint for a series of announcements through the fall, with upcoming rollouts planned for an Oval Office event and a speech on the road in the weeks ahead, a senior administration official said. Aides and allies point to what the President has already done to lower drug prices, combat opioid addiction and offer lower-cost alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. Health care explained: Medicare for All vs public option vs the ACA Since the start of Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans have struggled and failed to agree on a unified vision for health care to offer up as a substitute for the landmark health reform law they\u2019ve vowed to destroy, though Trump has said Republicans will be \u201cthe party of health care.\u201d And Democrats, emboldened by the midterm gains they achieved largely by focusing on health care, are eager to contrast their ideas for universal health coverage with a Trump approach to health care that has felt piecemeal at best and nonexistent at worst. What\u2019s more, the political calculations for Trump could change again later this year if an administration-backed lawsuit seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act succeeds. In that case, a patchwork quilt of proposals may not be enough to convince voters Trump and Republicans are prepared to fix a newly collapsed system. Back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in August forced the White House to postpone Trump\u2019s first planned trip to The Villages for a Medicare speech \u2013 which aides said needed to be retooled before a redo of the policy announcement. Trump will deliver that speech Thursday at an official event with a distinctly political title: \u201cProtecting Medicare from Socialist Destruction.\u201d The order will highlight the benefits of Medicare Advantage, which the Trump administration has been heavily promoting since 2017. It aims to give insurers more flexibility to offer telehealth and supplemental benefits, as well as to make it easier for seniors to sign up for these plans, which are offered by private insurers and have been growing in popularity. It will also allow Medicare Advantage enrollees to receive cash rebates to push them to receive high-value care. Notably, the administration wants to make sure that traditional Medicare \u201cis not  advantaged or promoted over Medicare Advantage,\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Administration officials have been touting Medicare Advantage, which has about 22 million enrollees or one-third of the total eligible for Medicare \u2013 ahead of open enrollment starting in mid-October. Premiums are declining for 2020, while plan choices and benefits are increasing. A senior official said Trump holds regular meetings with policy staff who brief him on the progress of his various health initiatives. The President asked his team to put together proposals he can tout on the campaign trail, and the senior administration official said Trump \u201craises health care on his own, every week.\u201d Led by Joe Grogan, head of the Domestic Policy Council, top aides \u2013 including Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Azar \u2013 have worked to develop initiatives Trump could pursue through executive action. Some are still in the works heading into 2020. Others already announced include a controversial proposal to require hospitals post the prices they negotiate privately with insurers and one that seeks to transform kidney care for the more than 37 million Americans with kidney disease. Prospects for a legislative solution to health care before the election are increasingly dim, however. Trump tried unsuccessfully in March to rally Republicans behind devising an Obamacare replacement that few lawmakers wanted to touch, given how costly the GOP\u2019s failure to pass one the first time was at the polls. Some Republicans on Capitol Hill are optimistic that legislation addressing prescription drug pricing and \u201csurprise\u201d medical bills could see some movement before the election, given bipartisan support for addressing both problems. The President has urged Congress to address both issues, and the White House backs the policies behind both bills. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have proposed legislation that would protect patients from getting hefty surprise bills if they unwittingly go to out-of-network doctors, particularly in emergency situations, but momentum has slowed amid heavy lobbying by both insurers and medical providers. While both chambers are also looking at drug price bills, that effort will likely be overshadowed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s recent proposal that calls for allowing the federal government to negotiate prices on some drugs \u2013 a non-starter for Republicans. Fact check: Bernie Sanders has made the same false claim about health spending for 10 years Running on fundamental change, however, is not a strategy typically employed by sitting presidents, who do their best to persuade voters not to change the status quo. \u201cI can\u2019t think of the last time an incumbent President campaigned on a specific comprehensive overhaul of anything, much less health care,\u201d said Josh Holmes, former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cI also think the new reality of health care politics is that anybody who has a plan that would disrupt coverage for current beneficiaries is playing with fire.\u201d Many of the Democrats leading in the race to take on Trump next year have advocated either for a national health insurance system, such as \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d or at a minimum for adding a government-backed public option to the Obamacare exchanges. The Trump campaign has seized on some of the most controversial elements of the progressive plans to bolster its overarching theme \u2013 that Democrats are too far left \u2013 but has otherwise done little in the way of promoting a health care alternative. Campaign advisers say they\u2019ve heard little talk of positive messaging on the issue, despite how dominant the topic is on the other side of the aisle. Trump\u2019s aides and allies remain confident their negative messaging on Democratic health care plans will resonate. Most are hopeful Democrats\u2019 shift toward what conservatives have described as a government takeover of health care will serve as a fruitful line of attack for Trump. The shift was evident in a briefing call administration officials held with reporters ahead of the order. Grogan stressed that the President\u2019s vision for a healthier America goes beyond the Affordable Care Act, \u201cwhich at the end of the day is not that many people.\u201d He sought to contrast what steps Trump has taken with the Democratic candidates\u2019 push for Medicare for All, evoking a familiar attack that it would lead to Medicare for none. \u201cWhile President Trump has expanded health care choices and decreased costs, not to mention lowered prescription drug prices and increased transparency in the industry, 2020 Democrats want to go far beyond Obamacare,\u201d said Daniel Bucheli, a Trump campaign spokesman. \u201cThe 2020 Democrat field is embracing a government takeover of health care under the \u2018Medicare-for-all\u2019 banner that would eliminate private insurance, increase wait times, and decrease the quality of medical care.\u201d While polls show that Americans want elected officials to lower health care costs, many are not ready to embrace a national health plan such as Medicare for All. Nearly 69% of the public favor a public option, which would compete with private plans, while 53% support Medicare for All, according to a September Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Democratic candidates have repeatedly attacked Trump for hurting Americans\u2019 health care, and experts say the President is seeking to show what he has accomplished amid those accusations. \u201cThe President is really focused on making his mark on health care,\u201d said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, managing director at Manatt Health, a professional services firm, who worked in the Obama administration to implement the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that, as the election is starting to ramp up, we\u2019re seeing a lot of efforts from the administration to show movement and progress on some of these priorities, given that repeal and replace really stalled.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren is challenging Joe Biden\u2019s dominance in the race for the Democratic nomination, standing at 22% to the former vice president\u2019s 20% in a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. Although neither candidate holds a clear lead at this point, the new poll finds Warren and Biden well ahead of other contenders for the Democratic nomination. Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 support has dipped to 11% in this poll, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 9% and Sen. Kamala Harris at 6%. Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar each land at 3%, while Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, investor Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang each have the backing of 2% of likely caucusgoers. The poll marks Gabbard\u2019s third qualifying poll for inclusion in October\u2019s Democratic debates. The rest of the field each notched 1% or less. Warren\u2019s improved standing overall in the Iowa poll comes on the heels of a stronger showing in recent national polls and is bolstered by an increasing positive favorability rating (75% have a favorable view, the best in the field, and she is one of only four candidates who have improved their net favorability since the June CNN/DMR poll), as well as a growing percentage of likely caucusgoers who say she is either their first choice, second choice or someone they are actively considering. All told, 71% are at least considering Warren\u2019s candidacy, ahead of the next best candidate on that score by 11 points (Biden at 60%). Her supporters are also more enthusiastic than those behind Biden (32% of her backers are extremely enthusiastic vs. 22% for the former vice president). Debate opens new fronts on guns, Biden's age in Democratic race The Massachusetts senator appears to be gaining ground primarily at the expense of Sanders. She holds the support of 32% of those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016 (Sanders himself stands at 25% among that group), stands at 48% among those who consider themselves \u201cvery liberal,\u201d and for the first time in CNN/DMR polling on the race, has edged ahead of Sanders among those under age 35 (27% back Warren, 22% Sanders). Biden\u2019s core backers remain behind him in largely the same way they were in the previous poll. Among seniors, he is the first choice of 35%, about the same as earlier this year. And he remains above 30% support with moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers. And Warren\u2019s supporters are a bit less apt to be locked in than are those backing Biden (12% of Warren supporters say their mind is made up vs. 26% of Biden\u2019s supporters). Overall, though, just 20% of likely caucusgoers say their mind is made up now, suggesting there is plenty of room for these preferences to shift before February. For many in the field, a summer spent campaigning in Iowa has done little to improve their chances there. Aside from Warren, no candidate has made meaningful gains in overall support compared with their backing among likely caucus attendees in June, and 10 candidates saw their unfavorable ratings rise by double-digits without an equivalent rise on the positive side of things, including a whopping 30-point increase in negative views of author Marianne Williamson, a 23-point jump for former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro and increases in the teens for former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Sanders and Biden each saw an increase in unfavorable views alongside a drop in favorable ratings (Sanders shifted from 70% favorable and 25% unfavorable to a 58% favorable to 36% unfavorable rating; Biden\u2019s favorable numbers dipped 6 points to 66% while his unfavorable rating rose 5 to 29%). Yang also saw his unfavorable numbers grow, but the rise was matched by the increase in his favorability rating. Beyond Warren\u2019s gains, Buttigieg boosted his favorable rating 8 points to 69% without an appreciable rise in unfavorable views, Klobuchar saw favorable views gain 6 points to top 50% for the first time, while her unfavorable numbers rose 4 points, and Booker\u2019s favorability climbed 5 points to 60% as the unfavorable side gained just 3 points. Though views on the candidates have shifted, those likely to attend Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucuses remain more apt to prioritize nominating a candidate with a strong chance of beating Trump (63%) over one who shares their positions on major issues (31%). And most think that after Trump, American government could return to the way it was before his election (59%). The poll sought to gain insight into what it is likely caucusgoers think an electable candidate would be. Nearly three-quarters said a candidate who can excite new voters (74%) is closer to their vision of electability than one who would excite the base (16%). And most preferred a candidate who would represent a new generation of leadership (57%) over one with a long history in government (28%), as well as one who would take the high road against Trump (54%) vs. getting in the mud as needed to take on the President (35%). Roughly two-thirds felt the more electable candidate is one who seeks common ground with Republicans (63%) rather than moving the country to the left (28%). But in assessing six positions that have become signatures of the more liberal candidates in the Democratic field, the poll finds wide variation in likely caucusgoers\u2019 level of comfort with them. Clear majorities say that they are personally comfortable with policies that would raise taxes on the wealthy (74%) and restore the ban on assault-style weapons (69%) and they feel candidates ought to run on those positions. Fewer felt the same about the Green New Deal (48%), \u201cMedicare for All\u201d (41%), free tuition for public colleges (36%) and moving the country in a socialist direction (20%). Views on Medicare for All in particular are starkly divided between those backing Warren or Sanders \u2013 the strongest proponents of such a plan among the Democratic candidates \u2013 and those who favor other candidates. Among supporters of Warren or Sanders, 63% say they\u2019re comfortable with Medicare for All and want candidates to run on it, while among those backing other candidates, just 29% feel the same way. Perceptions on these policy positions are one sharp divider between supporters of the two top candidates. Among Warren\u2019s supporters, 64% say that none of the six tested positions are bad policy. Among Biden\u2019s backers, though, just 29% feel the same way. The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, September 14 through 18 among a random sample of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample of likely caucusgoers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to give the federal government the ability to negotiate and cap prices on hundreds of drugs. The speaker unveiled her long-awaited plan to lower drug prices on Thursday, seeking to show how Democrats would address a major health care concern of Americans ahead of the 2020 election. \u201cThe burden of out-of-control prescriptions is an issue that touches every family in America,\u201d Pelosi said. Controlling the cost of drugs is a major priority for both parties in Congress, as well as President Donald Trump. They have all promised to take action, but little has been accomplished so far. Pelosi\u2019s proposal would empower the Health & Human Services secretary to negotiate annually for the best prices on at least 25 of the most costly brand-name drugs without generic or lower-priced alternatives and up to 250 medications, including insulin. The plan would impact drug prices not just for Medicare enrollees but for all Americans. It also calls for: The plan is expected to produce significant government savings, Pelosi said. Lawmakers will determine whether those funds could be put into expanding coverage in Medicare to areas such as hearing, vision or dental benefits or into lowering the price of additional drugs through negotiation. Although the President has also flirted with pegging the price of some drugs to their cost in other developed countries, it remains to be seen if he will back Pelosi\u2019s proposal, but he signaled support via Twitter, noting \u201cIt\u2019s great to see Speaker Pelosi\u2019s bill today. Let\u2019s get it done in a bipartisan way!\u201d The speaker said she is optimistic that Democrats can work with the White House on this issue. \u201cYes, we do hope to have White House buy in because that seems to be the root to getting any votes in the United States Senate,\u201d Pelosi said. But she was facing pushback among progressives in her own party on Thursday. She has been meeting with several caucuses this week to discuss her proposal. The Congressional Progressive Caucus has several concerns about the plan, including the number of drugs subject to negotiation annually, said Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin. \u201cBack home \u2026 they want to know if they drug they use, they\u2019re going to save money on,\u201d he said. Also at issue is how the bill addresses the high launch prices of some new drugs and whether the non-compliance penalty \u2013 a fee starting at 65% of gross sales of the drug and increasing quarterly until it hits 95% \u2013 is strong enough. The caucus, however, is pleased that the speaker is backing negotiation, rather than arbitration, and that the plan would cover all Americans, not just those on Medicare, Pocan said. The Energy & Commerce Committee\u2019s health subcommittee is set to hold a hearing on the legislation next Wednesday. Democratic leaders said they hope to have a bill to bring for a vote on the House floor in October. However, it is not likely to get far in the Senate since Republicans have long opposed allowing the government to negotiate drug prices. Already, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who is trying to convince members of his party to support his plan to lower drug costs in Medicare, has come out against Pelosi\u2019s proposals, a draft of which has circulated over the past week. His office last week circulated interviews he did in with various media outlets in which he described his proposals as moderate. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Democratic leadership\u2019s new drug pricing plan is \u201cjust more socialism.\u201d \u201cThe result will be less choice, which means less hope for Americans who are sick,\u201d McCarthy said, noting the full text of the bill has not been made available. The main drug industry lobbying group also lashed out at the speaker\u2019s \u201cradical plan,\u201d warning it would end the system that has made the US a leader in developing life-saving treatments. \u201cIt would fundamentally restructure how patients access medicines by giving the federal government unprecedented, sweeping authority to set medicine prices in public and private markets while importing price controls from other countries that restrict access to innovative medicines,\u201d said Stephen Ubl, chief executive of PhRMA.

            "article_content": "Something has happened to Bernie Sanders over the last few months in the 2020 presidential race. Or, more accurately, not happened. Sanders, the self-described Vermont Democratic Socialist, is stuck in neutral. And that\u2019s a very bad place to be with the day when actual voters will cast votes is getting closer and closer. (Just 138 days until the Iowa caucuses!) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Take the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday night. It showed Sanders at 14% \u2013 in 3rd place but trailing both Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden by double digits. But, that isn\u2019t even the real story for Sanders out of that poll! It\u2019s actually this: While Biden gained five points from a similar poll in July and Warren gained six, Sanders\u2019 support stayed right where it was \u2013 up only a single point from the summer, which is a statistically insignificant change. And this is FAR from the only poll that shows the Sanders\u2019 stagnation. A look at Real Clear Politics average of all of the polling conducted in the Democratic primary race to date confirms the Sanders stall. In the spring of 2019, Sanders was the clear 2nd choice to Biden. In fact, all the way through early June, Biden and Sanders were the only two candidates to consistently poll in double digits in the RCP average. But, since the summer, Sanders has flatlined. His average support has never gone higher than 17% and never gone lower than 14.8%. Sanders, due to the loyalty of his most ardent supporters, has always had a very high floor in this race \u2013 probably right around 14%. But, what\u2019s happened over these last few months is the emergence of what looks like a pretty low ceiling for Sanders\u2019 support in the 2020 race. First poll after third Democratic debate shows Biden leading but Warren rising So, what gives? The short answer is that there are just a whole lot more options for voters in this election than there were in the 2016 Democratic primary race. In that race, Sanders was the only alternative to Hillary Clinton. If you didn\u2019t like Clinton \u2013 and there were lots of Democrats in that camp \u2013 you were voting for Sanders. Period. And, Sanders clearly benefited from that dynamic \u2013 staying in the race all the way through the final primaries in June before bowing out amid Clinton\u2019s insurmountable delegate lead. In 2020, there are 20 candidates still in the race. 20! Which means that if you don\u2019t like, say, Biden, who is currently the frontrunner, there are lots and lots and lots of other options not named \u201cBernie Sanders\u201d to choose from. One in particular \u2013 Warren \u2013 is another reason that Sanders seems to have hit a bit of a wall. Warren\u2019s candidacy looks a lot like Sanders\u2019: Unapologetic liberalism in support of broad structural change in politics and society. Warren supports Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal. Warren and Sanders are both prominent supporters of the Green New Deal. They both want to tax the wealthy and corporations to pay for their proposals. The problem for Sanders is that Warren is surging on that message while he, well, isn\u2019t. In the Real Clear Politics polling average, Warren is now clear of Sanders for 2nd place \u2013 and the NBC-WSJ poll put her at 25%, the highest she\u2019s been in any hypothetical national polling of the primary. What explains Warren\u2019s rise on what is, for all intents and purposes, Sanders\u2019 message?  Voters like new faces!  Sanders ran in 2016 \u2013 and lots of Democratic voters flocked to him. But, for many of those voters, it may be a been-there-done-that situation. Warren is, in their minds, Bernie 2.0 \u2013 the same proposals in a more voter-friendly (and electable) package. And that gets at the more fundamental problem for Sanders. The people who love him love him exactly because he doesn\u2019t care about how he looks (perennially unkempt hair) or what he sounds like (very, very shout-y). Those traits make him authentic and different to them. They love him because of it, not in spite of it. But, those same Sanders-ian traits may be the thing keeping him from growing his support in the 2020 race in any meaningful way. If you are a Democrat and are relentlessly focused on nominating someone who can beat President Donald Trump \u2013 and all polling I\u2019ve seen suggests that\u2019s the dominant motivation for a majority of party voters \u2013 then Sanders\u2019 nutty-professor profile may keep you from jumping on board. There\u2019s evidence that Sanders\u2019 stall in polling is having an impact. Earlier this week, he replaced his New Hampshire state director \u2013 never a great sign with the primary set for mid-February. On Monday he lost the endorsement of the Working Families Party to Warren. (Working Families endorsed Sanders in 2016.) And on Wednesday, Sanders\u2019 Iowa state director confirmed to CNN that their political director in the Hawkeye State is no longer with the campaign. Now. It\u2019s better to have these struggles in the fall of an off-year rather than in the middle of primary season next late winter/early spring. And, because of the loyalty of Sanders core backers, it\u2019s hard to imagine him slipping from relevance anytime soon. But, his struggle to attract support beyond that hardcore, uh, core is real \u2013 and responsible for the current Sanders\u2019 stagnation in the race. UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect the departure of Sanders\u2019 campaign political director in Iowa.",

            "article_content": "First things first: The theme song of the week is The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd. Poll of the week: A new Kaiser Family Foundation poll finds that when it comes to expanding coverage and lowering health care costs 55% of Democrats and Democratic leaning independents prefer to vote for a candidate who does so by building on the Affordable Care Act. Only 40% want do so by voting for voting for a candidate who replaces the ACA with Medicare for All. This poll is consistent with previous Kaiser polls on the subject in finding Democrats wanting to vote for someone who builds on the ACA. What\u2019s the point: Another Democratic presidential debate was defined by whether it\u2019s best to improve health care coverage through Medicare for All with minimal private insurance or having private insurance with a government run health care option. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren argued the former, while some others, most prominently former Vice President Joe Biden, argued the latter. Polls like the one I just cited indicate that the candidates who favor a public option hold the majority opinion within the Democratic Party. Our CNN poll from late June directly posed the question to potential Democratic primary voters. We asked whether there should be a national health care plan and whether it should replace private insurance. The plurality, 49%, said there should be a government health care plan but it shouldn\u2019t eliminate private insurance. Just 30% said there should be a national health care plan and it should eliminate private insurance. A mere 13% didn\u2019t want a government run health care plan. The polling shouldn\u2019t be too surprising when you look at how Democrats feel out their own health insurance: they like it. According to Gallup polling from late last year, 82% of Democrats said the quality of health care they received was either good or excellent. A large majority, 71%, believed their health care coverage was either good or excellent. Even when it comes to health care costs, 61% of Democrats said were satisfied with what they paid in health care. On Thursday, Warren argued that, despite these numbers, she has \u201cactually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\u201d It turns out that Kaiser posed this question to Americans back in 2013 \u201cDo you have a generally favorable or generally unfavorable opinion of your own health insurance company?\u201d In that poll, 72% of Democrats they had a favorable view of their health insurance company. That\u2019s triple the 24% who said they had an unfavorable view. This polling is probably the reason that most of the Democrats on the Thursday debate stage don\u2019t want to mostly eliminate private insurance companies. It might also explain why Biden continues to lead the Democratic race. He\u2019s closer to the median voter on the marquee issue this primary season than either his two leading competitors Sanders or Warren. If Sanders or Warren win the nomination, it will be in spite of their health care positions, not because of them. Even if Sanders or Warren do become their party\u2019s nominee, it should be noted their health care stances are likely to be even more harmful in the general election. While 54% of all voters want a national health insurance option in CNN polling, just 19% believe that should come by eliminating private health insurance. When not offered the public option and asked directly by Marist College if it was a good idea to replace private insurance completely with a national health insurance plan, 40% of voters said it was a good idea and 55% said it was a bad idea. Moreover, 58% of all Americans told Gallup last year they were satisfied with their health care costs and clear majorities answered good or excellent on the quality of their health care (80%) and coverage (69%). And similarly to Democrats, 74% of all Americans told Kaiser in 2013 that they had a favorable view of their own health insurance company. Perhaps the best hope for Sanders and Warren is to not make health care personal. Americans may like their own insurance and their own insurance company, but just 20% are satisfied with the total cost of health care in America. A minority (43%) have a favorable view of health insurance companies at large. But when you propose eliminating private insurance, it\u2019s pretty hard not to make it personal to the many voters who rely on it.",

            "article_content": "The latest Democratic debate threw up a rich haul of clashes, incidents, slow burning controversies and policy collisions that will help define the 2020 race in the weeks to come. Often, a debate\u2019s impact only becomes clear in subsequent days, when exchanges that did not immediately resonate take on extra significance as the churn of the campaign does its work. Thursday\u2019s encounter in Houston exposed ideological, personal and policy divisions between the candidates that offer clues about how the Democratic race will unfold from now on. There\u2019s a trove of material for each campaign to mine to tweak the weaknesses of rival candidates. And President Donald Trump\u2019s team must have been watching with glee as comment on guns and health care piled up material for general election attack ads. Beto O'Rourke: 'Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47' Over the span of this race, there\u2019s little evidence that the debates are changing the hierarchy of candidates. But the confrontations are serving to expose the complex layers of the campaign and offer clues over how it may turn out. The debate solidified the clear top tier in this race and none of the leading candidates looks likely to quickly fade in the crucial run-up to the Iowa caucuses in February. Former Vice President Joe Biden had a patchy night but Thursday was his best performance so far in his campaign. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was relatively quiet but made no huge mistakes. And Sen. Bernie Sanders will have delighted his solid supporters but did not seem to solve the riddle of broadening his base. Debates confirm there is really only one issue in the Democratic primary These three however have yet to turn their full fire on one another. That\u2019s one thing to watch for as the race really gets going. From here on in, the clock is ticking for everyone else. Low polling candidates must elbow themselves into the top tier. Julian Castro\u2019s unsubtle jabs at Biden\u2019s age, Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s vow to confiscate assault rifles and an overt turn against Trump by Kamala Harris in a direct-to-camera stare down are a sure sign the pressure to stand out is beginning to show. In the weeks to come, keeping the cash flowing will become even more important as candidates build early state machines and buy advertising. So they must show donors that they still have a shot and there\u2019s a reason to go on. A metric of success for this debate will come in third quarter fund raising data at the end of the month. Businessman Andrew Yang rolled out a novel way of getting some buzz, turning his campaign into a raffle to give 10 people $1000 a month for a year to highlight his universal basic income plan. Castro\u2019s pile-on was clumsy. By repeatedly asking Biden: \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d the former HUD Secretary actually built empathy for the former vice president. But make no mistake, many of the other candidates are happy this is out there and even happier that Castro stepped on the landmine before they had to \u2013 their post-debate interviews are proof of that. Joe Biden has his best debate night -- and that might be good enough \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball across the end line without fumbling,\u201d Booker told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper after the debate. Harris was asked several times on \u201cNew Day\u201d about the Castro assault, but pointedly chose not to criticize its author or to defend Biden. The question of whether the former vice president is fit for the rigors of the presidency and to take on Trump is not going away. It\u2019s one of his biggest weaknesses and, as even Biden has said, it\u2019s fair game for opponents to explore. And Biden put it on the table himself by rooting his campaign in an argument about electability. Any stumbles in the Democratic debate next month and the issue will be back on the front burner. The dominant narrative is that this race is taking Democrats, led by Sanders, Warren and the activist base, so far left that they risk alienating America\u2019s political middle. Biden, Harris, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and O\u2019Rourke all had strong moments pushing a pragmatic brand of politics to reflect Washington realities. Their strategy is likely to become a more overt theme in the contest as the first nominating voting looms. The schism in the field is especially evident on health care \u2013 broadly over whether to build on Obamacare or to go all in on a Medicare for All push. Third debate shows why Democratic primary could take a while to decide There are signs that Warren might be hedging her bets and trying to provide herself room to track back toward the center in a general election campaign. But her line that \u201cI have never met anyone who likes their health insurance company\u201d may put off Americans who don\u2019t want to give up employer-provided plans. It will certainly be highlighted by Trump if she ends up as his Democratic opponent and will reinforce claims by the moderates that progressives are leading Democrats into a dead end. Another moment from Thursday sure to find its way into an attack ad is O\u2019Rourke\u2019s vow: \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d His call for a mandatory guns buy back scheme was an impassioned reaction to a massacre in his home town of El Paso and a strategy designed to help his underperforming campaign grab the spotlight. There\u2019s an argument that gun politics is changing and Washington is yet to get the message. But O\u2019Rourke also risks playing into GOP dogma that all gun control is a ruse for Democrats to confiscate the guns of law abiding Americans. It\u2019s a base-stoking claim already burning up conservative media. And the eventual Democratic nominee will have to repeatedly answer for O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment. One prominent Democrat is already mad at O\u2019Rourke. \u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying, \u2018Democrats are coming for your guns,\u2019\u201d Delaware Sen. Chris Coons said Friday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom.\u201d The Democratic debate at times seemed from another era. Candidates earnestly clashing over policy, pursuing traditional political attacks and firing off pre-planned zingers. Trump blew up such conventional political codes in destroying the GOP field in 2016. Assuming he shows up for presidential debates next fall, whoever emerges from the Democratic race will have to deal with the President\u2019s brawling, outlandish style. While Democrats were quarreling over the nuances of health care, Trump counter-programmed with a whirling campaign pitch at a Republican retreat in Baltimore. He vented against bans of plastic straws, complained about energy saving light bulbs Trump claimed made him look orange and included a bizarre aside about Republican House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy. The 33 most overblown lines from Donald Trump's Baltimore speech \u201cKevin is just like a cow, he\u2019s just smaller,\u201d Trump said. Overall, the Democratic presidential race marks an implicit bet that Americans are tired of Trump\u2019s act \u2013 and that offering clear plans on issues like health care is an antidote to the craziness that rocks the White House every day. Biden has made the most obvious pitch so far for the role of Trump slayer. Harris joined the game on Thursday night meaning that the question of electability will be increasingly important in the weeks to come.",

            "article_content": "Democratic candidates pushed back against Juli\u00e1n Castro going after Joe Biden\u2019s memory in Thursday\u2019s presidential debate, calling it \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cnot cool.\u201d Castro sharply accused the former vice president of forgetting what he\u2019d said just minutes before during a disagreement over a minor point in the candidates\u2019 broader discussion of whether to embrace \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which Biden has opposed. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro, a former housing and urban development secretary, said to Biden. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? I can\u2019t believe that you said \u2013 two minutes ago \u2013 that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re forgetting that. We need a health care system where you\u2019re automatically enrolled.\u201d South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg cut in, saying, \u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable.\u201d He continued: \u201cThis reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington. Scoring points against each other, poking at each other.\u201d Castro replied, \u201cThat\u2019s called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That\u2019s called an election.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota then responded, \u201cBut a House divided cannot stand. And that is not how we\u2019re going to win this election.\u201d Castro told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo after the debate that the comment was \u201cnot intended as a personal attack or affront.\u201d \u201cThis is a debate. And when we\u2019re talking about health care policy, we\u2019re talking about a policy that impacts every single person in this country,\u201d Castro said. Castro added on Friday that he would\u2019ve asked the same question of any of the other candidates had they denied a comment they made within minutes. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter that it was Joe Biden. If it had been another candidate that tried to deny what they just said two minutes ago, I would have asked them the same thing,\u201d Castro said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d In interviews with CNN immediately following the debate, Democratic candidates expressed disapproval of Castro\u2019s tactic and stressed the importance of party unity. Klobuchar said Castro\u2019s attack was \u201cnot cool,\u201d and \u201cso personal and so unnecessary.\u201d She said, \u201cIt feels like something that Donald Trump might tweet.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he is going to continue to contrast his views and record with Biden\u2019s, but that \u201cI\u2019m not going to go after him personally. That\u2019s not right.\u201d Buttigieg said it was \u201cstarting to feel like a scrum up there.\u201d Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said he is going to stand up against any kind of \u201cdemeaning and degrading between candidates,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve seen this movie before in the last election.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash pointed out that Booker had been tough on Biden in the last Democratic debate, where the senator delivered one of the most forceful denunciations of Biden\u2019s record and suggested he former vice president had been one of the chief architects of a criminal justice system that disproportionately incarcerated black and brown men. Booker responded, \u201cAbsolutely, but you saw the way I did it. It wasn\u2019t a cheap shot.\u201d Castro has \u201csome really legitimate concerns\u201d that are shared by many others, he said, about Biden\u2019s \u201cability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling.\u201d Booker said Castro has \u201cevery right to call that out.\u201d But the senator stressed the importance of tone and tenor and disagreeing respectfully. When you demonize somebody and create bad blood it\u2019s hard to unify afterwards,\u201d he said. Sen. Kamala Harris, whose confrontation of Biden in the first debate earned her a boost in the polls, said the focus should instead \u201cbe on what we need to do to prosecute the case against Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a debate stage. Things get heated,\u201d the California senator said Friday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d adding that \u201cthe focus needs to be on the fact that Donald Trump is not doing the American people the benefit of the office.\u201d CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "With\u00a0148 days\u00a0until the Iowa caucuses and\u00a0a barely winnowed Democratic field still vying for the nomination, the 2020 election is already in full swing.\u00a0Every Sunday, I round up the five BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they\u2019re ranked \u2013 so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week. To get these sent straight to your inbox, sign up for The Point newsletter! 5. Steyer\u2019s in (the next debate): Billionaire businessman Tom Steyer spent heavily to try to make it into Thursday\u2019s debate in Houston. (MUCH more on that debate below.) He failed, coming up one poll short of the qualification criteria. But on Sunday, Steyer got his poll. In a CBS/You Gov poll in Nevada released Sunday, Steyer took 2% \u2013 the fourth national or early state poll in which he has posted at least 2% support. That means that there will be at least 11 candidates \u2013 and two nights of debates \u2013 for the fourth debate in October. (All 10 candidates who made it into the third debate also qualify for the fourth.) Who else might get in? Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is now the closest, having met the fundraising threshold (130,000 unique donors) and with two (of the four necessary) polls showing her at 2%. Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson is next on the list, with one qualifying poll. Debating over two nights necessarily means the front pack will be split up \u2013 at least somewhat. Which makes what happens on Thursday night all the more intriguing. 4.\u00a0Is Tim Ryan going kamikaze?: Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan is still running for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 surprise! \u2013 but he has almost zero chance of actually winding up on the ticket. Despite that, he may have a real role to play in deciding who Democrats pick. Here\u2019s why: In an interview with Bloomberg last week, Ryan said this: \u201cI just think Biden is declining. I don\u2019t think he has the energy. You see it almost daily. And I love the guy.\u201d Over the weekend, Ryan held his ground in an interview with CNN.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not like I said something that a lot of people aren\u2019t thinking,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe have to be honest with each other. There\u2019s so much at stake in this election.\u201d The question of whether Biden, who is 76 years old, is up for the race has been kicking around the edges of the Democratic primary since the former vice president announced his candidacy. Those whispers have grown louder after Biden struggled in the first debate (and, to a lesser extent, the second) and as he has continued to misremember things and make other factual mistakes on the campaign trail. A bloodshot eye during CNN\u2019s climate change town hall, which Biden said was the result of bruising his eye in the process of taking out a contact lens, also became an issue \u2013 thanks in large part to Matt Drudge pushing the photo on his eponymous website. Biden has responded\u00a0to the questions as best as he can, noting that his age and competency can and should be an issue. But Ryan has clearly re-injected the \u201cis Biden really up for this\u201d question into the race. And it\u2019s not going to go away \u2013 even after Ryan\u2019s candidacy does. 3. Kamala Harris hit a snag:\u00a0 After the first presidential debate back in June, there was no 2020 candidate hotter than California Sen. Kamala Harris. Her command performance in the debate, which included a smackdown on Joe Biden, sent her soaring. Money poured into the campaign and polling showed she was suddenly a top-tier candidate. Times have changed. Harris struggled in the CNN debate in Detroit to recreate the magic of her first debate performance. She has continued to struggle with questions about where, exactly, she stands on health care.\u00a0Her poll numbers have slipped.\u00a0She\u2019s enduring headlines like \u201cWhy Kamala Harris is stuck in neutral.\u201d And she spent the weekend apologizing for seemingly agreeing with a questioner who called President Donald Trump\u2019s actions \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d Her top campaign advisers huddled with donors late last week in New York City amid questions about the current state of the campaign, according to the Wall Street Journal, evidence of the mounting concern over her chances. Harris continues to have considerable advantages in the race: She is charismatic and well-funded. She has real organizations \u2013 backed by influential endorsers \u2013 in early states. And she is generally well-liked by liberals and moderates in the party. But this current dip speaks to Harris\u2019 attempt to be all things to all people. At times she seems as though she is trying to align with the Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren end of the party. At other times she is clearly backing away from some of their more radical proposals \u2013 Medicare for All being the shining example \u2013 for fear of what it might do to her general election chances. Harris has a major chance to press \u201creset\u201d on the campaign this Thursday in the third Democratic debate. Scroll down for much more on that. 2. GOP primaries no more?: In the latest attempt to turn Trump\u2019s nomination as the Republican nominee in 2020 into a coronation, several state parties are taking steps to actually eliminate presidential primaries in their states entirely. On Friday, Kansas canceled its 2020 presidential primary. On Saturday, South Carolina and Nevada did the same. Arizona is expected to follow their lead on September 14. The stated reason for the cancellations is to save precious state party money. After all, why hold an expensive vote when the party is unified behind a single candidate? In 2004, for example, 10 states canceled their GOP primaries or caucuses and simply allocated all of their delegates for the Republican National Convention to George W. Bush. Of course, 2004 is not 2020. Bush had no opposition. Trump now has three announced challengers: Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh and former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who formally announced on Sunday. While Trump is a heavy favorite to be the GOP nominee against that trio, there is the possibility that certain primaries and caucuses could be embarrassing for the President \u2013 exposing a significant opposition to him within the party. Republican and Trump 2020 campaign officials are working to ensure that embarrassment doesn\u2019t happen. Which is good for Trump but bad for democracy. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! These four states will likely be the first to kowtow to Trump\u2019s wishes. My strong guess is they won\u2019t be the last. 1. The 3rd Debate: For the first time in the race, the top 10 candidates will all appear on a single stage Thursday night in Houston. (The debate will air on ABC and, yes, I will have a winners and losers column ready right after it ends.) The big headline is that Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren will be on the same stage \u2013 and at podiums next to one another! \u2013 for the first time in the race.\u00a0 Biden is the current front-runner, Warren the candidate with the momentum. They also represent the two competing visions of how the Democratic Party exists and flourishes in the age of Trump: Biden advocates a return to \u201cnormal,\u201d Warren is calling for large-scale structural reform in our politics. While that matchup will, rightly, suck up most of the oxygen in the pre-debate handicapping, it\u2019s worth remembering that there will be eight other candidates on the stage Thursday too. Eight other candidates who, unlike in the past two debates, have demonstrated consistent and real appeal in both polling and fundraising \u2013 and believe they can be the nominee. So, who else should you watch for?\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro has shown over the course of the first two debates that he knows what he\u2019s doing out there. Ditto Cory Booker. Kamala Harris could really use a strong performance after a shaky past month. I\u2019m most intrigued, though, by Pete Buttigieg. He has been purposely low-key in the first two debates, likely aiming to project gravitas amid questions of whether 37 is too young for someone to be president. But Buttigieg has more personality in him \u2013 as demonstrated by his presence on the campaign trail \u2013 and this debate would seem like the best place to bring it out.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s been an up and down summer for Kamala Harris. The California Democrat scored the biggest victory of her campaign in June, when, at the first debate, the senator excoriated Joe Biden on his past opposition to busing as a way to desegregate schools. The moment vaulted the California senator in the polls and exposed the vulnerability of the former vice president. But now, two months later and worlds removed from her campaign\u2019s high point, Harris was stuck using the archetypal political clich\u00e9 this week to fend off questions about her standing in the race and slumping poll numbers. \u201cI just heard you say polls,\u201d she told a reporter in a drab Las Vegas conference room on Wednesday. \u201cI think the only poll that matters is Election Day.\u201d Campaigns are never straight lines and often the high points are followed by striking lows. But Harris\u2019 summer has been particularly inconsistent, leaving Democratic operatives and even some Harris aides to question why the senator was unable to seize on her debate moment and firmly plant herself among Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2013 the race\u2019s top three candidates. Since that moment taking on Biden in June, Harris has been on a steady decline, unable to sustain the momentum that she earned for landing a solid punch against the race\u2019s frontrunner. Harris aides tell CNN they aren\u2019t worried about the lack of momentum and downturn in the polls, claiming that they won\u2019t let \u201ctemporary poll dips and blips distract or alter our approach to the race.\u201d But other advisers, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about the state of the campaign, said morale in the Baltimore-based operation has followed the polling downturn. It reached bottom when CNN released a poll last week that showed Harris had fallen back to 5% nationally, tied with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and nowhere near Biden, Sanders and Warren. \u201c(It was) the lowest point of the campaign, thus far,\u201d a Harris campaign adviser said of the day the CNN poll was released. In response, Maya Harris \u2013 the candidate\u2019s sister and senior aide \u2013 called key staff, big donors and bundlers to \u201cboost morale,\u201d the adviser said. Harris\u2019 senior aides are unmoved and believe that the summer, despite its ups and downs, has gone well. The campaign has plowed millions into organizing, spent money to stay on TV in Iowa and began to build an operation in California, which will have its first Super Tuesday presidential primary in 2020 and where the senator has leveraged her local status to consistently poll among the top candidates in the state. \u201cWe want to peak at the turn of the year, more than we do in August of 2019,\u201d a senior Harris aide said. Harris\u2019 campaign is looking to move past her roller coaster summer with an increased focus on building an operation that, in the words of one aide, is prepared \u201cfor the long haul.\u201d Harris and her team plan to bring on 19 new organizers in Iowa and 15 in South Carolina by early September, according to campaign plans provided to CNN, building on her already substantial staff in the early nominating states. And Harris\u2019 top aides have laid out a plan \u2013 both to the candidate and her top donors \u2013 where the nominating process is seen as a \u201clong protracted contest\u201d where \u201cthe top four candidates are going to be in a position to compete for the nomination potentially all the way to the convention.\u201d That is clear in how Harris is planning for Super Tuesday, too, a delegate rich day where more than a dozen states will be up for grabs. Harris has already built a sizable staff in her home state of California and her campaign announced recently that they were hiring seven new senior staffers in the state. In photos: Presidential candidate Kamala Harris The summer has also seen Harris invest in different organizing programs that the campaign hopes will help in the coming months. Much of that work has focused on college campuses, where Harris has invested time and money by hiring a full-time campus organizer in South Carolina and launched a program aimed at courting New Hampshire\u2019s large student population. \u201cOur focus is on winning the primary, not an off-year August news cycle, which is why we\u2019ve spent the summer building the grassroots organizing foundation that will propel Kamala to victory in this race,\u201d said Ian Sams, Harris\u2019 spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019ve already engaged thousands of volunteers and are competing to win in the early states, while preparing for a long primary contest that carries us into Super Tuesday and the rest of March.\u201d He added: \u201cThese races are marathons, not sprints, and Kamala is a long-distance runner.\u201d The issue that has dogged Harris most since the first Democratic debate is \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d the Sanders-backed health care plan that would entirely remake the health care system in the United States and push all Americans onto government backed plans. Harris\u2019 issues with health care began earlier this year when the senator appeared to tell CNN in January that she would eliminate private insurers as a necessary part of implementing Medicare for All. Harris aides later said the senator was referring to the bureaucracy around health care, not all private insurance. Harris, a co-sponsor of Sanders\u2019 bill in the Senate, once touted herself in 2018 as the \u201cthe first Senate Democrat to come out in support of Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All bill.\u201d Since then, though, Harris has released her own proposal that, while similar to Sanders\u2019 plan, has key differences, like the amount of time government health care is implemented and the availability of private health insurance. Harris advisers have described the plan as to the right of Sanders and the left of Biden, right where the senator would like to be politically. But the shifts in Harris\u2019 stance have created a view that the senator is trying to be everything to everyone. Harris has specifically offered mixed messages on private insurance under a Medicare for All system, vacillating between appearing to advocate for the elimination of private insurance \u2013 something her own plan does not do \u2013 and keeping some forms of private insurance. Biden\u2019s campaign lambasted the plan as a \u201chave-it-every-which-way approach\u201d and suggested that the changes are part of \u201ca long and confusing pattern of equivocating about (Harris\u2019) stance on health care in America.\u201d And Sanders\u2019 campaign labeled Harris\u2019 plan \u201cbad policy\u201d and \u201cbad politics.\u201d Harris\u2019 campaign argues it is not inconsistent to support Sanders\u2019 bill and have her own plan. And her support for Medicare for All but lack of support for removing all private insurance matches many voters. A CNN poll released in July found that more than eight in 10 potential Democratic voters said they favor a national health insurance plan \u2013 but just three in 10 favor a plan that completely does away with private insurance. Harris\u2019 campaign said she favors a number of paths to offering Americans access to health care as quickly as possible. A Harris senior aide said the senator opted to release her own plan this summer because she told her staff, \u201cI want my own plan,\u201d as opposed to running on Sanders\u2019 bill. The campaign points out other candidates like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Warren are co-sponsors of Sanders\u2019 bill, but may eventually diverge with their own specific plans. But a former strategist involved in her past California campaigns admitted that the perception of Harris as inconsistent on health care is an issue. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a lot of wiggle room to mess up on something like health care, because there\u2019s a narrative,\u201d the adviser said, adding that each slip up on health care grows \u201cexponentially worse\u201d than the time before. The belief inside the Harris campaign is that the California senator \u2013 because she is lesser known than the likes of Biden, Sanders and Warren \u2013 will have more pliable support than others in the race. \u201cShe has the most elasticity of any candidate,\u201d said Bakari Sellers, a Harris surrogate and CNN contributor. \u201cPeople want her to do well, but at the end of the day, they don\u2019t know her. It is difficult for her because she has to get acclimated to various communities quickly.\u201d That was echoed by Brian Brokaw, Harris\u2019 two-time campaign manager during her 2010 and 2014 runs for California attorney general and a senior adviser in her Senate race, who described the senator as a \u201cnewcomer\u201d who will need \u201ctime for her to make her case.\u201d \u201cKamala Harris is somebody throughout her career who has been underestimated or written off prematurely,\u201d Brokaw said. \u201cShe has made a lot of very smart people look foolish.\u201d This view \u2013 that Harris is unknown compared to others \u2013 is backed up by audiences at Harris\u2019 own events. While her gatherings often bring out her most enthusiastic supporters, they also draw a good number of curious, undecided voters still trying to take her measure. Because she is far less known than others, some of the undecided voters at her events say they need to get to know her better. Younger voters often say they have heard some vague criticisms of her record as a prosecutor before she entered politics \u2013 and need to do more \u201cresearch.\u201d Patrick Mirocha, a 46-year-old plant operator at a waste treatment plant, said he counts Harris\u2019 toughness among her top attributes. He is deciding among Harris, Buttigieg and Warren \u2013 who top his list because they\u2019re \u201call pretty brilliant.\u201d \u201cIf Kamala were on the debate stage (with Donald Trump), I think she\u2019d wax the floor with him. She would just dominate him,\u201d Mirocha said in an interview. \u201cI watched the Barr confirmation, the (Brett) Kavanaugh confirmation. You can tell she\u2019s a prosecutor. She\u2019s methodical. If you sit back and just kind of listen, really listen, you can tell she\u2019s two steps ahead of them in her questioning.\u201d See some of Harris' intense interrogations on the Hill Still, he is drawn to Buttigieg, in part because of his military experience and Warren because of her policy chops: \u201cI just think Elizabeth Warren has a long track record as being great\u2026 She\u2019d be formidable.\u201d Sellers and many inside Harris\u2019 campaign also see Harris\u2019 gender and race as a key reason she has experienced the ups-and-downs that other candidates have not. \u201cIt is very difficult for a black woman to become President of the United States. We are learning that and her team is learning that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has to deal with the misogyny that Elizabeth (Warren) and others have to deal with, but she has to deal with the racism.\u201d And voters have also factored that in with Harris. \u201cThe question to me isn\u2019t whether they can handle themselves debating against Trump,\u201d said Ryan Saddler, the 46-year-old director of diversity at St. Ambrose University in Iowa. \u201cThe question for me is \u2013 can they be convincing enough to the Trump supporters and those who are \u2013 I won\u2019t mince my words here \u2013 those who are in support of a white supremacist, male agenda to sway them, that they are capable of doing the job.\u201d Saddler, who attended a Harris event in Davenport, Iowa earlier this summer, said he was torn between Harris and Warren. But he feels that Warren\u2019s campaign has plowed into the work of listening to voters this year and trying to understand what they need, \u201cwhich is the history of our country for women, period, in any position of power.\u201d CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect Brian Brokaw\u2019s position as campaign manager for Kamala Harris\u2019 2010 and 2014 races for California attorney general.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have been circling for months \u2013 like battleships just out of range. We now know that will change in the second week of September, when the Democratic front-runner and the rival who is stirring the loudest buzz on the campaign trail meet onstage, at last, in the next Democratic debate. For the first time, Democratic voters will see side by side two candidates who perhaps best personify many of the ideological, gender, thematic and stylistic contrasts in their nominating race. Debate host ABC News is expected to confirm Thursday that only 10 candidates made the cut after a qualifying period that set fundraising tests and minimum polling thresholds, resulting in a single debate night for the first time in the nominating process. In the previous two rounds of double-header debates on consecutive nights, Biden and Warren were drawn apart, leaving the most intriguing emerging dynamic in the race unaddressed. Former Vice President Biden, 76, is the epitome of the Democratic establishment, a moderate, portraying his pragmatism and appeals to America\u2019s \u201cbetter angels\u201d as the key to wooing President Donald Trump\u2019s voters and beating a vulnerable incumbent in 2020. Warren, 70, a crusading reformer of the financial system, is in the same generation as Biden, who first ran for president in the 1980s, but campaigns with the relentless energy of a fresher figure on the national stage. Biden is the quintessential old-school, sentimental back-slapping politician, a former Senate bull with a trove of stories from Washington\u2019s corridors of power who is pledging to restore the civility of a pre-Trump era. Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, wants to shoulder hopes of shattering the highest glass ceiling in politics from Hillary Clinton, has a plan for every problem and is driving the liberal tide sweeping her party. The former vice president\u2019s campaign is polishing his already storied reputation as a gaffe machine. After detonating a new rhetorical landmine as he forgot just where he had spoken at Dartmouth, he told a crowd in New Hampshire: \u201cI want to be clear: I\u2019m not going nuts.\u201d As a former college professor, Warren, by contrast, is a stickler for detail. Her blitz of policy papers spawned her line \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan for that,\u201d which has become an unofficial motto of her campaign. While popular among Democrats, partly through serving as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, Biden has yet to demonstrate electric appeal among liberal base voters but may be able to call on a silent army of more moderate Democrats less active in the primary race. Warren, however, is starting to attract big crowds \u2013 including an eye-catching 15,000-strong turnout at a town hall in liberal Seattle recently. Her candidacy is a bet that Americans are ready to reject Biden-style centrism for a more radical platform on issues from student loans to climate change. Most recent national and early-voting-state polls of the Democratic race have Biden a clear front-runner and Warren consolidating her steady rise, disputing second place with Bernie Sanders. In a Quinnipiac University survey published Wednesday, Biden led with 32%, ahead of Warren with 19% and Sanders with 15%. The Biden/Warren rivalry has been building quietly for months \u2013 with differences emerging especially over health care. Biden is warning against \u201cMedicare for All\u201d options backed by Warren that could threaten the private health insurance plans of millions of Americans, and he wants to expand Obamacare and add a public Medicare option. \u201cYou worked like hell. You gave up wages for it,\u201d Biden told union members in Iowa last week, pledging they could keep their union-negotiated health insurance. Warren is warning that Democrats should not spread scare stories about people losing their insurance. \u201cWe should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that health care,\u201d Warren said at the CNN Democratic debate last month. Pre-debate buildup will highlight such differences to talk up the prospect of clashes between Biden and Warren in what could be a defining early moment of a race that is beginning to shed outsider candidates and will intensify after Labor Day. And it\u2019s possible that the candidates many analysts believe could be the last pair standing next year will decide that the time is right to throw off the gloves and fully engage. But given the early stage of the race and potentially different goals of Warren and Biden \u2013 not to mention the other eight candidates bristling for a fight, such fireworks may not erupt. \u201cI understand the inclination for that to be the hype, but I think it maybe could be a letdown \u2013 it is so tough with 10 candidates on the stage for spotlight to be on those two candidates,\u201d said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, who writes books about presidential debates. The former vice president played down expectations of a one-on-one duel with Warren in Houston. \u201cI\u2019m just going to be me and she\u2019ll be her and let people make their judgments. I have great respect for her,\u201d he told reporters in South Carolina on Wednesday. But Biden did appear to preview a possible policy duel with Warren later in the race. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to getting to the place, assuming I\u2019m still around, that it gets down to a smaller number of people so we can have more of a discussion instead of one-minute assertions,\u201d he said. One reason why the Biden vs. Warren showdown may have to wait is that Warren has yet to fully establish herself as the progressive champion in the Democratic race. Sooner or later as first votes approach next year, she will have to dispatch the challenge from Sanders if she is to move on, and her first job next month may be to appeal to supporters of the senator from Vermont. Biden has already learned that front-runners can expect attacks from all sides and will have more to worry about than just Warren. His campaign suffered an early wobble when Sen. Kamala Harris of California jabbed him on race in an earlier debate, though she has been unable to build on her resulting momentum. Biden will be keen at the September debate to step up his battle against Trump, to cement perceptions among many Democrats that he is the candidate best equipped for the general election. In an interview with black journalists on Tuesday, Biden argued he was the \u201cmost electable\u201d Democrat \u2013 and in a veiled possible swipe at Warren said his rivals might get bigger crowds or excite progressives but he has the most diverse coalition. \u201cI have never, ever, ever in my entire life had a circumstance where I have felt uncomfortable in the black community,\u201d Biden said. Both Warren and Sanders poll poorly among African American voters. Warren is trying to counter Biden\u2019s narrative that he is the strongest potential opponent for the President, declaring last week that \u201cit\u2019s not enough to be \u2018not Trump.\u2019 \u201c CNN\u2019s Arlette Saenz and Sarah Mucha contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio offered two markedly different views of the Democratic Party at CNN town halls on Sunday, providing a stark example of the political divide inside the party. Where Bullock defended his opposition to \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d de Blasio touted the sweeping health care plan. Where de Blasio talked about there not being much of a divide between rural and urban voters, Bullock pushed his ability to relate to people in rural states \u2013 like Montana \u2013 who voted for President Donald Trump. And where Bullock talked about his concerns about mandatory gun buybacks and his past opposition to universal background checks, de Blasio pledged \u2013 as president \u2013 to make gun legislation a central issue. Despite their differences, the question for both men is whether they were able to break out of their low-tier status in the Democratic race, where both Bullock and de Blasio find themselves polling under 1% in most surveys. Those results have put them as risk of missing both the September and October Democratic National Committee debates, an outcome that could imperil both campaigns. Here are the key takeaways from CNN\u2019s town halls with Bullock and de Blasio: Bullock defended his opposition to the single payer Medicare for All proposal, setting him apart from more progressive Democrats running for president like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Medicare for All would shift control over the health care system to the federal government and essentially eliminate the private insurance industry. Bullock said the \u201cgreatest stride\u201d the country has made on health care is the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care law also known as Obamacare that was signed by President Barack Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t think the best way is to start all over. I don\u2019t want to take away employer-sponsored health care,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cI look at this as an add-on, not a complete teardown.\u201d He added: \u201cThe way we get to full access and affordability isn\u2019t to start over. It\u2019s to build on what we have.\u201d New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he wants to \u201cmake sure people get health care from the beginning\u201d so patients don\u2019t turn to emergency room visits as a means of health care. His proposal: Medicare for All. \u201cThere should not be such a thing as an American who doesn\u2019t have insurance or doesn\u2019t have health care. That should be a thing of the past,\u201d de Blasio said. Where Bullock worried about costs, de Blasio argued that the plan would be cost effective because Americans would pay more in taxes but less in health care bills. And de Blasio took on some of his Democratic opponents over the issue. \u201cThis idea that, even in a lot of the Democratic Party debates, we\u2019re sort of arguing over, you know, well, we could get a little better here or a little better there. That\u2019s not what we should be talking about as Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should talk about how every American gets quality health care. Physical health care, mental health care. Quality health care when they need it. That should be the goal of this country.\u201d The New York mayor said on Sunday that the divide between urban and rural America, a rift that is seen as widening in recent years, is not as stark as most people believe. De Blasio argued that all Americans want generally the same from life, telling the audience at a CNN town hall that people in \u201crural counties\u201d and \u201cfolks who live in smaller town\u201d are asking him about \u201cliterally nearly identical (issues) to what I heard from my constituents here in the five boroughs.\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t see the divide as much as I think it\u2019s projected to all of us,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot more commonality of feeling and interest.\u201d The divide between urban and rural voters was most stark during the 2016 election, where Trump overwhelmingly won rural voters in 2016, while urban voters backed Democrat Hillary Clinton. But de Blasio said that divide is not as clear as it was on Election Day in 2016. De Blasio\u2019s answer stands in stark contrast to Bullock, who has run for president by touting himself as the best candidate to win back red states. Democrats are all but begging Bullock to run for Senate. They can stop, the governor said Sunday. \u201cSo that\u2019s an absolute no,\u201d CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota asked. \u201cThat\u2019s an absolute no,\u201d Bullock responded. As eager as Democrats are to oust Trump from office, many are worried about the US Senate, where the Democratic Party is currently in the minority. That concern has extended to the presidential race, where a number of Democrats from states with important Senate races are vying for the top job. Bullock said his issue with running for Senate are three-fold: professional, political and personal. \u201cPart of it is professional, meaning the whole time I\u2019ve served as an executive, I\u2019ve been able to bring people together to get things done. I think that\u2019s where my talents are best suited,\u201d he said. Politically, he said, he thinks it is important for the Democratic Party to better understand why it is losing states like Montana. And lastly, Bullock said, he wants to spend more time with his kids. \u201cI know President Obama had dinner with his kids a lot more than I would as a senator from Montana,\u201d Bullock concluded. Bullock blamed the National Rifle Association, an organization that he said was just a \u201cgun safety and hunting organization\u201d when he was young, for stalling any movement on gun control legislation. Bullock only came out in favor of universal background checks in 2018, far later than most Democrats, and he comes from a state with a proud culture of gun ownership and hunting. But Bullock explained on Sunday that he softened his position on guns because of the 2018 shooting at Stoneman Douglass High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead and listening to his children after the shooting. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a reason why we can\u2019t look at it as just a public health issue. In fact, I\u2019ll give you 30 million reasons. That\u2019s how much the NRA spent to make sure that Donald Trump was elected,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cWhen I was growing up, the NRA used to be a gun safety and hunting organization. Now it\u2019s a dark money field, political organization, that does nothing than drive us apart.\u201d But Bullock still opposes mandatory buy backs for assault weapons, a position that de Blasio supports. \u201cHow about we, the American people, say enough with the NRA\u2019s dominance of the Congress,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cBecause a clear majority of Americans want more extensive background checks. They want to close the gun show loophole. They want waiting periods. They want a ban on assault weapons. These things can actually happen.\u201d The death of Eric Garner at the hands of officer Daniel Pantaleo in 2014 continues to hang over de Blasio. Five years after Garner\u2019s death, Pantaleo was fired from the New York Police Department a week ago. De Blasio had blamed the Department of Justice over the handling of the case, but that explanation did not satisfy many in New York, some of whom vocally and directly protested the mayor. De Blasio looked to move past the issue on Sunday, telling CNN that the incident taught him that the city \u201chad to do pretty much everything differently.\u201d \u201cThere needs to be federal leadership that says de-escalation training, implicit bias training, body cameras, every police officer in America should have those. Every single one,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we end the tragedies.\u201d But the impact that the death continues to have on de Blasio was clear shortly after his answer when a woman in the audience faulted the mayor for Pantaleo\u2019s dismissal taking five years. \u201cWhat about Lieutenant Bannon? What about officer Ramos? What about other officers,\u201d the woman shouted. De Blasio did not answer the woman\u2019s question.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the administration is looking at possible tax cuts, but reiterated that the US economy is still growing and remains very far from a recession. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at various tax rate deductions but I\u2019m looking at that all the time \u2026 that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re in such a strong economic position. We\u2019re, right now, the No. 1 country anywhere in the world by far as an economy,\u201d Trump told press during a White House meeting with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. \u201cPayroll tax is something that we think about and a lot of people would like to see that, and that very much affects the workers of our country,\u201d Trump said, but cautioned that he\u2019s \u201cnot looking to do anything at this moment\u201d as it relates to those potential tax cuts. But despite Trump\u2019s public-facing vociferousness about the strength of the economy on his watch and aides stating they have no concerns about a recession, officials have discussed the possibility of a potential payroll tax cut to stave off anxiety over an economic slowdown in recent days. Five of the world's biggest economies are at risk. Here's where the US stands The President\u2019s robust take on the economy has been somewhat undercut in recent weeks. One indicator, the bond market yield curve inversion, went upside-down briefly last week, suggesting that a recession may be looming. And US Steel, part of the American steel industry the Trump administration has been trying to save through tariffs, has announced it would temporarily be laying off about 200 workers. Multiple senior officials told CNN they weren\u2019t aware of the payroll tax break discussions \u2013 revealing what an early stage the talks have been in. The Washington Post first reported the talks Monday. A White House official denied to CNN on Monday that the move was under consideration \u201cat this time.\u201d \u201cAs Larry Kudlow said yesterday, more tax cuts for the American people are certainly on the table, but cutting payroll taxes is not something under consideration at this time,\u201d the official said in a statement. The US has continued to see positive economic growth and a hot job market, thanks in part to Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, but that\u2019s been largely driven by consumer demand that could be dashed by a slowdown abroad. Tax policy analysts argue the timing of a payroll tax cut when unemployment is at a historic low and the economy is on solid ground would be a waste of ammunition in the event of a future downturn. \u201cThere\u2019s no economic reason for it right now. Unemployment is extremely low and the economy is slowing a little bit, but it\u2019s slowing from an artificially higher rate from the last round of tax cuts,\u201d said Benjamin Page, a senior fellow at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. During a downturn, administrations have used one-time tax credits, like former President George W. Bush did in 2001, which deployed rebate checks of up to $600 to Americans. The Trump administration would also need the support of Congress to make such a change, which analysts suggest might be difficult in the Democratically controlled House. Millions of American employees pay 6.2% of their salary in \u201cpayroll taxes,\u201d which are usually used to fund social safety net programs \u2013 such as Social Security and Medicare. It would not be the first time a sitting president has used it as a political maneuver. Former President Barack Obama, seeking reelection, signed a law in 2012 extending a payroll tax cut for workers and unemployment benefits as part of the administration\u2019s economic recovery plan following the financial crisis. Rather than paying a 6.2% payroll tax, they paid 4.2%, putting an extra $83 a month in the pockets of American workers making $50,000, for example. Payroll tax cuts, like all tax cuts, grow the deficit in the short term. But they are appealing to aides worried about a potential recession because they are widely popular and are designed to boost American spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy. \u201cA payroll tax would definitely reduce federal revenue and add to the federal deficit,\u201d Kyle Pomerleau, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, told CNN. The country\u2019s debt has been piling higher under the Trump administration in part due to a $1.5 trillion tax cut signed into law in 2017 along with a massive spending package passed by Congress. Trump promised during the 2016 election to eliminate the federal debt. The White House\u2019s Office of Management Budget has predicted that the deficit will exceed $1 trillion for the entire fiscal year, which ends on September 30. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in May had predicted a slightly smaller shortfall of $896 billion for the year, with deficits rising above $1 trillion starting in 2022.

            "article_content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a jab at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Wednesday, calling him \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d \u2013 a cutting nickname that recently prompted the Republican leader to take to the Senate floor to decry \u201cmodern-day McCarthyism.\u201d \u201cMoscow Mitch says that he is the \u2018Grim Reaper.\u2019 Imagine describing yourself as the \u2018Grim Reaper\u2019 \u2013 that he\u2019s going to bury all this legislation,\u201d Pelosi said at an event in Illinois on Wednesday. The California Democrat added the legislation her chamber has passed is \u201clive and well in the general public.\u201d In July, Republicans in the Senate blocked the advancement of election security legislation hours after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress warning of Russian election interference. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough blasted McConnell\u2019s block of the legislation, dubbing him \u201cMoscow Mitch,\u201d and Washington Post opinion columnist Dana Milbank called him a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d The comments drew a fiery McConnell to the Senate floor, saying, in part, \u201cI don\u2019t normally take the time to respond to critics in the media when they have no clue what they\u2019re talking about. But this modern-day McCarthyism is toxic and damaging because of the way it warps our entire public discourse.\u201d McConnell has previously said he believes strongly that elections should be primarily controlled by state and local authorities and not managed by Washington. He argues the federal government has already responded to the problems raised from the 2016 campaign and more does not need to be done at this time. A spokesman for McConnell, David Popp, pointed to the Senate leader\u2019s speech when asked by CNN Wednesday about Pelosi\u2019s calling McConnell \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d Popp highlighted the following passage from McConnell\u2019s floor speech: \u201cNow here we are in 2019. Again, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and the Russians seek to provoke fear and division in our country. To undermine faith in our institutions. To exacerbate our political differences until we tear ourselves apart. And, once again, it seems there are some who blindly take the bait. American pundits calling an American official treasonous because of a policy disagreement. If anything is an asset to the Russians, it is disgusting behavior like that.\u201d McConnell faces new questions after The Washington Post reported Wednesday about how one Russian company with ties to the Kremlin benefited from the lifting of economic sanctions, which McConnell aided by preventing from passing congressional efforts to keep the sanctions in place. That company then made a major investment in a project in McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky. Popp told the Post that McConnell \u201cwas not aware of any potential Russian investor before the vote.\u201d At the Wednesday event hosted by the Illinois Democratic County Chairs\u2019 Association, Pelosi touted legislation passed by her chamber that the Senate has not taken up, including legislation raising the minimum wage, addressing the climate crisis, increasing protections for sexual orientation and gender identity, strengthening election security and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. McConnell in April referred to himself as the \u201cGrim Reaper,\u201d vowing to kill what he called socialist legislation,\u00a0including the Green New Deal and \u201cMedicare For All\u201d measures. \u201cNone of that stuff is going to pass. None of it,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said at an event in his home state at the time. Pelosi on Wednesday urged the Senate to pass a pair of bills approved by the House this year aimed at strengthening gun background checks in the wake of two deadly mass shootings that killed more than 30 people in Texas and Ohio earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting since February, and now public sentiment must weigh in to save lives, to pass our bill,\u201d Pelosi said. McConnell\u00a0recently told a Kentucky radio station the Senate will put background check legislation and \u201cred flag\u201d laws \u201cfront and center\u201d when Congress reconvenes after its summer recess. McConnell made no commitments about what would come to the Senate floor.",

            "article_content": "Here are the stories our panel of top political reporters will be watching for in the week ahead, in this week\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d forecast. President Donald Trump has an important \u2013 but thankless \u2013 job to fill: US ambassador to Russia. \u201cI\u2019m watching for who will replace Jon Huntsman,\u201d Politico\u2019s Eliana Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s become a less enjoyable and perhaps less elite position in the Trump administration because of all the questions that have dogged this President about his relationship with Vladimir Putin.\u201d One candidate, Johnson said, is Stephen Biegun, Trump\u2019s current pointman on North Korea. \u201cThat says something about how the talks with North Korea are going, and perhaps that it is an even less enjoyable post than serving as the chief emissary to Russia.\u201d North Korea threatens to freeze South out of future talks Sen. Lindsey Graham kicked off a fuss last week by promising to repeal Obamacare if Trump wins reelection and Republicans take back the House. Bloomberg\u2019s Sahil Kapur said other Republicans just want the issue to go away. \u201cI spoke to several senior Republican aides who said it is unlikely to happen,\u201d Kapur said. \u201cOne of them actually texted me back a laughing face emoji when I asked about the possibility, and another one said it\u2019s just Lindsey being Lindsey. They don\u2019t want this to be the conversation, they want to stay focused on Democratic proposals on Medicare for all. They believe that\u2019s a good conversation for them.\u201d Trump will spend the next week at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, \u2013 and though he insists it\u2019s not a vacation, he\u2019ll probably have some extra time on his hands away from the White House. Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender says that\u2019s been a recipe for disaster in the past. \u201cIt was in Bedminster in 2017 that he first drafted his letter to fire James Comey, and where he threatened Kim Jong Un with \u2018fire and fury,\u2019\u201d Bender said. \u201cLast year during his summer break, he attacked LeBron James, belittled Omarosa over her book, and called for a boycott of Harley-Davidson.\u201d His aides are most likely hoping this year\u2019s break is a bit quieter. \u201cTrump\u2019s poll numbers tend to tick up a little bit when he can stay out of the news,\u201d Bender said. \u201cSo I\u2019m watching for this week is whether the President can get a little bit of R&R or if he\u2019ll continue a summer of unforced errors.\u201d Trump promotes Epstein-Clintons conspiracy theory, the latest in a pattern of baseless claims spread by President House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said this week that his committee is conducting a formal impeachment inquiry. But since there\u2019s been no official House vote authorizing it, Time\u2019s Molly Ball says there\u2019s some confusion within the Democratic caucus. \u201cThere have been some mixed signals,\u201d Ball said. \u201cDemocratic members of Congress are all back in their districts for the summer recess, and some members are kind of confused about what\u2019s going on here. \u2026 Is this some kind of clever strategy, are they trying to have it both ways by mollifying the pro-impeachment base, while at the same time not setting off the President or his allies with a big announcement.\u201d List: The 120 House Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry into Trump Nadler told CNN last week he wants his committee to decide by the end of the year whether to recommend articles of impeachment. \u201cHe\u2019s set out a very ambitious timeline,\u201d Ball said. \u201cHe wants to get some more witnesses before the committees in the fall and potentially have a vote on impeachment by the end of the year. There\u2019s some skepticism about that, and more than anything, confusion. So I think when Congress returns after Labor Day, you can expect some questions about what\u2019s actually going on. Nadler presses ahead with impeachment probe as Pelosi keeps door open And from CNN congressional correspondent Phil Mattingly: About a decade ago I got in the habit of asking lawmakers and aides what they\u2019d be watching during August recess. This time around I\u2019ve been struck by the acute, and growing, uneasiness with the state of global affairs. Among the issues raised to me the past few weeks: China, on two fronts. Trade, of course, and its posture toward unrest in Hong Kong. Iran. North Korea. South Korea and Japan, long with their own historic tensions, now with essentially frozen diplomatic relations. Police fire tear gas at pockets of protesters across Hong Kong Pakistan and India, where the Indian government\u2019s move to wipe out the autonomy of the restive - and disputed - Kashmir region, has put rival nuclear powers, and the region, on edge. Afghanistan. Peace talks continue, but so do Taliban attacks. All as the President reportedly wants US troops out by the 2020 election. ISIS. A Pentagon IG report this week said the group has \u201csolidified its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and was re-surging in Syria.\u201d Also mentioned: Turkey. Yemen. Venezuela. Brexit. As one senator summed it up to me this week: \u201cThere\u2019s just a hell of a lot going on right now that could become a much bigger problem.\u201d John Bolton heads to London for highest-ranking US visit since Boris Johnson became prime minister Now that\u2019s not to say any one of these things will escalate to the point of broader US involvement in the weeks ahead. But given the scope \u2013 and that many of these issues overlap in ways with one another \u2013 it\u2019s a good reminder: August is rarely as sedentary as the empty halls of the Capitol would make you believe.",

            "article_content": "On the night Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, the Democratic Socialists of America had about 8,000 dues-paying members. By the time the group opened its 2017 convention the next summer, its ranks had grown threefold. This past weekend, when delegates from around the country gathered here in Georgia, the number was more than double that \u2013 DSA is now home to 56,000 mostly young activists, making it the largest socialist organization in the country. More remarkable than its growth, though, is DSA\u2019s increasing presence on the electoral stage. Nearly 100 democratic socialists now hold office at almost all levels of government, from local school boards to the US Congress, where freshman Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib are at the front line of the fight over the Democratic Party\u2019s future \u2013 and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, though not directly affiliated with the group, is mounting his second campaign for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. DSA is not a political party, despite the push by some of its members to form one. But two years after delegates in Chicago debated whether, and how far, to engage in elections, it has emerged as an organizing force up and down the ballot. In March, DSA members voted overwhelmingly to endorse Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, a decision that \u2013 while hardly unexpected \u2013 represented its boldest step yet into the mainstream political forum. But in entering the current election cycle with such gusto, DSA also ramped up the internal divisions simmering within its rank and file. Many of those disputes mirror the ones facing the Democratic Party \u2013 the very party DSA is dedicated to radicalizing from the inside out. Ideology repeatedly clashed with electoral pragmatism during this year\u2019s convention, which veered between a giddy celebration of the group\u2019s previously unfathomable successes, delegates\u2019 passage of Green New Deal and open borders initiatives, and painful deliberations over how to harness its new power. Two votes during the first 24 hours of the gathering put those questions on display. The first asked what to do in the event Sanders fails to win the Democratic nomination; the second considered imposing a litmus test on candidates seeking DSA\u2019s national endorsement. The results were, in effect, a split decision. On Friday, delegates narrowly passed a proposal that will prevent DSA from backing anyone but Sanders in the next presidential race. The argument in favor was simple: DSA is a socialist organization and risked spoiling its authority on the left by publicly backing \u2013 as Andrew Sernatinger, a delegate from Wisconsin, argued \u2013 \u201ca candidate that is a neoliberal that is not what we are for.\u201d \u201cAll I\u2019m saying in this resolution is we\u2019re not going to endorse another Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t vote for whoever you want to vote for, do what you need to do.\u201d The arguments against \u2013 voiced on the convention floor \u2013 centered as much on timing as substance. \u201cTrump is just too dangerous for us to take cards off the table right now,\u201d said David Duhalde, DSA\u2019s former deputy director, who more recently worked as the political director for the Sanders-backing group Our Revolution. The resolution passed by a narrow majority, but there was more audible grumbling than gloating afterward. On Saturday morning, as the backlash built up online, the group put out a statement reminding reporters that while it did not endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016, DSA had \u201cadopted a strategy to \u2018Dump Trump\u2019 in swing states.\u201d For DSA\u2019s senior leadership, the growing pains highlighted during the three days of often-protracted debate and parliamentary wrangling in Atlanta are a price they seem willing to pay \u2013 a natural outgrowth, national director Maria Svart argued, of their commitment to democratic organizing. \u201cSome organizations are just debate societies and some organizations go out and canvass for whoever the candidate is. We actually want to change the system,\u201d Svart told CNN. \u201cWe want to transform our relationship to the capitalist class; we are doing something new. And so there\u2019s going to be tension between pragmatism and idealism. But that\u2019s what\u2019s actually beautiful about DSA, is we figure out how to have that balance in any given moment based on the conditions.\u201d Like many others in and around the convention, Lucie Macias, from the Chicago DSA chapter that has helped elect six democratic socialists to a city council of 50, said the vote shouldn\u2019t be read as a blanket rejection of any future nominee. \u201cI think an organizational endorsement is very different than what people are doing as individuals. A lot of times people just throw this out, that we didn\u2019t support Hillary,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t canvass for Hillary personally, but I voted for her.\u201d In private conversations outside the convention hall, most delegates said they would vote, and potentially canvass, for Elizabeth Warren if she were the nominee. Some expressed a genuine affection for the senator from Massachusetts. But others, pointing to her identification as a capitalist, suggested their openness was rooted in a recognition that being viewed as \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d would alienate potential allies. The organization\u2019s already growing numbers have thrust it into the crosshairs of mainstream Democratic politics, where anything short of a pledge to unreservedly back the party\u2019s eventual nominee is a nonstarter. Sanders, the country\u2019s best-known democratic socialist, has repeatedly said he will support the Democratic primary winner \u2013 no matter who it is. On Saturday, during a news conference with about 20 elected officials from around the country, including a number from traditionally Republican strongholds, there was a mix of tough talk and cautious reminders that Trump\u2019s reelection would undermine both the organization\u2019s short- and long-term goals. City councilman khalid kamau, of South Fulton, Georgia, warned that the tone of the argument over democratic socialism during the Democratic debates risked alienating DSA\u2019s super-charged activists. \u201cYou can\u2019t disparage socialism in this primary and come back six months from now and ask us to vote-blue-no-matter-who,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s my warning to the Democratic establishment.\u201d But there was near consensus among the elected leaders that even if Sanders falls short, defeating Trump should be DSA\u2019s first priority \u2013 no matter what strategy it chose. \u201cThe role for DSA in 2020 is to un-elect the individual that\u2019s occupying the Oval Office right now,\u201d Maryland state Del. Gabriel Acevero told CNN. Chicago Alderman Daniel La Spata, who represents the city\u2019s 1st Ward, said that \u201cputting an end to the Trump administration is the greatest good that we can pursue. And I hope that we will put all of our power behind that.\u201d But the dedication \u2013 or inflexibility \u2013 among the slim majority of delegates who voted to forswear formally backing anyone but Sanders next year found a counterbalance when the questions facing the convention turned to local races. The resolution to create a \u201clitmus test\u201d for national endorsements, which are filtered up from the local chapters, failed narrowly on Saturday after an organizer from the host state made an impassioned plea to the delegates. The proposed 14-point questionnaire was mostly uncontroversial, at least to any candidate who would seek DSA\u2019s support, asking whether they support single-payer \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d universal tuition-free child care and the Green New Deal. But the deal breaker, ultimately, was its requirement that candidates declare themselves \u201cdemocratic socialists\u201d \u2013 a designation the Georgia-based delegate warned would \u201ccut our legs out from under us in the South.\u201d \u201cWhat I see is forcing our candidates into a death sentence,\u201d the delegate said, \u201cbecause we have people who don\u2019t understand what socialism is here yet. We need people who are going to endorse our values even if they are not willing to say explicitly they are democratic socialists.\u201d Tristan Rader, a city council member in Lakewood, Ohio, applauded the convention\u2019s decision to vote down the litmus test. \u201cI come from a very blue city that voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, voted for Hillary overwhelmingly. I have no problems being an out democratic socialist running as a democratic socialist,\u201d Rader said afterward. \u201cIn my city, that works. Other places in Ohio that may not work. (Candidates) may share those values, but there may be some reservations about using some of that language, and local chapters should absolutely be able to set their parameters and make good decisions based on where they are in the country.\u201d Duhalde, the former DSA No. 2, also opposed the resolution. He pointed to DSA\u2019s increasing size and worries that circumscribing its pool of candidates would do the same to its influence and ability to back officials like Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who would have been disqualified from seeking a DSA endorsement if the resolution passed. \u201cRep. Omar has been such a fantastic representative, and so under attack, and then for DSA not to be able to support her, I think it\u2019s changing a lot of opinions,\u201d Duhalde said. \u201cHer as an almost symbolic force, in many ways, is making people reconsider whether that label really matters.\u201d",

            "article_content": "First things first: The theme song of the week is the theme from The NBA on CBS. Poll of the week: A new Kaiser Family Foundation poll finds 55% of Democrats and Democratic leaning independents say they want to build on the Affordable Care Act when asked which approach to health care they prefer. That\u2019s far larger than the 39% who say they want to replace the ACA with a national \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan. This matches polling from earlier this year which demonstrated a majority of Democrats would prefer to take a more incremental approach to health care. What\u2019s the point: Perhaps the biggest news coming out of this week\u2019s CNN presidential debates was the seeming criticism of former President Barack Obama\u2019s policies while in office. It was a stunning turn because anyone looking at the polling data can see that Obama and many of his policies (such as the ACA) remain popular. Democratic candidates who go after Obama too hard risk losing support in the primary and the general election. Beyond the poll numbers above on the ACA, take a look at Obama\u2019s favorable rating since he left office. Among potential Democratic primary voters, a 2017 Pew Research Center poll found that Obama\u2019s approval rating stood at 95%. A 2018 CNN poll put his favorable rating among self-identified Democrats at 97%. A May 2019 CBS News/YouGov poll showed that a grand total of 2% of Democrats rated Obama\u2019s presidency as \u201cpoor.\u201d A near unanimous 91% told CBS News/YouGov that it was good or excellent. When pitted against other past presidents since World War II, Obama\u2019s clearly the most popular among potential Democratic primary voters. A Quinnipiac poll taken last year found that 44% said Obama was the best. The second closest, Bill Clinton, came in far in back at just 14%. All of these numbers are even starker among black Democrats. Obama\u2019s favorable rating among them stood at 99% in a 2017 Pew poll His unfavorable rating was 0%. A clear majority of 57% said he was the best president since World War II in the Quinnipiac poll. Obama\u2019s ongoing popularity among black Democrats partially helps explain why former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s has such strong support from them. Biden has cited Obama\u2019s name so often you might think Obama was running with him again. It seems to be paying off for Biden \u2013 a recent Quinnipiac University poll has him winning 53% of the black vote in the primary. You can see how being attached to Obama directly helps Biden through a question asked by Monmouth University in May. Biden took 44% of the primary vote among those who said it was very important for the Democratic nominee to build on Obama\u2019s legacy. No other candidate had greater than 15% support. Biden\u2019s vote share fell to 25% among those who said it wasn\u2019t very important build on Obama\u2019s legacy. Democrats who critique Obama could be doing harm to themselves among the general electorate as well. Obama remains one of the few Democrats popular among voters the party\u2019s nominee likely needs to win in order to take back the White House. In a national CNN poll last year, 55% of voters said they thought Obama was a better president than Donald Trump. That was far above the 39% who said Trump was better than Obama. Blistering criticism of Obama highlights dramatic shift inside Democratic Party Of course, elections in this country are won on the state level \u2013 and Obama is popular in the important states. In the 2017 Pew poll, 57% of voters said they had a favorable view of Obama in a combined sample of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which he won in 2008 and 2012. These were the three closest states that Trump won in 2016 and would have put Hillary Clinton over the top in the Electoral College, had she taken them. When candidates go after Obama from the left, it could be seen as especially dangerous electorally speaking. Trump is already trying to make the Democrats be seen as too far from the center. Going after one of the few popular Democrats for not being far enough left helps make Trump\u2019s case for him. Democrats would be wise to spend most of their energy going after Trump \u2013 something Biden has strived to do \u2013 than anything related to Obama. Trump remains massively unpopular with Democrats and beating him is still a very high priority for Democratic primary voters.",

            "article_content": "South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was probably right Tuesday night when he said said that no matter what kind of agenda Democrats adopt, Republicans and President Donald Trump are \u201cgonna say we\u2019re a bunch of crazy socialists.\u201d Pete Buttigieg: \"It's time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say. It's true if we embrace a far-left agenda, they're gonna say we're a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda...they\u2019re gonna say we're a bunch of crazy socialists.\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rNx3Ki8Ftz Trump has transmitted that strategy in his tweets and rallies even though Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is the only avowed democratic socialist in the presidential race and on Wednesday he took a cue from Buttigieg, tweeting \u201cThe lesser of two Socialists is still a Socialist!\u201d which he attributed to Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. This will be a recurring theme as Democrats sort through their large primary field. Hickenlooper: Warren and Sanders are demonizing business Former Colorado Gov. John  Hickenlooper, a more moderate Democrat, said the word capitalist has \u201cgotten a negative connotation\u201d among Democrats and warned in an interview after the debate that his more progressive colleagues were \u201cdemonizing business in America.\u201d He said solving health care and climate change problems will require business working with government. Elizabeth Warren, who has just as many big ideas to increase the role of government in Americans\u2019 lives, swears she\u2019s a capitalist. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked her if that\u2019s her \u201cway of saying you\u2019re a safer choice than Sen. Sanders.\u201d \u201cNope,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s my way of talking about I know how to fight and I know how to win.\u201d Not all of the policy disputes onstage Tuesday were precisely debates over socialism, although that\u2019s how Trump and Republicans will portray them. They are debates about what the government should do for people, and there is a very real and important conversation going on in US politics right now about whether the US system of government and economy are working, and what can be done about it. It is certainly true that on the debate stage, Democrats split into distinct camps on how much more government should do for Americans on a variety of topics. Hickenlooper, asked at the debate about his warnings against socialism in a recent Facebook ad, returned the conversation to health care. \u201cI\u2019m saying the policies of this notion that you\u2019re going to take private insurance away from 180 million Americans who many of them don\u2019t want to give it,\u201d he said, would be a \u201cdisaster at the ballot box and you might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump.\u201d Sanders, who later threw up his arms in frustration at the charge, argued that he had won Democratic primaries in swing states like Michigan and that he could beat Trump. Hickenlooper argued not that something like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d is not likely to pass through the Senate, which it isn\u2019t, but that people won\u2019t accept massive new programs. \u201cI think if we\u2019re going to force Americans to make these radical changes, they\u2019re not going to go along,\u201d he said. John Delaney, a wealthy businessman and former congressman from Maryland who has run on the fringe of the campaign, joined relative moderates like Hickenlooper, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota in arguing not just that some of the progressive proposals backed by Sanders and Warren are not feasible, but also that they\u2019re wrong. Sanders and Warren want to end private health insurance in the US, believing that the government can do a better job. Sanders wrote the Medicare for All proposal \u2013 which would put every American, whether they want it or not, on a government-run health insurance plan \u2013 because, as he said, health care should be a right for everyone and private plans would be outlawed. Warren helped him make the case. \u201cThe basic profit model of an insurance company is taking as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage. That is not working for Americans,\u201d she said. But the plan goes too far, according to others on the stage. \u201cWhen we created Social Security we didn\u2019t say pensions were illegal,\u201d said Delaney, making the argument that the private sector and the government should both have roles in health care. \u201cAt the end of the day I won\u2019t support any plan that rips away quality health care from individuals,\u201d said Bullock. Warren argued that Republicans like Trump who have endorsed ending Obamacare without a replacement are closer to taking health care away. \u201cWe are the Democrats,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not about trying to to take away health care from anyone. That\u2019s what the Republicans are trying to do. And we should stop using Republican talking points.\u201d Delaney and Warren also disagreed over Warren\u2019s plan to pay for her proposals with a tax on wealth. Currently, the federal government taxes income and other things but does not track or tax individual wealth. Warren would create a new 2% tax on fortunes over $50 million. She turned to Delaney and said he could keep all the money he had under that amount, but for each dollar over, he\u2019d have to pay 2 cents. Delaney said he has no problem taxing the wealthy, but he questioned whether the government should or would be able to track and tax fortunes in that way. They had a similar scrape over trade deals, when Delaney argued in favor of agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was pushed by President Barack Obama but killed by Trump. Warren, who opposed the plan, said the US should use trade deals to raise standards for workers worldwide. \u201cFor decades we have had a trade policy that has been written by multinational corporations to help multinational corporations,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have no loyalty to America. They have no patriotism. If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, they would do it in a heartbeat.\u201d Delaney said the US can\u2019t isolate itself from the world market. Marianne Williamson, the self-help author running an outsider bid, said in her opening statement that the entire US economy needs to be rethought. \u201cIt is time for a generation of Americans to rise up again for an amoral economic system has turned short-term profits for huge multinational corporations into a false god,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the well-being of we the American people and the people of the world and the planet on which we live.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates have dragged their party to a defining ideological crossroads as they wrestle for a strategy to defeat Donald Trump. At Tuesday night\u2019s debate in Detroit hosted by CNN, east coast progressive icons Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders warned against \u201cspineless\u201d moderation, selling \u201cbig ideas\u201d of generational reform on health care, the economy and climate. Heartland moderates like Montana\u2019s Steve Bullock and John Hickenlooper of Colorado hit out at \u201cwish list\u201d economics and liberal pipe dreams that would \u201cFedEx the election\u201d to the GOP. At the end of the night, a key question lingered: Is most of America ready for the radical social and political change the most progressive Democrats are offering? Warren offered the most compelling answer to that question. \u201cI get it \u2013 there is a lot at stake and people are scared,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else.\u201d The theme will be refreshed in Wednesday\u2019s second debate when the most popular moderate \u2013 front-runner Joe Biden \u2013 will make a case that he is the most electable potential rival for Trump in a bid to bounce back from a shaky first debate in June. The first of CNN\u2019s two debates on successive nights in Detroit dramatically exemplified the crackling political energy inside the Democratic Party as the 2020 race hits a frenetic pace. Instead of choreographed put downs and viral spats between rivals, the evening evolved into a passionate policy seminar on proposals and plans that if implemented could fundamentally realign life in America. How the country \u2013 especially its crucial political middle interprets \u2013 Tuesday\u2019s debate and the political combat to come, could end up deciding who lives in the White House after January 2021. Before the next debates in September, the crowded field of 20 candidates could be halved by tightened polling and fundraising thresholds. But Tuesday\u2019s debate showed this is an ideological struggle will endure all the way to the convention next year. Unapologetic progressives like Warren and Sanders sense that the audacious move right by the Trump presidency and the economic forces that birthed it offer an opening for a new liberal dawn. \u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone goes to the trouble to run for president to talk about what we can\u2019t do and what we won\u2019t fight for,\u201d Warren said. Sanders, her biggest rival for the primary\u2019s left lane who has long advocated a \u201crevolution,\u201d said, \u201cI get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas.\u201d But more pragmatic Democrats fear that radical ideas like single payer healthcare and a Green New Deal play into Trump\u2019s warnings of socialism and would scare off moderate voters and replicate the most haunting Democratic defeats of the past. \u201cWe can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us, which is with bad policies like Medicare for All, free everything, and impossible promises,\u201d said former Maryland Rep. John Delaney. \u201cThat will turn off independent voters and get Trump reelected. That\u2019s what happened with McGovern, that\u2019s what happened with Mondale, that\u2019s what happened with Dukakis.\u201d This is a debate that gets to the core of the modern Democratic Party itself. Should it hark back the New Deal and Great Society policy monuments of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson \u2013 who signed Medicare into law 54 years ago to the day Tuesday \u2013 or is the path back to power a recognition that in an age dominated by conservatives, the gentler more incremental and centrist progressivism of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama? This is the fault line that exemplified by progressives who want to do away with private health insurance in a Medicare for All system and moderates who prefer a hybrid system akin to Obamacare. History suggests that Democrats will take a huge bet if they chose the path of Warren and Sanders: No Democrat in recent memory has won the White House on such a radical platform. As Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar put it after stepping off stage: \u201cI tried to make the case over and over tonight. \u2026 People are watching right now (and) they aren\u2019t Democrat or independent.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re moderate Republicans and we need to win them to win the election,\u201d Klobuchar told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. Yet there was a reason why Warren and Sanders were in the center of the stage on Tuesday \u2013 they are the most popular of the 10 candidates in the first debate. They represent the powerful liberal forces that are taking the Democratic far to the left of where Obama left it. The most fascinating question in the Democratic race is whether a liberal uprising that progressive candidates sense is in fact evolving in the country out of sight of the Beltway pundits. After all, Washington is often the last to know about looming political revolutions \u2013 Trump\u2019s 2016 victory is proof of that. Trump has already seized on the ideological ferment in the Democratic primary, portraying the most progressive contenders as out of control radicals emblematic of a party that is charging fast to the left. \u201cSame radical Democrats. Same big government socialist message. Same winner of tonight\u2019s debate: President Donald Trump,\u201d said Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary of the Trump campaign. It is comments like that that have many pundits warning that only by sticking to the center can Democrats build the broad coalition needed to beat Trump. But Warren cautioned moderate opponents in the debate to avoid using \u201cRepublican talking points\u201d to fault her policies on health care. And Sanders argued in a CNN interview that Democrats can only succeed by driving out a huge grassroots turnout that only ultra-progressive policies could stir. By definition, Tuesday\u2019s debate took placed in a controlled environment. Many of the most progressive ideas advocated by Sanders and Warren \u2013 a state-run health care system \u2013 have no chance of being implemented unless Democrats rack up huge and unlikely majorities in Congress as well as wining the White House. That\u2019s an argument for a less ambitious approach that may not alienate centrist voters and give the GOP such fodder. Another imponderable ahead of the election is whether voters will embrace a policy heavy candidacy or will respond to broad themes and atmospherics. This was a point made by outsider candidate Marianne Williamson in the first Democratic debates last month, when she suggested Trump won in 2016 because of the clarity of his slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d On Tuesday, the self-help guru argued that the Democratic policy pageant could leave the rest of the country cold. \u201cThe entire conversation that we\u2019re having here tonight, if you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this President is bringing up in this country, then I\u2019m afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days,\u201d she said. One Democrat on stage on Tuesday, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, argued that clarity of leadership and conviction was just as important as the party\u2019s ideological positioning. \u201cIt is time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that if we embrace a far left agenda, they are going to say we are a bunch of crazy socialists.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just stand up for the right policy and go out there and defend it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Watch the Democratic presidential debates on CNN and CNNGo at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, July 30, and Wednesday, July 31. The skills Kamala Harris honed during her years as a prosecutor will once again put her in the spotlight when she takes the stage on Wednesday for CNN\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Detroit. Harris\u2019 argument that she can \u201cprosecute the case\u201d against Donald Trump is at the core of her bid for the Democratic nomination, and the California senator will once again try to use the debate stage to prove that her years in the courtroom have readied her to spar with the President in a general election matchup. Aides who have worked with her over the years note that she has methodically prepped for these moments \u2013 either on the debate stage or in a US Senate hearing room \u2013 by diving into her briefing books, and then working her way down to an outline of each issue as she crafts what she thinks would be the most effective argument. Harris often presses her team to help her anticipate her opponent\u2019s arguments \u2013 or the potential holes in the testimony of her witnesses. She shows a touch of superstition by always making sure there is pizza during debate prep, because that\u2019s been her team\u2019s tradition throughout all of her campaigns. After the debates, one aide recalled that she buys the first round of drinks for staff members who helped her prepare, even if she heads out early to bed. Longtime confidantes Debbie Mesloh and Suzy Loftus note that meticulous preparation comes in part from the influence of her mother, who was a scientist and breast cancer researcher. Loftus and Mesloh, who both worked with Harris when she was a prosecutor in California, said the Democrat always wanted to make sure the team would \u201cdo the math\u201d on why her proposals might work better than those of her opponents so she was ready to counter their arguments. That instinct to carefully think through her answers has sometimes tripped her up in the lightning fast arena of 2020 presidential politics. She was criticized after her April CNN town hall with Jake Tapper for not having a ready answer on several policy questions. She sidestepped a question about felon voting rights, for example, by saying, \u201cI think we should have that conversation.\u201d Harris has also been chided for being difficult to pin down on policy questions like whether she would do away private health insurance as part of her support for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d She clarified that point when she released her Medicare for All plan Monday morning, with private plans being phased out over time. After all that strenuous preparation, California\u2019s junior senator made it a point to build in some time away from the briefing books while in the Motor City, heading out for a date night with her husband Douglas Emhoff to see MAXWELL at The Aretha amphitheater on Detroit\u2019s riverfront. Hinting at either her sweet tooth or pre-debate nerves, the candidate appeared to be arming her team for long nights this week \u2013 ordering an entire lemon velvet cake and one of every kind of pound cake, along with an iced caramel mocha latte, from a Detroit cake shop she visited on Monday. When asked about her mission for CNN\u2019s debate in Detroit this week, she laughed. \u201cTo not mess up,\u201d she said. That was not a problem in the first primary debate for the former district attorney of San Francisco \u2013 who prosecuted crimes like rape, homicide, battery and assault in the early days of her career in Alameda County \u2013 as she took command of the stage early in Miami, winning applause when she admonished the other candidates not to allow the forum to turn into \u201ca food fight.\u201d Kamala Harris shines in commanding Democratic debate performance She was calm, controlled and unflustered. With the audience as her jury, she wove her personal story so effectively into her critique of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s record opposing desegregation busing that he looked almost crestfallen, and abruptly broke off his answer by saying his time was up. Like previous presidential candidates who were practiced in executing their arguments before judges and juries \u2013 former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards are prime examples \u2013 there is no question that Harris\u2019 courtroom experience has given her an advantage in forums where there are nearly a dozen Democratic candidates on stage. Harris\u2019 former colleagues and friends have watched these debates and her prosecutorial interrogations in the Senate with a sense of anticipation, knowing that she is trained to excel in this arena. Loftus, a prosecutor who worked with Harris both while she was district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general, noted that some Americans watched in surprise as her former boss picked apart witnesses during Senate hearings. But Loftus knew better, saying that Harris\u2019 methodical questioning style had been honed by years in the courtroom. \u201cA prosecutor\u2019s training is to be prepared and know the answer to every question before it\u2019s asked,\u201d said Loftus, who is now running to be the district attorney of San Francisco. While watching Harris interrogate Attorney General William Barr, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Loftus remembered facing that same skeptical gaze and unsparing questioning from Harris. \u201cShe\u2019s intense to be questioned by,\u201d Loftus said. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the other side of being questioned by her, so there\u2019s an aspect of sympathy or empathy I have for some of them. The truth is, she\u2019s also supremely fair, but you\u2019re not going to get away with hedging or equivocating.\u201d Aggressively challenging Biden, the Democratic front-runner, in the first debate was a risky gambit for Harris, but it paid off. She benefited not only from the element of surprise, but also that Biden seemed totally unprepared to defend his own record. But now Harris enters the second debate with the added pressure of matching that first debate performance. Biden is clearly eager to move beyond his shaky performance, as many Democratic voters wonder whether he\u2019s up for the challenge of facing Trump or if he\u2019s gotten too soft, as several voters put it in recent interviews. \u201cPeople look at these debates like gladiator contests \u2013 they\u2019re trying to find out who the best person is,\u201d said Brett O\u2019Donnell, a veteran Republican debate coach who said Harris clearly had the best performance of any of the Democrats over the course of two nights in Miami last month. \u201cAggression is good because it\u2019s used to judge who their champion is. The Democratic Party wants to win, so they are looking for the person who can go into the arena with Donald Trump.\u201d The ability to counter-punch is particularly important to Democrats this cycle because party activists watched so many traditional Republican candidates crumble under Trump\u2019s attacks during the 2016 primaries, and as his eventual Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton struggled to get her message through the bluster and bravado that defined Trump\u2019s campaign. The importance of the Harris-Biden exchange in Miami \u2013 though it only took a few minutes \u2013 was evident in a weeks-long surge following the debate, when Harris saw a jump in both in her poll numbers and in donations to her campaign. \u201cTrump is so unconventional and he\u2019s very aggressive in debates,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cThe Democrats saw what happened to those other Republicans on the stage when they tried to stay conventional, and I think they know they\u2019ve got to have someone who is going to be able to break through that convention and go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump.\u201d",

The union, which endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden days after he entered the 2020 race, made its position clear in a letter sent to each of the Democratic contenders last week. \u201cThe International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), our 317,000 members and millions of others with quality, employer-provided healthcare do not support the concept of abandoning those plans for a government-run single-payer plan,\u201d Harold Schaitberger, general president of the IAFF, wrote in the letter. \u201cThe elimination of employer-based insurance in favor of a Medicare-for-all or government-run single-payer proposal is a bad idea that punishes working families who have secured quality healthcare.\u201d This position sets the union at odds with Medicare for All backers like Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The union\u2019s stance tracks more closely with Biden, whose plan preserves the current health care system but provides a Medicare-like option for individuals to buy into while keeping private and employer-sponsored insurance. In an interview with CNN, Schaitberger said the union has developed and negotiated health care coverage unique to its members that it does not want to see scrapped. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a record of supporting health care for every American, for everyone, but not at the expense of the plans that we have developed and negotiated over time and again,\u201d Schaitberger said. \u201cWith our profession and the type of injuries and the type of disease and the level of cancers and the level of behavioral health and post-traumatic stress, we have plans that we depend on that will assure coverage for those occurrences.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are not going to chance a government-run for Medicare for All plan that\u2019s somehow going to provide coverage for everyone and it\u2019s going to encompass the unique and special needs that our profession has not only earned and we developed.\u201d A recent CNN poll found 85% of Democrats favor a government-run health care plan, but only 30% of Democrats say a national program should completely replace private insurance. Schaitberger said health care will be a \u201ccore issue\u201d for the union in the upcoming election and argued it would be hard to support a nominee whose plan eliminates employer-based health care plans, saying, \u201cIt would be a huge disincentive at best.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As the 2020 Democrats fan out across the country trying to convince voters they would be better shepherds of the US economy than President Donald Trump, some Democrats like former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm are questioning whether they are connecting with the voters of the industrial Midwest who believe Trump is fighting for them. During the \u201cCitizen by CNN\u201d event Sunday night in downtown Detroit \u2014 where CNN will host Democratic debates on Tuesday and Wednesday, Granholm, a CNN contributor, noted that Trump won states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in part by vowing to undo unpopular trade deals and bring industry back to the US. \u201cPeople who are in blue collar jobs feel like at least he\u2019s trying something, right? That is the challenge for Democrats. Because what he\u2019s trying is actually not working,\u201d she said. \u201cThose stories, they need to be brought out because what he\u2019s doing is ineffective and worse, it\u2019s hurting workers. But Democrats have got to be able to make that case.\u201d The 5 candidates with the most to lose in this week's debates CNN interviews with voters in swing states across the country suggest that some of the leading Democrats could face two central problems as they look ahead to the general election contest in 15 months: one, most American voters are far more moderate than the far-left activists the candidates are courting to win the primary, and two, many Americans feel positive about the economy. It is the one bright spot in Trump\u2019s abysmal poll numbers, and clearly a factor that is bolstering his approval rating. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from this month had Trump\u2019s approval rating among voters nationwide at 45% with a disapproval rating of 52%. In a CNN poll from June, 52% of voters approved of how Trump is handling the economy. The ideological gap between leading Democratic candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris \u2014 with their full-throated support of Medicare for All, for example \u2013 and the more centrist views of many moderate Democrats and independents, is especially pronounced here in the industrial Midwest. Bernie Sanders leads caravan into Canada to purchase cheaper insulin with American prices rising In this union stronghold, many workers fought for their health care benefits over many years and are skeptical of the dramatic changes that a Medicare for All system would bring. While 90% of Democrats surveyed in a new Marist College poll say they want a health care system in which private insurers and a public option exist, only 64% of Democrats say Medicare for All is a good idea. Though the economy is showing signs of slowing \u2013 particularly in the auto industry, which is the backbone of the Michigan economy \u2013 there is also little evidence in public polling that voters are feeling that pain. 'Motors, mortgages and pizzas:' Here's why Detroit is on a rebound Seven in ten voters polled by CNN in June said they believed the economy was in good shape. In Michigan, the Brooking Institution\u2019s Mark Muro points out that overall employment is growing slower than the nation \u2013 1% versus 1.5% across America. But Muro, who has closely followed the economic trends here, notes that manufacturing actually lost ground in Michigan year over year after Trump was elected. \u201cMichigan is going to be a place to watch because the trends are generally going sideways on employment, and the state is so linked to the auto industry,\u201d Muro said. Of the three battlegrounds \u2013 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2013 Muro said: \u201cMichigan is going to be the one that\u2019s most important to watch, because it is showing more slowing than the others and is susceptible to further slowing in auto.\u201d",

            "article_content": "After calling on his 2020 Democratic opponents to reject money from insurance and drug companies, Sen. Bernie Sanders will return donations he received that violate that pledge, his campaign said Thursday. The pledge, announced on Wednesday, calls on 2020 campaigns to refuse \u201ccontributions over $200 from the PACs, lobbyists, or executives of health insurance or pharmaceutical companies,\u201d except for \u201crank-and-file workers employed by pharmaceutical giants,\u201d according to a campaign statement. \u201cIt seems to me that if we are going to break the stranglehold of corporate interests over the health care needs of the American people, we have got to confront a Washington culture that is corrupt that puts profits ahead of the needs of the people,\u201d Sanders said during a speech on his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal in Washington, DC. \u201cI am calling on every Democratic candidate in this election to join me in rejecting money from the insurance and drug companies,\u201d Sanders added. A CNN review of the campaign\u2019s publicly available donation history found the campaign has received at least six contributions of more than $200 from donors who did not list their official titles when giving money, but whose job descriptions contradict the pledge put forth by Sanders. After those donations were brought to the Sanders camp\u2019s attention, the campaign quickly announced it would return these donations and any others that do not align with the pledge. \u201cAs done previously, we will be donating any contribution that does not meet the parameters of the pledge to groups combating the health care crisis created by the insurance and pharmaceutical industries,\u201d campaign national press secretary Sarah Ford told CNN. \u201cThis pledge was launched yesterday with our full knowledge that some money may need to be returned,\u201d Ford added. How to watch CNN's live debate drawing One of the donors whose money violates the pledge is Lynn McRoy, who listed her job title as \u201cmedical director\u201d from Pfizer when she made her donations. McRoy is the vice president and global medical lead on breast cancer at Pfizer, according to LinkedIn. McRoy made seven donations in 2019, five of which were more than the $200 limit. Pfizer is on Sanders\u2019 list of pharmaceutical companies not to accept donations from. Another donor was Schiffon Wong, who was listed as \u201cresearcher\u201d at EMD Serono on the FEC form. She is the executive director, global evidence and value Development at the company, according to LinkedIn, which is part of Merck kGaA, both of which are companies on Sanders\u2019 list not to take money from. Wong donated $1,000. Fact check: Joe Biden misleads with claim that Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan would cause a 'hiatus' The donations by McRoy and Wong were first reported by ABC. McRoy and Wong did not immediately return a request from comment from CNN. Ford pointed out that these donations were only six out of 2 million, noting the donors did not accurately report their executives titles on their donation forms. \u201cIt is on the donor to accurately report their titles,\u201d Ford told CNN.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is making a very big bet on the status quo. That\u2019s true for his 2020 presidential campaign generally (his argument is that Donald Trump\u2019s election is a fever dream from which the GOP \u2013 and the country \u2013 will awake) but especially true on the issue that has proven decisive in a majority of elections in recent memory: Health care. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! On Monday, Biden rolled out his health care plan which, while it does many new-ish things, is best described as Obamacare Plus. Biden\u2019s plan takes the Affordable Care Act as its foundational principle and builds from there. So there is more money to lower the cost of purchasing insurance \u2013 and a public option similar to Medicare for those who want it. But there is not much that\u2019s radical in the Biden proposal, nothing coming anywhere close to the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal, which would eliminate the private insurance industry (and the ACA) in favor of a health care system run entirely by the government, supported by at least two of his main rivals for the 2020 Democratic nod. \u201cWe should not be starting from scratch,\u201d Biden said in New Hampshire on Sunday. \u201cWe should be building from what we have. There\u2019s no time to wait.\u201d And in a video released Monday morning to accompany his health care proposal, Biden noted that in the first Democratic debate last month he made clear he opposed getting rid of private health insurance. \u201cI believe we have to protect and build on Obamacare,\u201d Biden said in the video. \u201cI understand the appeal of \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare. And I\u2019m not for that.\u201d Within hours, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the author the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation, which is supported by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.) among others in the 2020 race, hit back at Biden\u2019s plan. Tweeted Sanders: \u201cI fought to improve and pass Obamacare. I traveled all over the country to fight the repeal of Obamacare. But I will not be deterred from ending the corporate greed that creates dysfunction in our health care system. We must pass Medicare for All.\u201d (The Sanders tweet included a video of Barack Obama calling Medicare for All a \u201cgood new idea.\u201d) Biden\u2019s willingness to stand up against the Medicare for All forces is a gamble, yes, but it is a calculated one based on a bevy of polling that seems to suggest the former vice president\u2019s positioning on the issue is the most popular approach. A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been tracking views of the ACA for years now, affirms the Biden position. The ACA is viewed favorably by 46% of the country while 40% have an unfavorable view of the law. (Obamacare\u2019s favorable numbers have outpaced its unfavorable ones since almost the minute the former president left office.) Among Democrats, the law is even more popular; 79% view it favorably while just 12% regard it unfavorably. Kaiser also asked Democratic and Democratic-leaning respondents what specific part of the health care debate they wanted the 2020 candidates to address in the first debates of the presidential campaign. (The poll came out last month, just before the two-night extravaganza in Miami.) More than a quarter \u2013 28% \u2013 said that lowering the cost of health care was what they wanted to hear from the candidates most about. About half that number (15%) said they wanted to hear the candidates discuss implementing a single-payer or Medicare for All system. Importantly \u2013 and potentially problematically for Biden \u2013 that question broke down along ideological lines. Among self-identified liberals, 23% said they wanted to hear more from the candidates about implementing Medicare for All. That number was just 9% among moderates. The coming (or maybe it\u2019s already here) health care fight in the 2020 Democratic race is indicative of the broader scuffle within the party between incremental and radical change. Biden has proudly embraced the view that Trump\u2019s presidency requires not a blowing up of the political system but rather a reinvestment in it by good-hearted public servants. Sanders and Warren (and, sort of, Harris) believe that Trump\u2019s presidency is a feature, not a glitch of Republican politics \u2013 and that the only response to these four years of Trump is to destroy the very political system that allowed him to be elected president. Biden\u2019s message is one that Republicans fear could lure many of their voters \u2013 already wary of Trump \u2013 in a general election. And almost all general election polling done in the race suggest the former vice president is not only the strongest potential Democratic nominee against the incumbent but would start that race with a statistically significant lead. But his problem may be \u2013 emphasis on may be \u2013 that in a Democratic primary, particularly in the year 2020 and with Donald Trump sitting in the White House, the party\u2019s most active voters want to support candidates advocating for massive, structural change rather than incremental fixes. Biden\u2019s belief is that there won\u2019t be enough of those big change voters to cancel out the incrementalists \u2013 on health care or in the race more generally. Like I said, it\u2019s a big gamble \u2013 and one that if he bets wrong could well cost him the nomination.",

            "article_content": "Two Republican-appointed judges hearing a Trump-backed challenge to Obamacare strongly suggested Tuesday that when Congress eliminated the penalty for not buying health insurance it threw the entire landmark health care law into question, including protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Such a ruling would threaten to wipe away coverage for millions of Americans and have a dramatic impact on a presidential race that is already focused on access to and costs of health care, nearly 10 years after President Barack Obama signed his signature domestic achievement. Two of the three judges on the appellate panel in New Orleans \u2013 Jennifer Elrod, a George W. Bush appointee, and Kurt Engelhardt, a President Donald Trump appointee \u2013 gave the appearance that they might side with a lower court judge who ruled last year that the whole law should be struck down. Hear the full arguments Listen to Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments in the Texas case challenging the Affordable Care Act. The appeals court judges will decide whether the landmark health law should be struck down, setting up a potential Supreme Court showdown. Source: US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit Chief Justice John Roberts in 2012 famously upheld Obamacare by declaring it legal as a tax. But since the tax is now zero, conservatives say the law is doomed. \u201cIf you no longer have the tax, why isn\u2019t it unconstitutional?\u201d Elrod asked. If the challenge to the Affordable Care Act \u2013 filed by a group of 18 Republican states, led by Texas, and later joined by the Trump administration \u2013 is upheld, it would do what Trump and a GOP-led Congress failed to accomplish in 2017: take down Obamacare. And while Trump has repeatedly said that people with pre-existing conditions, such as cancer and diabetes, would be covered even if the law is struck down, he has not issued any specific plans to do so. \u201cWhat happened in 2017 \u2026 is that Congress took away\u201d \u2013 effectively undercut \u2013 the core of Roberts\u2019 opinion calling it a tax, argued Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins. Because of that, Roberts\u2019 holding that the law is valid based on Congress\u2019 taxing power is now \u201cirrelevant,\u201d Hawkins said. The Democratic-led House of Representatives and a coalition of 21 Democratic states, led by California, argued that Congress hadn\u2019t intended to kill the full law when it set the individual mandate tax penalty to zero. If Congress had wanted to nix other provisions, they argued, it would have done so as part of the same tax law. \u201cThe entire Affordable Care Act can cooperate without the individual mandate,\u201d said Samuel Siegel, California\u2019s deputy solicitor general, noting that some lawmakers were clear at the time that they wanted only to act on the penalty. In fact, prior efforts to further gut the law were defeated when the late Sen. John McCain cast his \u201cno\u201d vote after midnight in a dramatic Senate session. Douglas Letter, arguing for the now-Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, said Texas and the other Republican-led states are exaggerating the effect of the tax law. \u201cTexas said \u2018HA! \u2013 you just did something unconstitutional,\u2019 \u201d Letter said. Even though the tax penalty is now zero, Letter argued, people still have a choice: Buy insurance or don\u2019t. \u201cThat means the choice is still there,\u201d he said. In fact, he argued, \u201cthere\u2019s less coercion than there was before\u201d to buy insurance. Hawkins, for his part, rejected any interpretations of Congress\u2019 intentions in 2017. \u201cI\u2019m not in a position to psychoanalyze Congress,\u201d he said. Judge Carolyn Dineen King, a President Jimmy Carter appointee who\u2019s the third member of the panel, asked no questions during the proceedings. A ruling is not expected until later this year. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals is considered one of the most conservative appellate courts in the country, and the losing side is assured to appeal to the Supreme Court. Engelhardt appeared to question why the fate of the Affordable Care Act was being left to judges instead of lawmakers. If there\u2019s a debate over what Congress intended first in 2010 and then in 2017, then Congress and the White House should clarify the issue, the judge said. \u201cThere is a political solution here,\u201d he said, adding that the courts should not be a \u201ctaxidermist\u201d for every big-ticket law Congress passes. The Senate, which remains Republican-controlled, did not join the case \u2013 a fact Engelhardt noted. \u201cThere\u2019s sort of an 800-pound gorilla that isn\u2019t here,\u201d he said during the hearing. Letter countered that the House cannot \u201cfix\u201d the problem on its own, saying the Senate and Trump must also sign on \u2013 which they \u201cobviously\u201d would not \u2013 eliciting snickers in the courtroom. Notably, the Trump administration is not defending the law. Initially, it argued that zeroing out the penalty invalidates only two of the law\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions \u2013 specifically, the provisions banning insurers from denying people policies or charging them more based on their medical histories. But in a surprise move in March, the Justice Department said it now agreed with the December ruling that the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down. Elrod and Engelhardt gave the administration a hard time in court Tuesday. They pressed the Justice Department\u2019s attorney, August Flentje, on what would happen if the courts found that the law was unconstitutional. Flentje said the administration is \u201cappreciative\u201d that the district judge put his ruling on hold, stressing that if the Affordable Care Act falls, a lot must be sorted out. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d he said, noting that the case should go through all the appeals first. Affordable Care Act gears up for momentous test in court The judges questioned whether Obamacare could be invalidated only in the 18 states that brought the lawsuit, while remaining valid in the rest of the country. Letter later jumped on Flentje\u2019s ambiguous responses, saying the Department of Justice\u2019s position makes no sense. It would be impossible to divide up certain provisions by state, Letter said, pointing out one that makes it easier to bring to market lower-cost versions of certain complex drugs. Trump is pinning his hopes on the court striking down the law, allowing him to fulfill his campaign promise to repeal it. But congressional Republicans are keeping their distance, since it would give Democrats fodder to attack the GOP for not protecting those with pre-existing conditions \u2013 a hallmark of the law. Trump has repeatedly said he is working on a replacement plan that will preserve those protections but has yet to release any details. He has said Congress won\u2019t vote on it until after next year\u2019s presidential election. The administration\u2019s stance left the task of defending Obamacare to a coalition of Democratic attorneys general and the House of Representatives, which joined in earlier this year after Democrats took control of it. House Democrats to vote on a resolution Tuesday condemning Trump on health care move Overturning the law would have far-reaching consequences, way beyond disrupting coverage for the millions of people who get their health insurance on the exchanges or through Medicaid expansion. Obamacare saves senior citizens money on their Medicare coverage and prescription drugs. It lets many Americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. And it allows children to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until they turn 26. Even the Trump administration is using the law to try to lower prescription drug prices. The Affordable Care Act\u2019s broad impact on the health care system is central to the arguments of both sides \u2013 with Texas saying the passage of the law has forced it to spend more money, and California charging that the law\u2019s nullification would cost it money.

Bernie Sanders for coming to her defense on Friday after former Vice President Joe Biden told CNN that she did not represent Democrats who could win competitive general elections. Sanders took a swipe at Biden, after the former vice president defended his commitment to moderation in a crowded Democratic field during an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that aired Friday morning. Sanders pointed to \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s trademark Green New Deal environmental protection plan as \u201cthe agenda America needs\u201d that would also unite voters against President Donald Trump. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be working with @AOC and so many other Democrats to pass Medicare for All, debt free college and a Green New Deal,\u201d Sanders tweeted later Friday in response to Biden\u2019s comments. \u201cThis is the agenda America needs \u2014 and that will energize voters to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d The New York Democrat replied on Twitter, \u201cThank you, @SenSanders. It\u2019s an honor to work alongside you and the millions of other people fighting for education, healthcare, and a living wage as rights.\u201d The New York congresswoman and Vermont senator have partnered on progressive issues before, including legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 15% and campaigning together for other progressive hopefuls ahead of the midterm elections. Ocasio-Cortez also appeared at a climate change panel Sanders hosted late last year. In his interview with Cuomo, Biden said Ocasio-Cortez doesn\u2019t represent voters across the country and candidates like her aren\u2019t likely to win in races in more purple districts. \u201cLook who won the races. Look who won last time out,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBy the way, I think Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant, bright woman, but she won a primary. In the general election fights, who won? Mainstream Democrats who are very progressive on social issues and very strong on education and healthcare.\u201d Biden also implied that Medicare for All is irrational, arguing that the majority of Democrats are \u201ccenter left\u201d not \u201cway left.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, Gregory Krieg, Katie Lobosco and Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden said in an exclusive interview with CNN airing Friday that he wasn\u2019t prepared for California Sen. Kamala Harris to confront him on issues of race the way she did at the first Democratic primary debate. Biden told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that while he was prepared to be a focal point at last week\u2019s debate, he didn\u2019t anticipate that Harris would be the candidate leading the charge. He also said he didn\u2019t expect to be faulted on issues of race, given his record on civil rights. \u201cI was prepared for them to come after me, but I wasn\u2019t prepared for the person coming at me the way she came at me,\u201d Biden told Cuomo on Thursday evening in Iowa, adding that he felt that way in part because he knew Harris well and Harris knew his late son, Beau Biden, too. Harris, a former prosecutor, confronted Biden over his decades-old Senate fight against busing to desegregate schools and comments about his ability to be civil and work with segregationist senators. The clash defined the second night of the debate and has helped boost Harris in post-debate polls, bringing Biden\u2019s once-high numbers closer to the pack of Democratic presidential hopefuls. In the interview, Biden also expressed deep skepticism of the leftward tilt of the Democratic Party, suggesting that \u201cMedicare for All\u201d is irrational, arguing that the majority of Democrats are \u201ccenter left\u201d not \u201cway left,\u201d and saying Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, while \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cbright,\u201d does not represent Democrats who can win a general election in a competitive district or state. But Biden, keenly aware the polls show Democrats care deeply about candidates\u2019 ability to beat President Donald Trump in 2020, spent considerable time in the interview looking toward that goal. He told Cuomo that he was familiar with the President because he was like \u201cthe bully that I\u2019ve always stood up to.\u201d \u201cThe idea that I\u2019d be intimidated by Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said with a look that suggested that notion would be foolish. \u201cHe\u2019s the bully that I knew my whole life. He\u2019s the bully that I\u2019ve always stood up to. He\u2019s the bully that used to make fun when I was a kid that I stutter, and I\u2019d smack him in the mouth.\u201d Biden, leaning forward as he spoke, repeated that he is unafraid of Trump and appeared to reference the moment in a debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton when the then-presidential candidate stood behind the former secretary of state as she spoke, crowding her on national television. Exclusive: Biden expresses skepticism of Democrats' leftward tilt and AOC's mass appeal \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to this man. You walk behind me in the debate. Come here, man,\u201d Biden said, flicking his hands toward himself. Biden faulted Trump on policy throughout the interview, including his handling of China \u2013 \u201cwhile he\u2019s tweeting, China\u2019s going to own the 5G market\u201d\u2013 and North Korea. \u201cLook, you want to talk, you want to deal with us, you want sanctions lifted. Show me something ahead of time,\u201d Biden said of North Korea, faulting Trump for his openness with the rogue nation and its leader, Kim Jong Un. Before taking on Trump, however, Biden will need to get through the crowded field of Democrats who are also vying for a chance to challenge the Republican President. And over the last week, it has been the confrontation between Biden and Harris that has defined the race. Harris\u2019 campaign communications director, Lily Adams, told CNN that she didn\u2019t view the moment as a personal attack against Biden. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to why he was or wasn\u2019t prepared. That\u2019s for him and his team to decide and to explain. But what she was pointing out was a very real disagreement on the record,\u201d Adams said on \u201cNew Day\u201d Friday. Biden said that his decades-old position against federally mandated busing to desegregate schools was \u201ctaken out of context\u201d by Harris during the debate. Biden added that he is frustrated the debate was so focused on decades-old policy, not what each candidate wants to do going forward. The former vice president said he will hold off going after his opponents\u2019 previous positions because he doesn\u2019t want the debate between Democrats to be backward looking. Harris and Biden campaigns spar over desegregation busing one week after first debate \u201cI get all this information about other people\u2019s past and what they\u2019ve done and not done. And, you know, I am just not going to go there,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf we keep doing that, that\u2019s, I mean, we should be debating what we do from here.\u201d But that didn\u2019t stop him from attempting to quell the continued focus on the debate moment. He told CNN that \u201cour positions aren\u2019t any different, as we\u2019re finding out.\u201d Since the debate moment, Harris and her campaign have struggled to explain her own position on busing to desegregate schools today. And animosity between the two campaigns has spilled out into the open, with top aides to Biden and Harris engaging in a heated back-and-forth on social media over where their respective candidates stand on the issue. Biden stood by his past positions on busing, telling Cuomo that \u201cbusing did not work.\u201d \u201cYou had overwhelming response from the African American community in my state,\u201d Biden said of Delaware. \u201cThey were, they did not support it. They did not support it.\u201d But the former vice president argued that the entire debate between Harris and him over busing centered on \u201chow do you equalize education in every area.\u201d On that measure, he said, he has the best plans, noting that he wants to triple funding for the most disadvantaged schools and have preschool available from age 3. \u201cEvery child out there is capable, but they\u2019re living in circumstances that make it difficult,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSo what are we doing? We\u2019re sitting around here as if it\u2019s an insoluble problem.\u201d Biden, though, never made that argument during the debate, largely ceding the point to Harris during the nationally televised moment. Asked on Thursday why he didn\u2019t push back as forcefully as he is now, Biden said, \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t want to do is get in that scrum. Do you think the American public looked at that debate, take me out of it, and thought, boy, I really liked the way that\u2019s being conducted?\u201d CNN\u2019s Arlette Saenz and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Editor\u2019s note: This story was originally published June 1, 2019. It has been updated to reflect the unexpectedly strong June jobs report. The economy has been like President Donald Trump\u2019s safety blanket. Regardless of his trade wars with top US trading partners, the Mueller investigation or his threats to Iran and North Korea, the markets have performed for him. The unemployment rate has remained impressively low and the country\u2019s economic expansion has kept chugging toward a new record. The US employment market made a surprisingly strong comeback in June after a weak May report, adding 224,000 jobs \u2013 far more than analysts had predicted. If the gross domestic product keeps expanding through July, that will be more than 10 years \u2013 120 months \u2013 of constant growth. Trump holds firm on Mexico tariffs despite Republican dissent That steadiness was on full display this week, after Trump overruled his top economic advisers and threatened to impose tariffs on every single good coming in from Mexico.  The stock market basically said meh. The economy will be the card Trump plays in 2020, perhaps more than any other. \u201cWhen you have the best employment numbers in history, when you have the best unemployment numbers in history, when you have the best economy probably that we\u2019ve ever had, I don\u2019t know - how the hell do you lose this election, right?\u201d the President said at a rally earlier this month in Pennsylvania. But will it pay off for him the way he\u2019s hoping? Economists who study this stuff have had jitters about whether the expansion is sustainable. They\u2019ll point to an inverted Treasury yield that\u2019s making bond markets freak out, a tepid housing market in cities, the recent stock market wobbles and the trade war with China. What\u2019s kept some investors and companies going through the standoff with China is the hope that it would soon end. But after the collapse of the most recent round of talks in Washington, both Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping have made clear that they aren\u2019t expecting any immediate progress. China went ahead Friday with retaliatory tariffs, and could take the fight to a new level if it acts on a threat to restricts US access to rare earth metals needed for cell phones and other sensitive electronics. On the stock market, as Yahoo Finance pointed out, most of the market\u2019s remarkable bull run under Trump came during his first year in office. The market topped out at more than 26,600 in January 2018 and has stayed around there, give or take, ever since. That, coincidentally, was when the President announced the first of his nationalist tariffs. Trump\u2019s trade war with China has led to a shrinking trade deficit with that country, but the overall US trade deficit has continued to grow, suggesting that the President\u2019s goal to bring production of goods back to the US has not been achieved. If those are red lights flashing, consumers are not seeing them; their confidence is close to an 18-year high. And a lot of smart people \u2013 even those who disagree with Trump\u2019s policies \u2013 are not immediately concerned about a recession, which is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. Given the impending record of 120 months of expansion, a recession seems a long way off. Back in April, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the expansion could continue for quite some time. \u201cIt could go on for years,\u201d he said in a conference call reported by CNBC. \u201cThere\u2019s no law that says it has to stop. We do make lists, and look at all the other things: geopolitical issues, lower liquidity. There may be a confluence of events that somehow causes a recession, but it may not be in 2019, 2020, 2021.\u201d That, notably, was before Trump\u2019s trade talks with China cooled. More recently, Dimon said trade could be a factor in derailing growth. \u201cTrade has gone from being a skirmish to being far more important than that,\u201d he said, as reported by CNBC. \u201cIf this goes south in a bad way, and you have other surprises, that could be part of the thing that changes confidence, changes people\u2019s willingness to invest.\u201d Compounding issues were on display Wednesday, as rising concern about China dovetailed with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s public comments that his investigation into Russian election attacks was hamstrung by Department of Justice rules from resulting in charges against Trump even though it could not clear him. The issue for Trump is that his 2020 prospects are so reliant on the economy while his approval ratings have not kept pace with how well he says things are going. \u201cEven amid record-low unemployment, robust economic growth and a roaring stock market, President Donald Trump has shown no signs of expanding his support beyond the roughly 46% of the vote that he carried in 2016,\u201d CNN analyst Ronald Brownstein wrote this week as he documented how the coming election will test the maxim that the economy is key to US politics. Democrats have made clear they want the election to be about issues and not about Trump. Political opponents of Trump like Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist to then-Vice President Joe Biden during the Obama administration, do not necessarily see a recession on the horizon. \u201cFirst of all, I want to be clear, it is a fool\u2019s game to try to predict the next recession,\u201d said Bernstein in a phone interview before Trump\u2019s threat of new tariffs on Mexico. \u201cThat said, the American consumer remains pretty strong and they\u2019re at the heart of at least near-term economic outcomes. Consumer spending is nearly 70% of our economy.\u201d Bernstein said Democrats in 2020 will have to focus on the idea that the economic boom under Trump was born of tax cuts that created a sugar high. \u201cI think the Trump tax cuts were a massive misdirection of critical resources, but those cuts combined with other deficit spending has to create a fiscal boost to the economy,\u201d he said, adding they \u201cjuiced economic growth.\u201d But while the tax cuts did undoubtedly help the economy in the short term, he said the key for Democrats is to show that the reductions haven\u2019t ultimately improved the lives of everyone or even most people. There\u2019s no evidence yet that the cuts, which most benefited the wealthy and corporations, will lead to longer-term business investments, growth or wage gains. What they\u2019ve definitely done is explode the US budget deficit. \u201cOnce, again, this trickle-down stuff has been shown to be snake oil,\u201d he said. Addressing inequality is central to Democratic proposals like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d from Bernie Sanders, free college tuition and child care from Elizabeth Warren, universal income from Andrew Yang and baby bonds from Cory Booker. Warren and Sanders want to impose taxes on the wealthy to help pay for these programs. Bernstein pointed to figures, published for the first time by the Federal Reserve in March, that show the top 1% of Americans have 30.9% of the country\u2019s net worth. Compare that with the bottom 50%, who have 1.2%. The data shows that the total net worth of US households has more than quadrupled since 1989, but the increase has mostly benefited the top 10% of households, while growth has been much slower for lower groups and nearly nonexistent for 50% of the country. In 2018, according to the Fed, the top 10% of US households controlled 70% of all household wealth, and their growth came at the expense of households with lower incomes, whose share of total net worth decreased. The bottom half of households saw their share of the country\u2019s wealth shrink from 4% in 1989 to 1% in 2018. There is also a key regional aspect to the country\u2019s economic dissonance, as Bernstein documented with a recent Washington Post piece about his own battle to survive a severe brain hemorrhage earlier this year. He survived, he wrote, in part because he lived in a city near a good hospital and had quality health insurance \u2013 things not all Americans have. \u201cAnyone who wants to be president needs to explain how he or she is going to address the stark regional inequalities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s jobs, opportunities, business start-ups, health care, hospitals, addiction. I want to hear concrete plans about how we\u2019re going to address this increasing regional divide.\u201d And Trump\u2019s success in 2016 came in large part because of frustration among less educated white voters in Rust Belt states angry that the economy and the country were leaving them behind. Whether those voters \u2013 be they farmers, coal miners or autoworkers, will be buoyed by the President standing up to China or angry that Beijing\u2019s countermeasures often target them directly could be a key element of whether Trump is reelected, regardless of the stock market and the data economists pore over.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders has company in the rapidly escalating race-within-a-race to lead the progressive wing in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary: Sen. Elizabeth Warren. A series of recent polls have shown the Massachusetts senator on the rise, placing slightly behind Sanders in Iowa and Florida, and leading him in a recent survey out of Nevada. A pair of nationwide polls released Wednesday showed them either in a statistical dead heat or with Sanders\u2019 holding a small advantage. Warren\u2019s uptick has complicated Sanders\u2019 efforts to cast himself as the Democratic left\u2019s foil to former Vice President Joe Biden, the unapologetic moderate and early polling leader in a sprawling, 23-candidate field. And her rise also muddies Sanders\u2019 path to the nomination. For most voters, there isn\u2019t much clear space between them on the major policy questions dominating debate within the party. And even among progressive activists, the places where Sanders and Warren split can appear trifling in contrast to Biden\u2019s \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d message. Increasing support for Warren has also provided a new opportunity for the anti-Sanders crowd, worried over his calls for \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d to criticize him, while openly discussing the Massachusetts senator in a different light. Jim Kessler, a co-founder of the centrist think thank Third Way, tweeted favorably about her recent plan to aid minority entrepreneurs. In an interview with CNN, Kessler praised Warren\u2019s campaign as \u201cpolicy rich\u201d and criticized Sanders\u2019 speech defending democratic socialism. Warren\u2019s proposals are \u201cwithin the lines of Democratic policies. They\u2019re not democratic socialist policies. They\u2019re within the lines of a candidate who says she\u2019s a capitalist,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cOur view is that it passes that test overall.\u201d Third Way\u2019s friendly words, which also featured in a Politico report early Wednesday, caught the attention of the Sanders campaign. A few hours after the story began to circulate, campaign manager Faiz Shakir tweeted out a familiar criticism of the group. Elizabeth Warren's new 2020 status: Jockeying for second place next to Bernie Sanders \u201cThird Way\u2019s approach antagonizes no one, stands up to nobody and changes nothing,\u201d Shakir wrote, echoing a comment Sanders made 10 days ago in Iowa about his moderate rivals. \u201cThis is a Washington think tank that takes Wall Street money, so if @ThirdWayTweet is the opposition to @BernieSanders\u2019 campaign, which is leading Trump in poll after poll, we welcome the contrast.\u201d About an hour later, Sanders himself chimed in, tweeting a link to the initial report and commenting: \u201cThe cat is out of the bag. The corporate wing of the Democratic Party is publicly \u2018anybody but Bernie.\u2019 They know our progressive agenda of Medicare for All, breaking up big banks, taking on drug companies and raising wages is the real threat to the billionaire class.\u201d On Wednesday night, Sanders told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, \u201cThat tweet was not about Elizabeth Warren,\u201d saying it was directed only at Third Way. The centrist group\u2019s stamp of modest approval for Warren offers new credibility to a narrative that has been tossed around among progressives since the early days of her campaign \u2013 the idea that, by effectively running slightly to Sanders\u2019 right, she could end up providing a more comfortable option for Democrats who, even as they want to push left, might be uneasy with some of Sanders\u2019 more radical views. But there is also peril here for Warren. Progressives have a long-running feud with Third Way and similar centrist groups. Kessler\u2019s complimentary words offer Sanders an opportunity to amplify differences between the two candidates without lodging the kind of direct, and potentially self-defeating, attacks that he has so far avoided. It\u2019s no secret that Democrats widely fear a slash-and-burn primary that hobbles the eventual nominee ahead of a general election showdown with President Donald Trump. But some progressives carry parallel concerns \u2013 specifically, that a hard rift between Warren and Sanders could ultimately undermine their respective bids to run down Biden, while doing untold damage to a movement both have done so much to shape and advance. Warren\u2019s campaign on Wednesday played down the polls and talked up her campaign infrastructure. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to the polls,\u201d a senior campaign aide told CNN. \u201cThey will go up and down throughout the race and focusing on the daily headline, tweet, or cable news chatter is not a recipe for long term success. Every day we are building an organization, talking about problems facing the country, and Elizabeth\u2019s solutions for big structural change.\u201d Elizabeth Warren's new 2020 status: Jockeying for second place next to Bernie Sanders Sanders and his top aides have repeatedly sidestepped direct questions about Warren, noting accurately that most progressive voters don\u2019t view the primary as a binary choice between the two, while trying to keep the focus on a larger picture \u2013 one that shows Sanders handily beating Trump, by about the same percentages as Biden, in a head-to-head matchup. Warren also leads Trump in similar matchups, but by narrower margins. In an email memo to supporters on Monday, Shakir touted \u201cour strong grassroots campaign\u201d while listing and analyzing a \u201cspate of polls\u201d he said underscored the strength of Sanders\u2019 base and his \u201csolidified\u201d place \u201cas the candidate in the strongest position to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.\u201d Among the surveys cited was a Fox News poll from this weekend that showed both Sanders and Biden comfortably defeating Trump: Biden by 10 points, 49% to 39%, and Sanders by 9, 49% to 40%. Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also led in their matchups, but by narrower margins. Warren held a two-point advantage, 43% to 41%. Harris (42% to 41%) and Buttigieg (41% to 40%) led by a single point. \u201cThe challenge here is to beat Trump and to nominate and then elect someone in the Democratic primary process who\u2019s going to move the country in a progressive direction \u2013 period,\u201d Sanders campaign senior adviser Jeff Weaver told CNN last week. \u201cSo the question is, Who is best able to do that? And I think that as long as the debate is a principled debate on policy positions, on one\u2019s ability to appeal to a wide range of voters and not personal and nasty \u2026 I think that is a healthy debate to have in the Democratic Party.\u201d Though Sanders and his most visible advisers have shown little appetite, more than seven months out from the Iowa caucuses, for any public jousting with Warren, some of his other aides \u2013 most often active on social media \u2013 have been more willing to highlight the candidates\u2019 differences. On Sunday, Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner, retweeted and quoted in part from Washington Post opinion columnist Elizabeth Bruenig\u2019s recent piece addressing those distinctions. \u201cThere\u2019s little for a progressive stalwart to object to in Warren,\u201d Bruenig wrote, after ticking off some of the Massachusetts senator\u2019s proposals and positions. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a distinction to be drawn between her approach and Sanders\u2019s, and much of it comes down to the matter of regulation vs. revolution.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d Turner tweeted. \u201cThis is about transcendence for the people!\u201d Others, like Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels and campaign speechwriter David Sirota, have pushed back \u2013 again, on Twitter \u2013 against the suggestion that Warren stands alone in the Democratic primary\u2019s policy engine room. \u201cFor the record, @BernieSanders has 25 policy proposals on his website,\u201d Gunnels wrote on Sunday as he began a thread that included links to an assortment of plans and legislation calling for everything from Sanders staples like Medicare for all and a $15 minimum wage to the \u201cLoan Shark Prevention Plan\u201d he introduced in May with New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In a recent interview, Shakir \u2013 who, like some Warren staffers, is a veteran of former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s office \u2013 would only say that Warren\u2019s campaign \u201cdeserve(s) credit for the success they\u2019re getting and the hard work that she\u2019s putting in their campaign. That\u2019s great. They should continue to do whatever they think will help them win.\u201d For now, both candidates seem comfortable pursuing their own paths \u2013 with Warren strategically rolling out her policy proposals and Sanders personally confronting corporate powers, as he did at the recent Walmart shareholders meeting. The question up ahead, as Justice Democrats communications director Waleed Shahid put it, is what they plan for their next acts. \u201cThey\u2019ve really centered the policy and ideology, now they are going to have to make the case why they\u2019re the candidate to lead the American people,\u201d Shahid said. \u201cI\u2019m curious where they go.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A middle school principal in New York who\u2019s launching a bid to unseat a powerful House Democrat is finding help from the same group that helped Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez win her long-shot bid in the 2018 midterm elections. Jamaal Bowman, from Yonkers, will challenge Rep. Eliot Engel, a 16-term incumbent. Bowman has the backing of the progressive political action committee Justice Democrats, which helped Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a Massachusetts Democrat, unseat the incumbent Democrats in their respective districts. Bowman is the first candidate from New York to be backed by Justice Democrats in the 2020 election, and the second 2020 candidate the group has backed across the country. Last week, it announced its endorsement of Jessica Cisneros, a human rights lawyer, in her bid to represent Texas\u2019 28th Congressional District. Ocasio-Cortez defeated then-Rep. Joe Crowley, the third-ranked Democrat in the House in the last Congress, in her primary. She went on to become the youngest woman elected to Congress after easily winning the general election race. Justice Democrats has backed some of the most high-profile liberals in Congress. Along with Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley, the group  helped Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan become the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress. The group also backed Reps. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, Ro Khanna of California and Pramila Jayapal of Washington state. Engel, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has served in Congress since 1989 and has rarely faced a serious challenge in his district. He won his primary with nearly 74% of the vote in 2018 and won the general election with 100% of the vote. It was a similar story in 2016, when he won almost 95% of the vote in the general election. The representative\u2019s 30 years of experience and impressive electoral record do not appear to daunt Bowman. The challenger uses his campaign announcement to underscore the policies Engel has backed, namely his support for the Iraq War, Wall Street deregulation, school privatization and building more prisons. I want to talk about a vision for a new America. It\u2019s a country rooted in our humanity. A vision where everyone is included.It's time for #NY16 to have a Democrat who will fight for jobs and education, not bombs and incarceration.Join us: https://t.co/aB0J4XSecH pic.twitter.com/D4Dofr0bOg Bowman\u2019s platform is based on various progressive policies. In his launch video, he outlines his desire to \u201cmake public college free, (legislate) Medicare for all people, universal child care, criminal justice reform and the Green New Deal.\u201d Bowman is one of two current challengers for Engel\u2019s seat in 2020.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic primary foes are zeroing in on generational change as a leading argument against him as they sharpen their lines of attack two weeks ahead of the party\u2019s first presidential primary debates. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas became the latest contender to criticize Biden when he was asked Thursday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d whether the former vice president represented a \u201creturn to the past.\u201d \u201cHe is,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cAnd that cannot be who we are going forward. We\u2019ve got to be bigger. We\u2019ve got to be bolder.\u201d Central to Biden\u2019s campaign is the notion that Washington can work after Trump leaves town. Biden has said often \u2013 including in his campaign launch video and as recently as Wednesday in Clinton, Iowa \u2013 that Trump\u2019s presidency will be viewed historically as an \u201caberration\u201d if it is limited to four years. Increasingly, other Democrats are denouncing Biden\u2019s message, saying he overestimates Republicans\u2019 willingness to work with any Democratic president and that his approach to politics falls short of solving the systemic problems facing the country. The candidates\u2019 messages on policy often aren\u2019t very far apart. Biden, like other Democratic contenders, talks about building on former President Barack Obama\u2019s achievements \u2013 including by implementing a \u201cpublic option\u201d for health insurance that would allow Americans to buy into Medicare. Here are the 23 Democrats who have said they're running for president But some younger Democratic candidates are peppering their speeches with calls for generational change. At 78 on Inauguration Day 2021, Biden would be the oldest president ever elected. Reflecting the polls, his events have so far drawn generally older crowds than those of other leading 2020 Democratic contenders. The oldest candidate in the field, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and the youngest, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both have stronger support among younger voters. And, despite their 40-year age difference, both are making the case for a new generation of politics. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to win by playing it safe or promising a return to normal. We are where we are because normal broke,\u201d Buttigieg said in Iowa over the weekend, in remarks that were clearly aimed at Biden. He added that \u201cDemocrats can no more promise a return to the \u201990s than Republicans can deliver on a promise to return us to the \u201850s.\u201d Sanders told an audience at the California Democratic Party\u2019s convention earlier this month that in his view, \u201cWe will not beat Donald Trump unless we bring excitement and energy into the campaign. And unless we give millions of working people and young people a reason to vote and a reason to believe that politics is relevant to their lives.\u201d Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 69, of Massachusetts are campaigning on ideological change \u2013 an argument that has shown stronger appeal among younger voters. Polls have shown that Biden\u2019s support is concentrated among older voters. In a new Monmouth poll of Nevada likely Democratic voters that showed him with 36% support overall, he was backed by 47% of those older than 65, 35% of those between 50 and 64, and 29% of those 18 to 49. Sanders\u2019 campaign views those in Iowa between ages 17 (they\u2019re allowed to caucus as long as they\u2019ll be 18 by Election Day in November 2020) and 21 as an opportunity to grow his support from 2016, senior Iowa adviser Pete d\u2019Alessandro said. \u201cThose are both young people, which we appeal to, but they\u2019re also new caucus-goers, because they didn\u2019t caucus last time. So they\u2019re part of the new people that we\u2019re bringing into it and, since we do well with them, that\u2019s part of expanding the universe\u201d of Sanders supporters, he said. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments were a major departure from his previous praise for Biden, who he had urged to run for president. O\u2019Rourke pointed to Biden\u2019s recent reversal on whether the federal government should pay for abortions, his mixed messaging on China and his vote to authorize the war in Iraq \u2013 which Biden since 2005 has called a mistake \u2013 saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask yourself where Joe Biden is on issues that are most important to you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what he believes or what he should apologize for. I only know that this country should be able to do far better,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, when asked on PBS last week whether Biden represents the future, said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He also downplayed Biden\u2019s status as the front-runner in national and early-voting state polls as a product of the former vice president being more widely known than other Democratic candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new generation of leadership,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not surprised that he\u2019s leading in the polls, because he has more name recognition, certainly, than I do.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is attacking it. Moderate Democratic candidates are warning against it, too. But in a speech Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders leaned in to his democratic socialist vision, casting his policies as the \u201cunfinished business\u201d of the New Deal era, and argued that the nation must embrace his politics in order to defeat rising global authoritarianism. \u201cIt is my very strong belief that the United States must reject that path of hatred and divisiveness and instead find the moral conviction to choose a different path, a higher path, a path of compassion, justice and love,\u201d Sanders said to applause at George Washington University. \u201cAnd that is the path that I call democratic socialism.\u201d Over nearly 45 minutes, Sanders quoted in his defense a range of historical figures, from Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He also recalled comments from figures like President Ronald Reagan, who during his pre-White House days served as a go-to spokesman for conservatives and used \u201csocialism\u201d as a slur against an assortment of liberal policy projects, including now popular programs like Medicare. Sanders also took aim at Trump, calling him a friend of \u201ccorporate socialism\u201d and the American face of an international \u201cmovement toward oligarchy (that) runs parallel to the growth of authoritarian regimes.\u201d Sanders\u2019 speech, which echoed in parts a similar address he gave during his last presidential campaign, came amid a growing backlash, from both Republicans and some Democrats, to his unlikely rise into the upper echelons of American politics. He began the 2016 Democratic presidential primary as a relative unknown, a Senate backbencher generally viewed \u2013 even by himself \u2013 as an outsider inside the Washington beltway. But his message gained traction when pitted against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton, a pragmatism-preaching liberal who was ultimately defeated, in part, by Trump\u2019s right-wing populist appeal. Sanders entered the 2020 race offering much the same message as four years ago, but with loftier electoral expectations and a more mature political operation. He also, now, has a more useful foil when it comes time to defend his agenda \u2013 the Trump administration. \u201cWhen Trump screams socialism, all of his hypocrisy will not be lost on the American people,\u201d Sanders said Wednesday. \u201cWhen Trump attacks socialism, I am reminded again of what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said: \u2018This country has socialism for the rich; rugged individualism for the poor.\u2019\u201d Sanders described Trump, Wall Street and other powerful corporations as a common enemy lined up against the shared interests of the working and middle classes \u2013 and dismissed criticism coming from the President and his allies as transparently self-serving and insincere. \u201cWhile President Trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism, they don\u2019t really oppose all forms of socialism,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people, but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches Trump and other billionaires.\u201d Promising to continue to roll out new proposals to complement his signature \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d single-payer health care plan, Sanders also described a coming \u201c21st century Economic Bill of Rights\u201d \u2013 a new version at what Roosevelt first spoke about in the year before his death. \u201cA Bill of Rights,\u201d he said, \u201cthat establishes once and for all that every American, regardless of his or her income is entitled to the right to a decent job that pays a living wage; the right to quality health care; the right to a complete education; the right to affordable housing, the right to a clean environment; and the right to a secure retirement.\u201d In the run-up to the speech, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir sought to separate out Sanders\u2019 argument from other candidates in the Democratic primary, most notably \u2013 though without saying his name \u2013 former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cThere is this belief that technocratic squishiness is the way to solve problems,\u201d Shakir told CNN. \u201cSen. Sanders is prepared to make the argument that what we need is a fighter unafraid to take on the big problems of the day and offer up real solutions to solve them.\u201d Shakir conceded that the \u201csocialism\u201d label is one that Sanders\u2019 opponents \u2013 both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 will continue to use in an attempt to tar his campaign, but insisted the Vermont senator would never back off his fundamental argument. \u201cThis is a fight we are excited to have,\u201d Shakir said, denying the speech was a response to dipping poll numbers or an attempt to reboot the campaign. \u201cWe are not going to duck this charge. We plan to take it on front and center. This has always been something that (Sanders\u2019) political opponents have used as a way to try and bring him down and despite those attacks, he has only gotten more popular.\u201d In a video posted Wednesday morning, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio gave a glimpse at the response Sanders can expect from political rivals. He called democratic socialism a \u201ctrendy phrase\u201d used by the \u201cradical left to ignore the incredibly destructive history of socialism,\u201d and declared it \u201cincompatible with our American values.\u201d The wider public response to Sanders\u2019 words will be watched closely not only by his political rivals, but by leaders of the Democratic Socialists of America, which has grown into the country\u2019s largest socialist organization \u2013 with 56,000 dues-paying members \u2013 in the wake of Trump\u2019s 2016 election. Its stars, like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have used their megaphones to reshape public perception around socialism \u2013 which has for so long been viewed as a dirty word in national politics. Ocasio-Cortez was put on the spot soon after her surprise primary victory last year, when she was asked during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d what democratic socialism meant to her. \u201cI believe that in a modern, moral and wealthy society, no person in America should be too poor to live,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in a clip that almost immediately went viral. \u201cSo what that means is health care as a human right. It means that every child, no matter where you are born, should have access to a college or trade school education if they so choose it \u2026 I think that no person should be homeless if we can have public structures and public policies to allow for people to have homes and food and lead a dignified life in the United States.\u201d Support for socialism can be tricky to measure through public polling. Democrats generally have a more favorable view than Republicans, but its support has not risen along with Sanders\u2019 political fortunes. Policies rooted in socialism, like Medicare or social security are widely popular across political lines. Another consistent finding has been diminished backing for capitalism, especially among young people and Democrats. According to a Gallup poll from last year, support for capitalism among 18- to 29-year-olds had fallen more than 20 percentage points over eight years, from 68% to 45% in 2018. But there was no movement when it came to socialism \u2013 it stood at 51% in both 2010 and 2018. Whether a modern candidate who embraces socialism can win a presidential election remains an open question. In another Gallup poll from April, fewer than half of Americans (47%) said they would vote for a candidate nominated by their party who is \u201ca generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be a socialist.\u201d It was the lowest figure among a range of traits tested, including being \u201ca woman\u201d (94%), \u201ca Muslim\u201d (66%) or \u201can atheist\u201d (60%). But candidates, like Sanders, are not so easily categorized. He is also Jewish (93%) and over 70 (63%). With Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory, and the march of other unabashed democratic socialist candidates at all levels of government, the term has come under increasing scrutiny \u2013 both from Republican opponents and Democrats who either disagree ideologically or worry that the label looks like a political skull and bones to voters. Recent rhetoric from both parties has created a sense that socialism itself is on the ballot \u2013 or on trial \u2013 in this campaign. But Maria Svart, DSA\u2019s national director, believes Sanders\u2019 popularity and changes to the broader political discourse, headlined by growing income inequality and a sharp rise in concerns over climate change, has changed the context of the debate. \u201cCapitalism is what\u2019s on trial,\u201d Svart told CNN before the speech. \u201cThis is not a drill. This is absolutely our last chance to change our system. The United States is the biggest polluter on the planet. Trump is actively making it easier to pollute. And if we don\u2019t stop it, we don\u2019t have a future.\u201d Like the Sanders campaign, which DSA voted to endorse, Svart also argued Democrats desperate to defeat Trump in 2020 needed to embrace a more radical political agenda. \u201c(Sanders) is giving this speech at a time when Trump, and certainly the Republicans, have a unified talking point that all Democrats are socialists. And obviously I wish that were so, but we\u2019ve seen the narrative around Biden and others about electability, and the reality is that too many Wall Street Democrats are completely out of touch with millions of people in this country,\u201d Svart said, adding that Sanders\u2019 \u201ccentral argument needs to be that socialism works for the 99%, socialism works for the many, and we should be more socialist. There is no alternative if we want to beat Trump.\u201d Centrist and more cautious liberal Democrats on the campaign trail have become increasingly vocal \u2013 and specific \u2013 in their attacks on Sanders and socialism. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper summed up the argument during his speech at the Iowa Democrats Hall of Fame celebration in Cedar Rapids this weekend. \u201cWe must present a bold vision for the future, but we also must acknowledge that the most effective attack the Republicans can level against us is \u2018socialism,\u2019 \u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cNow, that does not mean that Democrats should shy away from big progressive goals. Far from it. A pragmatist doesn\u2019t say no to big ideas, they figure out how to get them done.\u201d Sanders in his own remarks at the same event insisted, without mentioning socialism or any other candidate, that anything less than a full bore rejection of the status quo would leave voters cold \u2013 and potentially dim their excitement ahead of the next election. \u201cI understand that there are some well-intentioned Democrats and candidates who believe that the best way forward is a middle ground strategy that antagonizes no one, that stands out to nobody and that changes nothing,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIn my view, that approach is not just bad public policy, but it is a failed political strategy that I feel could end up with the reelection of Donald Trump.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The desire for a more traditionally liberal approach to government \u2013 more regulation, increased spending on public programs etc. \u2013 is at an all-time high, according to calculations by longtime political science professor James Stimson. \u201cThe annual estimate for 2018 is the most liberal ever recorded in the 68-year history of Mood, just slightly higher than the previous high point of 1961,\u201d Stimson, now the Raymond Dawson Distinguished Professor of Political Science (Emeritus) at UNC Chapel Hill, wrote recently of his findings. \u201cIt represents the expected leftward movement in thermostatic reaction to the Presidency of Donald Trump,\u201d he added. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Stimson has been monitoring the broad mood of the American public to approaches to government since 1991. Rather than attempting to gauge where people stand on a single issue at a particular moment in time, Stimson aims to take a far longer view \u2013 and to rate his findings on a spectrum from liberal to conservative governance. As The New York Times\u2019 Tom Edsall wrote about Stimson\u2019s methodology in 2013: \u201cStimson, using data from all available commercial and academic surveys, including American National Election Studies and Gallup\u2026.The graph tracks swings in public opinion, both to the left and right, using responses to polling questions measuring levels of support for government programs.\u201d Here\u2019s what Stimson\u2019s latest mood chart looks like as of earlier this month (and here is the data behind it): It\u2019s important to note what this chart shows \u2013 and what it doesn\u2019t. Stimson\u2019s mood score isn\u2019t meant to be predictive of whether a Democratic or a Republican will win a certain election, presidential or otherwise. Instead, it seeks to measure what sort of government people want. Do they want a government that we would traditionally describe as \u201cbig\u201d (meaning more involved in peoples\u2019 lives) or \u201csmall\u201d (lower taxes and less regulation)? Here\u2019s a real-life way to understand how Stimson\u2019s mood indicator works \u2013 and how it dovetails with the actions of politicians. In his 1996 State of the Union speech \u2013 an address seen by many as a framing of his argument for reelection later that year \u2013 Bill Clinton famously/infamously said this: \u201cWe know big government does not have all the answers. We know there\u2019s not a program for every problem. We have worked to give the American people a smaller, less bureaucratic government in Washington. And we have to give the American people one that lives within its means. The era of big government is over.\u201d That declaration was regarded, in retrospect, as Clinton seeking to move the Democratic Party beyond the New Deal and Great Society days and into a new political reality in which government was not always the solution to the problem. Now, look at Stimson\u2019s chart above. The desire for a liberal approach to government had been heading downward since the early 1990s \u2013 cratering right around when Clinton closed the book on so-called \u201cbig government.\u201d What Stimson\u2019s mood score makes clear then is that the public was ripe for just such a declaration \u2013 and Clinton\u2019s decision to say what he said (and when he said it) likely contributed to the overall efficacy of his message. (Clinton was overwhelmingly reelected in 1996.) Stimson\u2019s mood rating correlates, generally speaking, to public opinion polling that asks people what role they believe the government should play in their lives. Gallup has been asking that question: \u201cSome people think the government is trying to do too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses. Others think that government should do more to solve our country\u2019s problems. Which comes closer to your own view?\u201d The responses over time reflect Stimson\u2019s mood scale. In the summer of 2012, 61% said that government was trying to do too many things that should be left to individuals while just 34% said the government should be doing more. Stimson\u2019s measure of mood shows a bottoming-out in desire for liberal public policy at around that same time. Ditto the recent rise in the desire for a more liberal approach to government in Stimson\u2019s data; a September 2018 Gallup poll showed 50% think the government does too much while 44% think it should do more. Stimson attributes much of this change to the self-regulating nature of the American people. The desire for a more liberal government tends to rise when a Republican is in the White House and sink when a Democrat resides there. As Stimson told the Daily Tarheel after the 2018 election: \u201cI\u2019m known for the thermostatic idea that mainly public opinion is a reaction to what\u2019s happened recently.\u201d In essence, Stimson is saying that an increasing desire in the public for a more liberal policy solution is a function of the fact that the current president is a Republican, not that the current president is Donald Trump. Make sense? Now, even if the current mood is not rightly attributed to the very Donald Trump-ness of Donald Trump, it doesn\u2019t mean that Stimson\u2019s findings have no relevance to the ongoing 2020 presidential race. In fact, it suggests that the public might well be more open to large government involvement in things like health care (Medicare for All) or education (free college) than they would have been, say, 10 years ago.",

            "article_content": "Nearly every Democrat vying to take on President Donald Trump in 2020 made their pitch to Iowa\u2019s most plugged-in Democrats on Sunday, looking to set themselves apart from the sprawling field of candidates in the midst of a swirling carnival of activists and campaign volunteers. The event brought together four of the five top candidates in CNN\u2019s newly released poll, which found a tight race forming in the Hawkeye State, with former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 who was not present on Sunday \u2013 holding onto a lead, with Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren trailing him and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg on their tails. With 19 speakers allowed just five minutes, each candidate sought to break out before the activist crowd here in East Central Iowa \u2013 usually by hitting Trump in a new or creative way, knocking their Democratic opponents or casting themselves as an entirely different choice. Despite Biden\u2019s frontrunner status, most of the candidates refused to go directly after the former vice president, who attended his granddaughter\u2019s graduation ceremony instead and will visit Iowa later this week. Instead, it was Trump who drew most of the ire. \u201cHe claims to be the best president we have seen in a generation. Well, I say let\u2019s call Barack Obama, because that\u2019s identity fraud,\u201d California Sen. Kamala Harris said. Former Colorado Gov. Jay Hickenlooper called Trump \u201cthe worst president in the history of America.\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Trump is \u201ca liar, a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, a religious bigot, and someone who believes that he is above the law.\u201d The candidates who sought to offer a sharper contrast with their primary rivals either targeted Biden \u2013 or at least his style of politics \u2013 or, from the other side, Sanders and his Medicare for All plans. Buttigieg said Democrats will not win in 2020 by \u201cplaying it safe, of promising a return to normal.\u201d \u201cWe are where we are because normal broke,\u201d Buttigieg said, arguing that Democrats cannot promise normalcy or going back to the 1990s or 2000s, a line the mayor has worked into recent speeches as a subtle knock on Biden. Much like he did at the California state convention last week, Sanders in his speech warned that entering 2020 with \u201cmiddle ground\u201d positions risks dulling the argument against Trump and the wider Republican agenda. \u201cI understand that there are some well-intentioned Democrats and candidates who believe that the best way forward is a middle ground strategy that antagonizes no one, that stands out to nobody and that changes nothing,\u201d Sanders said, again making the implicit argument against Biden. \u201cIn my view, that approach is not just bad public policy, but it is a failed political strategy that I feel could end up with the reelection of Donald Trump.\u201d But Sanders has his critics \u2013 and they used their platforms to pushback against his agenda and question his electability. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, a critic of Medicare for All, ticked off a list of European countries \u2013 \u201cwhose systems we admire\u201d \u2013 that guarantee universal health care using models that keep a role for private insurers, which Medicare for All, in almost every case, does not. Hickenlooper argued that Sanders would be an easy mark for Republicans. \u201cWe must present a bold vision for the future,\u201d Hickenlooper said, \u201cbut we also must acknowledge that the most effective attack the Republicans can level against us is \u2018socialism.\u2019\u201d The day-long affair \u2013 which included some campaign staffers waking up at 4 a.m., to position themselves and boisterous supporters lining the streets with thousands of signs and eye-grabbing spectacles \u2013 represents the informal kickoff of the Iowa caucus season, with each campaign hoping to use the speech as a springboard to a summer full of organizing. But for many, the event was just about getting some attention \u2013 from the media and activists. \u201cThe challenge is that people just don\u2019t know my name,\u201d said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. \u201cThat\u2019s the principal challenge.\u201d And the historic size of the Democratic field impacted the event in a number of unique ways. It was difficult to move a few feet in the Cedar Rapids\u2019 venue without bumping into a candidate for president, a situation that created some unique interactions between competitors and their supporters. Sanders walked into the venue before the event as Harris supporters chanted about electing a woman to the White House, Hickenlooper and the California senator shared cheddar popcorn before both went on stage, and a bagpiper \u2013 paid for by Delaney \u2013 blared in the middle of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s speech rallying her supporters outside the venue. Each candidate was given five minutes of time on stage, with those who ran long being played off by loud Oscars-style music. The short time also forced speakers to make impressions off the stage, so the candidates mingled, chanted and rallied with their most ardent supporters outside the venue. Candidates and their spouses ran into each other. Activists chanted, cheered and marched through the streets. Sanders led a \u201cFight for 15\u201d solidarity march with striking McDonald\u2019s workers demanding a $15-an-hour minimum wage and a union, filling the street in front of the venue after headlining a rally nearby a few minutes earlier. Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign brought in a Moys breakfast taco truck and handed out flyers that offered a free taco to other campaigns\u2019 volunteers \u201cin appreciation of your support for the many Democrats running 4 POTUS.\u201d Later, his campaign bought a long table full of Casey\u2019s Pizza for those leaving the event. Delaney\u2019s team included at least a pair of sign-spinners and a helium-filled mini-blimp displaying the former Maryland congressman\u2019s name. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker made perhaps the largest organizing push, with chants and cheers echoing through the venue as his supporters followed him in. And Buttigieg\u2019s campaign hosted a sprawling picnic that included bag toss, food truck and live music, with the mayor himself playing the keyboard before marching over to the event flanked by his supporters. Outside groups were also on hand. Volunteers with the Sunrise Movement and other environmental organizations pushed candidates to address climate change. A Greenpeace scoreboard rating 2020 Democrats was on display across the street from the dinner. Supporters of The Young Turks chanted \u201csign the pledge,\u201d urging Democrats to promise their support for a progressive economic platform the left-leaning news outlet recently unveiled. Iowa Democrats celebrated two freshman congresswomen, Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne, who both won office in a midterm election in which female candidates and voters fueled the Democratic surge to a House majority. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand seized on that fact, making a direct appeal to the women in the room \u201cand the men who love them\u201d by urging Democrats to see the fact that women led Democrats back to control of the House in 2018 that a woman can win in 2020. \u201cWomen are on fire in America today. We have marched, we have organized, we have run for office and we have won. Because of women we flipped the US House of Representative,\u201d she said, imploring the crowd to believe \u201cnow is not the time to be polite, now is not the time for small steps, now is the time to fight like hell.\u201d Gillibrand has struggled to get traction in a field where only five candidates are polling above 5% in Iowa. Female candidates who are well-known in Washington, like Gillibrand and Klobuchar, are fighting for oxygen in a field with two older white men in Biden and Sanders leading. \u201cEvery so often I get sad about the numbers for some of the women \u2013 including everyone, our combined numbers and what they are \u2013 but I think it has been improving and I think people are taking us seriously and I think the debates are going to be a really good chance for the woman to show their stuff,\u201d Klobuchar said Saturday while campaigning in Cresco. \u201cCould we be running with less experience than we had?\u201d she asked about the men in the race. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think people would take us seriously.\u201d At such a crammed and fast-paced event, lesser-known candidates fought just to put themselves on Iowa Democrats\u2019 radars. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock accused Trump of turning elections into \u201cdark money auctions\u201d and touted his legal fights against the Koch brothers. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet railed against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican. \u201cTrump is the star of his own three-ring circus in Washington, but there is no doubt who the ringmaster actually is,\u201d he said. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard pledged to end \u201cwasteful regime change wars that have taken so many lives.\u201d California Rep. Eric Swalwell promised to \u201cbe bold, without the bull.\u201d Inslee said he wants to oppose Trump with his experience as the leader of the state with \u201cthe single best economy in the United States.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s going to drive him nuts,\u201d Inslee said.",

            "article_content": "When Barbara Paulding was 44 years old, Joe Biden had been a member of the United States Senate from Delaware for more than a decade \u2013 and Pete Buttigieg was about to be born. Despite being only 37 years old, the latter \u2013 a gay, veteran mayor from South Bend, Indiana, who is running for president in 2020 \u2013 wowed the now 81-year-old Paulding after he spoke in a low-slung union hall here in Des Moines. Paulding represents a growing number of senior citizens who have rallied around Buttigieg because of \u2013 not in spite of \u2013 his age. And she said after Buttigieg\u2019s speech that her support of the millennial mayor over the 76-year-old former vice president Biden or 77-year-old Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders does not feel abnormal. A recent CNN poll found that 22% of people 65 and older have a favorable opinion of Buttigieg, compared to 16% for voters under 34. And a recent Suffolk University poll in New Hampshire found more voters older than 65 said they would back the Indiana Democrat if the primary was today than voters younger than 50. \u201cI am ready to turn power over,\u201d Paulding said. \u201cLook at the mess we have made of it. \u201cI like Joe, but I don\u2019t want Joe to be President. I think we just need new leadership. I really feel that very strongly. Obama was a new year and transformational and I think we need that.\u201d The contrast between Paulding, a retired educator and author, and Buttigieg, a baby-faced Democrat, is readily apparent to the octagenerian. After the presidential candidate wrapped up his speech, she laughed, thinking about how he was young enough to be her grandson. \u201cI am ready to have somebody young,\u201d she said with a shrug. Paulding is not unique. As Buttigieg has risen in popularity, the faces in his growing crowds have not been solely dotted with young people who see the South Bend, Indiana, mayor as a member of their generational cohort. Instead, Buttigieg has seen a steady growth in support from senior citizens, with polls showing that the age group is, in some cases, more fervent in their Buttigieg support than voters closer to the mayor\u2019s age. Jim Green, a 75-year-old Vietnam War veteran and a vice chair of the Democratic Party in Londonderry, New Hampshire, introduced Buttigieg at a listening session for veterans on Friday. \u201cI was thinking about his age when they asked me to do the introduction,\u201d Green said with a laugh after the event. But, when he reflected on it, Green said he believed Buttigieg \u2013 even at his young age \u2013 had the right experience to be President. And, as a veteran, he appreciates the fact that Buttigieg has called for an end to endless war, like he did on Friday. \u201cWe are old enough and close enough to the end that you kind of take a look and see there are some people who seem to be moving stuff forward and then there are other people who are standing still,\u201d Green said without endorsing Buttigieg. \u201cI\u2019ve got to think about my grandkids. And I think he is moving things forward.\u201d What's Mayor Pete's path? And Buttigieg has noticed the senior support. \u201cThe thing that has really helped us out is that we have found the makings of a generational alliance of people of all ages who are focused on the future and believe it is time for a new generation to step forward,\u201d he told a small audience in Marshalltown, Iowa, in April. That idea of building this kind of coalition has come up time and again on the campaign trail \u2013 and Buttigieg has started to mention it at many of his events, seemingly when he looks out into the crowd and sees older faces. During a trip to South Carolina in March, Buttigieg said he believed \u2013 despite the fact the millennial generation is \u201csometimes a little misunderstood\u201d \u2013 his campaign had a chance to \u201cbuild a generational alliance around the hope of a better future.\u201d \u201cIf we don\u2019t step up, who will?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho has more at stake than those who will be picking up the pieces of the decisions that are being made right now?\u201d Jerry Pinneke, a 70-year-old Democrat from Ankeny, Iowa, was at Buttigieg\u2019s Marshalltown speech and was moved by his call for a \u201cgenerational alliance,\u201d especially on the impact it will have on voters who are considering supporting Biden. \u201cI really appreciate Joe Biden, but he is like me,\u201d Pinneke said. \u201cHe is an old guy and we have to get the hell out of the way and let the younger people come up, like Pete.\u201d Buttigieg told CNN on his April trip in Iowa that he believes the reason for the senior support is they understand better than others \u201cjust how much of a need there is for change.\u201d \u201cThey are excited about the idea of new ideas, of new faces, and they\u2019re not afraid of it,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m excited about being able to engage fellow millennials in the way that we\u2019ve been able to connect with young voters \u2026 but really this won\u2019t succeed unless we can unite voters like that with voters my parents\u2019 age or older and it\u2019s been really inspiring and exciting to see that in the crowds that come.\u201d The 10 Democrats most likely to be the 2020 nominee, ranked While Buttigieg\u2019s senior supporters do seem drawn to some of his ideas \u2013 like his pledge to invest billions into combating climate change and his plan to expand Medicare to any American who wants it \u2013 it appears to be his mere presence, the fact that he has already run a town like South Bend for eight years and the fact that such a young candidate could stand a chance in a presidential election that activates his older supporters. And appealing to seniors is not new to Buttigieg \u2013 even if it remains somewhat confounding. The mayor wrote in his pre-campaign memoir, \u201cShortest Way Home,\u201d that during his first run for mayor \u2013 when he was just shy of 30 \u2013 a poll of the city found older voters were more likely to say \u201cit was a positive that I was twenty-nine years old.\u201d \u201cTo this day, I wonder why,\u201d he wrote. \u201d\ufeffIs it that senior voters are less likely to see distinctions between twenties, thirties, and forties? Did I remind them of their children? Whatever the reason, we took the data as a reminder that you should never assume who will or won\u2019t support you.\u201d Interviews with some of Buttigieg\u2019s older supporters show how Buttigieg\u2019s observations appear to be valid. \u201cIf had a son, I would want him to be exactly like him,\u201d said Marty Davis, a 66-year-old lifelong Republican who, after noticing a lot of seniors on Facebook posting about Buttigieg, started the group \u201cSeniors for Pete Buttigieg.\u201d \u201cI feel motherly toward him, to be honest. If you want the perfect children to run our country the perfect way, it would be Pete.\u201d Davis\u2019 Facebook group, while tallying only a few hundred people, has turned into an outpouring of support from people who are old enough to be Buttigieg\u2019s mother or father. Some post about how he reminds them of their kids, while others remark that they see little difference between him and other slightly older candidates. But what Davis, who lives in Beaumont, California, after three decades of working for the City of Palm Springs, said she has noticed most clearly is that seniors are drawn to Buttigieg because of his age, not because they are willing to ignore it. Biden and Sanders \u201chave been around for 40 years, they are just not as visionary to me, not as attuned to the generation of my daughter, which is very important to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my daughter\u2019s generation to be represented now.\u201d The same is true for Lisa McAllister, a 60-year-old retired bank manager who joined Davis\u2019 group after she began seeing more and more about Buttigieg online. \u201cI really think that the world belongs to this generation,\u201d said McAllister, who recently moved to Point Pilot, Texas, after spending her life in Washington state. \u201cI am going to be exiting in the next 20-30 years and they should really be the ones making the decisions.\u201d McAllister, who has a 30-year-old son, said she respect millennials because they have grown up in a world of near constant war, school shootings and political upheaval. \u201cIf you are a patriot, if you love your country, you want the best for not only your current population but the future,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have got to take a look at the mistakes that we have made and there comes a time when we have to hand power over to those that will be living in the world they create.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The House passed a bill Thursday afternoon aimed at shoring up protections for those with pre-existing health conditions, part of Democrats\u2019 plans for protecting the Affordable Care Act under the Trump administration. The legislation was approved 230 to 183, mostly along party lines with four Republican members joining Democrats. While it\u2019s not expected to be picked up by the Republican-controlled Senate, the vote gives Democrats another messaging tool in the politically divisive fight over health care. The bill would nullify a Trump administration guidance that would allow states to ask for waivers to make major changes to their Obamacare markets. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services laid out in November four examples of what states could request \u2013 opening the door for people to use subsidies to buy coverage outside the Obamacare exchanges. This would include short-term health insurance plans that can reject people with pre-existing conditions or charge them higher premiums. The Trump administration last year made these policies more attractive by extending their terms to just under a year, instead of three months. However, no states have taken the agency up on its offer. Last week, it issued a request for more ideas on waiver concepts and programs states could consider under the so-called State Relief and Empowerment Waiver plan. House Democrats are looking to strengthen their claim of being the party to protect those with pre-existing conditions, which helped them regain control of the chamber in last year\u2019s midterm election. They passed a resolution last month condemning the Trump administration\u2019s effort to take down the Affordable Care Act in court and calling it \u201can unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people.\u201d Also in the pipeline are bills to repeal the administration\u2019s extension of short-term plans and to restore funding for outreach and assistance during Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment period in the fall. Signups for Obamacare coverage have drifted downward over the past two years after Trump slashed the budgets for enrollment help and advertising. House Democrats and Republicans traded barbs Thursday over the name of the bill \u2013 the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019 \u2013 one of several Democrats have teed up to counter the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to undermine Obamacare. Democrats stressed that the expanded waivers could hurt those with spotty medical histories. Trump calls for an end to surprise medical bills \u201cBy encouraging states to promote and expand short-term insurance plans, the Administration is giving insurers the green light to directly discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr., of New Jersey, said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s giving the greenlight for these plans to charge people with pre-existing conditions more money. And it\u2019s giving these plans the greenlight to refuse to cover any treatment that is related to someone\u2019s pre-existing condition.\u201d However, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers insist that states could not waive the Affordable Care Act\u2019s comprehensive protections for those with pre-existing conditions. \u201cThe misleading title of this bill confirms the Democratic majority\u2019s passion to score political points instead of governing,\u201d said Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, the Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s top Republican. \u201cLet me be very clear: this bill has nothing to do with protecting Americans with preexisting conditions. This bill has everything to do with eliminating health care options and choices for states.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Two House Democrats reintroduced health care overhaul legislation Wednesday that would provide universal coverage but stop far short of the sweeping \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan embraced by several 2020 presidential candidates. \u201cMedicare for America,\u201d a plan first introduced last year by Democratic Reps. Rosa DeLauro and Jan Schakowsky, would create a new version of Medicare that would be open to people of all ages. It would provide coverage for newborns, who would be automatically enrolled in the program, uninsured Americans and those currently on Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare plans. The bill would allow employers to continue to offer gold-level benefit plans, a key distinction from Medicare for All, which would get rid of private insurance. In a phone call with reporters on Wednesday, DeLauro argued it was important for people to be able to make their own choice about health benefits, \u201cand not one day be stripped of what they do know.\u201d \u201cWe were really trying to meet that need of people to make an informed choice of where they want to be,\u201d she said. DOJ lays out case for striking down Obamacare in its entirety Schakowsky suggested a full transition to single-payer could come at a later date, but that it might not be the best starting point. \u201cIt makes the transition to universal health care much easier to build on what we have now,\u201d she said. It\u2019s just one of several competing bills that Democrats have brought forward in recent months to reform the nation\u2019s health care system \u2013 and just as the landmark Affordable Care Act comes under renewed legal assault from the Trump administration. Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Debbie Dingell have introduced a more generous version of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All bill in the House, and it has won support from 108 Democratic cosponsors. That bill would include a two-year transition period, at the end of which every American would receive comprehensive coverage under the same plan. Medicare for America differs from Jayapal\u2019s plan in a notable respect: It comes with built-in ways to pay for the program\u2019s cost. DeLauro and Schakowsky would pull together revenue by increasing the Medicare payroll tax, hiking excise taxes on tobacco, beer, wine, liquor and sugary drinks, scrapping the 2017 GOP tax cuts and slapping a 5% surtax on individuals with an adjusted gross income above $500,000. In the phone call on Wednesday, DeLauro brushed off concerns about divides within the Democratic Party and said she didn\u2019t view anything about her proposal as adversarial. \u201cYou have to put this in context. It wasn\u2019t that long ago where the debate was whether or not we were going to be able to cover people with a pre-existing condition,\u201d she said of the Affordable Care Act debate. \u201cIt is really rather remarkable that what we are doing, from whatever iteration you are from, is discussing the issue of universal health care.\u201d \u201cThere may be others who see this as a divide,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a divide. I hope that it is a healthy, robust debate about one of the most pressing issues on the mind of the public.\u201d With the presidential campaign kicking into gear after a midterm election dominated by health care, the issue will take center stage. Frontrunner Joe Biden is at odds with Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All rallying cry, recently calling instead for a more modest Medicare public option. Your cheat sheet to all the 2020 Democrats' 'Medicare for All' plans And Beto O\u2019Rourke has signaled his support for DeLauro\u2019s Medicare for America plan, touting the option to retain private insurance. \u201cWhat it says is, if you like your employer-sponsored insurance, you like the network that you\u2019re in, you like the doctors that you can see, you\u2019re happy with that, you can keep it,\u201d he said last month in New Hampshire. \u201cIf you do not like your employer-based insurance and want to enroll in Medicare, you can. If you have no insurance whatsoever or if you are under-insured today, you can enroll in Medicare as well.\u201d Medicare for America also has backing from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cConsumers who have private insurance through their employer, many of them like the private insurance through their employer,\u201d Neera Tanden, president and CEO of the center, told reporters during the phone call with Schakowsky and DeLauro on Wednesday. \u201cThe beauty of this legislation is that it maintains that choice.\u201d Tanden also pushed back on single-payer plans that would eliminate private insurance \u2013 \u201cWe think there are legitimate arguments for alternative paths, but we also believe that at the heart of the health care system, the United States has always maintained some degree of choice for consumers,\u201d she said. Democrats in Congress are grappling over how to handle the issue amid growing support for sweeping change from the progressive grassroots. On Tuesday, the House Rules Committee held the first ever congressional hearing on Medicare for All. Democrats turn attention to defending Obamacare as Congress waits for Mueller report The hearing was cordial; lawmakers and witnesses mostly stuck to the policy effects of Jayapal\u2019s plan. But progressive activist Ady Barkan, who is dying of ALS, also lit a fire under Democrats\u2019 seats, calling for swift action. \u201cSome people argue that although Medicare for All is a great idea, we need to move slowly to get there,\u201d Barkan said in his opening statement. \u201cBut I needed Medicare for All yesterday. Millions of people need it today. The time to pass this law is now.\u201d In order to pass their desired health care overhaul, Democrats would have to overcome internal disagreements in the House, win back the Senate, and potentially end the Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes to approve legislation. They could also try to pass the bill through budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes but can limit the subjects a bill can address. Republicans used reconciliation in 2017 to attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but they failed to win enough support for the measure within their own ranks. A bipartisan effort to expand Medicare, of course, is out of the question. Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, the top Republican on the committee, said Jayapal\u2019s bill was a \u201csocialist proposal that threatens freedom\u201d and emphasized that Republicans have a range of fundamental problems with the concept, such as its provision to allow federal dollars to pay for abortions. \u201cWhat Democrats are proposing today would completely change America\u2019s health care system, and not in my view, for the better,\u201d Cole said.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden has visited Iowa countless times over 32 years, in previous presidential bids and as vice president. But Tuesday was the first time he arrived in the state as the Democratic front-runner. And in his first stops in eastern Iowa, Biden acted as if he was already in a general election match-up with President Donald Trump. In the first minutes of a rally in Cedar Rapids, he again lambasted Trump over the 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, organized by white supremacists \u2013 where Trump responded to the killing of a counter-protester by claiming there had been \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d Biden mocked Trump for defending those words last week, saying he had \u201cdoubled down on concocting a phony story on how these violent thugs only wanted to protect\u201d the city\u2019s statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. \u201cEnough\u2019s enough, man. This is nonsense. The very rally was advertised \u2013 advertised \u2013 as a white supremacist rally,\u201d Biden said. He accused Trump of waking up each day eager to \u201cwage war on Twitter.\u201d \u201cEverybody knows who Donald Trump is,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure they know who we are \u2013 who I am.\u201d CNN Poll: Biden solidifies front-runner status with post-announcement bump Though he swung repeatedly at Trump, Biden pulled his punches when it came to other Democratic contenders. He deflected questions about Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 criticism of his votes for the Iraq war and the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 and signaled he would not be engaging with his primary foes anytime soon, saying there will be \u201cplenty of time on stage\u201d once the party\u2019s presidential debates begin in late June. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get in a debate with my colleagues here,\u201d he told reporters during a stop at an ice cream shop in Monticello. \u201cThey talk about, there\u2019s a division in the Democratic Party,\u201d Biden said later on Tuesday night in Dubuque. But, he added, \u201cwe agree on basically everything, all of us running \u2013 all 400 of us.\u201d The early days of Biden\u2019s presidential bid have been marked by Trump ignoring his advisers\u2019 urges and repeatedly attacking Biden in front of reporters and on Twitter \u2013 and Biden responding. The contrast has played perfectly into Biden\u2019s hands: One driving force behind his candidacy is a sense among Democratic primary voters that he would stand a better chance of defeating Trump in 2020 than the party\u2019s lesser-known and more progressive candidates. National polls on Tuesday found that Biden\u2019s entrance had helped him surge into the high-30s among Democratic voters \u2013 making him the clear front-runner with more than double the support of his two nearest opponents, Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has also seen her support grow in recent days. In Cedar Rapids, Janet Leonard, a retired teacher who lives in Manchester, said she backed Biden in the 2008 Democratic caucus and will again because she sees him as having the best shot at ousting Trump. \u201cJoe can not only get the Democrats, but the independents and even the Republicans who maybe voted for Trump but are not really happy,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he is the most electable candidate. No matter what, we have to get somebody who is going to beat Trump.\u201d Biden is also leaning heavily on one tool he has that no other Democrat can match: being former President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president. His campaign released a video Tuesday morning that featured Obama praising Biden in 2017 \u2013 even though Obama does not plan to endorse a candidate during the Democratic primary. Then, in Cedar Rapids, Biden called Obama an \u201cextraordinary man.\u201d \u201cHe was a president our kids could look up to,\u201d Biden said. An air of nostalgia hung over a basement room in Cedar Rapids, where several supporters came wearing blue and white \u201cBiden\u201d T-shirts from his 2008 campaign. Biden promised in what was his first stop as a 2020 candidate in Iowa that voters would \u201csee a heck of a lot of me,\u201d and that \u201cno one\u2019s going to work harder\u201d to earn Democratic caucus-goers\u2019 votes. Biden has so far kept his stump speeches relatively short and trimmed them of his past references to former Republican colleagues he liked and worked with. He has also left out policy positions that could be fodder for Democratic criticism, such as his support for free trade. Instead, Biden has touted an agenda that includes undoing Trump\u2019s tax breaks, increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour and \u201cmaking sure we finish the job on health care\u201d by creating a public option that would allow anyone to buy into Medicare. Pete Wernimont of Cedar Rapids, a longtime admirer of Biden, brought a copy of the former vice president\u2019s book, \u201cPromise Me, Dad\u201d for an autograph. As he walked away from the rally, he said he was nearly entirely sold on Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cI\u2019m about 80 to 90% there,\u201d he said, adding that he was also intrigued by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. For now, though, he believes Biden is the most electable Democrat in the race. \u201cTrump\u2019s going to have a real fight on his hands,\u201d Wernimont said. \u201cI believe Biden can beat him.\u201d Kerry Robertson, a retired veteran, showed up at the Veterans Memorial Building in downtown Cedar Rapids not realizing that his weekly card game with friends had been replaced by a Biden campaign stop. Robertson, who says he didn\u2019t like Trump or Hillary Clinton and instead voted for an independent \u2013 he can\u2019t remember which one \u2013 in 2016, said Biden had earned his support. \u201cIf he can do something to keep Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, that\u2019s what a hell of a lot of people depend on, you know?\u201d he said. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders is putting his supporters to work this weekend. Volunteers will host an estimated 5,000 house parties across the US and in 34 other countries on Saturday, the campaign said, as it launches the 2020 edition of its national organizing program \u2013 a grassroots effort that the independent senator from Vermont believes could be decisive in what is shaping up to be a tightly contested Democratic presidential primary. Sanders, along with campaign manager Faiz Shakir, campaign co-chair Nina Turner and campaign organizing director Claire Sandberg, will address the partygoers via remote broadcasts, and the campaign plans to launch a new app to help volunteers keep track of their voter contacts. In an interview Friday evening, Sanders touted the campaign\u2019s large and growing volunteer list as a strategic advantage in the crowded primary field and said the Saturday gatherings represent \u201cthe first manifestation of that.\u201d Bernie Sanders' appeal to women of color falls flat with She the People questioner \u201cYou will see in this campaign a lot of spontaneous activity that doesn\u2019t come from our national headquarters,\u201d Sanders said, nodding to the DIY culture that has sprung up around both his presidential bids. \u201cPeople in Memphis, Tennessee and Los Angeles, California, they\u2019re going to come up with an idea, they\u2019re going to use local artists and musicians. So this is our effort to build a political movement, which will help us win the primary, help us win the general election and, in my view, it is the only way we bring about the kind of fundamental reforms we need in this country.\u201d But ceding that amount of control to volunteers \u2013 people with no official ties to Sanders 2.0\u2019s more coherent structure \u2013 also invites some risk. Volunteers are offered scripts and \u201cprinciples\u201d by the campaign, but organizers on the payroll have no way of assuring the campaign\u2019s message remains constant or comes across how they might hope. \u201cThis is always the difficulty you have,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cSo if somebody in some city or some state says something that\u2019s dumb, we can be sure that the local media will pick up on it. But I think everybody understands that when you have over a million people involved in the political process, you know, people will say what they say.\u201d Bernie Sanders is the new No. 1 in our 2020 Democrat rankings If all goes according to plan, they will be saying a lot \u2013 to a lot of people. In 2016, the campaign told CNN last month, Sanders supporters \u2013 using a smaller version of its current field organizing strategy \u2013 hosted an estimated 80,000 volunteer events, made 85 million phone calls, sent 10 million peer-to-peer texts and knocked on 5 million doors. Veterans of the 2016 Sanders campaign went on to employ some of the same tactics in other races, most notably Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2018 near-miss challenge to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s presidential campaign kickoff was viewed by supporters, his campaign said at the time, at more than 1,000 organizing parties in every US state and territory. Sandberg said the information passed on to volunteers at the parties will help them keep tabs on persuadable voters, be they friends, family, neighbors or someone spotted on a bus wearing a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d T-shirt. \u201cIn 2016, volunteers purchased voter files on their own from secretaries of state so they could get out there and start knocking on doors and talking to voters,\u201d Sandberg said, describing a level of energy and amateur expertise that the 2020 campaign is trying to more efficiently translate into votes next year. This time around, even the guidelines provided by the campaign have a more strategic, studied vibe. The six-page list of \u201cprinciples\u201d offered to hosts warns volunteers against engaging in debates with the unconverted. They also include a reminder: Tread carefully \u2013 you are being watched. \u201cWhen we talk with voters about Bernie and his platform, each of us is the face of the campaign,\u201d the guide says. \u201cThe impression that we make matters, and we take that responsibility seriously. We treat everyone we encounter with care and respect, whether or not they agree with us.\u201d",

            "article_content": "First things first: The theme song of the week is from the television show \u201cJeopardy.\u201d Poll of the week: A new Kaiser Family Foundation poll finds that 52% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents prefer that Congress focus on improving and protecting the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) rather than passing a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan. Only 39% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want Congress to focus on passing a Medicare for All plan. What\u2019s the point: Much of the focus in this 2020 Democratic primary season has been on health care. That\u2019s not surprising, given that voters have generally listed it very high up when ranking their most important issues in deciding who they will choose in 2020. When it comes to health care, a lot of energy among the candidates has been for some form of a Medicare for All plan. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has led the charge, and many of the other major Democratic contenders have followed. Some have definitively not, however: former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas. They\u2019re calling more or less for protecting and expanding the ACA. That means this latest Kaiser poll suggests that many of the Democrats running for president may actually be in the minority. Now, to be clear, the split is closer when you average across the last five Kaiser polls on the subject taken since 2017. About 48% were, on average, for expanding and protecting the ACA and 44% wanted to go for Medicare for All. Additionally, most Democrats say they\u2019re in favor of Medicare for All in the abstract. Politics, though, usually involves a choice. The ACA remains wildly popular with Democrats. The polling is pretty indicative that the Democratic Party\u2019s electorate is, at minimum, divided on health care. There is plenty of room for candidates who want to argue for a more moderate approach. This seems to especially be the case when Democratic voters think that health care is being threatened. Democrats were more likely this month than last to say they want Congress to pursue protection of the ACA over going after Medicare for All. As Kaiser noted, this movement came after President Donald Trump\u2019s administration said last month that it agreed the ACA should be scrapped (Trump has since backed away from that position, saying Congress should wait until after the election before voting on an ACA replacement). The polling on the health care path preference of Democrats now looks most similar to when Republicans tried to essentially repeal the ACA in the summer of 2017. It\u2019s not difficult to see Democrats continuing to believe the ACA is in peril. Trump again knocked it at the National Rifle Association convention on Friday. Indeed, the debate over health care is indicative of what\u2019s being seen in the polling at large. Democrats are afraid of Trump and will do almost anything to stop him. For instance, Democrats  say they want their party to move in a more moderate direction, despite more Democrats identifying as liberal than at any point in recent history. To that end, they\u2019re more willing than usual to put forth an electable candidate than one who is ideologically pure. You can see this in the polling for the primary. The candidates who are more moderate on health care are cumulatively polling between 5 and 10 points ahead of the candidates who are for Medicare for All. Obviously, this isn\u2019t a one-for-one. That is, voters are not basing their choices solely on ideology. Further, a more liberal candidate who is able to sell themselves as electable will be in a strong position. Still, it\u2019s basically impossible to underestimate the presence of Trump in Democratic voters\u2019 minds. When push comes to shove, the polling indicates that, at least for now, many Democrats are more interested in a return to the pre-Trump era than pushing an ambitious liberal agenda \u2013 even on health care.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is kicking off his presidential bid with a fundraiser in Philadelphia on Thursday night that includes some of the biggest names in Pennsylvania state politics. Next month, he\u2019ll attend a Los Angeles fundraiser at the home of celebrity designer Michael Smith. And a fundraiser is in the planning stages in South Carolina, home to the first-in-the-South primary. It\u2019s an unusual move to hold a fundraising event on the very first day of a presidential campaign, but the former vice president\u2019s scramble for campaign money underscores how critical posting a big fundraising number will be to Biden\u2019s third bid for the presidency. Biden, the 20th Democratic candidate to enter the race, starts from behind. Nine of his Democratic rivals entered April with at least $6 million in cash reserves. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, the Republican National Committee and an affiliated committee have an even larger war chest: $82 million in the bank. Biden himself is aware of the challenge, telling supporters on a Wednesday conference call that he \u201cwould be judged\u201d by the fundraising performance in the opening days of the race, according to one person on the call. Biden supporters say they are off to a strong start. Home state allies, moderates in Congress quickly endorse Joe Biden's bid Alan Kessler, a Philadelphia lawyer and prominent Democratic fundraiser who is raising money for Biden, said he\u2019s had an \u201cunbelievable\u201d response to Thursday\u2019s fundraising event that organizers began planning only a week ago. \u201cI\u2019ve not made one call or one request where the recipient has said \u2018no,\u2019 Kessler told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m batting 1,000 in terms of responses.\u201d He\u2019s asking for $2,800 donations, the maximum an individual can donate in the primary. Kessler estimates about 100 or 125 people would attend the event at the home of Comcast executive David Cohen. But many more who can\u2019t attend also are sending in checks, Kessler said. Given Biden\u2019s near-universal name recognition, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s handicapped at all by getting in a little later than a number of the candidates,\u201d he added. Organizers hope to raise $500,000 at Thursday\u2019s event, according to a person involved in the planning. Richard Harpootlian, a lawyer in Columbia, South Carolina, who is in the early planning stages of a Biden fundraiser in the Palmetto State, said he raised $30,000 in 12 hours once it became clear that Biden was entering the race. \u201cIf other people are having the same experience, then fundraising won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Harpootlian told CNN. Harpootlian, a veteran of South Carolina politics, was an early backer of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign and raised money for both of Obama\u2019s successful White House bids. He said Biden will win support because he \u201cis the one person in this race\u201d who can oust Trump in the general election. \u201cDemocrats are more pragmatic than I have ever seen them in a presidential race,\u201d Harpootlian said. \u201cThe main goal is not about the green plan or \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 or any of those issues. It\u2019s about who can stop the pain, who can beat Donald Trump.\u201d The political action committee Biden established in 2017, American Possibilities, raised a respectable $2.6 million over the two-year midterm election cycle and spent nearly half a million dollars to support Democrats running for Congress last year. But Biden has never been a prolific fundraiser on his own. He raised roughly $11 million, including money transferred from his Senate campaign account, during his brief 2008 presidential bid. That was well short of his $20 million fundraising goal in the race. He dropped out following a weak showing in the Iowa caucuses. By comparison, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 the fundraising leader of the 2020 field \u2013 collected $18.2 million from individual contributors during the first 41 days of his candidacy. And in a sign of grassroots strength, small-dollar donations or $200 or less made up 84% of his haul. Even as some big-name Democratic bundlers have defected to other campaigns, Biden still has access to the pool of political financiers, such as Kessler and Harpootlian, who helped underwrite the Obama-Biden ticket\u2019s successful White House campaigns. The case for and against Joe Biden's 2020 chances A May 8 fundraiser in Los Angeles will he hosted by two other Obama bundlers \u2013 Smith, who decorated the Obama family\u2019s private quarters at the White House, and his husband James Costos, who served as US ambassador to Spain during the Obama administration. The Hollywood Reporter first reported on the event. Other bundlers plan to play the field before settling on a single candidate. Robert Wolf, a longtime Democratic donor and Wall Street veteran who raised money for Obama and Hillary Clinton, told CNN that he will donate $2,800 to Biden on Thursday to show early support. But he\u2019s still spreading his money around. He said he\u2019s donated to seven other Democratic candidates so far: New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, California Sen. Kamala Harris, California Rep. Eric Swalwell and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. \u201cIt\u2019s so early still,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cWe want a diverse slate, and we want people\u2019s voices to be heard.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Jessica Dean contributed to this report.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday that she would support impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump after reading special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments differ from Democratic leadership opting not to encourage impeachment. The report indicated that Mueller was unable to conclude that \u2018no criminal conduct occurred\u2019 on the issue of obstruction \u2013 and deemed Congress capable of determining that Trump obstructed justice. \u201cMueller\u2019s report is clear in pointing to Congress\u2019 responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President. It is our job as outlined in Article 1, Sec 2, Clause 5 of the US Constitution,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, promising to sign on to impeachment proceedings led by fellow freshman Democrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Here are 11 key lines from the Mueller report Ocasio-Cortez added, \u201cWhile I understand the political reality of the Senate + election considerations, upon reading this DoJ report, which explicitly names Congress in determining obstruction, I cannot see a reason for us to abdicate from our constitutionally mandated responsibility to investigate.\u201d The New York Democrat stressed that she has taken \u201cno pleasure in discussions of impeachment\u201d in office or on the campaign trail, and preferred to focus on her signature issues of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d healthcare policies and advocating for the Green New Deal to combat climate change. \u201cBut the report squarely puts this on our doorstep,\u201d she said. Special counsel prosecutors determined that Congress still has the ability to find the President obstructed justice. \u201cWith respect to whether the President can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the Constitution, we concluded that Congress has the authority to prohibit a President\u2019s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice,\u201d the team wrote. More senior House Democrats took a more cautious tone than Ocasio-Cortez in interpreting the redacted report\u2019s release. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told CNN earlier Thursday that \u201cimpeachment is not worthwhile at this point,\u201d while House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said that impeachment is \u201cone possibility\u201d among others that the caucus could use to hold Trump accountable.",

Bernie Sanders is not hiding the fact that everyone\u2019s taxes would go up under his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, though the rich would be hit with several extra levies. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told the audience at a Fox News town hall in Pennsylvania that his plan would ultimately save most Americans money because it would eliminate premiums, deductibles and co-pays, which cost a typical family of four $28,000 a year. \u201cBut does that mean you\u2019re not going to pay something? Of course it does. You\u2019re going to pay more in taxes,\u201d said Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said at the town hall on Monday. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people are going to end up paying less for health care because they\u2019re not paying premiums, co-payments and deductibles.\u201d Your cheat sheet to all the 2020 Democrats' 'Medicare for All' plans Health care is dominating the debate of the 2020 election, with Democrats divided over whether to aim high with Medicare for All or take a more moderate approach. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump and Republicans say the universal health care concept is too expensive and would undermine the current Medicare program for senior citizens. Sanders hasn\u2019t provided a comprehensive analysis of how much the plan \u2013 which he reintroduced last week with expanded long-term care benefits that will add to the price tag \u2013 will cost or how how he will pay for it. Analyses conducted by different think tanks on his previous proposals suggest the price tag could be as much as $32 trillion over 10 years. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget looked at the plan Sanders unveiled during the 2016 presidential campaign, which included an array of taxes on the rich and on all Americans. The proposal would cost $25 trillion over a decade, but only raise $11 trillion in taxes, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the committee. \u201cHis plan still doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d Goldwein said in an interview with CNN. The other main Medicare for All bill \u2013 a very similar effort sponsored by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, in February \u2013 also lacks a financing plan. Neither are expected to get far in the current Congress. Other proposals to expand Medicare to younger Americans or add a government-run plan to the Affordable Care Act exchanges would largely be paid for through premiums, like current insurance plans are. Bernie Sanders to unveil new Medicare for all bill as the party rallies around Obamacare In his rollout this month, Sanders provided a list of potential revenue-raising options, including new levies \u2013 which he calls \u201cincome-based premiums\u201d \u2013 on people and on employers. Americans would pay 4% of their income, exempting the first $29,000 for a family of four. Companies would be charged 7.5% of payroll, exempting the first $2 million to protect small businesses. These are higher amounts than what Sanders proposed during his 2016 presidential run. At that time, he called for a new 2.2% income tax on all Americans and a 6.2% levy on employers to pay for Medicare for All. Sanders, however, would also hike taxes on the rich. He wants to increase the top income tax rate to 70% for those making above $10 million, raise rates on unearned income, such as capital gains, and limit tax deductions for those in the top tax bracket. Plus, he would establish a tax on \u201cextreme wealth,\u201d and raise the top estate tax rate to 77% on inheritances above $1 billion. He would also impose a fee on large financial institutions. A Sanders spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment. Tax experts, however, say that you can\u2019t raise enough money from taxing the rich and that the levies on all Americans may exceed the savings for more people than Sanders expects. This may be particularly true of low-income folks who get heavily subsidized coverage on the Obamacare exchanges. \u201cTo generate the kind of revenue that Sanders is talking about to pay for something as big as his version of Medicare for All \u2026 would be vastly more expensive than any of the kinds of things he\u2019s talking about,\u201d said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to come up with more money from some place.\u201d",

Buttigieg cast his candidacy as a direct rebuttal to Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 including his slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2013 and highlighted his belief that the country needs both a generational change and an entirely different political figure to lead the country past Trump. Buttigieg\u2019s argument is that he, a gay, veteran mayor from the Midwest, is just that kind of different politician. Here are the 18 Democrats who have said they're running for president \u201cMy name is Pete Buttigieg. They call me Mayor Pete,\u201d Buttigieg said to cheers. \u201cI am a proud son of South Bend, Indiana. And I am running for President of the United States.\u201d He said: \u201cI recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor. More than a little bold\u2014at age 37\u2014to seek the highest office in the land. \u2026 But we live in a moment that compels us each to act.\u201d The South Bend mayor is the fastest-rising Democratic candidate in the crowded presidential field and his decision to exit the lengthy exploratory portion of his 2020 bid comes at a time when a series of polls have shown Buttigieg to be firmly among candidates like Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, a far cry from when he was receiving less than 1% of support in some polls months ago. His recent star power showed through in a flurry of donations after his announcement, with supporters contributing more than $1 million to Buttigieg\u2019s campaign in the four hours following his speech Sunday, his campaign communications adviser Lis Smith tweeted. Buttigieg used his hometown as a character in his announcement, including the fact that he, over the last eight years, had overseen a renewal in South Bend\u2019s city center. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way for us to go. Life here is far from perfect. But we\u2019ve changed our trajectory and shown a path forward for communities like ours. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today. To tell a different story than \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019\u201d Buttigieg said, the rain audibly beating down on the steel roof above him as the lectern in front of him visibly took on water. \u201cBecause there is a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities: the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s time to walk away from the politics of the past, and toward something totally different. \u2026 That\u2019s why, this time, it\u2019s not just about winning an election\u2014it\u2019s about winning an era.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s launch took place inside the rain soaked and once bustling Studebaker plant that, when hollowed out after the company left in 1963, was a tangible symbol of his hometown\u2019s march toward decay. The building stood as a symbol of what Buttigieg hopes to deliver to the country: While the mayor announced on the rusted factory floor, just a doorway away stood the portion of the building that had been revitalized into a gleaming incubator to tech startups. Buttigieg addressed a few hundred people in the event\u2019s outdoor and fully uncovered overflow area. \u201cI am impressed by the people standing inside,\u201d he said, the rain hitting his uncovered head. \u201cI am moved by the people standing outside because this is what the beginning of a new American spring looks like.\u201d It has been a whirlwind few weeks for Buttigieg: The mayor has crisscrossed the country looking to seize on the boost he received from a well-reviewed CNN town hall in early March, hopscotching between early nominating states and a string of fundraisers in Democratic strongholds like San Francisco, Chicago and New York. By Buttigieg\u2019s own admission, the experience has been \u201cheady,\u201d but now, the mayor said, it\u2019s time to make it official. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve explored is that we\u2019re exploring some really beautiful territory and now it\u2019s time to make it official and announce a decision,\u201d Buttigieg said on Friday as he made his way back to South Bend after a whirlwind trip through California that included an appearance on \u201cEllen\u201d and a top dollar fundraiser in the Bay Area. Buttigieg announced the exploratory committee at a January news conference in Washington, DC. He told CNN in late March that while, \u201call of the indicators are pointing\u201d toward an official campaign, \u201ca launch is something you only get to do once, and we\u2019re not going to do that until we have all of the pieces in place.\u201d It wasn\u2019t always the plan to launch the campaign inside Studebaker\u2019s former factory. Initially, Buttigieg\u2019s nascent team has planned to basically shut down parts of South Bend\u2019s downtown and hold an outdoor rally in the heart of the city center that has been revived under the mayor\u2019s tenure. Rain and wind meant they had to change plans, but Buttigieg said there is a silver lining in the change. \u201cThe rain location may be a blessing in disguise because there is such symbolic power in that building and you can see in it the past, the present and the future,\u201d Buttigieg said before the event. \u201cI talk so much about how we\u2019re not looking to turn back the clock and it\u2019s not about retrieving some impossible again. That building is kind of a living symbol of all of that.\u201d The building has recently been repurposed. It now anchors South Bend\u2019s Renaissance District and houses a mix of technology companies, including South Bend Code School and an Amazon Web Services company, a symbol of how his leadership as mayor over the last eight years helped revitalize portions of the city. Pete Buttigieg pushed an aggressive plan to revitalize South Bend. Not everyone felt its benefits. Buttigieg\u2019s speech covered a range of policy issues. The mayor called for sweeping Democratic reforms on voting and in the judicial system, called climate change \u201ca life and death issue for our generation\u201d and said he wants to make sure every American has access to Medicare. But the best-received lines in Buttigieg\u2019s speech were when the mayor attacked Trump or spoke about his personal life, namely his marriage to Chasten Buttigieg. The mayor spoke at length about wishing he could tell his younger self \u2013 who wondered \u201cwhat it means when he sometimes feels a certain way about young men he sees in the hall at school\u201d \u2013 that he would be accepted. \u201cTo tell him that one rainy April day, before he even turns 40, he\u2019ll wake up to headlines about whether he\u2019s rising too quickly into becoming a top-tier contender for the American presidency. And to tell him that on that day he announces his campaign for president, he\u2019ll do it with his husband looking on,\u201d Buttigieg said to cheers. He added earlier: \u201cOur marriage exists by the grace of a single vote on the US Supreme Court. Nine men and women sat down in a room and took a vote and they brought me the most important freedom in my life.\u201d Buttigieg cast Trump as a backward-looking politician who has looked to use fear as a way to gain power. \u201cThe horror show in Washington is mesmerizing, all-consuming,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cBut starting today, we are going to change the channel.\u201d Buttigieg was introduced on Sunday by three mayors \u2013 Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton, Ohio; Christopher Cabaldon, the mayor of West Sacramento, California; and Steve Adler, the mayor of Austin, Texas \u2013 all of whom highlighted a different aspect of Buttigieg\u2019s record and candidacy. \u201cAre we aware that we are making history,\u201d said Cabaldon, who himself is gay. \u201cEven as the chair of America\u2019s LGBT mayors, I couldn\u2019t even dream of this moment four months ago.\u201d Adler\u2019s endorsement was significant because two other Texans \u2013 former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 are already running for president. Adler even spoke at an O\u2019Rourke event earlier this year. \u201cI think you give consideration to endorse a lot of people. Beto is a really good guy. Juli\u00e1n is a really good guy. And they are both friends. Just not as close as Pete. The one that I have seen that is really the most spectacular is Pete,\u201d Adler said. Although Buttigieg made his announcement official on Sunday, he officially dropped \u201cexploratory\u201d from his committee with the Federal Election Commission on Friday. Buttigieg\u2019s committee has been shoestring for months. According to the Buttigieg aide, the committee currently has 32 people on staff and plans to get to 45 or 50 staffers by the end of the month. That initially small staff has meant the mayor has spent very little of the $7 million his team raised in 2019\u2019s first fundraising quarter. According to the aide, Buttigieg\u2019s first quarter fundraising report will show he only has a burn rate of less than 10%, a number far smaller than other candidates, like Warren, whose campaign announced earlier this month her burn rate was more than 85%. \u201cPete\u2019s a different kind of candidate and we want to build a different kind of campaign,\u201d said Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to a top down, consultant-laden operation. We want to be more like a startup, and we want to build in a smart way and a steady way.\u201d Schmuhl said that, right now, the campaign does not have any pollsters or consultants. While he didn\u2019t rule them out in the future, Schmuhl said the campaign is looking to be \u201cnimble as we go along.\u201d The campaign has already opened a campaign headquarters in South Bend, two small suites in the Jefferson Centre building. The campaign also has plans to open a small office in Chicago, where a few aides will live and, given the relatively small size of South Bend\u2019s airport, the candidate and campaign aides will work ahead of flights around the country. Buttigieg\u2019s rise has also seen him get accepted to the upper echelon of Democratic donors, many of whom are looking to donate to multiple candidates as the field continues to grow. \u201cI said to him I will do whatever you need. If it is raising money, I will raise money, if it is talking to people in the national network, I am all in,\u201d said Steve Grossman, a former DNC chair who endorsed Buttigieg days ago. Another one of those donors is Susie Tompkins Buell, who \u2013 while supporting Harris \u2013 also hosted a fundraiser for Buttigieg and around 150 donors on Thursday in the Bay Area. \u201cHe made a very big impression on, I think, everyone. He is very authentic, and this is what people are craving,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is one thing he has in common with the current president: What you see is what you get. Otherwise, they are complete opposites.\u201d Pete Buttigieg's not-so-secret weapon is his husband, Chasten The mayor has also not been the only Buttigieg to experience a bump in notoriety. So, too, has Chasten Buttigieg, the mayor\u2019s husband and a teacher, who has become an omnipresent feature of political Twitter and, according to aides, is slated to do a number of solo speeches, primarily to LGBTQ and education groups. Buttigieg will follow up his announcement with a trip to New York for a low-dollar fundraiser in Brooklyn on Monday, followed by a two-day trip to Iowa on Tuesday and Wednesday.

            "article_content": "A federal appeals court on Wednesday granted a Trump administration request to expedite oral arguments in a case challenging the legality of the Affordable Care Act. The new time frame \u2013 with arguments in early July \u2013 means that the fate of Obamacare could come before the Supreme Court next term, with an opinion rendered by June of 2020 in the heart of the presidential campaign. As in 2016 and the 2018 midterms, health care has already emerged as a core issue, though there are fissures in both parties. Congressional Democrats have rallied around Obamacare, while some of the party\u2019s presidential nominees are supporting \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plans that would offer universal, government-backed health coverage. President Donald Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on repealing the law, has promised that Republicans will pass a \u201creally great\u201d health care plan after the 2020 election, although none has been proposed. Trump says GOP will be the party of health care but provides no plan The administration last month sided with Republican-led states that are pushing for the law to be invalidated by the courts. Attorney General William Barr said Wednesday he believes the Justice Department\u2019s decision not to argue in favor of upholding the Affordable Care Act is a \u201cdefensible legal position to take.\u201d Initially, the Trump administration argued that two key provisions of the law that protect people with pre-existing conditions could no longer be defended, but the rest of the law could stand. But after a district court ruled in December 2018 that the entire law should be invalidated, the Justice Department changed its position and argues the district court ruling should be upheld in full. As the administration debated its litigation strategy, Barr at first opposed to fully striking down the law. On Wednesday, he suggested that he is ready to back the administration\u2019s position. When California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein pressed on why Barr, as attorney general, didn\u2019t think it was his \u201cduty to defend\u201d the current law, Barr doubled down. \u201cWell, the law was originally upheld because the (individual) mandate was upheld as a tax,\u201d Barr said of the 2012 Supreme Court decision that upheld the law. The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare \u201cOnce the penalty was removed, the financial penalty was removed, that provision could no longer be justified as a tax which means that it would have to fall. So the mandate fell,\u201d he added, referring to Congress\u2019 decision in 2017 to effectively remove the penalty for not having insurance. \u201cThen the question becomes if the mandate falls, even though there was no penalty attached to it, what\u2019s its impact on the rest of the statute? Four of the justices in the (2012 case) felt that the whole statute had to fall. So, as I said before you arrived, senator, you know at the end of the day, I felt that this was defensible legal position to take.\u201d RELATED: The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare Feinstein also pressed Barr on who in the administration changed its stance. \u201cIs this determined by the White House?\u201d she asked. Barr said that it was \u201cdetermined by the process within the executive branch\u201d and a \u201cnumber of different players.\u201d \u201cWell, I assume you wouldn\u2019t take this position unless this is what the President wanted,\u201d Feinstein added. \u201cWell \u2013 that would be a safe assumption,\u201d Barr said. The administration\u2019s latest court filing came after months of heated internal debate that pitted Barr along with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar against acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and officials aligned with him, a source close to the White House told CNN at the time. Trump attorney general on ACA lawsuit: 'Let the courts do their job' Overturning the law would have far-reaching consequences \u2013 way beyond disrupting coverage for the millions of people who get their health insurance on the exchanges or through Medicaid expansion. Obamacare saves senior citizens money on their Medicare coverage and prescription drugs. It lets many Americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. And it allows children to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until they turn 26. Because the Trump administration is no longer defending the law in court, a coalition of 21 Democratic states led by California has stepped in to do so. \u201cBefore the ACA, 133 million Americans faced barriers to coverage because of a pre-existing condition like diabetes or pregnancy \u2013 yes, pregnancy,\u201d California\u2019s Attorney General Becerra said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe will be in court defending Americans\u2019 healthcare that President Trump seeks to strip from them, \u201d he added. Barr\u2019s comments on Wednesday came after he faced a similar grilling from members of the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday on the new decision. At one point during the hearing, he told Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Pennsylvania Democrat, that concerned lawmakers should \u201clet the courts do their job.\u201d Mulvaney said over the weekend that the White House could introduce a proposal \u201cfairly shortly.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kate Sullivan and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that the White House plans to release an Obamacare replacement plan before the 2020 election, after hosting top administration officials at Camp David over the weekend for a meeting on health care. \u201cI do think you\u2019ll see a plan here fairly shortly,\u201d Mulvaney told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d White House aides and administration officials \u2013 including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2013 huddled at the historic Maryland property on Saturday to discuss the general path forward for President Trump\u2019s health care policy, White House aides said. The talks ranged from messaging strategies to lowering drug prices to individual health insurance marketplaces. And while Trump this week ruled out taking a vote on an Affordable Care Act alternative prior to the election amid Republican resistance to the prospect, Mulvaney said the forthcoming plan would provide GOP candidates with campaign fodder. \u201cRepublicans have better ideas than Democrats. We should not be afraid to talk about that,\u201d Mulvaney said on Fox News. \u201cWe want to run on this.\u201d Trump stunned Republicans late last month when he paired his administration\u2019s decision to back an Obamacare court challenge with a call for the GOP to develop a legislative replacement. White House allies, lawmakers and even members of Trump\u2019s own staff were caught off guard when the Justice Department filed a brief in court supporting the complete invalidation of the Affordable Care Act, without preparing anything to take its place should that ruling stand. Unhappy with the President\u2019s decision to plunge the party back into a battle it lost less than two years ago, Republicans said they would await guidance from the White House. Trump, in turn, said he would ask GOP senators to craft a plan \u2013 leaving the White House and Congress pointing fingers at each other over who should take the lead in writing health care policy. White House aides have cited Graham-Cassidy, a health care proposal floated in 2017, as their starting point for the development of a plan. But even Trump\u2019s legislative team was surprised by the news that the President wanted a renewed focus on health care, and the administration has scrambled to come up with a plan that did not exist before Trump waded back into the issue. Top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, privately attempted to persuade Trump that a health care push would not only fail, but backfire on Republicans running up and down the ticket in 2020, multiple sources told CNN last week. Trump on Wednesday claimed he never intended to request a vote before next year\u2019s election, noting he had \u201cvery talented people\u201d working on a replacement plan for him. \u201cIt will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThis will be a great campaign issue.\u201d Democrats running in 2018 midterm races seized on voters\u2019 concerns about health care, and their heavy focus on the issue helped propel enough candidates to victory in Republican-held districts that the GOP lost control of the House in November. Now, Democratic presidential hopefuls are spending significant time on the campaign trail talking about health care \u2013 with many candidates promoting universal programs like \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Mulvaney on Sunday argued Republicans, who tried unsuccessfully in 2017 to pass health care reform when they controlled both chambers of Congress, need competing ideas to present to voters in 2020. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat something with nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats have already admitted that Obamacare doesn\u2019t work \u2013 that\u2019s why they\u2019re out there talking about this amorphous Medicare for All,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "House Democrats are taking their first steps to fulfill their promises to strengthen Obamacare and lower drug prices, as the fate of the Affordable Care Act promises to be a major 2020 election issue. After a marathon session Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed a dozen bills aimed at undoing several of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to weaken Obamacare and at bringing generic drugs to the market faster. \u201cWe were able to move forward in a bipartisan way on bills that will help bring generic drugs to market faster, which will make medications more affordable,\u201d said Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, D-New Jersey. The vote comes after a topsy-turvy two weeks for the landmark health care law. The Trump administration said early last week that it agrees with the ruling of a federal judge in Texas that invalidated the law. President Donald Trump then briefly renewed his quest to repeal and replace Obamacare, before being shut down by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and declaring there would be a GOP health care effort after the 2020 election. Here's what the GOP plans for health care look like The health care bills approved this week steered clear of the more controversial measures that Democrats are batting about, including \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and permitting drug importation from Canada. The legislation, approved largely along party lines, would restore funding for Obamacare outreach and enrollment assistance, which the Trump administration slashed, and provide funding for more states to set up their own insurance exchanges. It also includes a bill that would reverse the administration\u2019s rule making it easier to buy short-term health insurance plans, which don\u2019t have to adhere to all of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules. And the package would rescind guidance to states that allows them to upend the exchanges and provides $10 billion to states to establish reinsurance programs that lower premiums by protecting insurers from high-cost enrollees. A vote in the full House has not yet been scheduled, but it\u2019s unlikely these measures will be approved in the Republican-led Senate. The committee also approved a set of relatively small-scale bills aimed at reducing drug prices by increasing competition from generic drugs. It hopes to increase the sharing of information and to combat the steps brand-name drug makers take to slow the development and marketing of lower-cost generic alternatives. One more notable bill, titled the CREATES Act, would make it easier for manufacturers of generics to get the brand name samples they need for testing. This legislation, which had been stalled, passed unanimously after the two parties reached an agreement. Partisan squabbles shadow Congress' efforts to lower drug prices \u201cThis will make a real difference for many Americans and this just goes to show that when we work together, we can achieve real results,\u201d said Oregon Republican Rep. Greg Walden, the committee\u2019s ranking member, and Texas Rep. Michael C. Burgess, the top Republican on the health subcommittee.",

Other Democrats, from Sen. Elizabeth Warren to Former US Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke have made clear they\u2019re not socialists, but capitalists with caveats. There\u2019s something to Trump\u2019s attacks. In a recent NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll, 50% of US adults said they viewed socialism either somewhat or very negatively compared to just 18% who said they had a positive view of socialism. Just 25% of people in that poll said they\u2019d be enthusiastic about or comfortable with a socialist presidential candidate while 72% said they would be uncomfortable or have some reservations with a socialist presidential candidate. That was the least popular candidate attribute tested, although there were clear reservations about a candidate over the age of 75. The generational flaw in Trump's anti-socialism campaign South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg pushes what he calls democratic capitalism and argues the country is actually to the left of Congress and the Democratic Party on everything from gun laws to health care. He said Thursday on Good Morning America that Trump\u2019s strategy won\u2019t work. Buttigieg was asked by George Stephanopoulos about an essay he wrote in 2000 that won a national Profiles in Courage essay contest and whether his thoughts then were a liability now. The essay by then-high schooler Buttigieg praised Sanders, then a six-term 59-year-old lawmaker, for being a proud socialist in a time of poll-tested centrism. Buttigieg said centrism had led to cynicism among voters and that was, \u201cperhaps, the greatest threat to the continued success of the American political system.\u201d First, Buttigieg made clear to Stephanopoulos he wasn\u2019t necessarily applauding Sanders for his socialism. \u201cWhat I was praising Sen. Sanders for was for being honest about what he believed, and I think we need more of that,\u201d said Buttigieg. But then Buttigieg said something interesting about Trump\u2019s attacks \u2013 that they\u2019re worn out and from a different generation. A big part of Buttigieg\u2019s own argument is that American politics needs generational change, which is notable given the reservations voters have about candidates over the age of 75. Former Vice President Joe Biden is 76, Sanders is 77 and Trump is 72. The capitalist socialist populist manifesto of Democrats in 2020 \u201cThe President is adopting a tactic that takes us back to the darkest days of the \u201950s when you could use the word \u2018socialist\u2019 to kill somebody\u2019s career, or to kill an idea, but that trick has been tried so many times that I think it\u2019s losing all meaning,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act was a conservative idea that Democrats borrowed and they called that \u2018socialist.\u2019 So it\u2019s kind of like the boy who cried wolf. It\u2019s lost all power I think, especially for my generation of voters.\u201d Invoking that generational difference could work to the advantage of 37-year-old Buttigieg, who was born decades after the 1950s ended. Among the Democratic proposals Trump says is socialist is Sanders\u2019 plan for Medicare for all, which would take over the private health insurance industry and replace it with a government-run system. Medicare for all has become something of a catchphrase this year for Democrats. Most presidential candidates don\u2019t support a Sanders-style system, but all of them seem to like that phrase, Medicare for all. Trump clearly has a game plan for socialism in 2020 Buttigieg told Stephanopoulos he supports Medicare for all, but not in the Sanders mold. He said he\u2019d rather offer a public option and then said he thought people would choose that over the private market. \u201cYou might call it medicare for all who want it,\u201d said Buttigieg. \u201cYou take a version of Medicare, you let anybody who wants to buy into it buy into it, and then if people like me are right that that\u2019s going to be a preferred option that very naturally becomes a kind of glide path toward a Medicare for all environment, but it also dares the corporate world to come up with a better solution than what they\u2019ve done so far.\u201d There will be no room for that level of nuance in Trump\u2019s telling (or even Sanders\u2019 for that matter). In fact, the day after he spoke to Republicans about socialism, Trump was tweeting about health care. \u201cEverybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn\u2019t work. Premiums & deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance,\u201d Trump tweeted, promising Republicans would come up with a plan of their own. But he won\u2019t push any votes until after 2020, after, presumably, his war on the socialists is over.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump wants to kill Obamacare, but it will be a lot harder for him to fulfill his own health care promises without the landmark health reform law. Trump has made combating the opioid crisis and lowering drug prices top priorities of his administration. More recently, he promised to wipe out HIV in the US. The Affordable Care Act is key to achieving these goals. In fact, Trump officials are relying on the law for certain proposals, particularly to advance their ideas to reduce drug prices. At the same time, however, the administration is doubling down on trying to overturn Obamacare. In a surprise move last week, the Department of Justice said it agreed with the ruling of a federal judge in Texas that invalidated the landmark health reform law. The case is now in a federal appeals court. Trump punts on health care until after the 2020 election Eliminating Obamacare could leave roughly 20 million more people without health insurance, according to a recent Urban Institute report. The President said this week that he will not push for a replacement plan until after the 2020 election. Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion provision has been critical to giving opioid addicts access to treatment. Many of them are poor, childless adults who were shut out of Medicaid before the law made additional federal funds available to help states pay for expanding access to the program. Some 12.7 million people were covered under expansion programs throughout the US in fiscal 2017, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The share of those diagnosed with opioid addictions and who filled prescriptions for medication to treat the condition both rose sharply among Medicaid expansion enrollees in West Virginia between 2014 and 2016, according to a new study published in Health Affairs. Here's what happens if the courts kill Obamacare Many policies available to individual buyers prior to the Affordable Care Act either didn\u2019t cover substance abuse or had limited benefits and high co-pays, said Dr. Richard Frank, a health economics professor at Harvard who worked for the Obama administration. The law also provided more funding for community health centers, which assist many people living in rural areas, which have been hard hit by the epidemic. If Medicaid expansion disappears, the gains made in fighting the crisis could vanish, as well. \u201cOne of the reasons we are starting to see a plateau in overdose deaths is more people beginning to access effective treatment,\u201d said Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University. \u201cRepealing Medicaid expansion will kick people off the rolls. We can expect overdose deaths to start going up again.\u201d Eliminating Medicaid expansion could also hurt efforts to eradicate HIV since many of those infected are drug addicts who spread the disease by sharing needles, Frank said. The administration is also leaning on Obamacare to try to lower drug prices. The law created the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, which supports experimenting with different payment models. For instance, officials have proposed using the center to test settling the reimbursement level for certain pricey drugs administered in doctors\u2019 offices and hospital outpatient centers based on their cost in other countries, which typically pay far less. Trump outlined this plan with much fanfare at the Department of Health & Human Services in October. Trump leans into midterms with a pitch to un-rig Medicare drug prices The Affordable Care Act also increased the minimum rebates that pharmaceutical companies must pay in Medicaid and created the approval process for biosimilar drugs, which are cheaper versions of complex, costly medications known as biologics. It also required that insurers offering individual policies to cover prescription drugs and eliminated annual and lifetime caps on benefits, which is important for those who take pricey medicines. \u201cIf the ACA were struck down, it would increase drug prices across the board,\u201d said Rachel Sachs, an associate law professor at Washington University.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s surprising new position last week on taking another legislative run at repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act left Republican lawmakers scrambling in his wake. But several, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, took a proven path to try and talk Trump down from what they saw as an untenable position on the divisive issue: talk to him directly. Over the course of several days, Republican lawmakers attempted to dissuade Trump from his stated idea that Republicans should craft a new replacement plan, according to multiple sources. The focus, some argued, should be on prescription drug costs. But definitely staying away from a fractious intraparty debate that House Republicans like Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy firmly believe cost the GOP the House in the 2018 midterms. Or in what several sources called the most persuasive argument: framing the election around Democratic calls for Medicare-for-all. That was a specific message from McConnell in a weekend phone call, the sources said. Trump punts on health care until after the 2020 election The point was that with Democratic presidential candidates \u2013 not to mention the energy of the progressive base \u2013 are lining up behind the proposal, it provided a ripe target for the party. Add to that any Senate Republican effort this Congress would be completely rebuffed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and that defending Obamacare was a unifying issue for Democrats. It makes political sense, rather, for Republicans to be patient rather than throw out their own \u2013 potentially unpopular \u2013 plans. \u201c(Trump) has some big ideas and to his credit wants to solve problems. That\u2019s what leaders do,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota. \u201cBut you run into that wall of reality at some point, and, I think, trying to convey what the obstacles are to getting done what he wants done, done in the next two years, is something a number of our members conveyed to him.\u201d Republican campaign arms and outside groups had already launched initial salvos attacking the Medicare-for-all proposal, (or in McConnell\u2019s parlance: \u201cMedicare-for-none\u201d) and are working on shifting the focus at this stage could create new openings for frontline Democratic candidates and risks for Trump himself. McConnell and other Republican lawmakers have also already spent time attacking Democrats on the proposal in floor speeches and press conferences themselves. \u201cI look forward to seeing what the President is proposing and what he can work out with the speaker,\u201d McConnell told Politico in a brief interview last week. \u201cI am focusing on stopping the \u2018Democrats\u2019 Medicare for none\u2019 scheme.\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s calls with McConnell. The calls, especially McConnell\u2019s, had an impact on the President, who, according to one of the sources, secured the commitment that Trump would instead focus his energy on attacking Medicare-for-all and wait to see what the election led to before moving forward on any legislative efforts. It was a framing reflected by the President himself in a tweet thread Monday night, that amounted to a full flip from his claims last week, and once again displays his haphazard approach to policymaking. \u201cEverybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cPremiums & deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance.\u201d \u201cThe Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare,\u201d Trump said. \u201cVote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House.\u201d But one White House official said Trump\u2019s tweets \u201cshouldn\u2019t be misunderstood to mean we won\u2019t be pushing our own version of health care \u2013 basically health care policy principles.\u201d The official said Trump is acknowledging the reality that there is not much hope for \u201cTrumpcare\u201d \u2013 whatever that plan might be \u2013 to make it through a Democratic-controlled House. \u201cHe\u2019s just being realistic that there\u2019s no room for bipartisanship on this prior to 2020,\u201d the official said. A separate senior White House official said Trump is simply stating more explicitly what White House aides have always known: that there will be no bill to replace Obamacare that can get through this Congress. However, the official said \u201cthere is every intention of having a proposal\u201d that Republicans can put on the table. And yet, multiple White House officials Tuesday morning declined to commit that the President would actually release a plan before the 2020 election. When asked by CNN if the President will commit to releasing a plan before the election, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said she would not answer the question, saying only the President wants to talk about \u201cprinciples.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, Abby Phillip and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Congressional Democrats are locking arms to protect the Affordable Care Act \u2013 the party\u2019s signature achievement during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency \u2013 as President Donald Trump renews his efforts to repeal it. With one prominent exception. In media interviews last week, Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 among the front-runners for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination \u2013 pointedly refused to endorse legislation that House Democrats had introduced to expand the ACA and to block Trump administration initiatives designed to weaken some of its core consumer protections. Instead, Sanders underscored his support for replacing the ACA with \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation, in which government would become the \u201csingle payer\u201d for virtually all health care services. \u201cThe incremental reform that I support,\u201d Sanders told The New York Times, \u201cis phasing in \u2018Medicare for All.\u2019 \u201d Even when Sanders later wrote on Twitter that Democrats \u201cmust defend the ACA from Trump\u2019s assault,\u201d he did not specifically endorse the House bill and sharply added that \u201cprotecting the ACA will not fully solve the health care crisis.\u201d Sanders\u2019 cool posture toward the House legislation crystallizes the critical choice Democrats face on health care. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that Republicans would seek to replace the ACA after the 2020 election, thus increasing the chances voters view the race as a referendum on whether to rescind the law. With Trump again emphasizing his determination to undo the ACA \u2013 both by backing litigation that would invalidate the entire law and by proposing to replace it with block grants for states in his latest budget \u2013 Democrats must decide how to respond. The choice is whether to center the party\u2019s 2020 health care message on defending and reinforcing the ACA or to offer their own fundamental change by proposing to replace the law with a single-payer plan that would eliminate virtually all private health insurance. That choice, in turn, illuminates the broader crossroads awaiting Democrats in the 2020 election. More than any of his rivals, Sanders is betting that voters are open to fundamental changes that would vastly expand government\u2019s role in the economy. Although the party\u2019s center of gravity has undeniably moved left since the Vermont independent\u2019s unexpectedly strong showing against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, almost all of the other contenders \u2013 with the arguable exception of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2013 are offering more incremental changes that accept greater limits on government, both in cost and degree of control over the private-sector economy. The congressional Democratic leadership is tilting clearly toward the latter camp, for instance by stressing the legislation to repair the ACA rather than the single-payer proposal that excites the left. Almost all leading Democrats are now receptive to a greater role for government than in the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton famously declared, \u201cThe era of big government is over.\u201d Even compared with Obama, most of the 2020 field is offering proposals, on everything from increasing teacher pay (Sen. Kamala Harris of California) to imposing a wealth tax (Warren), that envision a more expansive \u2013 and expensive \u2013 role for Washington in driving economic and social change. But the question of how much change \u2013 and how great a role for government \u2013 the electorate will accept looms as a key dividing line in the 2020 Democratic race. That will be especially true if former Vice President Joe Biden enters the race as expected. With his long roots in more centrist Democratic politics, Biden would likely question whether vanguard liberal goals such as a government takeover of health care, the near-term elimination of fossil fuels, or tuition-free public higher education are electorally feasible, or even desirable from a policy perspective. An extensive new poll of likely Democratic primary voters released Friday by Third Way, a centrist Democratic group, offers some hints on how this debate may unfold. The survey, conducted March 7 to 10 by Democratic pollster David Binder, generally found most Democratic voters leaning toward incremental change rather than a radical restructuring of government and the economy. That instinct surfaced across an array of questions: Still, detailed results found a greater constituency for fundamental change among likely Democratic voters younger than 35. Nearly two-fifths of them in the survey, far more than older generations, preferred a candidate who called themselves a Democratic socialist rather than one who wanted to mend capitalism. And the share of younger Democrats who preferred a nominee who moved left to generate enthusiasm, while still a minority, was also higher than for older generations. Those findings help explain why Sanders ran so well among younger voters in 2016, and why polls again show him attracting much more support among younger than older Democrats. Health care remains the issue where these broader choices are likely to reach the sharpest point for Democrats through the 2020 election. Single payer legislation in which government would eliminate private health insurance and directly fund a guaranteed package of benefits through tax dollars remains the rallying cry for the left. Four other 2020 presidential contenders \u2013 Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Harris and Warren \u2013 have endorsed Sanders\u2019 single payer bill in the Senate. In the House, 105 voting Democrats have endorsed the companion bill from Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state. But the legislation that House Democratic leaders introduced last week to strengthen the ACA has drawn broader support. As a recent CNN analysis found, the single-payer bill has been endorsed by only two House Democrats from districts that backed Trump over Clinton in 2016 and just seven of the Democrats who captured previously Republican seats last November. By contrast, about two dozen first-term Democrats who flipped Republican seats last fall \u2013 including seven who won in districts Trump had carried \u2013 have already endorsed the bill to stabilize and expand the ACA. That bill, which would overturn Trump administration actions loosening protections for patients under the ACA and increase subsidies for people to buy insurance through the law, embodies the bread-and-butter focus that most Democrats emphasized on health care in the 2018 midterm elections \u2013 and that many party strategists see as the most appealing course for 2020. The bill represents a first step toward one future health care path for Democrats: building on existing programs, including the ACA and Medicare. For many Democrats, the next step might be legislation that allows all adults (or those over 50, depending on the proposal) to buy into Medicare while permitting those who want to maintain private health insurance to keep it. Presidential contender Beto O\u2019Rourke aligned with that option in his kickoff campaign speech Saturday in El Paso, Texas, when he declared: \u201cWe can give every American, every business in this country the choice to enroll in Medicare without eliminating plans that many Americans like for their families because those plans work for their families.\u201d Sanders dismisses these alternatives as insufficient because they maintain private health insurance. His coolness toward the new House bill sets him apart: Even Jayapal, the lead sponsor of the House single-payer bill, has backed the bill. So has liberal champion Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Likewise, Harris, who has also called for eventually replacing private health insurance with a single-payer plan, \u201cof course \u2026 supports other efforts to strengthen ACA and expand protections for pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Ian Sams, her national press secretary, in an email. Sanders\u2019 position confused many Democratic health care experts and angered party centrists. (Asked for further detail on his view, his Senate office pointed to his tweet last week.) \u201cThis is tone deaf among all but a small slice of Democratic primary voters,\u201d said Jim Kessler, Third Way\u2019s executive vice president for policy. \u201cWith so many people afraid about pre-existing conditions and losing their health care under Trump, there is a moral urgency to be pragmatic while we also try to get to universal coverage. This is precisely why Bernie Sanders has a ceiling (of support) and he just bumped up against it.\u201d Still, the outcome of this debate among Democratic primary voters is far from certain. Third Way\u2019s poll found that the share of Democratic voters who considered \u201creducing the cost of health care\u201d one of the most important issues for candidates to address was double the percentage that cited passing a single-payer plan. But in the latest monthly poll by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, Democratic voters, by a narrow 46% to 44% plurality, said congressional Democrats should focus on passing a single-payer plan rather than \u201cimproving and protecting\u201d the ACA. Democrats under 50 preferred focusing on single-payer by a double-digit margin, while those over 50 narrowly broke toward strengthening the ACA, according to detailed results provided by Kaiser. When Kaiser last asked that question in January, strengthening the ACA led by a double-digit margin among Democrats overall. The quick shift in the latest survey underscores how fluid opinion on this choice remains \u2013 and how much the debate among Democratic candidates through the coming months may shape perceptions. Whatever policy Democrats ultimately endorse, Trump has guaranteed a stark contrast in 2020 by renewing his efforts to repeal the ACA. The question is whether Democrats will counter that with proposals to build on the law or offer their own blueprint for uprooting and replacing it, as Sanders is urging.",

            "article_content": "There\u2019s a new entry into the rising Democratic debate over wide-ranging overhauls of the US health care system, this one from a House Democratic freshman who flipped a Republican district in 2018. New York Democratic Rep. Antonio Delgado plans to introduce legislation Monday that would allow all Americans to buy into a version of Medicare \u2013 an approach designed to avoid the substantial system-wide overhaul that would come with any effort to create a government-run health care system. \u201cThere\u2019s a need here to figure out where we all can come together and rally around achieving \u2013 achieving \u2013 a real change to our health care system,\u201d Delgado said in an interview with CNN. Your cheat sheet to all the 2020 Democrats' 'Medicare for All' plans The move opens up a new front in the Democratic debate over the future of health care, which has created divisions that have been laid bare in recent months as progressives in Congress make a strong push under the banner of \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d \u2013 that is, ditching the private insurance system and the Obamacare exchanges in favor of universal coverage paid for through taxes. More than 100 of Delgado\u2019s colleagues have already signed on as co-sponsors to a Medicare for All proposal introduced in February by Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Debbie Dingell. It has the support House Democratic freshmen like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib. It has also emerged as a purity test for Democratic 2020 candidates as they look to navigate an energized party base, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar urging caution as Sen. Bernie Sanders and others embrace the idea. Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have lined up to dismiss Medicare for All as \u201csocialism\u201d and have already laid out a series of attacks they plan to deploy throughout the 2020 election cycle. The generational flaw in Trump's anti-socialism campaign Delgado says his goal is a smaller bore overhaul in the marketplace \u2013 one that explicitly wouldn\u2019t displace people currently using private insurance and would have a mechanism to cover its cost, but still would open the door to universal coverage. \u201cIf you introduce a public competitor within the private insurance market place, there is no doubt that will have a real effect on the premiums, on deductibles and it will drive down the cost of health care,\u201d Delgado said of the bill, which is a companion measure to a proposal already introduced in the Senate by Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Michael Bennet of Colorado and is similar to a proposal introduced previously by Reps. Brian Higgins and John Larson last Congress. Both Higgins and Larson are original co-sponsors of Delgado\u2019s bill this time around. It also sets Delgado, who deliberately didn\u2019t back Medicare for All during the campaign and instead advocated for a Medicare buy-in proposal, apart from his more aggressive colleagues who may hail from districts considered more politically safe than his. Delgado unseated incumbent Republican Rep. John Faso in 2018 by five points \u2013 in a district Trump won by nearly seven points just two years earlier. Asked whether now having a proposal of his own to tout back home would shield him from criticism on the right, Delgado said probably not \u2013 but that\u2019s fine by him. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I do these things. I\u2019m not here to inoculate myself,\u201d he said. The proposal marks a substantial addition to the current Affordable Care Act, which Democrats have rallied around in recent days to protect after the Trump administration sided with a Texas judge who ruled in December that the entire law should be found unconstitutional. Democrats are divided on the future of health care, according to a March poll by the nonprofit health care think tank Kaiser Family Foundation, which showed 44% of those surveyed said Congress should focus on improving and protecting Obamacare, while 46% said Congress should move forward on Medicare for All. The Delgado bill would create a public insurance option on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, alongside the private insurance plans. The goal would be to give Americans more choices when buying Obamacare coverage, particularly in areas where few carriers participate. The proposal would set premiums for public plan enrollees to cover all the benefit costs, including administrative expenses. In other words, it would slot into the current system, as opposed to radically overhaul it altogether. Delgado acknowledged the path forward would be difficult given the stakes \u2013 and competing proposals in the debate \u2013 but that his goal was to \u201cactually find a sweet spot here that allows us to actually navigate these waters and get to a place where we don\u2019t just tinker around the system but we actually meaningfully change the system.\u201d The proposal would be phased in over a period of five years, with the plan\u2019s implementation kicking into gear first in rural counties with only one or zero health plan on the current Obamacare marketplace, then expanding to the entire country and eventually, opening the door for small businesses to also enroll. Delgado and his staff have had early stage discussions about the next steps for the bill with the committees that oversee health care policy, as well as Democratic leadership, according to an aide, and will seek to use the heft of a freshman class that swept House Democrats into power largely running on health care, to bolster the outlook for his effort. A more aggressive effort to line up supporters will be launched in the coming days, Delgado said, as he seeks to overcome what he says he\u2019s found to be an immediate roadblock in his early months in office: dysfunction. \u201cPeople talk to each other in headlines,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cThey engage in a fashion that allows for clickbait to ensue. There seems to be very little room for substantive debate on issues that we know are of critical importance. I want figure out how to own that space and be one of hopefully a growing group of individuals in DC who are committed to really doing the business of solutions oriented work.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s vague platitudes about \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cvery special\u201d health care for everybody are not going to cut it in his 2020 re-election race \u2013 after he was left exposed on the most urgent issue in American politics. An ill-timed move by the Justice Department to back the invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act offered a huge opening to Democrats and inadvertently revealed a gaping political vulnerability for Trump on Tuesday. The sudden pile on by Democratic presidential candidates over the controversy, and the hurried scramble by Trump and his aides to clean it up, offered an eloquent forecast of just how important health care will be in 2020. A court fight led by Republican attorneys general that precipitated the Justice Department policy shift could cause devastation in the health care market place and hit real-life coverage benefits for millions. It could also explode into the most heated months of the 2020 presidential showdown if Obamacare\u2019s fate \u2013 for the third time \u2013 ends up before its previous savior, Chief Justice John Roberts and his Supreme Court. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway tried the first damage control Tuesday on an issue suddenly rocking Washington, insisting that Trump\u2019s budget would preserve coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions. By lunchtime, Trump\u2019s electoral antennae were twitching as the return of Obamacare as a driving political issue trampled all over his end-of-the-Mueller investigation victory party and hinted at trouble ahead. \u201cLet me tell you exactly what my message is: The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care,\u201d Trump told reporters in a Senate corridor during a visit to consult Republican lawmakers. \u201cYou watch.\u201d It was the kind of sweeping, non-specific promise that helped Trump ride out the 2016 presidential race combined with base-pleasing threats to eradicate the proudest domestic accomplishment of his predecessor Barack Obama. But Tuesday\u2019s events were the first real sign that such an approach will not sustain Trump in his re-election race. That\u2019s partly because Trump is now the personification of the government \u2013 he bears responsibility for the state of the health care industry and the struggle many Americans are facing in affording spiraling costs of treatment. Their plight has hardly been eased by the GOP, which wasted two years of ultimately futile efforts to completely repeal Obamacare when it enjoyed a monopoly on power in Washington. Given how entrenched Obamacare has become, he is also in the position of looking like a leader trying to eradicate benefits \u2013 not provide new ones. Trump\u2019s unwillingness or inability to offer a comprehensive plan of his own to improve the health care of Americans, other than his campaign trail hyperbole, hampered the repeal efforts to the GOP in the House and the Senate. When Trump does talk about health care, it\u2019s mostly when he\u2019s lashing out at the late Republican Sen. John McCain for casting a crucial vote against repealing Obamacare, rather than offering a comprehensive plan. Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign website boasts about promises kept \u2013 including the repeal of Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate requiring the purchase of health insurance. But the listed achievements include plans like the multi-billion dollar effort to combat opioid abuse, which though worthy, does not come close to an explanation of how the health care system would work if the ACA is finally killed off. It\u2019s a big risk for Trump because voters are hungry for health care solutions. In the midterms, 41% of voters said health care was the most important issue facing the country. Three-quarters of that number said they supported Democrats. Obamacare, so long an albatross for Democrats during the previous administration, is now much more popular than it was, despite its failure to provide all middle-income Americans with affordable options. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that in 21% of counties in the nation, a 40-year-old earning $50,000 would have to spend 10% of their income just to pay for ACA premiums. Such headaches are helping to drive the early stages of the presidential race and help suggest why Trump, while currently vulnerable on the issue, could reap some political advantage with a serious effort to address the crisis. From a political perspective, the administration\u2019s revival of the health care debate was a disaster. It did not just distract from the President\u2019s attempt to make political capital out of an apparently favorable result from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, at least according to a summary by Attorney General Bill Barr. It must also have irked Trump that he was still being forced to deal with Obamacare itself. His frequent references to his predecessor leave no doubt about the importance he attaches to destroying Obama\u2019s legacy. But through successive elections, Supreme Court challenges and during the GOP Capitol Hill majority, Obamacare stubbornly clung to life. If Trump fails to win a second term, the law will likely outlast his political career. Since there is little prospect of serious health care reform \u2013 possibly with the exception of a bipartisan bid to lower the cost of drugs \u2013 in the current divided government in Washington, health care is sure to dominate the 2020 campaign. Tuesday\u2019s wrangle over the ACA also had another political dimension \u2013 it let Democrats off the hook. The push left by Democratic presidential candidates and the embrace by some of single-payer proposals like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d opened a lane for the GOP to use health care to claim their opponents had embraced \u201csocialism.\u201d But the Justice Department changed the shape of the health care debate and allowed Democrats off the defensive. They again stressed the mantra that Trump is bent on ripping health care away from Americans. Democrats turn attention to defending Obamacare as Congress waits for Mueller report The steep cuts to Medicaid and Medicare unveiled in Trump\u2019s 2020 budget unveiled this month only bolstered the attacks of eager presidential candidates. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont tweeted that Trump wanted to \u201cthrow millions of Americans off health insurance and put lives at risk,\u201d and pledged to fight back. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted, \u201cHealth care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights.\u201d Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke vowed on Twitter to \u201cprotect the care of those whose lives depend on it.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also may not have been able to believe her luck \u2013 as the administration handed her a way out of her dilemma of how to balance the apparently inconclusive outcome of the Russia probe with demands by a small but vocal faction of her caucus for impeachment. She could simply talk about something else \u2013 health care \u2013 which is all but certain to be more important to voters come 2020 than Russia. \u201cLast night in federal court, the Justice Department of the Trump administration, you\u2019d think they\u2019d have more to do, decided not only to try to destroy protections for pre-existing conditions, but to tear down every last benefit and protection the ACA affords,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe GOP will never stop trying to destroy the affordable health care of America\u2019s families.\u201d Were it not for the Justice Department\u2019s move, Pelosi\u2019s dance would have been far more delicate as she unveiled a new plan on Tuesday to strengthen the ACA and to reverse some changes made to the law by Trump.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to make health care better for all Americans, especially those with pre-existing conditions. But while his administration has yet to unveil a plan, his Justice Department is now threatening to strip away coverage and benefits that many people have come to take for granted in the nine years since the landmark Affordable Care Act was signed into law. The Republican Party will become \u201cThe Party of Healthcare!\u201d The administration said Monday that the entire law should be struck down, a dramatic reversal of its earlier stance. In a filing with a federal appeals court, the Justice Department said it agreed with the ruling of a federal judge in Texas that invalidated Obamacare. Previously, the agency under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions had argued only that two key protections for those with pre-existing conditions could not be defended. If the Trump administration prevails, the health care of nearly every American could be affected, though most don\u2019t realize it. While most people associate Obamacare with the individual health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion, it has far wider impact. Obamacare has meant lower premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for the roughly 60 million senior citizens and disabled Americans enrolled in Medicare. And it helped close the gap in Medicare\u2019s drug coverage. Trump says GOP will be the party of health care but provides no plan It slowed the growth of Medicare payment rates to hospitals and other providers, reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans and improved benefits for enrollees. The Obama administration estimated in 2016 that the typical Medicare beneficiary pays about $700 less in premiums and cost sharing thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Another popular provision: Children are allowed to remain on their parents\u2019 plans until they turn 26. Also, companies with at least 50 employees must provide affordable insurance to their staffers who work more than 30 hours a week. The law also prohibits employers from imposing annual or lifetime limits on benefits and caps out-of-pocket spending so those with expensive conditions don\u2019t exhaust their coverage. Americans are also able to get a wide range of preventive care \u2013 including annual check-ups, mammograms, cholesterol tests and flu shots \u2013  and birth control at no cost. And it\u2019s helped combat the nation\u2019s opiod addiction by broadening Medicaid coverage to more adults. Even the Trump administration is using the law to try to lower prescription drug prices. And, of course, there are the millions of people who\u2019ve gained coverage. More than 11 million people have signed up for 2019 policies on the Obamacare exchanges, and more than 12 million are insured through Medicaid expansion. The number of uninsured plummeted to 29 million last year, from 48 million in 2010. Trump administration now says entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down If the law is struck down, roughly 20 million more people would be left uninsured, an increase of 65%, according to an Urban Institute report published Tuesday. And hospitals would see uncompensated care jump by $50 billion, or 82%. But even more influential than the benefits Obamacare provides is how it has changed what people have come to expect in health insurance. Prior to the law, insurers could deny people policies or charge them more based on their medical histories \u2013 so those with acne as a teen could have trouble securing coverage on the individual market years later, for instance. Some 52 million non-elderly adults \u2013 more than one in four \u2013 have a condition that could have rendered them uninsurable before Obamacare took effect, according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care research group. The Affordable Care Act stopped those practices, requiring insurers to cover all applicants and provide comprehensive benefits. Here's what's at risk in the Texas Obamacare ruling The popularity of the pre-existing protections provisions helped doom congressional Republicans\u2019 attempts to repeal the law in 2017 and helped Democrats recapture control of House last November. Even now, Republicans often emphatically state that they want to maintain those protections. It would be hard to turn back the clock now. At least 60% of those who initially say they support the Texas judge\u2019s ruling turn against it once they hear that it would mean insurers could charge more or deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions and that young adults would no longer be able to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in January. The decision also gives Democrats more ammunition to say they are the party that will protect people\u2019s health care, despite Trump\u2019s claims. Already, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday unveiled a package of bills aimed at bolstering Obamacare. \u201cThis sets up a clear contrast for the 2020 general election on health care,\u201d tweeted Larry Levitt, senior vice president at Kaiser.",

            "article_content": "The biggest 2020 news this week is not the end of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. It\u2019s that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has asserted for the first time that the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down. Health care has consistently been listed by voters as a top issue to their vote. A CNN poll taken this month found that health care was already ranked fourth when Americans were asked what the most important issue was related to their 2020 vote. Compare that to Mueller\u2019s probe, which 0 respondents said was the most important related to their 2020 vote. I would expect health care\u2019s importance to 2020 voters to go up in the coming weeks and months. When health care has been in the news previously during the Trump administration, its importance to voters has risen. We saw this during the failed ACA repeals in mid-2017. And we saw Democratic candidates focus on it during the 2018 midterms as well. Health care was a driving factor in the midterms. When likely voters were asked just before Election Day how important an issue was to their vote, a higher percentage (52%) said health care than any other issue. In that same poll, the Russia investigation ranked as the least important of the eight issues asked about. The topic of health care almost certainly helped the Democratic Party last year in its bid to retake the US House. Poll after poll showed that Democrats were more trusted than Republicans on health care. An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted just before the election found that voters trusted Democrats over Republicans by a 16-point margin on handling health care. That was the largest gap in favor of the Democrats of any issue that was ranked highly important by a lot of voters. In the national exit poll, health care was listed as the most important issue by more voters than any four issues asked. Among those who said it was most important, Democrats won a 75% to 23% majority. Looking ahead to 2020, health care could help Democrats if it becomes a referendum on the ACA (i.e. Obamacare). The ACA remains popular with Americans. In the latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll out Tuesday, the ACA scores a 49% favorable rating to a 42% unfavorable rating among voters. This is very similar to the split when voters gave House control to the Democrats last November. It\u2019s also about the same when then-Sen. John McCain infamously gave his thumbs-down to end Republican hopes of repealing parts of the ACA in the summer of 2017. Indeed, that failed repeal attempt demonstrates the potential pitfall for Trump of going hard after the ACA. While almost nothing has moved his approval ratings, health care has. When ACA repeal was debated (and failed) in 2017, Trump\u2019s approval rating among voters dropped to its all time low of 37% in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate. The 22-month-long Mueller investigation never had that effect on Trump\u2019s ratings. Still, health care is not automatically a win for Democrats. Republicans may hope to change the topic from the ACA to health care at large. A number of prominent Democrats are currently discussing switching over to a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system, which would create a universal coverage program run by the federal government. If that plan includes getting rid of private insurers, then it could hurt Democrats. Although Medicare for All polls well in the abstract, a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 58% of Americans were opposed to a system that eliminates private insurers. Democrats will certainly be forced to reckon with Medicare for All in their 2020 primary. Kaiser has been asking for the past year-and-a-half whether congressional Democrats should concentrate on \u201cimproving and protecting\u201d the ACA or passing Medicare for All. Previously, more Democrats than not preferred that their party concentrates on \u201cimproving and protecting\u201d the ACA. In the latest Kaiser poll, more Democrats now prefer concentrating on going for Medicare for All.. About the only guarantee is that the most recent move by the Trump administration to end the ACA moves health care back into the spotlight. We\u2019ve already seen that the party who seeks to end the status quo on health care has lost their majority in 2010 (Democrats) and 2018 (Republicans). The side that is seen as mostly likely to defend the status quo on health care in 2020 is likely to benefit from it. It\u2019s not necessarily clear who that will be at that this point, given that options range from ending the ACA to implementing Medicare for All. It\u2019s really all about how the parties play their cards.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration on Monday said the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down, in a dramatic reversal. In a filing with a federal appeals court, the Justice Department said it agreed with the ruling of a federal judge in Texas that invalidated the Obama-era health care law. In a letter Monday night, the administration said \u201cit is not urging that any portion of the district court\u2019s judgment be reversed.\u201d \u201cThe Department of Justice has determined that the district court\u2019s comprehensive opinion came to the correct conclusion and will support it on appeal,\u201d said Kerri Kupec, spokesperson for the Justice Department. It\u2019s a major shift for the Justice Department from when Jeff Sessions was attorney general. At the time, the administration argued that the community rating rule and the guaranteed issue requirement \u2013 protections for people with pre-existing conditions \u2013 could not be defended but the rest of the law could stand. After the Justice Department took that position, federal District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor struck down the entire law and the case is currently before a federal appeals court. Trump and the administration repeatedly promised \u2013 particularly leading up to the midterm election \u2013 to protect people with less-than-perfect medical histories. But this shift in the Justice Department\u2019s stance doubles down on stripping away all the protections that were a hallmark of the landmark heath reform law. The administration\u2019s move didn\u2019t only startle supporters of the law. One former official who worked under Sessions told CNN Monday night that he, too, was surprised by the new position. Because the case is before one of the most conservative appellate courts in the country, it almost guarantees that the issue will return to the newly solidified conservative Supreme Court at some point. President Barack Obama\u2019s former solicitor general, Donald Verrilli \u2013 who once defended the law before the Supreme Court \u2013 is now defending the law on behalf of the Democratic-led House. Overturning the law would have far-reaching consequences \u2013 way beyond disrupting coverage for the millions of people who get their health insurance on the exchanges or through Medicaid expansion. Obamacare saves senior citizens money on their Medicare coverage and prescription drugs. It lets many Americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. And it allows children to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until they turn 26. And, even the Trump administration is using the landmark health reform law to try to lower prescription drug prices. The Trump administration would not defend the law in court so a coalition of 21 Democratic states led by California stepped in. \u201cThis lawsuit is as dangerous as it is reckless. It threatens the healthcare of tens of millions of Americans across the country \u2013 from California to Kentucky and all the way to Maine,\u201d said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a statement. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is an integral part of our healthcare system. \u2026 Because no American should fear losing healthcare, we will defend the ACA every step of the way.\u201d The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare After November\u2019s midterm elections, the Democratic-led House of Representatives also joined in. In briefs filed with the appellate court, House lawyers said that if O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling were upheld \u201cthe consequences will be devastating.\u201d \u201cMillions of Americans will be denied affordable health care,\u201d the House lawyers wrote. They added that \u201cinsurance costs will skyrocket\u201d and \u201cMedicare recipients will face steep increases in the price of drugs and other services.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration\u2019s stance amounted to \u201call-out war on the health care of the American people.\u201d \u201cOn the very first day that the Democratic Majority held the gavel, the House of Representatives voted to intervene against Republicans\u2019 monstrous health care lawsuit to defend people with pre-existing conditions and the health care of all Americans,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cWhile the Trump Administration broadens its monstrous ambitions from destroying protections for pre-existing conditions to tearing down every last benefit and protection the Affordable Care Act provides, Democrats are fiercely defending the law of the land and protecting all Americans\u2019 health care.\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, became the first 2020 candidate to weigh in on the filing with her criticism Monday night. During Attorney General William Barr\u2019s confirmation hearing in January, Harris asked him whether he was open to reconsidering the department\u2019s position. He replied: \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cTrump and his administration are trying to take health care away from tens of millions of Americans \u2014 again,\u201d Harris wrote in a tweet. \u201cWe must fight back again with everything we\u2019ve got. And in 2020, we need to elect a president who will make health care a right.\u201d This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "It was supposed to be one of the few areas of bipartisanship. Just after the midterm election, President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said they thought both parties could find common ground on lowering drug prices. But that partnership has yet to manifest in the House. Instead, Republicans are accusing Democrats of shutting them out of developing legislation. Complicating matters is the fact that Trump is pushing some proposals that many in his party may not like, such as tying the price of medications sold in the US to their cost in other developed countries. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has advanced a similar idea. \u201cThe political dynamic we are seeing today is unprecedented,\u201d said Ian Spatz, a senior advisor with Manatt Health, a consulting firm. There is \u201ca Republican in the White House who has made drug prices an important agenda item, but he\u2019s taking positions that are not traditionally Republican.\u201d One area that all sides agree on is making generic drugs more available. The Trump administration touted in its annual economic report Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration sped up approvals of less expensive generic drugs, which saved consumers $26 billion in the first 18 months of Trump\u2019s tenure. White House slams 'Medicare for All' as bad for Americans' health and wallets House Democrats are also focusing on generic drugs, holding a hearing last week in the Energy & Commerce Health subcommittee on seven bills largely aimed at reducing prices by increasing competition from generic drugs. These relatively small-scale bills steer clear of more controversial measures such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prices, permitting drug importation from Canada and banning drug makers from providing rebates. This makes them more likely to pass the House, but they\u2019d fare better in the GOP-controlled Senate if they had the support of Republicans in lower chamber. Only three of the bills, however, have Republican co-sponsors. GOP committee leaders blasted their Democratic peers for only providing them with the legislation eight days before the hearing, and then giving them only a day to find potential co-sponsors. Trump proposal would upend drug industry by overhauling rebates in Medicare \u201cRegrettably, while Republicans share the goal of today\u2019s hearing \u2013 lowering the cost of prescription drugs \u2013 the process has been anything but inclusive,\u201d Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, the committee\u2019s Republican leader, said at the hearing. Republicans say they are willing to work in a bipartisan way, but want a seat at the table, said Texas Rep. Michael Burgess, the GOP leader of the health subcommittee. \u201cBipartisanship is asking for my input, not just for my vote,\u201d he said at the hearing. The subcommittee chair, Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo of California, struck back, saying she is open to discussing the language of the bills. Efforts are more collaborative in the Senate. On Friday, Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Mike Lee of Utah joined with Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Dick Durbin of Illinois to reintroduce a bill aimed at increasing alternatives for drugs that may suffer shortages or have few competitors on the market. Senator: Big Pharma is 'morally repugnant' Grassley, head of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, also teamed up this year with Klobuchar on legislation that would allow the importation of drugs from Canada. And they worked together last year on a bill that would limit drug companies\u2019 ability to delay the introduction of generic versions of their medicines. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good chance of having broad support for legislation out of this committee,\u201d Grassley told reporters after last month\u2019s hearing with several pharmaceutical company CEOs. \u201cI expect to get something done. I expect that things are moving in our favor when you have broad bipartisan support like we do.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The latest CNN/Des Moines Register/MediaCom 2020 Iowa poll shows former Vice President Joe Biden continuing to lead the pack with 27% and Sen. Bernie Sanders close behind with 25%. Sanders is up from our last poll, though the relative order remains the same. No other candidate reaches double-digits. But beyond these topline numbers, the poll reveals some interesting trends in the electorate. Here are five key takeaways from our Iowa poll. The only two candidates breaking double-digits are also the only two candidates for which 90% of the electorate can form an opinion. The third best known candidate (Sen. Elizabeth Warren) is also the candidate who is in third place with 9%. Every candidate who gets more than 1% of the vote has at least 59% name recognition. Now, it\u2019s not all name recognition. Biden and Sanders are equally well known, yet Biden leads Sanders by 2 points. The same 67% of voters can form an opinion of Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, though Harris gets more than double the support of Booker (7% vs. 3%). Overall, on a scale from -1 to +1, the correlation is +0.83 between name recognition and first choice percentage. The best predictor of a candidate\u2019s standing in the CNN poll is the percentage of voters who hold a very favorable opinion of her or him. The top seven places in our poll are perfectly forecasted by the candidate\u2019s very favorable rating. The correlation for all the candidates is +0.95. Very favorable ratings are far more important in understanding a candidate\u2019s standing than the total favorable rating, which combines very and somewhat favorable ratings. The distinction between the very and somewhat favorable rating can be thought of us as \u201cloving\u201d versus merely \u201cliking\u201d a candidate. In a field that will have more than a dozen candidates, voters will have their pick of the litter. A candidate who is liked by a lot of folks but loved by only a few probably isn\u2019t going to come out on top in the 2020 primary. By the same token, a candidate who is polarizing (with people loving or hating them) like Donald Trump was in the 2016 Republican primary will have an advantage on the Democratic side this time around. Remember, Trump had a relatively low total favorable rating, but also a relatively high very favorable rating. This dynamic could work well for someone on the ideological edge of the party like Sanders. I\u2019ve noted on a number of occasions that the Democratic electorate is moving to the left. Our poll mostly confirms that. A majority of Democrats identified themselves themselves as liberal. A plurality support Medicare-for-all system in full and the Green New Deal. A majority will even be mostly satisfied with a nominee who thinks the country should be more socialist. All of these statistics sound good for Sanders. There is, however, a major warning signal. A giant 44% of Democratic voters say Sanders is too liberal. That\u2019s nearly double the 23% who say the same about Warren. That makes sense in so far as Sanders is further left than Warren. Interestingly, though, this 44% is far more than the about 25% who said Sanders\u2019 positions were too liberal during the 2016 primary season. That may suggest voters are paying more attention to Sanders policies than they were in 2016. The eventual primary winner in 2020 is probably someone who is able to placate the leftward movement of the party without being seen as outside the mainstream. Unlike in other states, Harris didn\u2019t see a sizable jump in her Iowa support compared to before she launched her bid. Her 7% is about the same as her 5% that she recorded in December. Obviously, that isn\u2019t a great sign for her. Her favorable ratings, however, saw a clear increase. Her total favorable rating jumped 9 points from 49% to 58%. No other candidate saw that large of an increase in her or his favorable rating. Importantly, her very favorable rating, which is correlated with horserace support, climbed from 19% to 23%. The highest increase among the other candidates in their very favorable rating was just 1 point. All the other candidates with greater than 1% of the vote in the poll (Biden, Booker, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Former US Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Sanders and Warren) actually saw a decrease in their very favorable rating. If the trendline for very favorable ratings among the candidates continues, Harris will likely eventually see a payoff. Of course, there\u2019s no guarantee that Harris will be able to keep it up. It\u2019s easy to see these numbers and say \u201cwe\u2019re 11 months until the caucuses.\u201d There\u2019s something to this line of thought. In competitive Iowa caucuses for Democrats and Republicans since 1980, the leader in the polls at this point has actually lost more Iowa caucuses (8 times) than won (6 times). The leader in the Iowa caucuses polls at this point have won the nomination 7 of 14 times. In a general election, knowing poll leaders have won 50% of the time wouldn\u2019t be useful information. In multi-candidate fields, knowing that the polling leader often goes on to win is helpful. For comparison, according to the betting markets, no candidate currently has more than about a 20% of winning the Democratic nomination. (The betting market odds make sense because Biden and Sanders are polling worse than many poll leaders at this point who went onto win.) The bottom line: There\u2019s plenty of time to these numbers to shift. Don\u2019t be surprised, however, if they stay relatively stable.",

            "article_content": "The idea that the Supreme Court should be increased beyond its current nine seats, popularly known as \u201cpacking the court,\u201d is drawing new, if still tepid, interest on the presidential campaign circuit and among liberal advocates. Former Attorney General Eric Holder recently endorsed the idea and presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has in recent days been talking up proposals to expand the nine. \u201cWhat we need to do is stop the Supreme Court from sliding toward being viewed as a nakedly political institution. I\u2019m for us contemplating whatever policy options will allow that to be possible,\u201d Buttigieg said at CNN\u2019s town hall in Austin, Texas, Sunday night, explaining a proposal that would increase the court to 15 justices. Such court packing, recalling President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s ill-fated attempt to add justices in the 1930s, faces long odds. Congress has not changed the size of America\u2019s highest court in 150 years. And liberal advocates are themselves divided over whether it would be a good option for the country. But the idea is not so easily dismissed as it might have been in earlier eras or even earlier months. Leading proponents premise the notion on the belief that after Congress expands the number of justices, a new Democratic president would be able to appoint justices to counterbalance today\u2019s court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority. \u201cCourt packing is integral to any effort to restore democracy,\u201d asserts Aaron Belkin, a San Francisco State University political science professor who is executive director of Pack the Courts, a group advocating an expanded bench. Belkin, backed by a board that includes some prominent law professors, insists that liberal legislative proposals, such as to counteract climate change or expand Medicare, must be accompanied by a plan to ensure that such initiatives would be upheld in court. Pete Buttigieg makes star turn in town hall spotlight Belkin said Pack the Court has raised $500,000 to support its efforts to generate support among presidential candidates, including by working in the field in Iowa. Belkin said his group\u2019s recommendation is the addition of four more justices, appointed by the president to life-tenured seats. Proponents have been motivated by President Donald Trump\u2019s broadscale attack on constitutional norms, as well as his speed in filling all level of federal courts. Yet, pending proposals could, conceivably, allow another Republican president to exert greater control of the Supreme Court. And some liberal law professors and progressive advocates have been speaking out against on the idea on more fundamental grounds. \u201cFocusing on such futile ideas is a distraction from the disciplined political work progressives need to do to regain momentum in the war over the courts,\u201d said Simon Lazarus, a Washington lawyer who was a domestic policy staffer in the Jimmy Carter administration and more recently a senior counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center. He said liberals should focus on encouraging their constituencies to make the judicial branch an election-issue priority as conservative Republicans and evangelical voters have for decades. FDR\u2019s attempt to \u201cpack\u201d the high court came in the mid-1930s when a conservative-dominated Supreme Court was striking down his New Deal initiatives intended to help America cope with the Depression. The justices invalidated laws to bolster the economy and help workers, for example, with minimum-wage and maximum-hour standards. To enhance the chance that his initiatives would be upheld, Roosevelt proposed \u2013 after he had won reelection in November 1936 \u2013 the appointment of a new justice for every sitting justice older than 70. (Six of the nine were then over 70.) The public did not embrace the idea, and then-Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes worked privately with members of Congress to stall legislation related to the additional seats. Equally important, the court soon became more receptive to FDR\u2019s New Deal. In spring 1937, for example, it upheld a minimum-wage law that was similar to a measure previously struck down and separately endorsed a new labor relations board. (Justice Owen Roberts\u2019 key vote for the Roosevelt administration became popularly known as \u201cthe switch in time that saved nine.\u201d) In time, the more conservative justices began to retire, and Roosevelt had his chance to appoint his own justices. Duke University law professor Neil Siegel, a board member of the American Constitution Society who has worked on Supreme Court nominations for Democratic senators, warned that court-packing proposals, if enacted, could further politicize the high court. \u201cPacking the court could substantially increase the public perception \u2013 and, perhaps more importantly, the perception among the justices themselves \u2013 that the court is partisan and political in just the way, and to the same extent, that Congress is.\u201d The partisan view of the court, however, may already be established in the public\u2019s mind. Chief Justice John Roberts has tried to counteract the view that the judiciary is just another political branch of government. Last November, after criticism from Trump about a ruling by, as Trump put it, an \u201cObama judge,\u201d Roberts responded with a rare rejoinder. \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d It was plainly a message to Trump, but the chief justice, a student of history who also keeps an eye on what might lie ahead, may have been thinking about challenges across the ideological spectrum. Holder, who was President Barack Obama\u2019s attorney general, addressed court packing at Yale Law School last week, generating new, high-level attention on the long-odds topic. The Yale Daily News reported that Holder, who is not running for president, told an audience that if he were president and Congress was majority Democratic, he would consider adding two more court seats to compensate for Mitch McConnell\u2019s \u201cpower-grabbing antics\u201d that prevented Senate consideration of Obama nominee Merrick Garland. His spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said on Monday that Holder would consider any expansion \u201ca corrective.\u201d Democrats remain angry over Senate Majority Leader McConnell\u2019s action in 2016 blocking consideration of Obama\u2019s choice of a successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia died suddenly in February 2016. Obama nominated US Court of Appeals Judge Garland that March and for the remaining 10 months of Obama\u2019s tenure, McConnell impeded Senate consideration of any kind. After his election, Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch to the Scalia seat, and Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017. In 2018, Trump replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, a moderate conservative, with Brett Kavanaugh. Separately, Trump has been appointing record numbers of federal appeals court judges, assisted by Senate Republicans who have changed filibuster and other procedural rules to speed approval of nominees. Among presidential candidates, Buttigieg has expressed the most notable openness to the idea of court packing. Yet he is apparently not committed to any single proposal. \u201cOne of them involves having 15 instead of nine justices,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Sunday night, \u201cbut I\u2019m not just talking about, suppose I get elected as president, putting on six justices that I think agree with me, and daring the next president who might be conservative to throw on a couple more. That\u2019s the last thing we want to do. What we need to do is stop every vacancy from becoming this apocalyptic ideological battle that harms the court and the country.\u201d Supreme Court justices still skeptical of TV cameras Buttigieg said he envisions, in one possibility, changing the structure of the court, so that 10 of the 15 would be appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents. \u201cThe other five can only be seated by a unanimous consent of the remaining 10,\u201d he said, which would mean they would have the respect of the others and \u201ccan be counted on to think for themselves.\u201d Supreme Court justices are appointed for life, as are lower court judges, according to the terms of the US Constitution. Any change to that lifetime tenure and the Constitution would require ratification by three-fourths, 38, of the 50 states. Congress, on the other hand, may alone alter the number of justices. Even though that path is theoretically easier than amending the Constitution, it has not been done since 1869, when Congress established the nine seats, after a low of five justices and a high of 10 in earlier decades. Currently on the nine-member bench, five justices are Republican appointees who vote generally conservative; four are Democratic appointees who generally vote liberal. That 5-4 split has been the norm for decades, but with last year\u2019s retirement of Kennedy and appointment of Kavanaugh, who had a strong conservative record as a lower appeals court judge, that rift deepened significantly.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump clearly thinks he has a winning argument against Democrats in 2020 and it comes straight out of his Baby Boomer childhood. Trump and other Republicans have spent the past few weeks arguing that Democrats would rob Americans of consumer comforts like cars and hamburgers, using a definition of socialism that borrows from a time when that ideology \u2013 in the form of communism \u2013 posed an actual existential threat in a nuclear standoff with the Soviet Union. That\u2019s not the world Trump sees. When he riled up the young and conservative activists at this past weekend\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump brought up \u201csocialism\u201d four separate times with four separate one-liners: But Democrats are selling a softer socialism, leaning on government as the solution to soaring health care costs, widening inequality, and a new and more dangerous existential threat \u2013 climate change \u2013 that many fear is literally killing the earth. Their audience is the portion of the electorate too young to remember the Cold War. Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was born in October 1989, the month before the Berlin Wall fell and two years before the Soviet Union collapsed. This group\u2019s view of socialism is in the happy social media dispatches from Northern Europe, where child care is free, almost everyone has a job, health care is provided for and retirement is guaranteed. The capitalist socialist populist manifesto of Democrats in 2020 Socialism is clearly having something of a moment in the US political discussion thanks to Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez, the main spokeswoman for the Green New Deal and for a more socialist Democratic party that would re-imagine the US economy as a way of combating climate change. It also stems from the 2016 candidacy of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent running a second time as a Democrat on a brashly democratic socialist agenda. Sanders, by the way, is the only person currently running in the Democratic primary who calls himself a democratic socialist. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who is considering a run, likes to call himself a progressive. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who like Sanders has a disdain for Wall Street and big banks, has said pretty clearly she considers herself a capitalist. The origins of Sanders' ideology, in his own words The question of the Democratic primary may very well end up being how much Democrats want to embrace the label of socialism and whether it will continue to be a dirty word in US politics. Americans coming of age today and even those who have been voting in recent elections are more likely to have encountered socialism not via Russian communism, which is long gone, but from China\u2019s version, which is planted emphatically in the world marketplace, or from Northern Europe, where Sanders likes to points out the governments honor free markets but also take care of their citizens. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out Monday, just 18% of Americans had a positive view of socialism, 50% had a negative view and 26% had a neutral view. Capitalism, meanwhile, was the mirror opposite: 50% had a positive view, 19% had a negative view and 25% had a neutral view. Worse for someone like Sanders is that voters were asked what might make them enthusiastic about a candidate. A \u201csocialist\u201d candidate drew the most skepticism. Four percent of registered voters said they\u2019d be enthusiastic about a socialist candidate. Four! Widening that out, 25% said they\u2019d be enthusiastic or comfortable and 72% said they\u2019d be have reservations or be very uncomfortable. But there\u2019s another important element to consider in terms of socialism. Most of the skepticism about socialism comes from older American generations. Trump\u2019s Baby Boomers \u2013 he was born in 1946 at the beginning of the Baby Boom  \u2013 grew up under fear of nuclear fallout and seeing the Soviet Union as the main existential threat to the US. Bernie Sanders' American Dream is in Denmark Now, it is their distrust of socialism that Trump is banking on, even as those Boomers embrace the twin US government safety nets of Social Security and Medicare. Less than a third of voters who are 65 and older have a positive view of socialism in Gallup polling from August 2018. That\u2019s remained steady since 2010. Meanwhile, positive views of socialism among 18-29 year olds \u2013 all born after the fall of the Soviet Union \u2013 are much stronger at a steady 50% or so since 2010. And it support falls with each generation from there \u2013 41% positive among the general Millennial age group and 30% among the general Generation X age group. That\u2019s important because of how many voters are in those younger age groups. Voters older than 65 will be about 23% of the electorate in 2020, according to projections from Pew. Voters born after 1996, Generation Z, will be about 10% of eligible voters in 2020. Millennials will be about 27%. Generation X, who were born between 1965 and 1980, and so have very real memories of the Cold War, will be about 25% of the population. Only the very oldest voters might be old enough to remember 1920, the high water mark for American socialism, before the Cold War or the Soviet Union, when Eugene Debs, running outside the major party system, got 3.4% of the US presidential vote as a socialist. So maybe Sanders\u2019 honeymoon in the Soviet Union in the 1980s won\u2019t lead to conspiracy theories about him as a Manchurian Candidate of sorts. Especially since it is the new Russian plutocracy of oil barons and oligarchs that interfered with the 2016 election in an attempt to help Trump.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump attacked special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s credibility Saturday, disparaging former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former FBI Director James Comey as Washington waits for Mueller\u2019s report in the coming weeks. In a largely unscripted, wide-ranging speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference lasting more than two hours, Trump hit on several key issues in a characteristic fashion \u2013 mocking proponents of the Green New Deal, vowing to protect free speech on college campuses with an executive order and taking shots at his longtime rival and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. But he made a point to take on Mueller, commenting extensively on key parts of the investigation, as the probe appears to be winding down. \u201cSo now we\u2019re waiting for a report, and we\u2019ll find out \u2026 who we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for a report by people that weren\u2019t elected.\u201d \u201cYou put the wrong people in a couple of positions and they leave people for a long time that shouldn\u2019t be there, and all of a sudden, they\u2019re trying to take you out with bullshit, OK,\u201d  he added. The President lambasted Mueller as an unelected prosecutor running unchecked and accused the special counsel\u2019s team of investigators of being stacked against him. \u201cRobert Mueller never received a vote and neither did the person that appointed him,\u201d Trump said in an apparent reference to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was appointed by Trump and named Mueller as special counsel in May 2017. \u201cRobert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cOne of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 all killers. In fact, it would have been actually better for them if they put half and half and Mueller can do whatever he wants anyway, which he\u2019ll probably do.\u201d Fact Checking Trump (and others) at CPAC No one on Mueller\u2019s team ever ran the Clinton Foundation. Trump may have been referencing one of the Mueller team\u2019s lawyers, Jeannie Rhee, who previously represented the Clinton Foundation in a racketeering lawsuit. While several of the lawyers have made personal donations to Democrats in the past, the majority of them have been longstanding Department of Justice employees. Trump also argued that Mueller was compromised due to his prior interest in being FBI director after Trump fired James Comey, and repeated a favorite allegation that Mueller and Comey are \u201cbest friends.\u201d Comey has said in the past that he and Mueller are not best friends. He also bashed Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself from the Mueller investigation and delegate overseeing Mueller to Rosenstein, impersonating Sessions with a thick Southern accent. \u201cThe attorney general says, \u2018I\u2019m going to recuse myself,\u2019 and I said, why the hell didn\u2019t he tell me that before I put him in?\u201d Trump said. \u201cHow do you recuse yourself?\u201d He also attacked Sessions as useless, lamenting that using his powers to hire and fire cabinet members under Article 2 would have been seen as obstruction \u2013 a standard that he alleged was \u201conly for Trump.\u201d \u201cThe Attorney General recuses himself, and I don\u2019t fire him, no obstruction,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s the other thing \u2013 if you use your rights, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it\u2019s called obstruction, but only for Trump, for nobody else. So the attorney general is weak and ineffective and he doesn\u2019t do what he should have done.\u201d Trump fired Sessions in November following an increasingly strained relationship and months of personal attacks by the President. He also recounted Comey\u2019s firing as being due to the former FBI director being \u201ca bad, bad guy,\u201d saying that he had discussed it at the time with first lady Melania Trump, and that he had anticipated bipartisan support after Democrats voiced criticism of Comey. \u201cI said Melania, I\u2019m doing something today, I\u2019m doing it because it really has to be done \u2026 he\u2019s a bad, bad guy, that\u2019s been proven now with all of the emails,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI said to the first lady, I said, \u2018but you know the good news, the good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan, everyone\u2019s going to love it\u2019 \u2013 so we fired Comey.\u201d \u201cI fire a bad cop, I fire a dirty cop, and all of a sudden, the Democrats say, \u2018how dare he fire him, how dare he do this,\u2019\u201d Trump added. Trump told NBC in May 2017 that he was thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d when he decided to fire Comey, adding that he was irked by the investigation, which he saw as motivated by Democratic anger over his 2016 win. Here were some other key elements of Trump\u2019s speech: Trump said the US had learned a lot since the sudden conclusion of his summit with Kim Jong Un and repeated his previous explanation for not reaching a deal \u2013 \u201cI had to walk, because every once in a while, you have to walk.\u201d He added that North Korea had said it was \u201cwilling to do much less on the sanction front. But you see, that\u2019s not what happened there. So, already I think we\u2019re negotiating.\u201d Trump, who has faced backlash for saying he took Kim\u2019s word that the North Korean leader was unaware of former prisoner Otto Warmbier\u2019s capture, said Saturday that he was torn between his obligation to negotiate and his support for the Warmbiers. \u201cI\u2019m in such a horrible position,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause in one way I have to negotiate. In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier. And I love Otto. And it\u2019s a very, very delicate balance.\u201d Trump also accused congressional Democrats of accepting socialism and trying to \u201creplace individual rights with total government domination\u201d during the speech. \u201cJust this week more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American health care,\u201d he said, apparently referencing the Medicare For All bill currently supported by many House Democrats. Trump said that the plan \u201cwould lead to colossal tax increases\u201d and \u201ctake away private coverage from over 180 million Americans,\u201d as opposed to the private plans and new cooperative plan backed by his administration \u201cwhere you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost.\u201d After discussing the Green New Deal, Trump urged those considering socialism to look to Venezuela to see its failures. \u201cSocialism is not about the environment, it\u2019s not about justice, it\u2019s not about virtue,\u201d he said. \u201cSocialism is about only one thing \u2013 it\u2019s called power for the ruling class, that\u2019s what it is. Look at what\u2019s happening in Venezuela and so many other places.\u201d Trump came out swinging against the Green New Deal, calling the progressive climate plan an attempt by Democrats to \u201ccompletely take over American energy and completely destroy America\u2019s economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal \u2026 which somebody described as a high school term paper written by a poor student.\u201d He said that the plan would destroy the natural gas, nuclear power and auto industries as \u201ctheir plan would remove every gas-powered car from American roads.\u201d The plan actually calls for \u201coverhauling transportation systems in the United States to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible\u201d and does not call for taking away cars. \u201cYou just have to cross 95% of the world and it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in the United States,\u201d he said of the plan, which aims to maximizing buildings\u2019 energy efficiency. \u201cNew York City would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again, I don\u2019t think so. This is the craziest plan.\u201d He also bashed Green New Deal sponsor Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, saying, \u201cI see the white-haired, long-time senators standing behind this young woman and she\u2019s ranting and raving like a lunatic and the senators, these senators \u2013 \u2018yes, I agree with this, yes, I agree.\u2019\u201d Trump specifically targeted 2020 presidential candidate and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, saying that he should have saved Saturday\u2019s speech for a real opponent closer to election season. \u201cI just want to be the Republican that runs against them,\u201d he said of Democrats endorsing progressive projects such as the Green New Deal. \u201cI\u2019m going to regret this speech, this speech should have been delivered one year from now and not now, dammit.\u201d He also reused his \u201cPocahontas\u201d nickname for Warren, claiming that he\u2019s destroyed her career such that she won\u2019t be the Democratic nominee he\u2019ll face in 2020. \u201cI should have saved the Pocahontas thing for another year because I\u2019ve destroyed her political career and now I won\u2019t get a chance to run against her and i would have loved it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to knock out all of the good stuff and end up with somebody that\u2019s actually got talent, that would be bad.\u201d Trump also referenced his efforts to eradicate ISIS\u2019 presence in Iraq, telling the CPAC audience that different generals told him on his trip to Iraq that they could defeat the group in one week as opposed to two years. \u201cWhat I was told by a general who I had to fire, I said, \u2018General, how long before we get 100% of the caliphate?\u2019 He said, \u2018sir, two years.\u2019 I said, \u2018I can\u2019t take it two years.\u2019 And then I flew to Iraq,\u201d Trump said. It was unclear to whom Trump was specifically referencing but former Defense Secretary Gen. James Mattis resigned in December over disagreements with Trump over how to pull troops out of Syria. Trump said that while in Iraq, he asked generals there why it would take two years to \u201cknock off two or three or four percent, which is what we had left.\u201d He said that a general he called \u201cRaisin\u2019 Cain\u201d then told him, \u201c\u2018It won\u2019t, sir, if we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster \u2026 we can have it totally finished in one week.\u2019\u201d The general then added that his superiors coming in from Washington had not conferred with him, and that \u201cyou\u2019re the first one to ask us our opinion,\u201d Trump said. This story has been updated with additional developments Saturday. CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In 2016, when Bernie Sanders proposed the idea of getting rid of all private health care insurance in favor of a national system run by the federal government, Hillary Clinton repeatedly mocked both him and the idea. \u201cI want you to understand why I am fighting so hard for the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Clinton said in Iowa in late January 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t want it repealed, I don\u2019t want us to be thrown back into a terrible, terrible national debate. I don\u2019t want us to end up in gridlock. People can\u2019t wait! People who have health emergencies can\u2019t wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.\u201d Between that race and the early stages of the 2020 contest, much has changed. Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal has become the default position of lots of 2020 candidates \u2013 including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California; all of whom see their support for the measure as a way to mobilize liberal voters who formed the backbone of Sanders\u2019 surprisingly successful 2016 bid. \u201cGood news is, before I ran for president, in 2016, that was considered to be a wild and crazy idea,\u201d Sanders told Wolf Blitzer in a CNN town hall Monday. \u201cToday, a significant majority of the people support that concept.\u201d Which is, generally speaking, true. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll showed 56% of the public is supportive of a government-run system. But that poll question \u2013 and the broader debate over \u201cMedicare for All\u201d \u2013 left out one critical piece of information: Under Sanders\u2019 plan, private health insurance would be totally and completely eliminated \u2013 an idea that is a) much more controversial and b) much less popular. That same Kaiser poll found that support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d dropped 21 percentage points when respondents were told the program would eliminate private health insurance companies. But in the CNN town hall on Monday night, Sanders made clear he has zero plans to hedge his position. Here\u2019s the key exchange between Sanders and Blitzer: BLITZER: Senator, let\u2019s talk a little bit about Medicare for All, because about half of Americans, as you know, they\u2019re insured by their employer plans. According to a recent Gallup poll, 70% of these people with private health insurance, their plans, they like their plans. They think their plans are good. Will these people be able to keep their health insurance plans, their private plans\u2026 SANDERS: No. BLITZER: \u2026 through their employers, if there is a Medicare for All program that you endorse? SANDERS: What they will \u2013 what will change in their plans is the color of their card. So instead of having a Blue Cross Blue Shield card, instead of having a UnitedHealth Insurance card, they\u2019re going to have a Medicare card. That Medicare card will allow them, Wolf, to go to any doctor that they want. If they\u2019re going to the doctor, they\u2019re happy. Any hospital they want. But you know what else? They\u2019re not going to be paying any private insurance premiums. If they are seniors, we are going to expand Medicare benefits to cover dental care, which is not covered for seniors, hearing aids and eyeglasses. There will be comprehensive health care. People can go to any doctor, dentist, or hospital they want. BLITZER: So if they like their health insurance plan, they won\u2019t be able to keep their health insurance plan? SANDERS: Wolf, nobody \u2013 this business of liking your health insurance plan, which, by the way, employers change every single year \u2013 people like their doctors. They like the hospitals. They like the care they\u2019re getting. Our bill, in fact, right now, if you are in a particular program, you may not be able to go to the doctor that you want. Our program will allow you freedom of choice. What\u2019s clear from that exchange is that this is the political hill on which Sanders has chosen to die (or be victorious). He isn\u2019t going to blanch at polling \u2013 as Wolf rightly cited \u2013 that shows people prefer keeping private insurance with a public option. Or at the proposed cost \u2013 Sanders\u2019 website says it would costs $1.38 billion a year, while more conservative economists put the price tag much, much higher \u2013 which would well raises taxes considerably, particularly on wealthier Americans. The question now for everyone in the race not named Sanders is, how do they react? Signing on as a Senate co-sponsor for a piece of legislation that is never going to see the light of day \u2013 the Republican majority isn\u2019t bringing it up \u2013 is very different than running for president on your support for a program that would get rid of all private insurance in the country and cost, well, a whole heck of a lot. We\u2019ve already seen Harris kind of, sort of hedge \u2013 or maybe not! \u2013 her position. In a CNN town hall last month, here\u2019s how Harris answered the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d question: \u201cWell, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don\u2019t have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. Who of us has not had that situation, where you\u2019ve got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, well, I don\u2019t know if your insurance company is going to cover this? Let\u2019s eliminate all of that. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d Except that, in a CNN story the following day, this happened: \u201cAs the furor grew, a Harris adviser on Tuesday signaled that the candidate would also be open to the more moderate health reform plans, which would preserve the industry, being floated by other congressional Democrats. It represents a compromise position that risks angering \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 proponents, who view eliminating private health insurance as key to enacting their comprehensive reform.\u201d Harris\u2019 campaign pushed back on the idea she was hedging, explaining that while her goal was \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d she also was in favor of other legislation to expand the number of people covered. The difference between Sanders\u2019 position and what I think is Harris\u2019 position is this: Sanders believes \u201cMedicare for All\u201d is the only workable solution to right the wrongs of the current health care system. And that half measures \u2013 like the sort Harris has said she supports \u2013 don\u2019t really bring the country to the hard but necessary solution of getting rid of the private insurance industry. Put another way: Harris sees the fight over the future of the health care industry in the country as a \u201cboth/and\u201d proposition. Sanders sees it as an \u201ceither/or.\u201d That difference could be critical as the primary fight heats up. Health care is already emerging as one of the central fights of the 2020 primary and general election and it\u2019s clear that Sanders, at least, is going whole-hog when it comes to \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders condemned \u201cbullying and harassment of any kind\u201d Saturday in an email urging people representing his 2020 campaign in the media to act respectfully. \u201cLet us do our very best to engage respectfully with our Democratic opponents - talking about the issues we are fighting for, not about personalities or past grievances,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cI want to be clear that I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space.\u201d The email, which a source provided to CNN Sunday, came less than a week after Sanders officially announced his candidacy for president. The letter dissuades supporters from using personal attacks on Sanders\u2019 behalf, saying that the campaign message and rhetoric needs to be the opposite of President Donald Trump\u2019s. \u201cWe must never forget what this campaign is about and who our real opponents are,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cThey are the most dangerous president in modern American history and the powerful special interests who back his agenda.\u201d Sanders, an Independent from Vermont who identifies as a Democratic Socialist, has committed to run and govern as a Democrat if elected. His refusal to run as a Democrat in his campaigns for the US Senate has been a sore spot for many in the party. He does caucus with the Democrats as a senator. Sanders, however, specifically reminded his supporters to refrain from vitriol on social media in regard to his Democratic opponents. He pointed toward a general election when he said his supporters will need to work with their primary opponents to achieve his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d of removing Trump from office. \u201cRemember that our struggle is bigger than a Tweet or a Facebook comment,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cAnd remember that our primary opponents are decent people \u2013 many have been friends and allies of mine in the Senate.\u201d Following the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton criticized Sanders and his supporters for attacks on her character and harassment online during their primary fight. The former secretary of state said such attacks created \u201clasting damage\u201d that made it more difficult for her to unite the party in the general election. Sanders is one of 10 Democrats to officially announce their candidacy for president. Many candidates have voiced support for progressive policies such as Medicare for all and free college tuition. Sanders says this shift in the party is a result of his 2016 campaign. His second presidential campaign started with a strong fundraising showing over his opponents, raising nearly $6 million in 24 hours. The Huffington Post was the first to report about the email.",

And on Twitter, Pete Buttigieg invoked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s new debate fundraising requirements to encourage his supporters to donate. The Democrats running for the presidency are relying on a mix of social media salesmanship and old-fashioned merchandising to scoop up what is fast becoming one of the most valuable commodities in the 2020 presidential campaign: small-dollar donors who they can tap repeatedly to fuel their primary campaigns and a general election fight likely to cost billions of dollars. As the Democratic Party\u2019s early contenders rally around a populist message that rejects big money in politics, they are scrambling to find grass-roots donations to remain competitive in a crowded field. And the party\u2019s new debate criteria have made small-dollar donors even more important: In addition to a polling requirement, candidates can also get on the debate stage by receiving contributions from at least 65,000 unique donors. To show widespread support, candidates also must demonstrate they have financial support from a minimum of 200 donors per state in at least 20 states. \u201c65,000 is not a low number,\u201d said Ken Christensen, who runs The Politics Company Inc., a political and fundraising consulting firm in Washington. \u201cUnless you have an organization that can be proactive on your behalf in 20 states, it can become quite difficult to meet that threshold.\u201d Van Jones: I've never seen anything like Bernie Sanders Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who announced his second presidential run on Tuesday, relied on small-dollar donors to help raise a staggering $237 million in his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 2016. And the power of Sanders\u2019 supporter list was on display this week. On Wednesday, his campaign said it had raised $5.9 million from 223,000 people in the first 24 hours of his candidacy, swamping the fundraising figures announced by his rivals to date. In all, a dozen Democrats already have announced presidential campaigns or exploratory committees, and several others are weighing bids. All of the major-party candidates have denounced contributions from corporate PACs, and several say they want nothing to do with super PACs, which are independent committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts to support candidates. \u201cSmall-dollar donors are going to be instrumental in choosing who our Democratic nominee will be,\u201d said Erin Hill, executive director of ActBlue, which serves as a central online fundraising platform for Democratic candidates and causes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the billionaires on our side; we have the people,\u201d Hill said. \u201cPractically and pragmatically, it\u2019s the only way to have enough resources to win.\u201d The new debate rules put particular pressure on lesser-known candidates to step up their digital outreach, whether that means selling kitchen magnets or working to create viral campaign moments that draw eyeballs to politicians\u2019 Instagram feeds and Twitter accounts. Businessman and former US Rep. John Delaney of Maryland has been running for the presidency since 2017, relying on $4.5 million of his own money to fuel his long-shot campaign. And although he\u2019s crisscrossed Iowa repeatedly, only about 1% of the respondents to the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll in December named him as their first or second choices for president. Even so, Delaney\u2019s press secretary Michael Starr Hopkins said he\u2019s confident Delaney will meet the debate criteria by achieving 1% or more support in three polls. \u201cWe are aggressively ramping up our digital fundraising, but we expect to be polling above 1%,\u201d Hopkins told CNN. Sanders, who appears to have jumped to an early fundraising lead, is among the candidates using swag to sell his campaign. His online store offers \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d coffee mugs ($15) and \u201cMedicare for all\u201d T-shirts (from $27). People who purchase campaign merchandise aren\u2019t really buying a product under federal rules; they are making campaign donations. Those transactions provide data valuable to candidates: email and shipping addresses and phone numbers \u2013 allowing politicians to hit them up for more contributions and urge them to turn out to vote. \u201cThat\u2019s worth a lot more to a campaign than the $10 you spent for the hat,\u201d said Michael Malbin, who runs the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute. Just as important, merchandising opens up new avenues to donors, drawing in revenue from people who may not be diehard supporters. \u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t 100% sold on the candidate\u2019s platform, but they want the T-shirt,\u201d said Bentley Hensel, who runs 1776 Consulting, a political e-commerce firm based in Louisiana. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, announced his exploratory committee earlier this month. The 37-year-old former Rhodes scholar faces an uphill battle for attention in a field crowded with better-known Democrats. But he quickly seized on the new debate rules as a fundraising opportunity. \u201cDNC says having >65,000 individual contributors will be a debate criterion,\u201d Buttigieg (pronounced boot-edge-edge) tweeted. \u201cNow would be a great time to chip in, any amount, to the exploratory committee!\u201d His campaign aides did not immediately respond to requests about how much money the pitch had raised. But it drew hundreds of retweets and scores of comments from people who said they had donated. Karen Campbell, who runs her own advertising firm in Springfield, Missouri, told CNN she had answered Buttigieg\u2019s call with a $10 contribution. Campbell said she hasn\u2019t decided which candidate she\u2019ll back in 2020 but that she\u2019s impressed by Buttigieg\u2019s intelligence. \u201cI want him to be on the debate stage,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems willing to say one word that often goes unspoken by presidential candidates eager to win over voters: No. At a CNN town hall with voters here on Monday night, the Minnesota Democrat offered few sugar-coated promises on causes that have become popular among the party\u2019s progressive base. Instead, she gave detail-laden answers about why there are no easy fixes to these challenges, despite what they might hear from other Democrats. With her presidential campaign only eight days old, Klobuchar is testing the balance between pragmatism and purity, while resisting the urge to pander to the party\u2019s progressive wing. Her approach on stage at St. Anselm College, which echoes early conversations she is having with voters in New Hampshire and Iowa, offers a glimpse into how she hopes to differentiate herself from a large and still-growing field of 2020 Democratic hopefuls. Even as she touts her progressive record, she is seeking to carve out a more moderate lane, while emphasizing her ability to accomplish the goals she lays out. Amy Klobuchar takes questions at CNN town hall The winds of the Democratic presidential primary are blowing fiercely from the left, but on Monday night she showed few signs of bending. Asked whether she would support Medicare-for-all, Klobuchar replied: \u201cIt could be a possibility in the future. I\u2019m just looking for something that will work now.\u201d She said her focus would be on improving the Affordable Care Act, expanding both Medicare and Medicaid and creating a public option. As for the Green New Deal, she praised the idea, but said it was pie in the sky to enact such sweeping proposals in 10 years. \u201cI think they are aspirations,\u201d she said. \u201cThe actual legislation you do,\u201d she added, \u201cwe know there\u2019s going to be compromises.\u201d She pledged on day one of her presidency to re-enter the US into the Paris climate agreement and move to enact the clean power rules that the Obama administration had supported. And when asked if she supported free college, she replied: \u201cNo. I am not for free four-year college for all.\u201d As the crowd including many students listened intently, she said: \u201cIf I was a magic genie and could afford to give that to everyone I would.\u201d She said her plan was to make it easier for students to refinance their loans, make community colleges free and extend Pell grants. Finally, she added: \u201cI have to tell the truth. We have this mounting debt that the Trump administration keeps getting worse and worse. I also don\u2019t want to leave that on the shoulders of all these we\u2019ve got to do a balance.\u201d It\u2019s an open question, of course, whether the path to winning the Democratic presidential nomination rests in the middle. The energy in the party comes from its left wing, where several of her rivals are positioning themselves. While Democrats have unified around their opposition to President Donald Trump, the field is starting to take new shape. Sen. Kamala Harris stands behind her support for Medicare-for-all \u2013 at least as one option to addressing the health care crisis. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand touts her belief in the Green New Deal. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren is pushing a new wealth tax. A year before the voting begins, the series of liberal ideas are creating early litmus tests and potentially setting up long-term political landmines. What sounds good in a primary campaign often can spell trouble in a general election. The divisions are also playing out on the Senate floor, including on last week\u2019s vote to avoid a government shutdown. Klobuchar joined Sens. Sherrod Brown and Bernie Sanders in supporting the spending bill, while Sen. Cory Booker, Harris, Gillibrand and Warren opposed it. There are, surely, many more dividing lines to come. And at this early juncture, most Democrats are only beginning to study the candidates. But judging by the standing ovation she received from the crowd on Monday night, Klobuchar demonstrated that she is well on her way to carving out her lane in the crowded field. She came armed with a sense of humor and a willingness to say no. The question, of course, is how big of an appetite exists for that in a party steadily shifting to the left.",

            "article_content": "A look at the policy positions of the 2020 Democratic field suggests this group of candidates and potential contenders is further left than those running in previous cycles. In past years, you might not have expected, for instance, that so many candidates would sign on to Medicare for all or the Green New Deal. But are the Democrats running for president this year truly further to the left than other recent cycles? A look at the candidates who have been members of Congress suggests that they are, as a group, considerably more liberal. We can see their liberalness in their voting records. To be clear, there are many ways to calculate a candidate\u2019s ideology (as we\u2019ll talk about a little below). Depending on which one you use, you can come to a different conclusion about how liberal someone is. Still, voting records are among the better methods and easiest to calculate. The website Voteview tracks the roll call votes of members of Congress. I\u2019ve taken a specific metric on their site that allows members of Congress to become more or less liberal over their careers and averaged the vote records for each candidate over the last three Congresses before their presidential run. I\u2019ve also rescaled the scale to make 0 most liberal and 100 most moderate. Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama all had scores between 63 and 66 using this methodology. This score put them roughly in the middle of their party\u2019s senators\u2019 average score. This year the current or past members of Congress who have either declared their presidential candidacy or have formed an exploratory have an average score of 48. That is, they are considerably more liberal as a group than the past nominees or the average Democratic member of Congress. What\u2019s especially noteworthy is that generally speaking the candidates with a better chance of winning are all on liberal side of that 48: Cory Booker (46), Kirsten Gillibrand (35), Kamala Harris (31) and Elizabeth Warren (27). The only declared senator with a more moderate than average score is Amy Klobuchar (73). Not surprisingly, she\u2019ll likely try to pitch herself as the more moderate candidate. Interestingly, the roll call votes do paint a picture of certain candidates racing to the left, despite being somewhat more moderate in the beginning of their careers. One such candidate is Gillibrand, who many detractors argue has flipped-flop over her career. There numbers show that Gillibrand has shifted. When she was a House member from upstate New York, her score was considerably more moderate (82) than it has been over her last three terms in the Senate (35). Part of Gillibrand\u2019s movement is no doubt because she is now representing the much more liberal state of New York in the Senate than her more conservative congressional district. Her shifting positions are not just because who she is representing has changed. In her first four years in the Senate, Gillibrand scored towards the middle of the Democratic caucus (58). In the last two years, Gillibrand was far more liberal (15). Booker seems to be moving to the left as well. A number of people on the left view him with some suspicion because of his prior support for more moderate positions (such as defending private equity). Indeed, his voting record score in his first two years in the Senate was much more moderate (53) than it was in the last two years (36). In fact, a different system for judging ideology suggests Booker has moved even more to the left. We can estimate a candidate\u2019s ideology based on who gives money to candidates. Back in 2014, numbers from the Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections showed that Booker\u2019s donors were more moderate as a whole than all current 2020 candidates but John Delaney\u2019s. Why are Democrats as a group running to the left? They seem to be responding to a Democratic electorate that is, at a minimum, describing themselves as more liberal. The Pew Research Center found that 44% of Democratic voters (including those independents who lean towards the Democratic Party) called themselves liberal. Back in 2004, just 30% of this group said they were very liberal. Candidates moving to the left may be making a mistake, however. The majority of Democratic voters still identify as moderate (54%), and Gallup finds that that at least in the abstract a majority of Democrats (54%) want their party to become more moderate instead of liberal. Part of that may be that be they think a moderate candidate is more electable, which is what Democratic voters prize most in a nominee at this point. Of course, it could be the case that none of this ideologically positioning ends up mattering too much for vote choice. Voters make their decisions based off a slew of factors including simple candidate likability. Still, the fact that this field is further to the left than previous nominees is important. Studies indicate that presidents are likely to at least try to keep their campaign promises. That is, there does seem a better chance than normal that we\u2019ll end up with a more liberal president than we\u2019ve seen in recent years if the eventual Democratic nominee wins in the general election. If Klobuchar or Joe Biden (who is still weighing a presidential bid) win the primary, however, the Democratic nominee could end being more moderate than previous years.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are entering the 2020 election cycle with many of their leading presidential contenders increasingly willing to break with a pro-Israel foreign policy orthodoxy that guided the party for a generation. The new crop of progressive political stars in the House and a base more sympathetic to the Palestinians than ever before helped push a half-dozen White House aspirants to break with the pro-Israel lobby last week on a major bill, even as it passed with support from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other high-ranking Democratic officials. Omar: 'I unequivocally apologize' after backlash over new Israel tweets But the simmering divisions and debates inside the party blew up on social media Sunday night, when Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar suggested in a series of flippant tweets that the top House Republican\u2019s support for Israel was \u201call about the Benjamins\u201d \u2013 or tied to financial backing offered by the right-leaning American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Omar\u2019s comments were denounced by members of both parties as \u201canti-Semitic\u201d and, by Monday afternoon, she had responded to Democratic leadership\u2019s condemnation with an apology, saying in a statement posted online, \u201cI unequivocally apologize.\u201d Earlier in the day, a pair of Democratic House newcomers sought to gather signatures for a letter rebuking Omar over her tweets and, in a move likely to escalate the controversy, her support for the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions movement \u2013 known as BDS \u2013 against Israel in response to its treatment of Palestinians. \u201cSuch positions,\u201d Democratic Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Elaine Luria wrote, \u201care, at their core, anti-Semitic.\u201d Listening and learning, but standing strong \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd pic.twitter.com/7TSroSf8h1 The blow-up threatens to further complicate an already knotty question facing progressives who have spent years now carefully questioning what they view as a political establishment that is too deferential and unwilling, over domestic political concerns, to criticize the Israeli government. Contrary to Omar\u2019s claim, AIPAC does not donate to candidates. It does, however, spend millions lobbying elected officials \u2013 a distinction she failed to make \u2013 and does, as described on its own website, ask its would-be \u201cCongressional Club\u201d members to \u201ccommit to giving political contributions in a clearly pro-Israel context to candidates running for the United States House of Representatives and/or United States Senate.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that money plays a huge role in our politics. Also true that tropes about Jewish money have been used for centuries to target Jews,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 foreign policy adviser Matt Duss tweeted on Monday morning. \u201cProgressives need to be extremely aware of that history and avoid those tropes as we talk together about how to fix our politics.\u201d Sanders, who is Jewish, has been among the likely 2020 contenders most willing to denounce the Israeli government over its treatment of the Palestinians. The ongoing political shift came clearly into focus last week when nearly all of the Democratic presidential hopefuls \u2013 with Sen. Amy Klobuchar a notable exception \u2013 voted against a Senate bill that would allow state and local governments to withhold contracts from those who participate in BDS. Most of them took the same position in explaining their opposition to the bill: They oppose efforts to boycott Israel, they said, but they feared the measure violated First Amendment rights. Here are the Democrats who have said they're running for president \u201cThere are ways to combat BDS without compromising free speech, and this bill as it currently stands plainly misses the mark,\u201d New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker \u2013 who had co-sponsored a similar bill as recently as November \u2014 said in a statement last week to Jewish Insider. Most of the other Democratic presidential candidates and potential candidates in the Senate \u2013 including Sanders, California Sen. Kamala Harris, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown \u2013 opposed the legislation, all citing free speech concerns that overshadowed their opposition to the boycott efforts. \u201cI believe in free speech. And I do not support BDS but I think the steps to outlaw go too far,\u201d Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told CNN recently. The votes put the party\u2019s 2020 field largely at odds with Schumer, the New York Democrat, who backed it. They also failed to sink the effort which easily passed with support from both parties. It is unclear if House Democrats will bring up the bill for consideration. But in voting in near lockstep against it, the presidential contenders highlighted a shift that has been gaining steam among Democrats for years. In 2018, the Pew Research Center found that 27% of Democrats said their sympathies lied with Israel, while 25% said the Palestinians \u2013 with the rest saying neither. That was a sharp drop from the 43% who chose Israel just two years earlier. Younger and more liberal Democrats, in particular, said they were more likely to side with the Palestinians. And some companies that cater to a younger clientele have also shifted their positions in response to Israeli government actions: Airbnb in November said it would stop listing rentals in West Bank settlements. The election of two BDS supporters \u2013 Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Muslim women in Congress \u2013 to House Democratic ranks last year pushed the issue to the forefront. \u201cWe are finally able to have conversations that we weren\u2019t really willing to,\u201d Omar told CNN recently, \u201cand so it is really important for us to get a different lens about what peace in that region could look like and the kind of difficult conversations we need to have about allies.\u201d Senate approves Middle East policy bill urging the President to keep US troops in Afghanistan, Syria Their willingness to criticize Israel, often in the context of clear and unabashed advocacy for Palestinians, has already begun to test old rhetorical boundaries in a way that even some of the party\u2019s more liberal elected officials have typically sought to avoid. Freshman lawmakers like Tlaib, Omar and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been quick to reject those constraints, and seem poised now to insist on a conversation that top Democrats have long stifled or sought to avoid. \u201cStraight up, the party is not ready for the debate that is coming,\u201d one senior aide to a Democratic senator told CNN last year. \u201cIt is an overdue debate and my strong sense is that no, the party is not ready to have it \u2013 look who the foreign policy leaders are. But that doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s coming.\u201d A major moment that opened the doors for Democrats to become much more critical of Israeli policy came in 2015, when Benjamin Netanyahu came to Capitol Hill to denounce former President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal, said Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a left-leaning Jewish advocacy group. \u201cWhen he came to Congress and argued against the policies of the sitting President of the United States at the invitation of the Republican speaker at the time, that was really what I think will be regarded as the historical moment when that bipartisanship was shattered. And it opened up the possibility for people to have arguments over these issues in ways that they probably didn\u2019t prior to that,\u201d Ben-Ami told CNN last week. \u201cIt gave permission to people to actually say what they think. To open up.\u201d Trump's racist Elizabeth Warren taunts have entered a new phase Netanyahu \u201cthrew in his lot with these right wing dictators and with Trump and as a result the liberal Democrats that make up the majority of the Jewish community \u2026 are going to oppose what Netanyahu is doing,\u201d he said. In a statement on Monday, Ben-Ami described the controversy surrounding Omar\u2019s tweets and the storm of accusations of against her \u201coverheated, ill-considered and reductive.\u201d \u201cElected officials should be particularly sensitive and careful on the question of the role played by campaign contributions in influencing US policies toward Israel and the Middle East,\u201d he said, adding that they \u201cshould also refrain from labeling all criticism of Israeli actions or policies as \u2018anti-Semitic,\u2019 in a transparent effort to silence legitimate discussion and debate.\u201d What\u2019s not yet clear is whether Democrats, including the party\u2019s new progressive vanguard, are willing to go any further in breaking with the Israeli government or curbing long-standing US support. Republicans are eager to capitalize on what they characterize as Democrats abandoning Israel. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, whose reported threat to \u201ctake action\u201d against Omar and Tlaib over their criticism of Israel appears to have prompted Omar\u2019s tweets, is now accusing top Democrats of an \u201cabdication of leadership.\u201d House majority leader deletes tweet saying Soros, Bloomberg, Steyer are trying to 'buy' election McCarthy tweeted on Sunday that \u201cAnti-Semitic tropes have no place in the halls of Congress,\u201d but before the midterms said in a post of his own, \u201cWe cannot allow (George) Soros, (Tom) Steyer, and (former New York Mayor Michael) Bloomberg to BUY this election! Get out and vote Republican November 6th. #MAGA\u201d \u2014 a reference to three Jewish billionaire donors whose names have been used in anti-Semitic propaganda. He deleted the tweet a day later. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has embraced Netanyahu and pleased pro-Israeli advocates within both parties\u2019 ranks by moving the United States\u2019 embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In the spring of 2017, a bipartisan anti-BDS bill arrived in the Senate with more than 50 cosponsors, another sign of how deeply entrenched support for Israel has become at the highest levels of national politics. Despite the overwhelming initial support, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin was pressured into redrafting parts of the legislation after it came under scrutiny by civil liberties groups. Gillibrand, an opponent of BDS initially listed as a sponsor of the bill, withdrew her name following a burst of criticism, led by the ACLU, and said she would ask the authors to \u201crewrite it\u201d to make clear that individuals would not be targeted for taking part. Grassroots Jewish progressive groups like IfNotNow, which was formed in 2014 during a conflict that became known by many as the Gaza war, believe opposition to Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem \u2013 often described as \u201cthe occupation\u201d \u2013 fits in naturally with other, increasing popular priorities, many of them championed by Sanders. \u201cThe same progressive values that so many Americans use to support issues like \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 or abolishing ICE and promoting more humane treatment of immigrants, raising the minimum wage, stricter gun control, keeping fossil fuel money out of politics are the same progressive values \u2013 and they\u2019re Jewish values \u2013 that lead us to oppose occupation,\u201d said Emma Saltzberg, an IfNotNow co-founder and volunteer organizer. CNN\u2019s Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump had an insult and a warning in his State of the Union address when he said \u201cwe are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.\u201d It was a warning because he suggested the US could follow the same path as Venezuela, which despite its oil riches has become an unstable country. It was an insult since he was suggesting Democrats want to take the US toward socialism, which has long been thought to be a dirty word in US politics. \u201cAmerica was founded on liberty and independence \u2014 not government coercion, domination and control,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d Get used to this topic. Trump used it repeatedly in November as he campaigned for Republican candidates and its inclusion at the State of the Union address suggests he\u2019ll be bringing it back as the 2020 campaign ramps up. Here are some of the ways Trump has used the specter of socialism, including about Venezuela, as an argument against tax hikes, as part of a pledge to protect Medicare, and as a dream for his ideal opponent. Note: The factba.se database is an incredible resource for exercises like this. \u201cWe stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom \u2013 and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair. Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.\u201d - Trump\u2019s State of the Union Address, February 5, 2019. You hear this argument a lot, not just from Trump and other conservatives, but also from Democrats like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. It is true that the Venezuela government has called itself socialist in previous years when the Venezuelan economy was doing better and before some socialists held it up as a model. But that was before leaders in Venezuela, like the erstwhile President Nicholas Maduro, had turned to authoritarianism and become antidemocratic. But the path from strongest capitalist society in the world to near-failed socialist state-turned authoritarian regime would be long and have a lot of offramps. Plus, the US economy does not rely on a state-run oil company, as Venezuela\u2019s does almost entirely. \u201cThey want to impose socialism on our country.\u201d - Trump in Chattanooga, Tennessee, November 4, 2018 While most Democrats don\u2019t call them socialists, a growing number embrace the idea of democratic socialism as espoused by  Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has pushed tax hikes and bold new government programs like the Green New Deal, which aims to provide jobs and cut down on carbon emissions. Sanders is the only self-avowed democratic socialist in the Democratic 2020 field \u2013 he is expected to run \u2013 and he\u2019s been talking about socialism for decades. Democratic anxieties over 'Medicare for all' kick off first 2020 primary fight Other progressive Democrats do not like to be called socialists. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has bristled at the idea. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m a capitalist,\u201d she once said during an interview. Sen. Sherrod Brown, another progressive who thinks the government can do a lot more, calls himself a populist, but he says Trump has mangled the idea of populism. There are also Democrats who want nothing to do with socialism, like the billionaire Bloomberg, an avowed capitalist. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said the US doesn\u2019t need socialism. Democratic socialists say they don\u2019t want a purely socialist society where the government controls all production. Rather, they want to encourage a government more active in providing services and benefits like health care, transportation and housing. \u201cI do really want to run against a true socialist because I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s what this country wants.\u201d But let\u2019s see what happens. It\u2019s going to be a very interesting fight.\u201d Trump in Tupelo, Mississippi, on November 26, 2018. As to whether the country wants socialism, that\u2019s another question entirely. As CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg wrote last year, one recent Fox News poll suggested 36% of Americans said it would be a good thing for the country to move toward socialism, compared to 51% who said it would be a bad thing. That\u2019s a much tighter spread than in previous times Fox asked the question. Pair it with data from Gallup that show younger Americans have a more positive view of socialism than capitalism and you have a country possibly more open to the idea. But certainly not there yet. \u201cThat\u2019s what socialism gets you when they want to raise your taxes to 70%. You know, it\u2019s interesting, I\u2019ve been watching our opponents \u2013 our future opponents \u2013 talking about 70%. Number one, they can\u2019t do it for 70%. It\u2019s got to be probably twice that number.\u201d - Trump on January 24, 2019, during a trade meeting at the White House Two times 70% would be 140%, which would be one heck of a tax. But he has a point here that social programs like the Green New Deal would require either a ton of new government revenue or realigning the political conversation away from the idea that debt, for a country like the US, is a bad thing. Debt? What debt? At $22 trillion, here's the argument the national debt doesn't matter Trump\u2019s tax argument misleads about Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposal \u2013 her office has said it\u2019s really more of a conversation-starter \u2013 which would be for a top marginal tax rate of 70%. That means income over $10 million would be taxed at that rate. Income before $10 million would be taxed at lower rates. It would have affected the grand total of 16,087 tax returns of $10 million or more reported in 2017 to the Internal Revenue Service. A separate wealth tax idea from 2020 hopeful Warren would place an annual tax rate of 2% on a household\u2019s wealth between $50 million and $1 billion and a 3% tax on wealth over $1 billion. The public isn\u2019t overwhelmingly sold on the idea of a wealth tax. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released Wednesday, 41% of Americans said they would support an additional tax on those who earn $10 million or more a year at 70%, but 54% said they would favor a tax for those whose net worth tops $50 million. \u201cDemocrats want to raid the Medicare to fund socialism.\u201d - Trump at a campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi November 26, 2018. The idea behind this comment is a little weird. Medicare is a government-run, \u201csingle-payer\u201d health care system for older and disabled Americans. It\u2019s arguably the most socialist element of US society. Providing \u201cMedicare for all\u201d is the promise of the more progressive 2020 candidates, although there are big disagreements over how exactly to achieve such a promise. If the 2018 election was any indication, there will be a fight in 2020 over who can believably become the party and the candidate to protect Medicare.",

            "article_content": "Former Rep. John Dingell, the longest serving member of Congress on record and a politician whose voice loomed large even after he left Capitol Hill, passed away Thursday. He was 92. \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of John David Dingell, Jr., former Michigan Congressman and longest-serving member of the United States Congress,\u201d the office of his wife, Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Michigan, said in a statement. \u201cCongressman Dingell died peacefully today at his home in Dearborn, surrounded by his wife Deborah. He was a lion of the United States Congress and a loving son, father, husband, grandfather, and friend. He will be remembered for his decades of public service to the people of Southeast Michigan, his razor sharp wit, and a lifetime of dedication to improving the lives of all who walk this earth.\u201d The Michigan Democrat was a lion in the House for decades and a longtime committee chairman. In more recent years, he became known for his witty Twitter account and criticism of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday ordered the flags at the US Capitol to be flown at half-staff in honor of Dingell. \u201cJohn Dingell was a giant legislator on behalf of the people,\u201d said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. He described Dingell as a \u201ctireless advocate\u201d who fought for clean air, clean water, consumer protections and financial regulations throughout his nearly six decades in Congress. Dingell served in the House of Representatives for 59 years and 22 days, from 1955 to 2015. According to the House historian\u2019s office, he served with 11 presidents and cast 28,551 votes. Of that time, he served on the Energy and Commerce Committee for nearly 58 years, making Dingell the longest serving member on any congressional committee. He served as chairman of the committee for more than 15 years. Dingell, whose district was home to the Ford Motor Company, had long been a strong supporter of the auto industry but also stressed environmental issues over the years. He played a key role in helping pass signature pieces of legislation such as the Civil Rights Act, Medicare, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. \u201cI think he will go down in history as one of the most impactful members of the United States Congress,\u201d said Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries of New York. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a great tweeter as well.\u201d With the expansion of Twitter, Dingell became known for his commentary on current events through snarky and sometimes hard-hitting tweets that often went viral. He built a following of more than 250,000 users, dwarfing that of many current members of Congress. Trump has been the subject of his criticism in recent years, but more broadly, Dingell has been knocking what he describes as a decline in institutionalism. \u201cIn my six decades in public service, I\u2019ve seen many changes in our nation and its institutions. Yet the most profound change I\u2019ve witnessed is also the saddest,\u201d he wrote in a December op-ed for The Atlantic. \u201cIt is the complete collapse in respect for virtually every institution of government and an unprecedented cynicism about the nobility of public service itself.\u201d Dingell favored abolishing the Senate, where legislation faces a higher threshold for passage, and combining the two chambers into one. \u201cIt will take a national movement, starting at the grassroots level, and will require massive organizing, strategic voting, and strong leadership over the course of a generation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it has a nice ring to it, doesn\u2019t it? \u2018Abolish the Senate.\u2019 I\u2019m having blue caps printed up with that slogan right now. They will be made in America.\u201d John David Dingell Jr. was born July 8, 1926 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He was exposed to politics at an early age when his father was elected to the House in 1932. The young Dingell then served as a House page and attended the Capitol Page School from 1938 to 1943. \u201cWe saw some rather great things,\u201d Dingell said in a 2012 oral history interview with the office of the House historian. \u201cThe President (Franklin D. Roosevelt) declared war the day after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor (December 8, 1941). We saw Winston Churchill on the 26th of December, 1941, when he came to address the Congress.\u201d When he was 18, Dingell enlisted into the US Army, almost three years after he watched Roosevelt deliver his famous \u201cDay of Infamy\u201d address to Congress. After his father died while in office 1955, Dingell was elected to the seat in a special election at the age of 29. He was then re-elected to 29 more congressional sessions, until he decided not to run for re-election in 2014. His wife, Debbie, succeeded him and remains in the seat today. Dingell\u2019s service, combined with that of his father and his wife, marks the longest consecutive service in Congress for a single family: nearly 86 years.

They\u2019ve got a Wall Street billionaire, an anti-Wall Street crusader, a California prosecutor, a Midwestern populist, a New England socialist and a guy from Texas on a road trip. They\u2019ve got populists and capitalists and progressives and moderates. They\u2019ve got former Republicans and established statesmen. Some want a single-payer health care system. Some want a private system. Some want both. Elizabeth Warren is going to tax the rich. Michael Bloomberg doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s constitutional. Howard Schultz left the party to run as an independent. Bernie Sanders is still an independent, but his effort to drag the party more toward his progressive priorities has paid off.

No matter who stands to accept the nomination, it will disenfranchise someone taking an interest in the primary this year. Even Trump-hating conservatives like George Will are picking favorites.

Bernie Sanders is the only card-carrying democratic socialist of the bunch running so far. \u201cDo I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street\u2019s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy?\u201d he asked rhetorically in 2015 during a Democratic debate. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Elizabeth Warren claims to be a capitalist to her core, but she\u2019s made a career of holding Wall Street to account. \u201cI am a capitalist. Come on. I believe in markets,\u201d said said on CNBC. \u201cBut only fair markets, markets with rules. Markets without rules is about the rich take it all, it\u2019s about the powerful get all of it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s gone wrong in America.\u201d Square those two with Michael Bloomberg, who won big in the casino capitalist process and is worth many billions of dollars. \u201cWe need a healthy economy, and we shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about our system,\u201d he said this week. Then there\u2019s Schultz (not running as a Democrat!) but worth noting he said this week on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that it\u2019s partially Warren\u2019s policies that make him think the US is veering toward socialism. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the country should be heading to socialism,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she believes in programs that will lead to a level of socialism in America.\u201d Or Sherrod Brown, who was running on a populist message long before Donald Trump and wants to bring the term back for Democrats. \u201cHe uses his phony populism to distract from the fact that he has used the White House to enrich billionaires like himself. Real populism is not racist,\u201d Brown has said. Or Cory Booker, the New Jersey senator now in the race who employed a message of shared sacrifice and shared benefit in launching his campaign Friday. \u201cTogether, we will channel our common pain back into our common purpose,\u201d Booker said in his kickoff message. Somewhere in the middle is the rest of the potential field, including the likes of Kamala Harris, the prosecutor, and Kirsten Gillibrand, who has ties to Wall Street but has signed on to some progressive policy proposals as a senator. Former Vice President Joe Biden, for instance, is certainly a capitalist, but he might be somewhere to the left of Bloomberg and he\u2019s spoken about inequality. \u201cI don\u2019t think 500 billionaires are the reason we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Biden has said. \u201cThe folks at the top aren\u2019t bad guys. But this gap is yawning, and it\u2019s having the effect of pulling us apart. You see the politics of it.\u201d A more specific policy debate will come as Democrats try to find a coherent message on health care. Most of the senators thinking about runs have signed on to Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all proposal. But there\u2019s a difference between supporting his bill, which would end the private health insurance system as we know it, and the idea of Medicare for all, which suggests something people can opt into or buy is different than the specific bill, which would put everyone on a Medicare-type system. Sen. Kamala Harris learned those intricacies after her appearance at a CNN town hall. Senators who haven\u2019t signed onto the proposal include Brown, although he\u2019s long been an advocate for a single-payer health care system, but would rather allow people to buy into it. Harder to pin down are people like former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who never signed on to a Medicare-for-all bill, but during his failed Senate campaign posted his support for Medicare for all. He\u2019s said he opposes the Sanders-style plan. So does Klobuchar. Biden hasn\u2019t definitively taken a position on Medicare for all either. He\u2019ll have an interest in defending the Affordable Care Act, passed on his watch as vice president, if he enters the race. Rep. John Delaney, a wealthy businessman and dark horse candidate out of Maryland, has his own idea to guarantee basic minimum health care but then let the market provide everything else. There will be similar debates over social programs Sanders has proposed like free college education. Booker has a proposal to direct the Labor Department to test federal jobs guarantee programs. Several senators, including Kirsten Gillibrand, Harris and Warren, are cosponsors of that bill. The businessman and activist Andrew Yang, another dark horse, wants to give everyone a universal basic income of $1,000 per month. The Bloombergs and Delaneys of the field are concerned about the national debt. The Sanders and Warrens aren\u2019t so much. Populists like Brown and progressives like Sanders and Warren are unlikely to look favorably on trade deals. They all opposed the TPP, the Obama-era trade agreement Trump killed. But Biden, as vice president, was solidly in favor. Illustrations by CNN\u2019s Will Mullery Update: This piece does not analyze the platform of every declared or possible Democratic candidate.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat who rose to prominence as Newark\u2019s charismatic and ambitious mayor, announced Friday that he is running for president. Booker chose the first day of Black History Month to launch his campaign, timing that nods to Booker\u2019s own heritage and suggests he will put it at the center of his pitch to voters. \u201cThe history of our nation is defined by collective action; by interwoven destinies of slaves and abolitionists; of those born here and those who chose America as home; of those who took up arms to defend our country, and those who linked arms to challenge and change it,\u201d Booker narrates in a video released on Friday morning, which features him walking through his Newark neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019m Cory Booker and I\u2019m running for president of the United States of America,\u201d he says in the video. Booker joins a crowded and growing Democratic field that is already the most diverse in history \u2013 with multiple women, one gay candidate, a Latino and, with Booker now in the mix, two black candidates. His announcement comes nearly a year to the day from the Iowa caucuses and the start of the primary calendar. Booker plans to head to Iowa February 8-9 and then to South Carolina on February 10. He also intends to visit New Hampshire over Presidents Day weekend. Booker is one of several senators running for president or seriously considering it. At 49, he is the youngest among his Senate colleagues in the race. His age is not all that sets him apart: Booker is unmarried and vegan, two unique qualities among the emerging Democratic field. In his announcement video, Booker also notes that he is \u201cthe only senator who goes home to a low-income, inner city community\u201d in Newark, \u201cthe first community that took a chance on me.\u201d In the Senate, Booker has at times favored a pragmatic approach, teaming up with like-minded Republicans on issues like criminal justice. But he has also emerged as a passionate interrogator of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees \u2013 including Justice Brett Kavanaugh, at whose confirmation hearing Booker memorably unloaded in a heated \u201cSpartacus moment.\u201d Public polling suggests Booker is unknown to many Americans. But in a field where there is no clear front-runner, he brings a raw political talent that some Democrats believe could make him a powerful contender. The campaign message of Booker, who\u2019s a gifted orator on the stump, will center on his signature themes of finding \u201ccommon purpose\u201d and a bringing about a \u201crevival of civic grace\u201d in American society, drawing a stark, if implicit, contrast with President Donald Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric. While Booker has been reluctant to attack the President directly, not wanting to emulate his tactics, Trump has not hesitated to target the senator \u2013 saying during a White House event in October that Booker \u201cran Newark, New Jersey, into the ground.\u201d Here are the Democrats who have said they're running for president It\u2019s unclear how Booker\u2019s record as mayor will play in the Democratic primary or beyond. Critics say Booker did not meet his lofty promises to reshape the city, with some progressives faulting his support for school choice, among other issues. But Booker\u2019s allies believe this chapter of his story will be an asset, affording Booker some distance from Washington and demonstrating his executive chops. As a senator, Booker has sought to sand off some of his rough political edges ahead of 2020, burnishing his progressive credentials by signing on to policies such as \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d Last year, he announced he would no longer accept corporate PAC money; some progressives have been skeptical of Booker for the support he has received from Wall Street donors. Booker will also oppose super PACS supporting his candidacy or others. Reflecting its central place in Booker\u2019s story, Newark will be the headquarters for his campaign. Logistically, that home base will offer the candidate and his team easy access to the power hubs of Washington and New York, plus proximity to three major airports to facilitate travel to key primary states and fundraising hotspots around the country. His campaign manager will be Addisu Demissie, a veteran of Booker\u2019s 2013 Senate race, who most recently ran Gavin Newsom\u2019s successful bid for California governor. Demissie also boasts experience on the ground in Iowa, having cut his teeth as a field organizer for John Kerry\u2019s 2004 caucus campaign, returning in the 2008 cycle on behalf of Hillary Clinton. Other top campaign officials announced Friday include Jenna Lowenstein, who formerly ran Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy\u2019s 2018 re-election campaign, as deputy campaign manager; Booker\u2019s Senate chief of staff Matt Klapper as senior adviser; and Modia Butler, a longtime Booker adviser dating back to his days in Newark, as senior strategist. Booker\u2019s path to the nomination would almost certainly run through South Carolina, where African-American voters compose a majority of the Democratic primary electorate. But Booker has also aggressively cultivated a network in Iowa, recognizing that a strong performance there would build valuable momentum for later contests. To steer his Iowa operation, Booker has already lined up a team of sought-after operatives: Michael Frosolone, who led Iowa Democrats\u2019 statehouse campaigns in 2018; Joe O\u2019Hern, who ran the Democratic coordinated campaign in Ohio during the midterms and oversaw Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s 2016 caucus efforts; Haley Hager, most recently the Iowa director for Tom Steyer\u2019s NextGen group targeting young voters; and Tess Seger, outgoing communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party. Born in 1969 in Washington, Booker enjoyed a comfortable upbringing in the post-civil rights era, a lot he ascribes to a \u201cconspiracy of love\u201d that enabled his parents to break barriers. Cary and Carolyn Booker were among the earliest black executives at IBM and, because of anti-discrimination laws, they were able to buy a home and raise their children in the affluent, mostly white community of Harrington Park, New Jersey. Booker attended Stanford as a star football recruit, playing for four years but, by his own admission, never breaking through at the college level. Booker\u2019s interests were broad, however: He also served as student body president and ran a crisis hotline for students. He would go on to attend Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and later graduate from Yale Law School. With an elite law degree in hand, Booker bypassed more lucrative opportunities and moved into an affordable housing complex in one of Newark\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, planning to lend his skills to a nonprofit. He soon turned to local politics, however, unseating a longtime incumbent on the City Council. In 2002, Booker once again took on an uphill political battle, mounting a challenge to Newark Mayor Sharpe James, an avatar of old-school political corruption. Although Booker fell short by a few thousand votes, he won in losing \u2013 becoming a media and political darling in the process. Four years later, Booker ran again and won, cementing his status as a rising star in the Democratic Party. As a talented and ambitious black politician, Booker has elicited predictable comparisons to former President Barack Obama, whom he endorsed during the 2008 primary and campaigned for in 2012. Booker has acknowledged the trope and jokes about it, but he doesn\u2019t neatly fit the mold. Whereas Obama often was guarded and serious, Booker is an extrovert whose unbridled enthusiasm and brimming energy can seem almost comical. Booker also did not take the express lane to a presidential bid, as Obama did. Instead, he served nearly eight years as mayor, passing on an opportunity to lead Obama\u2019s Office of Urban Affairs in 2009, before successfully running for Senate in 2013 in a special election following the death of Sen. Frank Lautenberg. Booker will be up for re-election in New Jersey in 2020; state law would permit him to run for Senate and president simultaneously. Booker\u2019s core message has remained consistent over many years in politics \u2013 with a focus on love and unity that undergirds everything else. In some ways, Booker is a political heir to former President Jimmy Carter, who in the aftermath of the Nixon administration pledged a government \u201cas good and honest and decent and compassionate and filled with love as are the American people.\u201d Booker recently described Carter as a \u201cmoral (giant) in America\u201d and a model for \u201cwhat I want my message to be in leadership.\u201d Carter, for his part, had urged Booker to run for president. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who seems poised to be one of Booker\u2019s chief rivals, also embraced some of Carter\u2019s signature themes in her debut rally last week, repeatedly invoking the Carter-esque term \u201ctruth.\u201d But Booker makes a distinctly emotional appeal, with soaring, often sermon-like oratory. Last year, he said he doesn\u2019t know if he has tapped into \u201ca winning political message or not, but I will always be talking about trying to unify this country, trying to bring us together.\u201d And he has not been cowed by steep political odds before. \u201cHe\u2019s a person who operates between instincts, gut and faith,\u201d said Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat who\u2019s the most recent former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. \u201cWhat he did when he decided to take on an incumbent mayor, I think he\u2019s driven more by faith and purpose than politics.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz teased his potential 2020 presidential run with a \u201cpox on both your houses\u201d approach to Democrats and Republicans, hoping to seize on general antipathy toward the nation\u2019s two-party system. But in his first week in the 2020 gauntlet, punctuated by repeated media appearances, liberal angst and a less than smooth public book tour, Schultz saved his most biting attacks for the left, previewing how his potential independent bid could be contentious for the Democratic Party, which is hellbent on ousting President Donald Trump. Schultz\u2019s attacks on core Democratic policies framed not only the debate inside the party but previewed how Republicans will cast the eventual Democratic nominee in 2020. Over the course of only a few days, the billionaire labeled Medicare-for-All \u201cun-American,\u201d said Trump will get re-elected if the Democratic nominee supports significant tax hikes on the wealthy and argued the country can\u2019t afford \u201cfree college.\u201d \u201cIt concerns me that so many voices within the Democratic Party are going so far to the left,\u201d Schultz said this week. \u201cI think we got to get away from these falsehoods and start talking about the truth and not false promises.\u201d He added: \u201cIf I ran as a Democrat, I would have to say things that I know in my heart I do not believe, and I would have to be disingenuous.\u201d Howard Schultz deletes tweet about column that contained smears on Warren and Harris Schultz\u2019s criticisms could amplify the Republican message toward the Democrats in 2020. Some Republicans even cheered his critiques of the party, a sign of what could come should Schultz fully get into the race. Democrats remain unsure of how seriously to take a Schultz bid. Some speculate that this is all just an elaborate ruse to sell books, others believe it is a vanity project meant to burnish Schultz\u2019s ability to garner a following. But some are taking his foray into presidential politics seriously, gearing up for the possibility that he will need to be treated like any other candidate threatening a Democratic nominee. His moves have been monitored by aides on Democratic 2020 campaigns, in part because he has enough money to ensure that he is more than just a flash in the pan. And some Democratic organizations have begun building a research book on the former CEO, preparing to sully his candidacy, should he run. Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC, used the week to send out \u201cFOIA requests to national and state offices that either Schultz or his corporate entities may have interacted with\u201d as a CEO, said a spokesman for the group. And American Bridge, a Democratic opposition research organization, pledged on Tuesday \u2013 in the midst of Schultz\u2019s media blitz \u2013 to \u201coppose him at every turn\u201d should he run and \u201cstand in the way of defeating Trump\u201d in 2020. Schultz\u2019s roll out came after months of research and testing about whether a general election electorate would be receptive to an independent bid, including a series of one-on-one interviews with voters across the country by pollsters working for Schultz, according to multiple Schultz advisers. To date, Schultz has commissioned at least six national polls on his viability and place in the 2020 field, the advisers said. The polling has been led by Greg Strimple, a Republican pollster who worked on John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential bid, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s 2009 and 2013 gubernatorial bids and most recently worked with the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund. The results, said one adviser, showed an opening for an independent candidate who focuses intently on dysfunction in the two-party system. \u201cWe are going to have a different conversation with the American people than a Kamala Harris or a Donald Trump is going to have,\u201d said the adviser. \u201cWe are going to say do you think the two-party system is advancing the needs of the American people. Do you think it is advancing the American dream? It is going to be that kind of conversation.\u201d Schultz\u2019s team also focused intensely on his interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday. Howard Schultz says companies must do more than make money To gauge the response, the advisers said, the team commissioned a 1,000-voter dial test during the interview to see how different comments affected public sentiment for the former Starbucks CEO. One adviser said his attacks on the party system, his personal story and his record at Starbucks tested the best. Even still, there has been an overriding sense among Democrats that his first week in the spotlight also showed clear weaknesses in Schultz\u2019s effort, like his inability to answer policy questions and the fact that his first book tour event was remembered for a guy who stood up and called him an \u201ca**hole.\u201d The biggest black eye: Taking to Twitter to promote a column from a conservative outlet that included denigrating references to two Democratic senators, Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. Schultz later deleted the tweet and his team blamed a staffer, reminiscent of an argument Trump made after degrading Iowans on Twitter. \u201cI have heard from literally zero Democratic operatives or aides freaking out about Schultz\u2019s candidacy,\u201d said a top Democratic aide on a 2020 campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s fallen on his face - saying universal health care was un-American, promoting sexist and racist tropes about female presidential candidates, and getting screamed at for being an \u201ca**hole\u201d at his launch event.\u201d The aide added: \u201cDemocrats are trying to win a long primary. Schultz will have to survive even longer.\u201d Schultz\u2019s team argue Democrats \u2013 which have publicly worried about his impact on the race - are viewing a general election matchup between Trump, Schultz and a Democrat incorrectly by comparing him to 2016 third party candidates like Jill Stein and Gary Johnson. \u201cThey are thinking about a Jill Stein or a Ralph Nader or that type of person as a proxy for a campaign that Schultz would run if he runs a campaign and I will tell you, they are very different,\u201d said one Schultz adviser. \u201cWe will have real money, we will be on the ballot in all 50 states and we will go out and run a campaign that prosecutes the problems of the two party system.\u201d Schultz and his team worked with Kellen Arno and Kahlil Byrd, two strategists who - through Americans Elect - worked to get ballot access for their presidential ticket in 2012. While the effort wasn\u2019t successful, Americans Elect did get ballot access in 29 states. But even those close to Schultz acknowledge that he hasn\u2019t had a perfect week, the biggest blunder being the deleted tweet. \u201cIt was sloppy and dumb and shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the Schultz operation. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a whirlwind and the approval process broke down. It was embarrassing but unintentional.\u201d But that is far from the only misstep. A protester disrupted his first book tour event by calling him an \u201cegotistical billionaire a**hole,\u201d an incident that overshadowed anything else Schultz said at the event. \u201cGo back to getting ratioed on Twitter,\u201d yelled the man. \u201cGo back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world!\u201d And on policy, Schultz had to soften his criticism of Medicare for all as \u201cun-American.\u201d Though he defended calling universal healthcare \u201cun-American, which he first expressed on CBS This Morning on Tuesday, he later sought to clean it up on CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s not American,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cIt\u2019s unaffordable.\u201d Schultz\u2019s team have taken the critiques in stride, a nod to the fact that they aren\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cIf both parties attack, even better,\u201d said the adviser. \u201cIt will burnish his outsider image.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston and Cristina Alesci contributed to this report.",

He told CNN on Tuesday that the Democratic Party started losing him \u201cwhen the party started shifting so far left to progressive policies that I know in my heart are \u2026 as false as President Trump telling the American people when he was running for president that the Mexicans were going to pay for the wall.\u201d He stood by his criticism of \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d a policy supported by Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, as \u201cnot American\u201d and told CNN the proposal is \u201cunaffordable.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an idea that has no merit,\u201d he said of the 2% annual tax on Americans with an income over $10 million that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic hopeful, proposed. \u201cShe knows that there\u2019s no way this could come to pass this,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are just false campaign promises to make noise and again, it\u2019s punitive.\u201d Schultz does not support New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s plan of a 70% marginal tax rate on income over $10 million. How Howard Schultz's father drove him to build Starbucks \u201cWhy should we punish it? What\u2019s the American dream? The American dream is to create opportunity,\u201d he told Harlow. \u201cThe American dream is to rise above your standing in life. Now, we\u2019re going to be provide punitive tax rates for people who have succeeded. Now what we need is comprehensive tax reform.\u201d While he was critical of Democrats\u2019 tax proposals, he hasn\u2019t embraced Trump\u2019s tax cuts, either. \u201cThere has to be more skin in the game. Both for individuals who are of privilege and certainly corporations, who shouldn\u2019t receive a 21% tax cut just for being a corporation,\u201d he said. Harlow asked Schulz how his plan would reduce the widening income gap. Cillizza: 5 reasons Howard Schultz (probably) won't be president \u201cIs it raising corporate taxes immensely?\u201d she asked. \u201cI think the 21% tax rate was wrong. I would not be supportive of that if I was president,\u201d Schultz said, referring to the Republican tax plan\u2019s cut to the corporate rate. Harlow pushed again, \u201cBut would you raise corporate taxes?\u201d \u201cI would not be supportive of 21%,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should give you some idea as to what I would do. And I also think there has to be significant incentives of corporations to do more for their people: training, education, and obviously health insurance. But we need comprehensive tax reform.\u201d Schultz: Harris' Medicare-for-all plan 'not American' Though he hasn\u2019t officially announced, Schultz remained open to having a woman as his running mate. \u201cI think it\u2019s the most important thing to do is to have the highest qualified person and if that\u2019s a woman that would be wonderful,\u201d Schultz told Harlow. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201d Asked if he would add a Republican to the ticket, he said, \u201cI think that would be interesting and certainly demonstrate a centrist position, which I believe in.\u201d Since announcing Sunday that he\u2019s contemplating an independent run, Schultz\u2019s potential candidacy has been met with fierce opposition from Democrats, who think Schultz would take votes from their party\u2019s nominee and pave the way for Trump to win re-election. Schultz dismissed the criticism as a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d and argued that it would be a \u201cfar left progressive Democrat\u201d who would hand Trump a second term. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz: 'I am seriously thinking of running for President' Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who toyed with the idea of running as an independent in 2016, recently argued against third-party candidates. \u201cWell, this is a very different time than 2015,\u201d Schultz said, adding later, \u201cI respect his decision. If he\u2019s going to run, he\u2019s going to run as Democrat. Good luck to him. I respect Mike Bloomberg. I have a different view.\u201d If Bloomberg were to jump into the 2020 race, Schultz said it \u201cwould not affect me.\u201d Howard Schultz says Medicare-for-all is 'unaffordable' Schultz also vowed that he \u201cnever put myself in a position where I would be the person who re-elects Donald Trump, but that is not what I believe today.\u201d But the former Starbucks magnate didn\u2019t leave any ambiguity about his personal feelings about the current commander in chief when asked by Harlow for his first reaction to the words \u201cPresident Trump.\u201d \u201cDespicable,\u201d Schultz replied.",

            "article_content": "Americans are as divided as congressional Democrats about how to expand health care coverage to more people. Coming off their midterm election romp, progressive Democrats feel they have a mandate to push for a universal \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d plan. But some of their Democratic peers support less drastic changes to the nation\u2019s health care system. A national Medicare-for-all plan received the lowest favorability score in Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s January tracking poll, released Wednesday. Some 56% of respondents said they favor Medicare-for-all, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan. But roughly three-quarters of Americans prefer other proposals to expand Medicare or Medicaid, Kaiser found. Some 77% favor allowing people age 50 to 64 to buy into Medicare, while 75% would allow people who don\u2019t have job-based insurance to buy into Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income Americans. Democrats head into 2019 divided on how to fix health care Some 74% favor creating a national health insurance program similar to Medicare, but allowing people to keep the coverage they currently have, according to Kaiser. A majority of Democrats and independents favor all four of these options, but only buying into Medicare or Medicaid garners the support of about two-thirds of Republicans. Less than a quarter of Republicans favor Medicare-for-all and 47% support a national plan that would allow people to keep their coverage. Support for a national Medicare-for-all plan swings wildly after folks hear about the potential effects. It spikes when respondents are told that it would guarantee health insurance as a right or eliminate premiums and reduce out-of-pocket costs. Amid Obamacare uncertainty, Dems divided on health care as 2020 approaches But favorability slumps when they are told it would eliminate private health insurance, raise taxes or threaten the current Medicare program. And it tanks when told it would lead to delays in receiving care. Many people don\u2019t think Medicare-for-all would have an impact on them. Not surprisingly, the uninsured age 18 to 64 are most likely to say they\u2019d be better off, at 43%. But 37% of this group don\u2019t think it would have much of an effect, while 19% thought it would leave them worse off. Senior citizens, however, are not buying the Republican argument that Medicare-for-all would hurt the existing Medicare program. Only a quarter of Kaiser respondents 65 and older thought they\u2019d be worse off if a national plan were implemented. Despite all the hype surrounding Medicare-for-all, Americans want lawmakers to focus on other health care issues. First up is making sure that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage protections for those with pre-existing conditions remain. Close behind is lowering prescription drug costs. Democrats ramp up battle to lower drug prices Just over 1 in 10 respondents want lawmakers to implement Medicare-for-all, though the same share want to repeal and replace Obamacare. Protecting people from surprise medical bills ranks last.",

            "article_content": "There was a time \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t all that long ago \u2013 where the worst thing you could call a Democratic politician with aspiring national ambitions was \u201cliberal.\u201d Politicians ran from the label because they believed it connoted that they were out-of-touch, coastal elites \u2013 not the sort of candidate who could win in a place like Ohio or Iowa or even Colorado. Those days are over \u2013 at least among Democrats, according to a new Gallup poll on partisan identification. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! While the percentage of people who self-identify as \u201cliberal\u201d has been increasing steadily from 17% in 1992 to 26% in 2018, the real change has been in how Democrats think of themselves. In 1994, 1 in 4 Democrats called themselves liberals \u2013 the same number who referred to themselves as \u201cconservative Democrats.\u201d The bulk of Democrats \u2013 48% \u2013 said they were moderates. Today, for the first time in the history of Gallup asking the question, a clear majority (51%) of Democrats identify as liberal while 34% see themselves as moderates and and 13% regard themselves as conservatives. As Gallup\u2019s Lydia Saad notes, the percentage of Democrats who identified as liberals rose, roughly, one percentage point a year from 2002 to 2014, but has picked up to two points a year since 2014. What\u2019s interesting \u2013 and telling \u2013 is that a similar pattern hasn\u2019t played out among Republicans. Yes, more Republicans now identify as \u201cconservative\u201d today (73%) than did in 1994 (58%), but conservatives made up a majority in 1994 and still do two and a half decades later. There are lots of potential reasons for these changes. As Saad notes, the growth of unaffiliated voters over the past decade could mean that \u201cthe two major parties may be increasingly comprised of the more hard-core adherents of each side\u2019s philosophy.\u201d Which makes sense. If moderates abandon the Democratic and Republican parties because they feel as though the two sides have become too ideological and partisan, then the people left in the parties are going to be \u2013 wait for it! \u2013 more ideological and partisan. There has also been an aggressive movement within Democratic circles to reclaim the word \u201cliberal\u201d \u2013 to make clear that they proudly wear that banner rather than past politicians like, say, Hillary and Bill Clinton, who prided themselves on their centrist approach, a not-so-subtle rejection of the \u201cliberal\u201d tag. Case in point: An audience member named Rob Porter asked Hillary Clinton this question at a CNN debate in June 2007 in South Carolina: \u201cMrs. Clinton, how would you define the word \u2018liberal?\u2019 And would you use this word to describe yourself?\u201d Here\u2019s Clinton\u2019s full answer: \u201cYou know, it is a word that originally meant that you were for freedom, that you were for the freedom to achieve, that you were willing to stand against big power and on behalf of the individual. \u201cUnfortunately, in the last 30, 40 years, it has been turned up on its head and it\u2019s been made to seem as though it is a word that describes big government, totally contrary to what its meaning was in the 19th and early 20th century. \u201cI prefer the word \u2018progressive,\u2019 which has a real American meaning, going back to the progressive era at the beginning of the 20th century. \u201cI consider myself a modern progressive, someone who believes strongly in individual rights and freedoms, who believes that we are better as a society when we\u2019re working together and when we find ways to help those who may not have all the advantages in life get the tools they need to lead a more productive life for themselves and their family. \u201cSo I consider myself a proud modern American progressive, and I think that\u2019s the kind of philosophy and practice that we need to bring back to American politics.\u201d Which, like, what? Clinton clearly just didn\u2019t want to say the world \u201cliberal\u201d because she was worried how Republicans might use it against her in a general election. That she never got to the general election in that campaign \u2013 beaten by the more openly liberal Barack Obama \u2013 was a telling moment in how the Democratic Party\u2019s relationship with the word was changing. Compare Clinton\u2019s 2007 answer with what Bernie Sanders told The Guardian in the wake of the 2018 midterms. \u201cTake a hard look at the [House Democrats] elected to Congress next year,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that many of them are women or people of color \u2013 many of them are progressives who won their elections demanding Medicare for All, demanding raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and making public colleges and universities tuition free.\u201d And it\u2019s not just a willingness to re-embrace the word \u201cliberal.\u201d As the jockeying for the 2020 presidential race heats up, a number of potential contenders are crowding one another on the party\u2019s left via their support for longtime liberal dream policies including Medicare for All, free college and a $15 minimum wage. (Much touted liberal freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has proposed the possibility of taxing income over $10 million annually at 70% as a way to pay for the so-called \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d) Politicians are, by nature, a reactive species. With their livelihoods dependent on winning office (and votes), they tend to go where they believe those votes to be. The cavalcade of 2020 Democratic candidates sprinting to the left \u2013 oftentimes seemingly trying to out-liberal each other \u2013 is all the evidence you need (although the Gallup poll is useful too!) that the energy of the party is located in its liberal wing. The broader question heading into 2020 is whether a candidate who runs for \u2013 and wins \u2013 the Democratic presidential nomination as an unrepentant liberal is someone who can win the White House. In the Gallup data, more people still identify as \u201cconservative\u201d (35%) than say they are \u201cliberal\u201d (26%). That gap has narrowed, yes, over the past decade. But in 2020, it\u2019s still very likely that more people who turn out to vote will see themselves as \u201cconservatives\u201d than \u201cliberals.\u201d Does that matter when you have a president as abnormal \u2013 politically speaking \u2013 as Donald Trump? We\u2019re going to find out in 665 days.",

            "article_content": "It isn\u2019t easy for Ady Barkan to raise his right fist anymore, but he\u2019s been doing it a lot lately. Diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an incurable neurodegenerative disease better known as ALS or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, 34-year-old Barkan is a progressive activist who has spent the past two years fighting the GOP\u2019s 2017 tax bill and trying to help Democrats take back Congress. From his wheelchair in Minneapolis last month, Barkan addressed a crowd of hundreds. \u201cI am willing to give my last breath to save our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here to ask you: What are you willing to give?\u201d According to Barkan, his voice is getting weaker every month, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from being a vocal supporter for Democratic candidates in swing districts across the country. He recently released an advertisement endorsing Danny O\u2019Connor, a Democrat running for Congress in Ohio\u2019s 12th District, called \u201cThis dying father has a message for Ohio voters\u201d \u2013 and Barkan\u2019s PAC purchased $100,000 worth of airtime to broadcast it. \u201cI was shocked when the Republicans in Congress proposed a tax bill that would take away my health care to fund tax cuts for billionaires,\u201d he says in the ad. \u201cYour family and my family are going to pay the price, so now I\u2019m asking you to be a hero.\u201d Barkan told CNN he created the ad because Ohio\u2019s upcoming special election will be seen as a sign of what to expect in November\u2019s midterm election. It\u2019s also another election, and with 23 seats needed for Democrats to take back the House, every race matters, he said. This is only the latest effort from Barkan\u2019s Be a Hero Fund, a project of the Center for Popular Democracy that focuses on electing Democratic candidates who will protect health care programs like Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. The fund created a similar ad campaign in April to influence a special election in Arizona, and Barkan said his team hopes to run advertisements in other districts before the midterm election. \u201cI just want people to know that their future is in their hands and our democracy is what we make of it,\u201d he said. Last month, Barkan embarked on a six-week speaking tour from coast to coast to campaign for Democratic congressional candidates. As part of the 22-state \u201cBe a Hero\u201d tour, Barkan has joined forces with activists and politicians like Sens. Kamala Harris, D-California, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, to mobilize voters and raise awareness about health care. \u201cOur elected officials in D.C. are refusing to be heroes on our behalf, and I am asking Americans all across the country to be heroes by organizing their neighborhoods and co-workers and friends and family, and making sure that everyone votes in the election to preserve our health care and protect our democracy,\u201d he said. Why I confronted Jeff Flake on a plane Barkan made headlines last year when a video of him confronting Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, at 30,000 feet on a cross-country flight surfaced on social media. In the video, Barkan asked Flake to vote against the GOP\u2019s proposed tax-cut bill, which Barkan said would have a devastating effect on his disability payments and medical costs. \u201cYou can be an American hero, you really can,\u201d Barkan said on the plane. \u201cYou can save my life.\u201d His career as a political activist didn\u2019t end there. Barkan was arrested on Capitol Hill less than a week later while protesting the same bill. The tax plan passed, but Republican leaders did agree to prevent a $25 billion cut to Medicare, a cut Barkan had aggressively protested. In an Op-Ed he wrote for CNN last year, Barkan said he never imagined he would be in this position. \u201cA year ago, I was healthy, taking morning runs on the California coast and looking forward to a new life with my newborn son, Carl,\u201d he wrote. Barkan was diagnosed with ALS in October 2016, when his son was 4 months old. It's been a hard year for many families, including ours. And next year will bring a new wave of challenges.But we're here together now. So we're going to cherish this moment, enjoy this day.And we'll do it again tomorrow, thankful for what we have.May you find peace too. pic.twitter.com/NyoW79x1I3 \u201cMy wife and I, it felt like we had the perfect life until that moment, and it\u2019s obviously been very difficult and very sad that I won\u2019t have as much time with my son as I would like,\u201d Barkan said. Now, he says he is using what years he has left to fight for democracy and to make the world a better place for his son. Barkan has a busy few weeks ahead as he finishes his speaking tour August 12. After stops in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, D.C. and Delaware last week, his next events are in New York, where he will speak alongside gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon and with Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Although it\u2019s becoming more difficult as his illness progresses, Barkan said he will continue giving speeches until he is no longer able. To his followers on Twitter, he has made one thing clear:  \u201cI may be dying, but I\u2019m definitely not going quietly.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Dr. Adam Kassam is a Toronto-based physician who writes about health care, public policy and international affairs. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree from Cornell University, medical degree from Dartmouth College and a master\u2019s degree in public health from Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. The decision by Sen. Elizabeth Warren to unveil her Medicare for All plan left little doubt that health care will likely be the single most important policy issue facing Americans in 2020. And while much of the political narrative will focus on how the election represents a referendum on President Donald Trump, Sen. Warren decided to listen to polls and make health care reform a central theme of her campaign. It\u2019s a bold decision. And a risky one. To announce an eye-watering $20 trillion government-run health care program as a central pillar of one\u2019s platform would have, a decade ago, earned any politician derision and mockery while sinking his/her chances for ever running for president. That it is now a serious part of a leading contender\u2019s platform is a testament to how quickly the political landscape has changed. The courage that is needed to publicly disclose a fully-costed Medicare plan cannot be understated. It also demonstrates that Sen. Warren wants to have a real debate about policy, which should be commended given how elusive nuanced discussion has become in the hyperpolarized political climate. The evidence about the importance of universal health coverage to the well-being of society is strong: Various studies show such coverage reduces disease mortality rates, poverty and inequality and prolongs life. It should, therefore, not come as a surprise that there is a growing momentum to recognize health care as a basic human right. Each of us are personally touched by a health care issue at some point in our lives \u2013 and most reasonable people believe that one should not endure financial hardship because he or she became sick. Democratic naysayers are wrong on Medicare for All The more difficult question is whether a Medicare for All plan is the best way to achieve universal health coverage. Most of the discussion has centered on how much it would cost to implement Medicare for All and not enough on how this would impact patients directly. As a Canadian physician, and one who works in a single-payer model, I believe it is imperative to present to patients the many benefits of a transition to a Canadian-style model, such as cheaper prices for drugs such as insulin, along with the potential pitfalls of such a system, so that voters are better able to make an informed decision at the ballot box. The non-partisan Commonwealth Fund has ranked a number of health care systems with single-payer models \u2013 including that of Canada \u2013 as consistently among the worst of 11 OECD nations on patient outcomes, access and equity. Interestingly, even those who study health care systems have been reluctant to endorse a single-payer model. Part of this stems from the fact that close to 5 million Canadians, roughly 13% of the population, currently don\u2019t have a family doctor. Compounding this problem are the soaring specialist wait times that are unfortunately becoming a hallmark of our health care system. Sadly, the shuttering of clinics and rationing of care is happening at alarming rates in Canada. Medicare for All is a political loser The reason for this is a combination of factors that includes the unique situation of physicians being treated as independent private contractors. This means doctors bill the government for their services rendered to patients, but in many circumstances are responsible for setting up their own clinics, having to pay the cost of rent, utilities, medical supplies and other human resources overhead. In this paradigm, the government sets a ceiling for physician billings. With increased costs, many physicians have decided to reduce their hours, work part-time, cease practicing and retire. Moreover, it is also not uncommon for my patients to wait over a year from the moment I refer them to an orthopedic surgeon to the time they receive the appropriate workup, imaging and are ultimately operated upon. This is happening amid a doctor shortage in Canada where, paradoxically, newly qualified primary and specialist physicians \u2013 many of whom I know personally and trained alongside \u2013 are having trouble finding work. It is increasingly challenging for new graduates to find jobs in specialty care centers, which often have restrictions on the number of full-time hires that can be employed. The Medicare for All bill is a winner All of this helps explain why nearly 200,000 Canadians travel abroad annually for health care services. Nevertheless, there is a valid argument to be made in the United States about reducing per capita spending on health care to align with rates in other nations. Administrative costs in Canada are much lower than in the United States, and physicians don\u2019t have to navigate labyrinthine payment structures with multiple insurance companies. Most importantly, patients are also not being bankrupted for merely needing health care services. However, Sen. Warren\u2019s plan to put pressure on the supply side of the health care industry may serve to alienate providers who will make decisions based on economic considerations. In other words, by squeezing providers and hospitals, a government-administered system will reduce incentives to see patients and exacerbate the epidemic of burnout within health care communities. There is no perfect health care system. In the same way that many would describe the American system as too beholden to greedy insurance companies, one might argue that an unyielding adherence to a single-payer philosophy has also prevented desperately needed reform in Canada.  The best answer probably lies somewhere in between, and the Goldilocks approach is something to which Americans should give serious consideration. Blended health care models \u2013 that is, mixtures of public and private payer options \u2013 have a track record of success around the world, which is why strengthening of Obamacare and a fill-in-the-gaps plan is likely to be the most realistic, methodical and cost-effective way of improving upon a system in dire need of reform. Ultimately, in a partisan world increasingly being defined by purity tests, we should remember that perfection should not be the enemy of the good. Incremental progress is part of the journey toward betterment, which has deep scientific roots in evidence-based practice and policy making. It is this ethos of compassion, patience and meticulousness that will empower us to make the right decisions to improve our society.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. The Joker told Batman, \u201cThis is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.\u201d That line, from the closing minutes of \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d, is one way to anticipate what will happen on Capitol Hill next week: Public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump begin Wednesday. The unstoppable force? A parade of witnesses testifying that Trump\u2019s White House appeared to be shaking down Ukraine\u2019s president to force an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, despite a lack of evidence of wrongdoing. The immovable object: Trump and his GOP supporters, who this week tried out an array of defenses, including Sen. Lindsey Graham saying he won\u2019t read the witnesses\u2019 transcripts and that the process is \u201cBS.\u201d \u201cAs the President faces an impeachment inquiry, he, like any individual facing a serious allegation, has a right to mount a robust defense,\u201d noted Elliot Williams. \u201cHowever, President Trump\u2019s behavior toward those tasked with congressional oversight and investigations into his personal conduct, and his attitude toward the current congressional impeachment inquiry are all rooted in the same idea: that our country\u2019s basic systems themselves are illegitimate.\u201d Trump is relying on \u201cpublic mistrust of government\u201d and showing he doesn\u2019t understand the limits on presidential power, Williams wrote. The problem for Democrats is that Trump\u2019s approach may be working, wrote Susan Glasser in the New Yorker. \u201cThe allegations of abuse of power are striking and unprecedented: a President seeking to privatize American foreign policy for his personal political benefit.\u201d But we know how this will end, she suggested. \u201cFor Trump and his defenders, it is a coup, a show trial, a witch hunt. When that is the starting point, there is no place for the facts, no process that can satisfy, no way to split the difference\u2026 the President has successfully rendered the investigation irrelevant, at least for his most fervent supporters.\u201d The open hearings may shift opinion. So far, polls show a huge partisan divide between an overwhelming majority of Democrats who favor impeachment and an equally solid bloc of Republicans who don\u2019t. Arick Wierson argued that Democrats should drop the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d talk when describing Trump\u2019s interaction with Ukraine\u2019s president: \u201cAmericans are never going to agree to removing a President from office for engaging in acts described by a Latin term many don\u2019t understand or at least would never use.\u201d Instead, \u201crebrand Trump\u2019s alleged transgressions with a term that most Americans don\u2019t need to Google to understand \u2013 one with teeth. Bribery. Extortion. Payola. Shakedown. Ransom payment. There are plenty of better ways to say it than quid pro quo.\u201d All week Trump hammered away at the whistleblower, wrote Elie Honig, who called the \u201crelentless assault\u201d by the President and his backers \u201cwrong, irrelevant and dangerous.\u201d Witnesses have backed up all of the whistleblower\u2019s key allegations. Meanwhile the impeachment controversy dragged in Vice President Mike Pence, who met with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky before military aid to that nation was released. Trump (and Pence) biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio suggested that the vice president might not be an immovable object. \u201cIf Trump needs to find a scapegoat to take the heat off himself in the Ukraine scandal, Pence is the perfect target,\u201d he wrote. In the New Zealand parliament, Chl\u00f6e Swarbrick\u2019s response when an older colleague heckled her during a climate crisis speech was instant: \u201cOK Boomer.\u201d And it went viral. So my colleague Pat Wiedenkeller asked two of CNN Opinion\u2019s regular commentators to hash it out. Millennial Jill Filipovic wrote to Boomer Paul Callan: \u201cYou Boomers have called us \u2018snowflakes,\u2019 mocked us for trigger warnings and safe spaces (which are just an attempt to be sensitive to others), and even derided avocado toast (which is delicious). You were born into post-war prosperity, enjoyed the riches of government hand-outs and affordable education, then moved into your subsidized suburban homes and pulled the ladder up behind you.\u201d Callan fired back: \u201cYour professional success is undoubtedly the result of your Boomer parents raising you in a \u2018subsidized suburban home,\u2019 thereby facilitating the \u2018affordable education\u2019 you now criticize. The participation trophies were a Boomer error I readily admit.\u201d And from there, the exchange got a little\u2026tense \u2013 and enlightening. And nobody got hurt. In a related vein, two former Nobel Peace Prize winners, congratulated young activists for acting on climate issues while adults have largely abdicated. Leymah Gbowee and Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta wrote, \u201cUnencumbered by bureaucracy, conformity and conventional wisdom, young people have the raw, out-of-the-box thinking that could lead to the development of the \u2018moonshot\u2019 ideas we need to save the planet.\u201d Everything in politics may look different less than a year from now, when voters choose a president. Tuesday\u2019s off-year election offered some intriguing clues. Julian Zelizer described key results as \u201cextraordinarily frightening for Republicans. Like the 2018 House midterms, which were devastating to the GOP, the results in Kentucky and Virginia offer evidence that the president\u2019s record is putting their party in real jeopardy. They show that the President\u2019s imprint on politics \u2013 more than almost anything else \u2013 has the capacity to drive up Democratic turnout as the party\u2019s loyalists, including union members, show they are furious about what has taken place.\u201d Alice Stewart was in accord with fellow Republicans who argued that their loss of the governorship in very red Kentucky wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s fault. But she urged the Trump campaign to pay attention: \u201cSuburbs are the new Florida, so focus on suburbia.\u201d In the Atlantic, Ron Brownstein, noted that the GOP \u201csuffered resounding repudiations in urban centers and inner suburbs, which contain many of the nonwhite, young-adult, and white-collar white voters who polls show are most resistant to Trump.\u201d If the trend continues, it\u2019s hard to see how the President could again go down the narrow path that brought him victory in 2016. There\u2019s alarm on the Democratic side too as the battle between two of the top tier candidates, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, grew more fiery, particularly after Warren rolled out a Medicare for All plan that wipes out private health insurance. Bakari Sellers warned: \u201cIf Democrats are serious about defeating Trump, flipping the US Senate, and expanding our lead in the US House, we must understand that purity tests \u2013 making sure that a candidate\u2019s ideology lines up perfectly with their party\u2019s \u2013 do not work.\u201d At the end of the week, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg roiled the field with news that he was considering entering the race. Two people who have worked for him, Arick Wierson and Bradley Honan, argued that Bloomberg is the perfect antidote to Trump, but others, including Peter Beinart in the Atlantic, were skeptical about his chances. Virginia\u2019s election results were important for more than just statewide issues. Carol Jenkins wrote that new Democratic majorities in the state legislature will be in position to make it the 38th and final state needed to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment: \u201cEarlier this year in Virginia, the measure lost \u2013 by one vote.\u201d She added, \u201cDeliberately left out of the Constitution when it was written, women have paid the price in opportunities, rights and protections ever since.\u201d Other smart takes on politics: Jennifer Rodgers: On Trump taxes, the Supreme Court should do the right thing Robert Redford: A race against time to undo the damage caused by Trump Michael Bociurkiw: After Trump debacle, Ukraine has one card to play James Gagliano: It\u2019s not just Barr \u2013 we need a new way to keep attorneys general nonpartisan Michael D\u2019Antonio: What really \u2018triggered\u2019 Donald Trump Jr. Joe Lockhart: GOP\u2019s raging hypocrisy on impeachment President Trump has discovered his inner sports fan, leaving his resorts and the White House in recent weeks for a World Series game, a UFC fight and the LSU-Alabama game. In Alabama, he was cheered. But at the first two events he heard a sound that is never directed at him at his rallies: boos. It\u2019s what he deserves, wrote Dean Obeidallah: \u201cGiven polls showing nearly 60% of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing, he should brace himself to hear a lot more boos between now and when he finally vacates the White House.\u201d Politics and sports often don\u2019t mix. When the World Champion Washington Nationals visited the White House Monday, some team members didn\u2019t show up, including relief pitcher Sean Doolittle, who has objected to Trump\u2019s rhetoric. But some were enthusiastic, including catcher Kurt Suzuki who wore a MAGA hat for the occasion. It took guts for both players, wrote Paul Begala: \u201cWhen liberal Sean Doolittle pitches, MAGA-loving Kurt Suzuki catches him\u2026when they step inside those white lines to earn their living playing a kids\u2019 game, Suzuki and Doolittle have to put aside whatever political differences they may have and work together in perfect harmony for the good of the team. I think a lot of politicians could learn from these two ballplayers.\u201d A century ago, on November 11, 1919, Americans marked the one-year anniversary of the end of World War I with a new holiday. \u201cArmistice Day\u201d is now known as Veterans Day and it honors those who have served in the military in war and peace. Among those we should remember Monday, wrote Admiral Mike Gilday, the US Navy\u2019s Chief of Naval Operations is Cmdr. Ernest Evans, \u201cwho chose to sail the USS Johnston into harm\u2019s way during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Sea in 1944. Despite the superior Japanese force of battleships, heavy cruisers, and destroyers, Johnston\u2019s actions ultimately crippled the Imperial Japanese Navy. Evans, who died in action, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.\u201d The lesson to remember? Gilday wrote, \u201cAcross the nation this Veterans Day, we honor the service, sacrifice and commitment of those men and women who have worn the cloth of this great nation. If you believe as I do that there is a desire in every human heart to live in freedom, then this day is a special day.\u201d Jill Filipovic: Mourning the Mormon victims and opening our hearts Glenn Gamboa: Lizzo is primed to end cancel culture Mark Osler: Wisconsin\u2019s governor should pardon Brendan Dassey Lisa Woolfork: \u2018Harriet\u2019 breaks open what we know about slavery Kovie Biakolo: Nigeria\u2019s \u2018Lionheart\u2019 disqualification is bigger than the Oscars Ernesto Garratt: Chile\u2019s elites aren\u2019t listening to the protesters AND\u2026 Emma Watson, famous for playing Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies, spoke out about the pressures she deals with as her 30th birthday approaches. \u201cIt took me a long time, but I\u2019m very happy (being single),\u201d she said in an interview with Vogue. \u201cI call it being self-partnered.\u201d The phrase drew some jeers on social media, but Holly Thomas wrote that there\u2019s nothing wrong with Watson\u2019s mindset and she didn\u2019t deserve \u201ca maelstrom of criticism for her honesty.\u201d The larger question, according to Thomas: \u201cwhy does the pressure for women to partner up remain so rife? There is little evidence that, for them, being in a couple is necessarily better than being single in terms of life expectancy, happiness or health.\u201d The answer: \u201cIt is, however, in men\u2019s interests for women to believe that they should partner up. Studies have repeatedly shown that a man is likely to live longer and enjoy better mental and physical health if he is married to a woman. It\u2019s little wonder that centuries of PR in a male-run world have been dedicated to teaching women that they are sad or somehow deficient if they remain alone.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sarah Isgur is a CNN political analyst. She has worked on three Republican presidential campaigns and is an adjunct professor at George Washington University\u2019s School of Media and Public Affairs. She is a graduate of Harvard Law School. The views expressed here are the author\u2019s. Read more opinion on CNN. While the latest head-to-head polls show President Donald Trump trailing Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, translating those polls into votes for the Democratic nominee next fall won\u2019t be easy. Earlier this month, Elizabeth Warren announced that she would not hold big-dollar fundraisers, even if she becomes the Democratic nominee. Within hours, though, her aides added a caveat: This pledge did not apply to fundraisers she would do on behalf of the Democratic National Committee. This important addendum should come as no surprise to those who have been following the problems at the DNC for the last several years. With just one year left before election day, the DNC doesn\u2019t have the money, the data or the team to adequately support the eventual nominee. Filings from late September reveal an anemic DNC mired in debt while the RNC has senior staff set up already in a whopping 19 states. Elizabeth Warren, and every other candidate who appeared on the debate stage last week, knows that it will be nearly impossible to win the White House without a competent national party apparatus \u2014 especially if there is a protracted fight for the nomination that stretches into the spring. Voter turnout is what will ultimately decide who wins the 2020 election. This election will not be about winning over undecided voters with television ads. There are few undecided voters, now that nearly every American has an opinion about President Trump (only 5% have \u201cno opinion\u201d about his job performance). But it doesn\u2019t matter whether more than half of voters want him out of the White House if they don\u2019t show up to vote when it counts. That\u2019s why money \u2014 and enough time to spend it \u2014 matters. Turning out voters takes enormous resources on the ground in every state. It takes money far enough in advance that a campaign can build out a ground game with enough time to identify middle- to low-propensity voters, target them with digital ads that are laser-focused on their interests and bombard them with information to get them to the polls at the right place and on the right day. It takes field staff knocking on the right doors at the right time so that a candidate banks as many votes as possible when early voting starts. That makes it easier come Election Day, when field staff can focus on targeting the remaining stragglers. It\u2019s a game of millimeters. DNC warns of heightened disinformation activity ahead of debate (This is why Hillary Clinton and her team sound silly when they crow about winning the popular vote in 2016. All that means is they wasted time and money targeting the wrong voters. I assure you that the Trump team didn\u2019t waste a moment\u2019s thought on getting extra votes in Texas. They spent their resources in, you guessed it, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.) Let\u2019s step back a moment. Last week, The New York Times published an in-depth story about voters in a swing county in Pennsylvania. The interview that opens the piece is with Mark Graham, an Obama voter who switched to supporting Trump in 2016. He hasn\u2019t been impressed by the President\u2019s performance (he called Trump\u2019s behavior \u201ca joke\u201d), but after watching the Democratic primary debates in September, he told the Times he couldn\u2019t back any of the Democrats either. Then came the political chaos of the past few weeks. Now Graham says, \u201cI\u2019d vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who it is at this point.\u201d Upon reading that, the DNC may be gaining confidence \u2013 that\u2019s one more vote in Pennsylvania, right? But do you see the problem? Graham doesn\u2019t actually like any of the Democratic candidates on that stage; he just happens to like Trump less. He\u2019s what you\u2019d have in your database as a high-propensity voter (he votes every four years) with a low attachment score for the eventual nominee (he\u2019s not particularly motivated to vote for the Democrat). Graham is not undecided \u2013 but once the general election is here and he\u2019s bombarded with negative ads about the Democratic nominee on social media, specifically targeted to his interests, Graham may well throw up his hands and decide not to vote at all. This means the DNC needs someone to visit Mr. Graham and remind him of all the things he\u2019s feeling right now about President Trump and make sure he doesn\u2019t decide to stay home in November of 2020. He doesn\u2019t need to hear more about Medicare for All canceling his private insurance; he needs to hear about President Trump\u2019s latest mess. But who\u2019s going to knock on that door? And, unless The New York Times writes a profile on every voter in Erie, how will the DNC know who else to talk to and what to say? Hillary Clinton appears to suggest Russians are 'grooming' Tulsi Gabbard for third-party run While the Democratic primary candidates are raising gobs of money, they are also spending it largely in ways designed to help them defeat their fellow Democrats in the primaries, not to defeat Donald Trump in the general election. On the one hand, Democratic contenders are building miniature ground games in early primary states, which would be good, except that Pennsylvania and Ohio are not early primary states. You don\u2019t need a ground game in South Carolina to beat Donald Trump come next fall. Building those early ground games, of course, is exactly why the party committees exist. But the DNC isn\u2019t exactly inspiring confidence that the organization will be ready for the fight come 2020. New FEC reports were filed last night and the gulf continues to widen. The DNC raised under $7 million, with $8.6 million on hand and more than $7 million in debt. The Republican National Committee, on the other hand, raised more than $27 million and has over $59 million on hand with no debt. This means the Trump campaign and the RNC combined in the third quarter to raise over $125 million. Add that to the multiple staff shakeups at various Democratic party committees and, well, yikes. Voters have strong feelings about the President and about the direction of the Democratic Party. But feelings don\u2019t equal turnout. A recent experiment, for example, showed that Democratic voters who were exposed to news coverage about some of the left-leaning policy positions taken by Democratic candidates at the debate became slightly more enthusiastic about voting for the eventual nominee of their party. But the survey also showed two big red flags. First, independents who read about the party\u2019s leftward turn were 6% less likely to vote Democratic. Second, the experiment also found that the results \u201cdid not indicate [Democratic voters] were more motivated to vote and campaign for the eventual nominee than those who hadn\u2019t read about them.\u201d  This is why campaigns and parties spend hundreds of millions of dollars on targeted digital ads, and on building a robust ground game. And while the President may be turning off non-white voters in Florida, Democrats aren\u2019t going to win that state or any other swing state unless their voters actually show up to\u2014you guessed it\u2014vote. But the eventual Democratic nominee won\u2019t have a field army to greet them at the Panhandle gates. We may spend a lot of time talking about the polls in the media, but the candidates who appeared on last week\u2019s debate stage would be wise to remember: Polls don\u2019t vote.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cBurning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke said Saturday that the best thing President Trump could do for the country is to resign. Rather than forcing the country to go through a divisive impeachment process or scorched-earth election, O\u2019Rourke said, the President should decide, for the sake of the country and his own self-interest, that he needs to bow out. \u201cThe best possible path, especially if you\u2019re concerned about a country that\u2019s never been more divided, perhaps more highly polarized every day, is for this President to resign, allow this country to heal and ensure that we come back together with the greatest, most ambitious agenda we\u2019ve ever faced, none of it possible while he remains in power,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told an audience in Austin. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plea for a president to step aside has solid roots in American political history. This week Robert Schenkkan\u2019s \u201cThe Great Society\u201d opens at Lincoln Center in New York City. The play, a sequel to Schenkkan\u2019s Tony Award-winning \u201cAll the Way,\u201d focuses on President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s tumultuous years between 1965 and 1968, when his decision to escalate the war in Vietnam came to devastate his presidency. \u201cIn Shakespearean terms,\u201d Schenkkan tells me via email, \u201cthe two LBJ plays are consciously modeled on Shakespeare\u2019s History Plays. This is a variant of the Wheel of Fortune. The only constant of power is that your grip on it is only temporary. The King is dead; long live the King.\u201d While his political opponents blasted \u201cJohnson\u2019s War\u201d as unjust and unnecessary, Johnson \u2013 played in the Broadway run by Brian Cox of \u201cSuccession\u201d \u2013 watched as his grand domestic accomplishments, such as Medicare and voting rights, got drowned out by calamities foreign and domestic. The disastrous war consumed the nation at the same time that a brewing white backlash to civil rights tore Johnson\u2019s coalition apart. Trump's ruthless attacks may come back to haunt him When antiwar Democrat Sen. Eugene McCarthy came in a strong second place in the 1968 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary, Johnson\u2019s team was stunned. On March 31, 1968, Johnson shocked the nation. The President ended a nationally televised speech about a temporary bombing halt in Vietnam by saying: \u201cI shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\u201d Even his advisers hadn\u2019t known about that part of the speech. As I recount in my book, \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now,\u201d there was elation in certain parts of the country at Johnson\u2019s announcement, particularly where antiwar sentiment was running strong. In New York\u2019s Greenwich Village, people took to the streets to cheer \u201cGoodbye Lyndon.\u201d Besides his fears of defeat, Johnson explained that stepping down was the only noble option that would allow him to devote his full attention to figuring out an end to the war and letting the nation start to come together, without political considerations looming over his head. LBJ was not the only president to make this decision. Johnson had watched from the Senate in 1952, as President Harry Truman, facing terrible approval ratings and a deadlocked conflict in Korea, decided that he would not run for reelection. Johnson\u2019s successor, President Richard Nixon, faced with a House of Representatives ready to vote for articles of impeachment and a Senate open to removing him, decided to step down from office in August 1974, before his term had ended. SE Cupp: This just got real. Brace yourself What are the chances that President Trump would make the same choice? The prospects of Trump ending his career rather than forcing others to do it for him \u2013 either Congress or the electorate \u2013 seem remote. Trump loves a fight and seems to be revved up by the prospect of taking on the Democratic House. Over the last few days, he has gone on a Twitter storm attacking all of his opponents. In one tweet, he wrote of Rep. Adam Schiff: \u201cI want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.\u201d Trump has spent his entire career punching back when attacked, and right now he believes he has the full support of his party going into this political battle. With memories of the 1998 midterms, when the electorate punished the GOP for impeaching President Bill Clinton, Trump is betting that voters will turn against the Democrats rather than him, putting him in an even stronger position by Election Day. There are some experts who speculate that this mess could all end with the President stepping down, not for the good of the nation, but for the good of his own future. They envision some kind of a deal giving him legal immunity from prosecution in exchange for leaving office. In other words, resignation would be his get-out-of-jail-free card. But it is extremely difficult to imagine Trump voluntarily reaching the same decision that audiences are seeing Brian Cox reenact in \u201cThe Great Society.\u201d Johnson loved a fight, but he also had a deep respect for the nation\u2019s democratic institutions and for the duties of governance. Trump does not. He has joined forces with a generation of Republicans who are willing to tear everything down if necessary in pursuit of partisan power. He also appears to have little reverence or even respect for the office that he holds. Rudy Giuliani -- international man of mystery If there is going to be an outcome of the kind that O\u2019Rourke is talking about, it probably won\u2019t come through voluntary choice. And barring some kind of legal deal that he can\u2019t refuse, this President will keep on fighting until he no longer can. The only way to reach a Johnsonian outcome, in Trump\u2019s case, would be via the Richard Nixon path. The future will rest on what Senate Republicans decide they want to do about a lawless president. If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell met with Trump to deliver the news that his colleagues would not support the administration should a trial prove that articles of impeachment were sound, the President would suddenly be the one sitting on the other end of the boardroom table about to be told, \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d Only then would the possibility of resignation become real. Right now, however, we\u2019re not even close to that point. Many key Senate Republicans have been scrambling to the cameras to affirm their support for the President. \u201cI think it\u2019s very appropriate for the President of the United States to suggest that you\u2019ve got a corruption problem and this prosecutor that was fired, maybe it was because he was corrupt, or maybe because he was looking at something close to America here,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters last week. However much they might rumble privately about the impropriety of a president dictating foreign policy based on promises of election assistance, Senate Republicans are standing firmly behind the White House for now. The situation is so extreme that some experts are not convinced that McConnell would even convene a Senate trial \u2014 once again breaking constitutional norms all for the sake of the GOP \u2014 even though McConnell has said that he would. Yet one should never say never in American politics, especially since political parties tend to reverse course when they see that doing more of the same will break their hold on power.  The power of partisanship on which Trump has depended might turn against him if the party no longer sees him as being in its best interests. More than good conscience or realism, the loss of Republican support in the Senate will be the only development that can leave President Trump standing alone, with no choice but to step down.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. It was a raw, visceral moment at last week\u2019s Democratic debate when Beto O\u2019Rourke discussed the human toll of the massacre in his hometown of El Paso and vowed,  \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d In remarks that were applauded by some of his rivals on stage in Houston and many other people, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d Sizing up the performance of the 10 candidates, debate coach Todd Graham awarded O\u2019Rourke an \u201cA\u201d for his \u201cpowerful\u201d gun control argument: \u201cHis genuineness was evident,\u201d wrote Graham. But as Zachary Wolf wrote, the politics of taking away any variety of guns is complicated: \u201cRepublicans have been warning for decades that Democrats will try to take weapons away from gun owners.\u201d Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were among those who argued \u201cthat they absolutely would not,\u201d but instead only sought to improve gun safety laws. On the controversial idea of replacing all private health insurance with a government plan, advocates like Senator Elizabeth Warren insisted that voters will welcome the change: \u201cI\u2019ve actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\u201d (Polls suggest otherwise, as Harry Enten wrote.) Like O\u2019Rourke, Warren may be walking a tightrope as she appeals to the progressive Democratic base while looking ahead to the possibility of a race against President Donald Trump, in which centrist voters may be key, and in which her debate remarks could be targets of opposition advertising. \u201cFor the first time, the socialists were on their heels and the moderates were on the attack,\u201d wrote Paul Begala. \u201cIn the ABC debate, we finally had a vigorous, honest debate about Medicare for All. Gone were the disingenuous digs of prior debates (\u2018You\u2019re repeating Republican talking points!\u2019) In their place was a substantive critique about cost, choice, and banning employer-provided health care.\u201d Frida Ghitis was impressed. \u201cThe night was a win for the Democratic Party. That\u2019s because candidates repeatedly reminded viewers that despite their differences, the men and women jousting for the presidential nomination embrace views that align more closely with theirs.\u201d E.J. Dionne, writing in the Washington Post, noted, \u201cAfter spending the first half-hour of Thursday\u2019s debate tearing each other apart over health care \u2014 which happens to be their party\u2019s strongest issue \u2014 the Democratic presidential candidates realized that their opponent is President Trump and acted accordingly.\u201d But are they ready for that general election battle? There were moments for the Democrats to celebrate, wrote David Gergen. \u201cBut they are kidding themselves if they think any of the candidates is yet ready to slug it out with Trump\u2026it is still devilishly difficult to know how much their promises will cost and how they will be paid for by just taxing the rich. If they wait much longer to define their budget plans, they will find Republicans defining them for them \u2014 and it won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d SE Cupp was unequivocal about the remarks of another Texas candidate: \u201cJuli\u00e1n Castro just effectively ended his bid for President. Usually adept at navigating these debates and using his time to his advantage, tonight he looked petty, puerile and, well, like a jerk.\u201d She was referring to Castro badgering Biden during a discussion of health care (\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d) The former HUD secretary denied afterward that he was trying to make an issue of Biden\u2019s memory and age, but Cupp was among many who saw it as exactly such a play: \u201cAttacking Biden \u2013 more than once \u2013 for \u2018forgetting\u2019 what he\u2019d just said was a not subtle (and fairly dishonest) attempt at making Biden look feeble and out of it. Then, flatly declaring that, through their respective health care plans, he was carrying out Obama\u2019s legacy and Biden wasn\u2019t was an ugly, personal and unnecessary attack to make his point.\u201d Barack Obama, as it happened, fared much better in this debate than last time, when candidates questioned his policies. In fact, Biden seemed more determined than ever to cling to Obama\u2019s popularity in the party, wrote CNN commentator and former Obama strategist David Axelrod. \u201cThe former vice president might well be overdoing it \u2014 but there is a lot of upside to touting his friend, the former president\u2026He knows that he will rise or fall with the president who brought him to the dance.\u201d Obama\u2019s attorney general, Eric Holder, wrote before the debate that the work of Obama and other Democratic presidents is one \u201cin which every Democrat should take pride \u2014 and upon which our next standard-bearer must campaign, rather than attack by accepting as real Republican talking points.\u201d Many credited Biden with an improved debate performance this time, but several of the other nine contenders also got high marks. Julian Zelizer commended Elizabeth Warren for a methodical strategy that has boosted her standing: \u201cFocusing on policy, focusing on her message, focusing on her life story, focusing on issue-based statements has allowed her to run a formidable campaign.\u201d After six people died and hundreds developed illnesses attributed to vaping, President Trump proposed banning flavored e-cigarettes. \u201cIt\u2019s not a shock that a largely untested and unregulated industry based on inhaling various mysterious substances might have health consequences,\u201d wrote David Perry. \u201cStill, Trump\u2019s announcement of a total ban on flavored e-cigarettes seems a little extreme. If he suddenly wants to think of the children and save American lives, here\u2019s a better idea: enact meaningful gun regulations.\u201d For the first time last year, the number of deaths from gun violence exceeded that from auto accidents. Former assistant secretary of labor David Michaels wrote that, the country\u2019s leading e-cigarette maker \u201cJuul denies targeting teenagers, and the company\u2019s approach to gaining market share follows the now time-honored Silicon Valley startup playbook: Break the rules and ask forgiveness after you\u2019ve dominated the market. But now, after they\u2019ve been caught and are in the asking-forgiveness phase, the company is under pressure to show evidence that e-cigarettes are less harmful than the traditional type.\u201d He called for the industry to fund research, but leave the control of those experiments to scientists. The activist-actress and the conservative senator met, and agreed to disagree. But it was worthwhile anyway, wrote Alyssa Milano after her chat with Ted Cruz: \u201cHe is a real person. He isn\u2019t a villain in a movie. He cares when these shootings happen. When people on my side of this fight say he doesn\u2019t, they\u2019re wrong. I hope he came away with the fact that we are caring people, and supporters of the Second Amendment, just not unlimited gun rights.\u201d Cruz thanked Milano via Twitter for a \u201cpositive, civil &  substantive discussion.\u201d It\u2019s surprising that John Bolton lasted as long as he did in the Trump administration, wrote Julian Zelizer. But last week, he was shown the door. As Peter Bergen noted, \u201cOn so many issues \u2013 North Korea, Iran, and Venezuela \u2013 President Trump\u2019s national security adviser\u2019s bellicose views and advice repeatedly clashed with those of his mercurial boss.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi called an abrupt end to her press conference Thursday, after saying reporters were \u201chung up\u201d on the word \u201cimpeachment.\u201d This followed the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s vote that day setting the rules of its impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump. The committee said it will go beyond the bounds of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, but legal analyst Elie Honig offered a more far-reaching proposal: forget the Mueller report and concentrate on allegations that Trump has sought to enrich himself personally through the presidency. \u201cWhen I was a new Justice Department prosecutor preparing for one of my first trials, a supervisor gave me a valuable piece of strategic advice: Go for the jugular, not every capillary. Don\u2019t get bogged down trying to prove every detail of every last bad act or misdeed. Instead, pick out the subject\u2019s worst conduct, offer up your strongest proof and make it hit hard.\u201d In Honig\u2019s view, the most damning evidence the House has against Trump is the question of whether he has violated the Constitution\u2019s \u201cemoluments\u201d clause: \u201cJust in the past few weeks, we have seen Trump stumping for, and receiving, official business at his private properties. Trump openly contemplated hosting the next G7 summit at his own property in Florida.\u201d Such an investigation would be full of obstacles. Former Justice Department and Senate Judiciary Committee official Elliot Williams wrote: the Trump administration has \u201can unprecedented level of contempt for Congress and its constitutional duty to oversee the executive branch.\u201d \u201cIn a display of arrogance that would have been unheard of in any prior administration, the current administration has, on at least 30 occasions, refused or delayed turning documents over to Congress,\u201d wrote Williams. Other political takes: Jackie Bray: The National Weather Service is standing strong against politics John Avlon: 9/11 unleashed destructive forces that we are still wrestling with Jill Filipovic: Donald Trump craves Chrissy Teigen\u2019s approval Michael D\u2019Antonio: Trump was orange before light bulbs became efficient Frida Ghitis: A President who threatens national security Legal analyst Joey Jackson wrote that a judge was right to send actress Felicity Huffman to jail in the college admissions cheating scandal, but also that the short term of 14 days made complete sense: \u201cHuffman\u2019s conduct following the exposure of these crimes has exemplified grace, contrition, remorse and acceptance of responsibility. Instead of making endless excuses, trying to justify her behavior, and directing blame at others, she has owned her actions. That matters.\u201d Looking more broadly, he wrote, \u201cThis whole scandal demonstrates how people with money and privilege have nearly unlimited opportunities to perpetuate their family\u2019s high status. The rest of society has to play by the rules. Not everyone has the resources necessary to pay someone to take their children\u2019s SAT exam, or bribe a proctor to correct the test after it\u2019s taken. As such, the less privileged are forced to implore their children to work hard, get good grades, and do their best to stand out among their peers.\u201d In TIME\u2019s Ideas section, Daniel Markovits traced the factors that power inequality in schools and universities: \u201cThe elite invests unprecedented time and money in educating its children. Rich parents pay for art, music, and sports lessons, hire tutors and, critically, send their children to schools that spend many times more on educating their students than middle-class schools\u2026\u201d Opening the doors wider will take a lot of work, he notes. Sam Teicher and Joe Oliver: The spirit of the Bahamian people shines in the face of Dorian Tara Murtha: The Highwomen are revolutionizing country music Emiliana Simon-Thomas: Couple discovers that \u2018free\u2019 $120,000 from bank can\u2019t buy happiness Rebecca Wanzo: With sequel, \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 saga turns on the light Michael Bociurkiw: Hong Kong is having a leadership crisis Javed Ali and Marcella Huber: The US needs to act now against the next terrorist incubator Peggy Drexler: Bullied Florida boy\u2019s story is complicated AND: Pierce Brosnan, who played James Bond in four films, said it\u2019s about time the character of the British secret agent was re-conceived as a woman. That\u2019s the last thing we need, wrote Holly Thomas:  Sure, \u201cwomen are every bit as capable of playing seductive alcoholics with gambling issues as men are, and it would be wonderful to see how a female star made the part her own.\u201d Still, \u201cupdating Bond by way of Adam\u2019s rib-ing him into a woman distracts from the necessity of characters and franchises which belong to women from the beginning.\u201d Thomas noted that the female heroes who already exist are commercial successes: Take Gal Gadot in \u201cWonder Woman\u201d or Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh in \u201cKilling Eve.\u201d \u201cOne of the loveliest things about Gal Gadot\u2019s portrayal of Wonder Woman was that it didn\u2019t inhabit the traditional male template for a comic book hero. Rather than \u2018beat the guys at their game,\u2019 she played it on her own terms. She was tender and vulnerable, and her willingness to bring softness to the role \u2013 cooing at a baby, gasping at the flavor of ice cream \u2013 made the character multifaceted, and no less convincing a warrior.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Alice Stewart is a CNN Political Commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN. Former Vice President Joe Biden is in and the race is on for the Democratic nomination for president. Now the field of 20 candidates must strategize their way forward in the take-no-prisoners era of President Donald Trump. With the leader of the free world unconstrained by niceties, unabashed in name-calling, and unpredictable on Twitter, how do Democrats respond and avoid a repeat of 2016? We\u2019ve heard it in the hit series \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put a leash on a dog once you\u2019ve put a crown on its head.\u201d It\u2019s true \u2013 President Trump is living proof; he\u2019s already referring to Biden as \u201cSleepy Joe.\u201d Trump will engage in bare-knuckle campaigning and Democrats need to take off the gloves and be prepared for a fight. As for what Democrats should do now, some things are standard in the primary process. Having worked in communications on the presidential campaigns of the last three Republican winners of the Iowa Caucuses, I have learned a few nonpartisan rules of the road for the early primary states. Keep in mind: Free advice is generally worth the price. First \u2013 don\u2019t be fooled by the southern hospitality in South Carolina. Politics is a blood sport there, cleverly disguised by seersucker suits and \u201cbless your hearts.\u201d Second \u2013 folks in New Hampshire truly espouse their \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d motto, so avoid standing in the way of a patron and their blue plate special when campaigning at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester. Third, never, I mean never, eat a corn dog in front of the media at the Iowa State Fair. Just Google that last one \u2013 you\u2019ll understand. As for what to say, this is where Democrats seem to have different strategies. Many are focusing on support for progressive issues such as the Green New Deal, Medicare for all, and free college tuition. On one hand, highlighting the issues important to their base and showing contrast with their rivals in policy is a smart tactic in a primary. On the other hand, they also need a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in the general election, which may involve appealing more overtly to centrists. Ana Navarro: Joe Biden is normal -- and that sounds really good to me Joe Biden took a different rollout approach from other Democrats. He made his announcement about President Trump\u2019s divisive nature and framing this race as a \u201cbattle for the soul of this nation.\u201d In essence, he was leapfrogging over the primary candidates and positioning himself slap dab in the general election race. It\u2019s what you call a high risk, high reward move. As for the primary process, it\u2019s standard practice for candidates on the GOP side to vow to engage in the Reagan Rule, to \u201cnot speak ill-will of a fellow Republican.\u201d Former President Barack Obama has encouraged the current field of Democratic candidates to \u201cavoid a circular firing squad.\u201d In 2008, the late great Sen. John McCain would come in Gov. Mike Huckabee\u2019s green rooms and run through some of his debate jokes with us. Some would ding a particular challenger in a not so flattering way. Huckabee was a great barometer as to which ones to go with and which ones to cut. McCain generally took his advice. He was always funny and always respectful. In 2012, the kind-natured Sen. Rick Santorum was seen by some as a little off-putting, so he began to wear his signature sweater vests and he took on a softer-gentler tone and appearance. Sometimes it\u2019s the little things that mean a lot. Moving on to 2016, there was no Reagan Rule or even a Golden Rule for Donald Trump. He criticized every challenger from Lyin\u2019 Ted, to Little Marco, to  Low-energy Jeb, and we can\u2019t forget \u201cCrooked\u201d Hillary Clinton. My former boss, Sen. Ted Cruz, had enough of Trump criticizing his wife and let it be known, calling Trump \u201ca sniveling coward\u201d and told him to leave his wife \u201cHeidi the hell alone.\u201d Charlottesville wasn't about Robert E. Lee, Mr. President. It was about racism Fast forward to the 2020 race, President Trump has already brought out the nicknames \u2013 Elizabeth Warren as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d \u201cSleepy Joe Biden, \u201cCrazy\u201d Bernie Sanders, a \u201cstone-cold phony named Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke,\u201dand even Weirdo Tom Steyer. Stand by for more, the president is reportedly \u201cwork shopping\u201d nicknames for other 2020 candidates. The question is \u2013 do voters care? A recent Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service poll found 90% of voters expressing concern about \u201cthe uncivil and rude behavior of politicians.\u201d At the same time, just 85% of voters want political leaders to seek \u201ccompromise and common ground.\u201d Time will tell if Biden\u2019s decision to focus on President Trump and core values of the nation over core policies of the Democratic Party is a winning formula.  Even before stepping onto the track, Biden has been the Democratic frontrunner.  The Real Clear Politics (RCP) average shows him with a six-point lead over Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Given that the presidential race is based on state-by-state contests, early state polls are critical. In Iowa, where the first presidential caucus is held, RCP has Biden ahead by four points, leading Sanders, Buttigieg and Harris respectively. Things are different in the first primary state, New Hampshire, where Sanders leads by two points over Biden, Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren.  Those numbers will ebb and flow over the next nine months, leading up to the Iowa Caucus in February.  A lot can, and will, happen. If we have learned nothing else since President Trump took up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we have learned \u201cyou can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks.\u201d You can\u2019t even put a leash on it. Democrats would be wise to campaign accordingly.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Last night\u2019s marathon series of CNN town halls offered five hours of conversation with five leaders vying for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 each intensely interesting, newsworthy, and rich with policy and personal detail. Two second-timers were on view last night. Kamala Harris is the apparent pick for frontrunner among early-state party activists, per fivethiryeight. She is a woman of color whose heritage is rooted in both the African and Asian American communities, a former prosecutor and current US senator with decades of policy decisions and political choices behind her. Her town hall was a chance to clarify her prosecutorial record and convince voters to the left of her authenticity. Pete Buttigieg is the surprising upstart with the wind at his back \u2013 the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, the youngest candidate in the race, a married gay man, a military veteran, a devout Christian with Midwest origins and Harvard creds, whose momentum as a candidate was propelled in no small part by the success of his first CNN Town Hall on March 11. His town hall was an opportunity to add policy depth to his ideas, and to reassure voters he isn\u2019t a flash in the pan. But what was clear in Harris and Buttigieg\u2019s appearances, and the three others preceding them Monday night, is that everyone\u2019s goal is to stand out as the most different and compelling alternative to Donald Trump. Both Harris and Buttigieg have strong claims to the title. Dems' town hall was socialism on parade Harris is the candidate who most aligns with the base of the Democratic Party and its most conventional ways of positioning itself. She\u2019s from the biggest blue state, and was a \u201ctough on crime\u201d attorney general, but also framed herself during her town hall as enlightened and progressive when it comes to protecting people of color, the poor, the disenfranchised, the marginalized. As Harris put it, \u201cRight now, our country requires leaders and the top leader to, instead of using a microphone in a way that is about fueling the fan of hate \u2026 we need leadership that understands the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, and they\u2019ve got to stop dividing us.\u201d For his part, Buttigieg is the current Democratic hot ticket, just 37 years old with minimal electoral experience, but with a self-assurance that belies his years. He\u2019s from a deeply red Midwestern state, a person of faith who would have \u2013 as he pointed out last night \u2013 more military experience than any president in the past few generations, and is also a former management consultant. Speaking of the benefit of military service, Buttigieg lamented the lack of \u201cways to be part of that fashioning of a common character at this moment when social media and our different bubbles have us increasingly just floating in our own little parts of this country.\u201d As her town hall kicked off, Harris\u2019s first question was ripped from the headlines: Should Congress move toward impeachment? And her response was characteristically balanced. \u201cI believe Congress should take steps toward impeachment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also a realist.\u201d She cautioned that it was unlikely that the process would lead to Trump\u2019s removal, given Republican control of the Senate. Klobuchar breaks from the populist pack Harris rang a bell of ambivalence that would echo throughout the night. She sounded the refrain of \u201clet\u2019s have that conversation\u201d when asked tough questions about reparations, about giving prisoners the right to vote, and about too many issues that deserve study, but, frankly, demand her decisiveness. Realistically, politicians have to consider and debate. But rhetorically? Americans want strength, conviction and confidence \u2013 and are tired of \u201cconsider both sides\u201d as a fallback. But Harris shone when she was asked about matters relating to her personal life and experience. Asked about Medicare For All, she gave an unqualified vote of support. And the real point scored came when she then discussed her mother \u2013 \u201cfive feet tall. If you ever met her, you would have thought she was seven feet tall\u201d \u2013 a cancer researcher who herself died of cancer. Harris spoke compellingly of the heartbreak of dealing with a terminally ill loved one, of \u201canticipatory grief\u201d and the grueling and cruel way our health systems deal with patients and families alike. Harris also gave an impassioned defense of her record as a prosecutor supporting tough enforcement of anti-truancy laws. \u201cI took a look at who the homicide victims were who were under the age of 25,\u201d she said, and learned that \u201c94% of them were high school dropouts,\u201d she said. \u201cI said what we have got to do is pay attention to the fact that these children aren\u2019t in school and put all the resources necessary to get them in school and give their parents the resources, hold the school districts accountable\u2026\u201d She added: \u201cAs a result of our initiative, first of all, nobody went to jail \u2026 we improved attendance by over 30%.\u201d Elizabeth Warren is the star who may eclipse Bernie Sanders Her record generated the biggest applause when she talked about refusing to defend the anti-gay-marriage act, Proposition 8, saying it was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court agreed, \u201cand the wedding bells rang across the country. I\u2019m very proud of that. \u2026 I was marrying same-sex couples at San Francisco City Hall.\u201d Buttigieg also brought focus to controversial policy decisions of the past: his most provocative actions as mayor of South Bend included a campaign to raze abandoned properties in poor neighborhoods to raise property values and reduce crime. While some have criticized the initiative as disproportionately impacting minority property owners, Buttigieg countered that it was people in those neighborhoods who were asking for action. \u201cI just thought these neighborhoods are never going to be as safe as we want them to be unless we do something and act fast,\u201d he said, pointing to how the program also invested in the community and increased funds for law enforcement. \u201cThe number-one complaint that we heard, especially from low- income and minority homeowners in the neighborhoods that we addressed, was what took you so long?\u2019\u201d Law enforcement was the subject of another key question on Buttigieg\u2019s record: His decision to demote South Bend\u2019s first black police chief after it was found out that he\u2019d secretly recorded some of his officers to determine if racially biased language was being used by white cops in his department. Buttigieg professed ignorance of the details of the taping while also acknowledging that \u201cone of the things I realized was that while I was absorbed in just making sure that we weren\u2019t tripping on any landmines related to laws about what you can and can\u2019t record, I was, frankly, a little bit slow to understand just how much anguish underlay the community\u2019s response to this.\u201d But elsewhere, Buttigieg spoke with remarkable clarity and energetic purpose. He said the political and economic system \u201cneeds to be changed profoundly\u201d and that \u201cwhat\u2019s at stake right now is how to win not just an election, but an era.\u201d He clearly stated that Trump \u201cdeserves impeachment, but I\u2019m also going to leave it to the House and Senate to figure that out, because my role in the process is trying to relegate Trumpism to the dust bin of history \u2026 especially to get Republicans to abandon this kind of deal with the devil they made.\u201d He said that candidates talking too much about Trump led many Americans to feel like they were talking too little about them.  It was clear that while Harris grew stronger as her time went on, Buttigieg was in his element from the outset, with the town hall format playing to his strengths as a counterpuncher and policy-immersed wonk \u2013 one with a former McKinsey consultant\u2019s instinct for reframing negatives as positives, and an ear for the applause line. Late in his session, when Anderson Cooper brought up a recent gibe at Buttigieg\u2019s expense made by Richard Grenell, ambassador to Germany and the most prominent gay appointee in Trump\u2019s administration, the mayor promptly responded, \u201cI\u2019m not a master fisherman, but I know bait when I see it, and I\u2019m not going to take it.\u201d The exchange was a reminder of something critical and incredible about both town halls: With Don Lemon as moderator of Harris\u2019s session and Anderson Cooper as moderator of Buttigieg\u2019s, we have arrived at a moment in history when the mainstream media and political stage can be occupied by two black people and two out gay people, in conversation with one another about the critical matters that are shaping the future for all of us. And in that regard, the town halls have made us all winners.",

Nicole Mason, a visiting scholar at the Center for Public & Nonprofit Leadership and a professorial lecturer at Georgetown University, is the author of \u201cBorn Bright: A Young Girl\u2019s Journey From Nothing to Something in America.\u201d She has written extensively on community development, poverty and economic security. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. Earlier this month, I interviewed Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, about her upbringing, work and the future of the Democratic Party. In the interview, Tanden spoke candidly about the need to unify the party and focus on bread and butter issues that Americans care about\u2013 like health care and the economy\u2013instead of perpetuating the toxic divisiveness that has characterized much of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. This is how we can win, she said. Last week, the Bernie Sanders campaign sent a letter to the Center for American Progress, criticizing the organization. The letter also accuses  Tanden of \u201ccall[ing] for unity while simultaneously maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas.\u201d The New York Times added fuel to the fire this week when it highlighted the friction between Sanders and Tanden in an article that painted her as an overly ambitious Clinton loyalist with a personal axe to grind.  The Times interviewed Tanden\u2019s mother, Maya Tanden, who  said her daughter \u201ccan be very aggressive.\u201d She added: \u201cShe\u2019s not going to let anyone rule over her and she has loyalty to Hillary because Hillary is the one who made her.\u201d She also intimated that Neera Tanden had a score to settle with Sanders and his supporters from the 2016 Democratic primary. Maya Tanden later released a statement through her family members saying that she \u201cdidn\u2019t understand my words would be used in the story.\u201d She went on to express pride in her daughter\u2019s success and credited her for \u201cmaking life better for so many people.\u201d Despite the clarification, however, the damage had already been done. Bernie Sanders' campaign escalates feud with top liberal think tank Tanden has been publicly chastised for her ambition and political shrewdness in a way that likely no man in her position ever would. It is dangerous to attempt to discredit or penalize women like Tanden for having a clear point of view for which they are willing to fight \u2013 and for using the skills, networks and access they have accumulated over years towards this end. California Sen. Kamala Harris faced similar criticisms. When she announced her candidacy for president, some portrayed her as an overzealous political climber willing to do whatever it takes to win. Lately, it seems like women candidates and political operatives have had a hard time breaking free of gendered stereotypes about how women should be or act. Tough women, like Tanden, are no exception. Tanden wants to win. When I sat down with her for a one-on-one interview for the radio show Making Space, it became clear that she is an ideologue and party loyalist, almost to a fault. She has a clear allegiance to the Democratic Party and believes it has the right policies and values to move the country forward. Bernie Sanders pushes back at critics of his new wealth: 'I didn't know it was a crime to write a good book' In 2008, when it became evident that Hillary Clinton was going to lose the party nomination to Barack Obama, Tanden went to work for him as policy director, a position she had held in the Clinton campaign. Given the bitter primary, many thought it was an odd move, but to Tanden, it wasn\u2019t about the person but about the larger cause. Tanden\u2019s dogged loyalty to her party is no different from Mitch McConnell\u2019s loyalty to his. They  want to win. The question becomes at what cost? The 2020 election is high stakes for Democrats and Republicans alike. It will be a contest of ideas and strategy, with a very slim margin for error. For Democratic elites and insiders who are tethered to a well-worn centrist playbook, the ideas and policies proposed by party newcomers, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York, might seem destabilizing or risky in such a pivotal election cycle. However, voter enthusiasm and the conversations sparked by the Green New Deal or Medicare for All cannot be ignored. Neither can the throngs of Sanders supporters and others who are pushing the party left.  The challenge for Democrats will be to craft an agenda that reflects the real needs of people and families, and to support the candidate that best personifies these ideas and ideals. Tanden, and her unwavering commitment to building a more equitable and inclusive democracy with sound policies that make the lives of Americans better, is exactly what the party needs. We should all embrace her, not push her away during this critical political and social moment.",

If Donald Trump\u2019s administration has its way, millions of Americans will lose their health insurance, and the entire health care industry will be upended. Make America Great Again? This administration wants to make us sick again \u2013 and it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that if they succeed, a great many Americans will go bankrupt; some will die. Ever since taking office, President Trump has made it a priority to attack his predecessor\u2019s legacy. Trump appears to hate former President Barack Obama with a vigor perhaps matched only by his loathing of Hillary Clinton, the woman who beat him out in the popular vote. Like a petulant and implacable child still stewing over a toy he was forced to share, Trump has put all reason aside. He\u2019s not interested in improving lives or making this country better. He seeks only to destroy. The sole thing he cares to build is his own ego. Thanks to a far-right judge in Texas who invalidated the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2013 the part of the law that requires most Americans to buy health insurance, keeping costs down for everyone and insuring better health outcomes \u2013 the Trump Department of Justice is emboldened, and is now asking the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to wipe out the entire law. That would mean that the millions of people who rely on the ACA for their insurance, including lower-income people benefiting from state Medicaid expansions, would be up a creek. It would also mean that the ACA\u2019s protections for everyone, including those Americans who still rely on private or employer-based insurance \u2013 protections like the bar on considering preexisting conditions and free contraception and many other preventive care services \u2013 would cease to exist. Pelosi: GOP says one thing and does another on healthcare And what plan does the Trump administration have ready to replace the ACA \u2013 and insure millions \u2013 the day after they lose their health care coverage? There is none. Nada. Calling the Trump administration\u2019s position \u201ccrazy,\u201d Timothy S. Jost, an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law, told the Washington Post that this \u201cwould be like invalidating the Interstate Highway System, causing chaos on an unimaginable scale. It\u2019s conceivable that the entire Medicare payment system would collapse.\u201d Does Trump care that he is asking a court to throw the country into chaos and set us back? Does Attorney General William Barr, who pledged to uphold the laws of the land but is instead acting as a lapdog to the president? No. These men are agents of annihilation. Trump\u2019s famous campaign promise tag line was all about moving America backward, and undoing any progress we made. It was also a dog whistle to his white male base \u2013 after all, he\u2019s suggesting that America was greatest at a time when African-Americans and women had fewer legal rights, and white men dominated the public sphere. This attempt to kill the ACA is exactly on brand: regress, contract, devastate. Democrats, on the other hand, want to maintain and expand the ACA, to make sure that more Americans can have high-quality affordable health care. Some Democrats, like presidential contender Elizabeth Warren, support the Medicare for All bill proposed by Bernie Sanders, an independent senator also running for president as a Democrat. Sanders wants the Medicare plan immediately, while Warren says she wants to take some time figure out the most effective way to get to universal coverage. But that\u2019s the key: They are building, moving forward, expanding. This invisible line divides the health care debate This presents a stark choice, and illustrates the fundamental difference between today\u2019s GOP and the ascendant Democrats. Do we want bigger, better, kinder, more? Or smaller, worse, meaner and less? Republicans aren\u2019t even pretending to offer an alternative. They have no vision or plan, only a desire to harm their own countrymen because they see Democrats as avowed enemies instead of fellow public servants with a different worldview. They\u2019re only interested in breaking what their despised opponents built. The next presidential election is still more than a year away, and Democrats don\u2019t yet know who they will run against President Trump. But remember this moment: It tells you everything you need to know.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. On the same day a new CNN poll showed Iowa Democratic voters interested in older, well-established politicians with familiar names, a trio of young, lesser-known candidates made their case at a televised town hall at the SXSW festival in Austin. Longshots John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg each tried to display allegiance to some of the most unorthodox positions floating around the Democratic campaign \u2013 but all three took pains to avoid going too far off the deep end. Like all Democratic candidates, the SXSW town hall participants faced the challenge of presenting themselves as stable and experienced \u2013 while also seeming prepared to fight for the sweeping changes in economic, social and foreign policy that the party\u2019s liberal base is demanding. The town halls showed the kind of tightrope Democrats must walk on the road to 2020. Of the three town hall participants, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, seemed to connect best with the crowd. No less an authority than David Axelrod, the manager of President Obama\u2019s historic 2008 campaign, said on Twitter that \u201cI have rarely seen a candidate make better use of televised Town Hall than @PeteButtigieg\u2026. Crisp, thoughtful and relatable. He\u2019ll be a little less of a long shot tomorrow.\u201d While Buttigieg did connect with the crowd, he, too, turns out to be carrying some radical baggage. The mayor has called for possibly expanding the size of the Supreme Court from 9 members to 15 \u2013 a reworking of the judicial branch last attempted seriously by President Franklin Roosevelt (who dropped the idea amid a general political uproar caused by his so-called court-packing scheme). \u201cWhat we need to do is stop every [Supreme Court] vacancy from being this apocalyptic ideological battle,\u201d Buttigieg said, calling the court expansion idea no less radical than the \u201cshattering of norms\u201d by Republicans who refused even to consider Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland. Pete Buttigieg: 2020 election is not just about defeating Trump Buttigieg champions another unorthodox idea \u2013 a guaranteed income for all Americans \u2013 that is sure to draw accusations of government interference in the free market. The mayor didn\u2019t give a lot of specifics about how a guaranteed income would work, other than to point out that certain kinds of labor, like caring for an elderly relative, need to be compensated. And interestingly, Buttigieg doesn\u2019t favor trying to impeach President Donald Trump. \u201cThe best way to defeat and end this is through an election,\u201d he said, unless Congress discovers wrongdoing so terrible that impeachment is required. Turning to the other candidates, John Delaney, former corporate CEO and ex-congressman from Maryland, who declared his candidacy back in 2017, has racked up more than 20 visits to Iowa, apparently following the formula that worked for longshot Jimmy Carter back in 1976.  Along the way, he apparently has heard the core demand of Democratic voters for reform of America\u2019s overpriced, underperforming health care system. So Delaney has signed on to a version of Medicare for All, under which every American would have a guaranteed right to quality medical care. Some would call the concept socialist, but Delaney (who shuns the term) told the town hall that \u201chaving a government-only solution to health care is not the right answer.\u201d Delaney: Mistake to embrace socialism in its pure form Delaney\u2019s alternative? Expand Medicare and Medicaid into a single, cradle-to-grave entitlement. He told the town hall: \u201cYou get it as a right of citizenship but if you don\u2019t want it, you can opt out. Get a small tax credit. Or you can buy a supplemental system. And it\u2019s fully paid for by eliminating the corporate deductibility of health care.\u201d Delaney is attempting a neat trick: creating an all-but-universal, government-run health care system that retains enough opt-outs and market mechanisms that he can sell to the public as something other than socialism. The town hall audience seemed to accept Delaney\u2019s promise. We\u2019ll see if Democratic voters do the same. Tulsi Gabbard, on the other hand, dealt with the socialism question by ducking it altogether. When moderator Dana Bash asked the congresswoman from Hawaii, point-blank, if she identifies as capitalist or socialist, the response was a meandering non-answer. \u201cSo many of these labels are misused, misunderstood,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m an independent-minded person, I\u2019m a Democrat and my sole focus and purpose is to figure out how we can best serve the people of this country.\u201d That won\u2019t cut it on the campaign trail. Not with Republicans itching to turn the 2020 election into a referendum on socialism. Gabbard: My past Assad comments were misunderstood Gabbard, a war veteran, used much of the town hall to explain her controversial call to withdraw American troops from several thorny overseas entanglements. She specifically condemned the idea of using American power to corral or remove dictatorships in Syria, Venezuela and Iran. \u201cI will end these regime-change wars,\u201d she said at the town hall. \u201cI will work to end this new Cold War and this nuclear arms race that is costing us trillions, and again take those resources \u2026 and use them to serve the needs of people here.\u201d That position, which sounds reasonable at first blush, represents a break from decades of American policy. It\u2019s unclear, for instance, how Gabbard would simply end the new cold war against Russia, given its efforts to undermine US elections. Would a President Gabbard talk Vladimir Putin out of trying to destabilize our democracy? It also seems unlikely that Gabbard, if elected, could ignore or downplay the Iranian regime\u2019s exporting of terrorism and its threats to displace or attack Saudi Arabia and Israel, two key American allies. Her curiously soft-on-dictators position extended to Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian strongman who Gabbard once met with \u2013 and, who, according to the UN and international inspectors, has used poison gas on his own people. Asked at the town hall if she considers Assad a war criminal, Gabbard said: \u201cI think that the evidence needs to be gathered and, as I have said before, if there is evidence that he has committed war crimes, he shall be prosecuted as such.\u201d  It\u2019s understood, and understandable, that many Democratic activists want to see candidates walk back from endless wars and the reckless commitment of troops overseas. But Gabbard\u2019s refusal to call out Putin and Assad was a costly mistake. It seems unlikely that Democrats will select any of these three town hall candidates as the champion best suited to take on Trump. But they offer a glimpse of the problematic policies that the party\u2019s base want candidates to take on \u2013 and a foreshadowing of the ferocious battles we\u2019re likely to see in the coming months.",

View more opinion at CNN. Sen. Bernie Sanders launched his second presidential bid on Tuesday and turned heads by raising $5.9 million right out of the gate. Within 24 hours of his announcement, more than 223,000 people had donated to the campaign. The numbers easily outpaced his rivals. Sen. Kamala Harris, for instance, raised $1.5 million in 24 hours, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar received $1 million in donations in the first 48 hours of her campaign launch. With numbers like these, Sanders has \u2013 for the second time in four years \u2013 taken Democrats by surprise. The Brooklyn native has been repeatedly dismissed as a far-out senior and socialist who represents the \u201cBen and Jerry\u201d electorate of Vermont. \u201cThere\u2019s enough ageism, religious bigotry and reflexive horror at the idea of socialism among the broad electorate,\u201d wrote columnist Eric Zorn in the Chicago Tribune in 2016, \u201cthat, if he wins the nomination, Sanders would probably lose every state\u2014even his home state of Vermont.\u201d Despite the skeptics, Sanders has demonstrated yet again that he has the ability to draw the kind of passionate and loyal support that Democrats will need going into 2020. Defeating Amy Klobuchar could give progressive Democrats a chance for real change Other Democrats who are in the campaign mix are moving quickly to quash his candidacy. Harris, one of the most promising challengers to emerge so far, rejected the label commonly associated with Sanders and told voters in New Hampshire earlier this week, \u201cI am not a democratic socialist.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is still considering a campaign, told reporters that the country can\u2019t meet \u201cfundamental challenges\u201d without \u201charnessing the power of the market.\u201d These and other remarks have all been interpreted as a slam against Sanders. Although many Democratic candidates appear focused on beating Sanders, they should take a pause from the horse race to look at both his years in the Senate and the elements of his 2016 campaign that seem to give him such strong appeal. Given that President Donald Trump attracts resolute devotion from many of his supporters, Democrats should learn from some aspects of Sanders\u2019 example and use them to galvanize a strong base. Here are key elements from Sanders\u2019 approach to politics that could benefit the other candidates. Sanders understood from the start of his 2016 presidential campaign that his mission was to build a movement, not just run for office. He always framed his candidacy in terms of bringing together voters who were frustrated with the status quo and wanted to fight for a different vision of American society. In doing so, he tapped into the spirit of the 1960s activism that rocked American politics. Despite having what some critics say is a larger-than-life ego, Sanders offered a candidacy that made his followers feel as if they were fighting for something bigger than themselves. The movement was essential to sustaining his campaign against Hillary Clinton through an improbable primary and caucus run. And it didn\u2019t stop after Sanders lost. He has continued to work with candidates running for Congress and has used his public platform to keep selling his message. Many of his key ideas have since been embraced throughout the Democratic Party, and the payoff was evident from a new crop of legislators elected in the 2018 midterms. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for one, does not shy away from progressive visions. Say what you will about his socialism or his sometimes-abrasive personality, but Sanders is a politician who believes in putting forward big ideas. The senator is not cut from the Bill Clinton model of politics, where the goal is to aim toward the pragmatic center and position one\u2019s ideas in such a way that they are difficult to attack as leftist. The right is slamming the Green New Deal, and Democrats need to react fast In contrast to a political orthodoxy in Washington which almost always pushes candidates in that centrist direction, Sanders simply refuses to twist himself into knots. He likes to give the electorate big policies to chew on. In 2016, he focused on Medicare-for-all, a higher minimum wage, free college tuition, campaign finance reform, and ending growing economic inequality. Although it was easy to mock the repetitious and unpolished style of his campaign rhetoric, it gave voters a menu of ideas that very much defined what his movement was about. Many voters were glad to hear from a candidate who aimed for the moon and believed that the goal of a political campaign was to offer inspiration and aspiration rather than a set of finely tuned positions that had been watered down after several rounds of focus-group tests. Sanders, who ostensibly understood that he didn\u2019t look the role of a president with his disheveled professorial appearance, decided that he wasn\u2019t going to change much. He would give voters Bernie Sanders and hope that they liked what they saw. He didn\u2019t embellish his speeches with bombast and he walked onto the stage and into the television studio dressed as he would on any other day in his office. There was a logic to what he did and it explains some of the constituents\u2019 passion for Bernie. Voters are sophisticated enough to see through staged events and scripted talking points, and they like to see a real person asking for their vote. On the campaign stage, Sanders acted exactly as he has done throughout his career. He is the grumpy and certain leftie who has a real point of view about how the world works and is insistent on telling everyone what he thinks. He knows what he likes and knows what he hates and refuses to stay quiet about those opinions. From his entrance into presidential politics, he has insisted on being exactly who he is and letting the voters decide what they think rather than molding himself to appeal to their whims. Sanders doesn\u2019t back away from a tough fight. It took a certain amount of chutzpah for him to even run for president in 2016. It was crazy to think that he could take on Clinton or that he could actually put together a legitimate campaign. But he did. Why Joe Biden shouldn't run for president And Sanders did not hesitate to play tough. He is a progressive who knows how to throw a political punch. Sanders mounted an incredibly aggressive campaign in 2016, ignoring the party leaders who asked him to stop his primary campaign to directly confront Clinton on some of her biggest vulnerabilities, from high-paying speeches to corporate donations to her campaign. Since losing the Democratic nomination, Sanders has continued to fight back against President Trump. After Sanders threw his hat in the 2020 ring, Trump tweeted, \u201cCrazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!\u201d Sanders fired back and wrote, \u201cWhat\u2019s crazy is that we have a president who is racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and a fraud.\u201d That is the kind of blunt talk Democrats will need to employ in the ugly general election campaign that is sure to come. It\u2019s also important to note that Sanders has on both occasions refused to run for President as a third-party candidate. In doing so, Sanders has demonstrated that he knows what he is fighting for and can see the clear differences between Republican and Democratic policies. Though he certainly made things more difficult for Clinton in 2016, he conducted his fight in the legitimate arena of the primaries rather than risking a Republican victory in the general election by peeling away left-leaning Democratic votes. While Sanders is certainly a formidable candidate, there are plenty of reasons why many Democrats don\u2019t like him. He is not registered as a Democrat. He leans too far to the left for some in the party. He is often vague on the details. His ego seems way too large. He lost in the 2016 primaries so there is no reason to believe he can do better this time.  Female staffers have spoken out about allegations of sexual harassment, disparities in pay, and an uncomfortable professional environment while working for his 2016 campaign. His candidacy also seems like a throwback to the past at a time when a record number of women are running for the presidential nomination; his entrance in the race this time around will also likely steal away support from Sen. Elizabeth Warren in particular, who could be a much stronger general election candidate against Trump.  All of these criticisms are valid and present issues to be vetted. But Democrats need to stop living in the past and start using a different playbook to take on the future. Sanders\u2019 approach, disconnected from the candidate himself, offers 2020 Democratic hopefuls some useful lessons about how they can put together a campaign that energizes, inspires and mobilizes voters to give their party the best chance of winning the White House.",

On Saturday, Twitter was abuzz with the news that Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator, might be \u201cimminently,\u201d as Yahoo News reported, jumping into the 2020 race for president. But it was readily apparent from the trending hashtag #NeverBernie that Sanders\u2019 entrance into the 2020 race would be far different and likely even more challenging than 2016. When Sanders announced in May 2015 his run for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, he was only viewed unfavorably by 12% of those polled by Gallup. His unfavorable rating, however, in that same poll in late 2018 is closer to 40%. And more than that \u2013 and this truly surprised me \u2013 was the level of opposition and even anger directed at Sanders by some of my fellow progressives on Twitter on Saturday. No, Kamala Harris is not a 'female Barack Obama' In 2016, I supported Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary. After Hillary Clinton became the nominee, however, I became a surrogate for the Clinton campaign, speaking on her behalf to the Arab and Muslim American community since I\u2019m a member of both. So when I speak of the reaction to Sanders\u2019 possible run in 2020, I do this as someone who supported him in the past for championing issues that leading Democrats were not discussing at the time \u2013 from railing against the \u201cbillionaire class\u201d \u2013 which he declared \u201ccontrols the political life of our country\u201d \u2013 to speaking of Palestinians as human beings who not only deserve their own state but should also be treated with \u201crespect and dignity.\u201d Sanders\u2019 greatest impact, though, is likely on the issue of a single-payer health-care system which he dubbed \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d During the 2016 campaign, Clinton rejected the proposal, even running an ad slamming it where she declared: \u201cThe American people can\u2019t afford to wait for ideas that sound good on paper but will never make it in the real world.\u201d Flash forward and a 2018 Reuters poll found that not only do 85% of Democrats support \u201cMedicare for All\u201d but many of the leading Democratic presidential candidates have embraced it, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand. The biggest mistake Democrats could make right now Despite that, as I learned first-hand Saturday, there are many Democrats \u2013 even past supporters \u2013 who either are looking for a new candidate in 2020 or passionately oppose him. There were several distinct themes that emerged among the countless people who were tweeting in connection with the #NeverBernie hashtag. The first thing that I noticed was anger over the possibility that Sanders could consider running as a Democrat again. Countless people raised the point \u2013 which is certainly valid \u2013 that Sanders had long identified as an Independent and only became a Democrat to be able to run in the 2016 Democratic primary contests. Then in 2017, Sanders declared that he was running for re-election to the US Senate as an Independent, rebuffing efforts from Democratic Party leaders to formally join the Democratic Party. Trump's nightmare: A Latino taking his job That was the main source of contention among self-identified progressives, but close behind was the belief that Sanders had cost Clinton the election in 2016. While others made it clear they held no personal animus towards Sanders, they expressed fears that if Sanders ran it would reopen the wounds of the Hillary-Bernie fight we saw in 2016. As these people noted, in order to defeat Trump in 2020, progressives must be united. And they were concerned that a Sanders\u2019 candidacy could undermine that. What was also unexpected were the number of people on Twitter \u2013 some I have interacted with or known for years \u2013 who said that they had supported Sanders in 2016 but simply wanted someone younger in 2020. One friend, who was truly a big Sanders supporter in 2016, tweeted that if Sanders, who is now 77, is elected he will be the oldest president ever elected and for this reason he preferred a younger candidate. Kamala Harris is making history in the 2020 race There were several other themes raised by those who opposed Sanders such as the way he dragged his feet to release his tax returns in 2016 and the fact that he opposed sanctions against Russia in a 2017 Senate vote. In a statement, Sanders said that he supports sanctions on Russia for interfering in our 2016 election but voted against that sanctions bill because he had concerns it would undermine the Iran nuclear deal since the bill had proposed sanctions against both Iran and Russia. Another issue that clearly upset many progressives were the actions of the so called \u201cBernie Bros,\u201d purported Sanders supporters, who had reportedly engaged in harassment of Clinton supporters and reporters during the 2016 campaign. Some of these \u201cBros\u201d spewed hateful and often sexist comments. While Sanders did denounce the Bernie Bros tactics as \u201cdisgusting\u201d in 2016, for many those words weren\u2019t enough. Obviously, there are countless people who still passionately support Sanders today. Indeed, a December CNN poll of Iowa Democrats found Sanders in second place behind Joe Biden.  And if Sanders runs in 2020, he could very well win the nomination.  The stark reality is that in 2020 \u2013 as opposed to 2016 - -the field is not just Sanders versus Clinton. Currently, there are eight confirmed candidates, but the number could go up to 14 candidates or higher, many of whom will be espousing positions just as progressive as Sanders. And, clearly, if Sanders enters the 2020 race he will have some built-in opposition that he didn\u2019t have when he first ran in 2016. But win or lose, Sanders\u2019 legacy will be that he played a major role in moving the Democratic Party to the left, especially on health care, which may just help the ultimate Democratic presidential nominee win the White House in 2020.",
